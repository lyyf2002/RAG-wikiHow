, Apply the ointment two to three times each day in addition to using Vaseline, Aquaphor, or a lip balm. You could also use a low-potency corticosteroid ointment if you obtain a prescription from your dermatologist.Using corticosteroid treatments for more than a few days could lead to thinning of the skin on your lips or the enlargement of blood vessels in the area you applied the ointment.

Chickenpox: A viral infection that many people get at some point during their lives that produces extremely itchy blisters all over the body.
Hives: An outbreak of swollen, itchy, pale red bumps that appear suddenly on the body in response to an allergic reaction, extreme stress, or some other reason.

, The bodily changes that accompany different types of internal diseases can also cause severe cases of itching. The internal diseases most likely to contribute to itchiness are:


Liver disease
Kidney disease
Thyroid disorders
Cancer

, Many types of allergic reactions can cause extreme cases of itching. These include poor reactions to:


Drugs or medications you’ve never taken before
Noxious chemicals or substances
Certain types of food

Stop scratching.,
Wash affected skin.,
Take care of your skin.,
Wear loose, comfortable, and clean clothing.,
Avoid allergens.,
Reduce stress.",How to Stop Severe Itching3," When you experience an itch, your natural reaction is usually to scratch it. This, however, often further irritates the skin and can make the itch even worse. Break the itching cycle by resisting the urge to scratch.

, Washing your skin with an antiseptic solution or soap can help remove anything that might be irritating your skin, soothe areas that already itch, and limit the chances that itchiness will spread to other parts of your body.

, Using skin-friendly antiperspirant, antifungal powders, and anti-itch creams or lotions can help keep your skin from becoming either too dry or too moist, both of which can lead to irritation and itchiness.

, Loose, smoothly textured clothing—especially clothes made from cotton—can help you avoid further irritation by minimizing the amount of friction on your skin. Wearing clean clothes can also help keep your skin from coming into contact with itch-inducing irritants or germs.

, Some of the most common allergens associated with itchy skin that would be good to avoid are:


Nickel or nickel alloys commonly found in jewelry
Harsh soaps and scented detergents, including some laundry detergents
Strong perfumes or fragrances
Cosmetics such as shampoo, nail polish, or sunscreen that contain harsh chemicals

Rub aloe vera gel on your skin.,
Use peppermint, thyme, or basil leaves.,
Make a paste out of juniper berries and cloves.",How to Stop Severe Itching4," Topical creams and lotions that contain camphor, menthol, phenol, pramoxine, and benzocaine—all of which numb nerve endings to reduce the sensation of itchiness and the likelihood of scratching at irritated skin—can be applied directly to itchy skin.

, Covering itchy skin in cool, wet bandages, dressings, and towels can help protect your skin from further irritation and provide temporary relief from the discomfort of itching.

, Baking soda is a natural acid neutralizer that reduces itchiness by restoring your skin’s natural pH balance. Add 1 part water to 3 parts baking soda to make a soothing paste that you can apply directly to itchy skin.

, While hot water can actually dry out your skin, potentially making it even itchier, lukewarm or cool water can help relieve itching. When taking cool baths here are some things to keep in mind:


Avoid perfumed bath oils, powders, or bubbles since they can alter the pH levels of your skin and possibly become irritating.
As with a baking soda paste, adding 1 cup of baking soda to a bathtub full of water can provide relief to itchy skin by balancing the skin’s pH levels.
You can add 1 to 2 cups of finely ground oatmeal, also called colloidal oatmeal, to your bath to treat irritated and itchy skin. Oatmeal reduces itchiness by balancing out your skin’s pH levels, drawing heat away from the top layer of skin, and sealing in the skin’s natural oils. Be sure the oatmeal is finely ground and that the water isn’t too hot, otherwise the oatmeal will thicken and be difficult to clean from the tub.

, Lemons contain natural substances that can numb sensations and reduce inflammation. Simply cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice directly onto your itchy skin.

, Due to its natural antiseptic and antifungal properties, apple cider vinegar can be a good remedy for itchiness. Dip a cotton ball or piece of cloth into the vinegar and gently dab it onto the itchy skin.

, Aloe vera has natural anti-itch and cooling properties. Rubbing the gel produced by this plant directly onto itchy skin and letting it dry is a good way to reduce itchiness. You can get aloe vera one of two ways:


Snip a leaf from a live aloe vera plant, cut it lengthwise, and scoop out the gel that’s inside.
Buy bottled aloe vera at a store.

, These herbs all contain eugenol, which is a naturally occurring anesthetic with soothing and numbing effects. Leaves from these plants can be used in two main ways:


Crush the leaves and rub them directly onto the itchy skin.
Add ½ ounce of dried leaves to 1 pint of boiling water to make a tea. When the tea has cooled down a bit, you can pour it directly over the itchy skin or use it to soak bandages or towels for use as a compress.

, Juniper berries and cloves both have natural anti-inflammatory properties that can help relieve severe itching. To make a juniper berry paste:


Melt together 3 ounces of butter and 2 ounces of beeswax.
Grind 4 tablespoons of juniper berries and 3 teaspoons of whole cloves in a coffee grinder, and stir them into the melted mixture.
When the paste is cool, apply it directly to itchy skin.

, In many cases, additional diagnostic work may become necessary. Here are some of the most common tests your doctor may ask for:


Blood test. Drawing blood with a small needle and analyzing its components in a laboratory can help doctors identify the internal conditions that could be contributing to the itchiness.
Imaging tests. X-Rays, MRIs, or CT scans may help doctors find the internal conditions at the root of your itchiness.
Chemistry screen. This type of blood test can help determine if liver or kidney disorders are contributing to the itch.
Thyroid function test. A specific type of blood test, a thyroid function test examines whether a thyroid abnormality might be causing the itchiness.
Skin biopsy. By removing and testing a section of affected skin, doctors can better determine what types of specific skin conditions are contributing to the itch.

Use corticosteroid creams.,
Take oral antihistamines.,
Use topical anesthetics.,
Take antidepressants.,
Apply topical calcineurin inhibitors.,
Receive light therapy.,
Use antifungal agents.",How to Stop Severe Itching6," Corticosteroid creams block certain inflammatory and itch-inducing chemicals in the immune system, and can be applied directly to itchy skin.

, Antihistamines are primarily used when itchiness is a result of an allergic reaction. They work by blocking the body’s production of histamines, which are involved in the inflammatory response system.

, Applied directly to itchy skin, topical anesthetics contain ingredients that numb nerve endings, thereby decreasing the sensation of itchiness.

, If you and your doctor determine that your itch is caused by an underlying psychological, emotional, or stress condition, you may be given Prozac or Zoloft, both of which have proven anti-itch properties.

, Your doctor may suggest using a topical calcineurin inhibitor, which reduces itchiness by blocking your body’s inflammatory response system.

, In some cases, your doctor may recommend light therapy, also known as phototherapy. This type of treatment exposes skin to various wavelengths of light in order to block the immune system functions that contribute to inflammation and itching.

, If your itchiness is the result of a fungal infection such as ringworm or athlete’s foot, your doctor may prescribe an antifungal agent. These can be applied topically or taken orally.

Stop the bleeding.,
Get immediate medical care for a serious wound.,
Clean the wound.,
Keep the wound clean and disinfected.,
Get a tetanus shot.,
Keep stitches clean.,
Use acetaminophen or Ibuprofen for pain relief.,
Take a shower carefully.,
Know that you may be pale after the injury for a couple of days.,
Keep food and debris out of the laceration.,
Look for the signs of an infection.,
Watch for the signs of a concussion.,
Inspect the injury for proper healing.,
Contact your child's doctor if you suspect the laceration has become infected.",How to Take Care of a Facial Laceration," This is your first priority. If you have a facial laceration that is bleeding a lot, you need to get the bleeding under control. Place pressure on the wound, so that the blood will gradually clot and stop flowing.If you are using a bandage or piece of cloth to stop the bleeding, don't take it off to replace it with another piece once it is filled with blood. Instead, simply place another piece of bandage or cloth over the original piece and continue pressure. This will better allow clotting to take place on the surface of the wound.;
, If you have a large laceration that is bleeding excessively, you need to get medical care. A doctor or medical professional will be better able to assess the injury, stop bleeding, and treat the laceration.Sometimes a cut is so serious or deep that it won't stop bleeding even when pressure is applied. With injuries such as this, a doctor may need to apply stitches.
If the laceration is near your eyes, or if it is impacting your ability to speak or breathe, then you should call 911 immediately.
Do not drive yourself if you are injured, as this could put others at risk, so call emergency services or find someone to take you to a doctor.

, If bleeding has stopped and you are sure that immediate medical care is not necessary, start cleaning the wound. Depending on what caused the laceration, your wound may be relatively clean to very dirty. Take a mild soap and warm water and gently clean the wound until you cannot see any dirt or debris and the soap is rinsed away.


You do not want to press on a wound that bleeds easily or that did not clot easily. Instead, take it slowly and gently so that the wound doesn't start bleeding uncontrollably again, and put no pressure on the wound.

, You will just need to keep the area clean, apply a first-aid ointment or antibiotic, and change bandages regularly. This is all in an attempt to keep the area infection free.


If your injury is so minor that you don't go to the doctor, simply continue with basic first aid for a cut. Keep the area clean and avoid irritating it if at all possible.

, If you have a facial laceration, it may be necessary for you to get a tetanus shot. If the wound is dirty and you have not had a tetanus shot in the past five years, you will likely need a booster. If you have not had a tetanus shot in 10 years, you should get one from your doctor, even if the wound appears clean., If your cut has been stitched up by a doctor, you will need to keep them clean in order to avoid infection. Follow your doctor's advice about aftercare, including washing and cleaning the area and replacing bandages.You will want to clean the wound area daily; however, avoid submerging the stitched area in water until the cut has healed.
Instead of stitches, your doctor may apply Steri-Strips to more minor cuts. These are adhesive strips that serve the same function as stitches but don't require the pain of stitches., Most lacerations do not require anything stronger than an over-the-counter painkiller. Follow the directions on the bottle, making sure to follow the recommended daily dosages.


If you have been taking over-the-counter painkillers and they are not sufficiently dulling your pain, consult with your doctor about getting a prescription for something stronger; however, your doctor may simply tell you to take additional over-the-counter painkillers.
Ibuprofen can inhibit clotting and can increase bleeding. If the wound was recently bleeding, talk to your doctor before taking ibuprofen.

, Though cleaning the wound is a good idea, too much soap or water could irritate the cut. Try putting a dry washcloth or towel over the cut while you are in the shower to keep the water out.Taking a bath should be ok while recovering from a facial laceration, as your face does not need to be in the water to take a bath. However, be sure to keep it out of the water as much as possible and avoid submerging the laceration at all. This can irritate the wound and prevent proper healing.

, This depends on how much blood you lost and how serious the injury is.

, Depending on where the stitches are, eating can be difficult. If the injury is on the chin or near the lip, you might have to eat or drink small things or amounts in order keep the food out of the laceration.


Consider eating liquid meals through a straw if the laceration is bad and interferes with your ability to eat. This will allow you to keep the laceration clean and keep getting enough nutrients.

, An infected cut will usually turn red and puffy.It will become more tender and may have a discharge.


If you think your laceration is infected, you should have it looked at by a medical professional.

, If a child has gotten a serious facial laceration you should make sure that their brain was not affected by the same force that injured the child. Make sure your child is able to talk without being confused and is able to move around normally after an injury to the head. If there is concern for a concussion, your child should be seen by a medical professional who can determine the need for a CT scan of the head. Your child should also be kept under close observation for 24 hours after the injury.Know that it is ok for your child to sleep. Along with being pale, children are often sleepy after an injury. It is ok to allow your kid to sleep but be sure to check on her condition every two to four hours.

, A child won't always alert you that an injury is not healing properly. When changing bandages, check to make sure that the injury is healing nicely.


The wound is likely to be red and puffy for awhile, but it should usually not be oozing pus that is white, green or yellow.
Lacerations are places where a serious infection can enter your child's body. This is why it is so important to keep an eye on his injury., If the area around the stitches becomes infected, contact your doctor about whether to bring the child in to be assessed. A true infection will require professional cleaning and antibiotics in order to heal.

Accept yourself.",How to Stop Obsessive Skin & Blemish Picking," If you cut your nails you won't really be able to pick your blemishes and spots. (If you prefer to, you can also file your nails.);
, Your obsessive skin picking could be a condition known as Dermatillomania (now known as Excoriation disorder)-- a compulsive disorder where a person has an intense urge and need to pick at ones own skin, and you will need help and a good treatment to beat it. Use resources for more information, such as online sites, forums or read ""Skin Picking: How to Cure Dermatillomania"" by A Foxwell.

, Seriously—eliminating the temptation to use them on your skin will help you beat your picking., Use Neosporin or another antibacterial ointment on your newer scars, and try not to touch them., It is hard and will take patience, but nobody wants spots anyway. Use a daily cleanser and eat healthy. If acne causes you to pick, purchase a cleanser with Salicylic acid in it, or with Benzoyl Peroxide. You can also try using a mild skin lightening cream with Hydroquinone to gradually reduce the appearance of scars. This will take time though, but hopefully it will all be worth it.

, For example:



Make a closed fist for one minute instead of picking or in response to condition that usually provokes picking behavior.

Go for a walk outside every time you feel an urge to pick.Punish yourself with something for picking but not too drastic -- to do the dishes or no TV for a day or something like that. It might sound so crazy but it actually works and sooner or later you will have ditched your obsession.

,, You can wear a mask if you pick at your face, you can wear long pants if you pick at your legs, etc. You can also wear gloves or bandaids on your fingers when you feel the urge to pick. , Do you have triggers? This often occurs as a result of some triggering cause. Some common triggers are irregularities on the skin -- or anxiety or other negative feelings., Embrace the idea that nobody has perfect skin, and that your imperfections are what make you unique.

Avoid scratching.,
Use cold water.,
Take an oatmeal bath.,
Wear the right clothing.",How to Stop Itching1," While scratching an itch might seem like the easiest route to relief, it actually can make it worse. Scratching your itch will only prolong the irritation.


When you scratch your skin it causes a mild amount of pain. The sensation of pain interferes with the itching sensation, so you feel the pain of scratching over the itching.However, your brain will release serotonin in response to the pain to try and relieve it, which can then activate the itch receptor and cause even more itching.Scratching can be tempting. It can be helpful to cover the itchy area in Band-aids or gauze strips. You can also trim your nails short or wear clothing that covers the itch.;
, Cold temperatures affect the nerves that cause itch and can sometimes cause them to slow, resulting in relief from itching. Applying cold water to itchy skin can reduce the sensation.


Run cool tap water over the affected area. You could also place a cold washcloth on the skin until itching stops.A cold shower or bath can help, especially if the itch covers a large area.Ice packs are a good option as well. You can buy commercial ice packs at most supermarkets or drug stores. Always wrap these in a towel or wash cloth and never apply directly to the skin.If you can't find ice packs, you can also place ice cubes in a plastic bag or use frozen vegetables like a bag of peas instead., Oatmeal has been shown to soothe the skin for some people, and a cool oatmeal bath might help relieve your itching.


Colloidal oatmeal is preferred as it dissolves more easily in the water.However, if that's unavailable you can also use a food processor or blender to grind a cup of unflavored oatmeal.Run a tub of lukewarm water and pour the oats into a tub. Stir to remove any clumps.
Soak in the tub for 15 to 20 minutes and, when you're done, pat yourself dry.

, If you have an itch, you should minimize irritation to the area. Oftentimes, the type of clothing your wearing can make an existing itch worse.


Strive for loose-fitting outfits made from smooth textured fabrics.Avoid tight, constricting items of clothing. If possible, choose outfits that do not cover the itchy area.
Natural fibers, such as silk and cotton, do not usually irritate itchy skin. Wool is not recommended.

Try over-the-counter anti-itch creams.,
Try oral antihistamines.,
Know when hydrocortisone creams are effective.,
Seek medical care when necessary.",How to Stop Itching2," Many itch creams area available for purchase from drug stores and supermarkets. These could help soothe an itch.


Look for the following ingredients when selecting creams, as they're particularly effective in combating itch: camphor, menthol, phenol, pramoxine, diphenhydramine, and benzocaine.These remedies numb nerve endings and therefore reduce itching. They can be applied every few minutes until symptoms stop.Try calamine lotion with up to 4% concentration of menthol.
You should always be sure to read any warning labels on any products you purchase and check for any potential allergens. Make sure you know what to do in the event of an allergic reaction.

, Antihistamines are often the first line therapy for people with wide-spread itching.


Use non-drowsy antihistamines during the day. This will include over-the-counter allergy medications such as cetirizine (Zyrtec) and loratadine (Claritin).Make sure you talk to your doctor about your itch as only she can determine if it's caused by allergies. If it's caused by other factors, antihistamines may not help you with your itching.

, Hydrocortisone creams are a variety of over the counter topical ointments designed to reduce itch. They can be helpful in some situations, but are not always the right option depending on the cause of your itching.


Hydrocortisone creams only help ease itch caused by certain rashes, such as eczema. Over-the-counter creams are often somewhat weak, containing only 1% cortisone, but if you have eczema or another skin condition such as seborrhea they might still provide some relief.If your itching is caused by an allergic reaction, bug bites, or dry skin it's doubtful hydrocortisone creams would help at all.As always, only apply over-the-counter creams as necessary and talk to your doctor if you have a reaction.

, Itching is usually not a medical emergency, but if your itching is paired with certain symptoms or is severe you should seek medical care.


If your itch is severe enough that it disturbs your sleep, you should see your doctor as soon as possible to determine the cause.If itching lasts more than two weeks and does not improve, you should talk to a doctor.If your itching affects your entire body, seek medical care as soon as you can.See a doctor if itching is paired with symptoms like weight loss, exhaustion, change in bowel habits, fever, or redness and rashes on the skin."

Apply sunscreen when needed.,
Use moisturizers.,
Avoid any known irritants.",How to Stop Itching3," If your itching is caused by sunburn, make sure to apply sunscreen to any exposed skin when going outside.If your skin is particularly sensitive to the sun, avoid sunshine during peak hours. These means anywhere between 10AM and 2PM. Peak hours are based on peaks in UV radiation and not sunlight itself. Therefore, the timeframe remains the same year-round.SPF levels are somewhat deceitful. A sunscreen that has an SPF of 50, for example, is not actually twice as protective as one with an SPF of 25. Choose brands based on what they protect against rather than SPF levels. Look for brands that specifically protect against UVA and UVB rays.These are usually labeled ""broad spectrum.""
While SPF levels aren't the best measure of a sunscreen's strength, it's important to understand most dermatologists recommend a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or above.

, Dry skin can become itchy easily, so using high quality moisturizers can help reduce the likelihood of skin itch.


High quality moisturizers include Cetaphil, Eucerin, and CeraVe. They can be purchased at most drug stores without prescription.Apply creams once or twice daily, especially when getting out of the shower, after shaving or exercise, or other activities that dry out or irritate skin., Your itching may be caused by exposure to allergens or skin irritants. If you suspect your skin's itchiness is in response to an irritant, limit your exposure.


Common causes of allergic reaction in skin are nickel, jewelry, perfume, skin products with fragrances, cleaning products, and some cosmetics. If itchiness seems to occur in response to a particular product, cease use.Scented laundry detergents are known to cause skin itchiness. Try to buy natural detergents that don't contain added scents.Use mild, unscented soaps, conditioners, and lotions when possible."

Moisturize skin after washing.,
Use a chelating shampoo.,
Use less soap.",How to Stop Hard Water from Ruining Your Skin1," Regular usage of hard water can lead to dry, irritated skin. Combat this effect right after showering, bathing, or washing your face by moisturizing right away. Use a facial moisturizer and rich body lotion, and apply generously.Warm coconut oil can also be used as an intensive body moisturizer.;
, Hard water may leave mineral deposits in your hair and on your scalp, leaving it dry. Counteract this effect by purchasing a chelating shampoo, which contains an ingredient that bonds with the minerals in hard water and helps to rinse them away. Look for a shampoo (in pharmacies, beauty supply stores, or online) that contain “EDTA”, or Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetate., Hard water makes it difficult for soap to dissolve, leaving a buildup on your skin that can have negative effects (e.g. dryness, irritation). Using less soap can lessen this effect simply by cutting down the amount of potential buildup. When washing, focus larger amounts of soap on areas where you perspire frequently (like your underarms) and use it sparingly on the rest of your body."
"
Buy a water softening shower head.,
Install a household system.,
Rent a water softening system.",How to Stop Hard Water from Ruining Your Skin2," If you have hard water and wish to treat it, start with a water softening shower head before thinking about installing a larger system. These shower heads use replaceable filters to purify water and are available online or in hardware stores. Installation is as simple as replacing your old shower head, and the filtration works immediately to provide soft water in your shower., If you wish to soften the water throughout your home, buy a whole-house system. Ask neighbors or colleagues for recommendations, and read reviews of local companies providing this service. Note that professional installation of such a system is required to keep warranties, and systems cost a minimum of $1,000 before additional costs.Get quotes from different companies and compare prices before making a purchase.
Some municipalities do not allow these systems because of their use of salts and resins to remove contaminants. Call your local municipal office to find out what regulations are in effect in your area.

, Contact local companies to inquire about the possibility of renting water softening systems. This may be a more cost-effective choice for smaller homes, apartments, or vacation homes. Renting a system may also be a good way to see if buying a whole-house system is a worthwhile investment for your home."

Add aluminum sulfate to your water.,
Wash your face with bottled water.,
Shower elsewhere whenever possible.",How to Stop Hard Water from Ruining Your Skin3," Add one tablespoon (0.5 oz.) of aluminum sulfate to a small bucket of water. When the minerals clump and settle to the bottom, skim water off of the top with a cup or small container. Use the soft water to wash your face or take a sponge bath., If washing your face with tap water is having noticeably adverse effects on your skin (irritation or redness), make a point of using bottled water to wash it instead. While the cost may seem excessive, it may be worth the investment if your skin is particularly sensitive. Be sure to use enough water to rinse your face efficiently and prevent product buildup. , If you have access to a shower somewhere other than home (e.g. at the gym or swimming pool), take the opportunity to shower there as often as possible. Cutting back on the number of showers you take in hard water will minimize the overall damage to your skin. Make a point to bring your facial cleanser and wash your face there as well."

Even after you wash your hands, your skin still has these oils.
Don’t pick or squeeze the pimples as this will create a localized inflammatory response and will also contribute to scarring.;
, Do this twice a day. If you tend to get acne around the hairline, shampoo every day as well. This will help to reduce the amount of sebum (the oily secretion from your glands) on your face. However, you will not want to use harsh products or wash vigorously, because this stimulation will increase the oil production and stimulate skin growth, both of which clog your follicles., Scrubs, astringents and some exfoliating masks can also irritate the skin and worsen your acne. People without serious acne or sensitive skin issues can exfoliate their face one to two times a week. , Stop using creams, lotions, makeup, hair products, acne concealers, and sunscreen that are greasy or oily.

Bring a small pot of water to a boil.,
Wash your face.,
Pour the steaming water into a bowl.,
Add essential oils or herbs.,
Steam your face with a towel over your head.,
Draw the dirt from your pores with a mask.,
Tone your face.,
Moisturize your face.",How to Steam Your Face1," A basic steam involves nothing but water and your skin. It doesn't require much water. Fill up a small pot with 1 - 2 cups of water and bring it to a full boil.;
, While the water is heating up, wash your face using a gentle cleanser. Be sure to remove all of your makeup and any dirt, oil or sweat that's sitting on the surface of your skin. It's important that your skin be clean when you steam it. Your pores will open wide, and if you have dirt or makeup on your skin, it could cause irritation.


Don't wash your face with an exfoliating scrub or harsh soap. Before a steam, it's best to wash with a very mild cleanser, to reduce the chance that the steam treatment will further irritate your skin.
Pat your face dry with a soft towel.

, If you're doing the steam treatment as part of an at-home spa treatment, pour it into a big, pretty ceramic or glass bowl. If you just want a quick steam, you can leave it in the pot. Place whatever vessel you're using on a few folded towels on top of a table.


Don't pour the water into a plastic bowl. You don't want small plastic molecules getting involved in your facial steam.
Be very careful that you do not burn yourself! If you decide to leave the water in the pot, then make sure to remove it from the heat source before using it.

, Now's the time to add essential oils or herbs to the water to make the treatment a little special. If you add oils or herbs, the steam treatment will double as an aromatherapy session, so it will be a 2-in-1 treatment. Just a few drops of essential oils goes a long way.


Be sure to add any extras after you've taken the water off the boil. Otherwise, the scents will quickly evaporate.
If you don't have any special oils or herbs, try tea! Put a few herbal tea bags in the water. Chamomile, mint, and chai all make excellent steams.

, Drape the towel over your head so that it drops down on either side of your face, trapping the steam so that it concentrates near your skin. Place your face close enough to the steaming water to feel it massaging your face, but not so close that your skin feels like it's burning or you're having trouble breathing fresh air.


A typical steam lasts about 10 minutes, so you may want to sit down while you do the treatment. However, keep in mind that you can receive many of the same benefits if you stop after 5 minutes.
Don't steam your face for much longer than 10 minutes, especially if you have acne or other skin issues. Steaming causes the face to swell, and it can exacerbate acne if done for too much time.

, The steam treatment leaves your pores wide open, making this the perfect time to draw out the dirt and other impurities. The best way to do so is to follow your steam treatment with a clay mask. Smooth the mask over your face and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Wash it away with warm water and pat your face dry with a towel.


You can purchase a clay mask in the beauty section of your grocery store, drug store, or large store, such as Target or Walmart.
If you don't have a clay mask, use plain honey or a combination of honey and oatmeal.
If you choose not to use a mask, you can simply wash your face with warm water after the steam treatment.
Don't use a strong exfoliant on your skin after steaming, especially if you have acne. Since your face will be slightly swollen and your pores will be open, scrubbing it could cause it to become inflamed.

, After you rinse your mask away, use a facial toner to help your pores close back up. Apply it to your face in gentle strokes using a cotton ball.


Lemon juice makes a great natural toner. Mix 1 tablespoon with 1 cup of water.
Apple cider vinegar is another great option. Mix 1 tablespoon with 1 cup of water.

, Steam and heat cause the skin to dry out, so it's important to follow your treatment with a good moisturizer. Use one made with soothing oils, aloe and butters that will prevent your skin from getting too dry. Let the moisturizer completely absorb into your skin before applying makeup.

Polish your skin only once or twice a week.",How to Skin Polish," It's important your skin is as hydrated and healthy as possible when you go into the polishing process. To help with this, up your water intake. Aim to drink anywhere between 10 to 12 glasses of water a day. Do this for about a week before you plan to polish your skin., While you work your way up to the skin polishing, eat things like wheat germ, soy, nuts, eggs, and yellow, orange, and dark green vegetables. This will help your skin tolerate the polishing well., In order to keep your skin healthy and also diminish signs of wear or aging, it is important to moisturize each day immediately following your shower or bath. This helps keep your skin extra smooth and in optimal condition for polishing. Be sure to use a body oil or lotion daily that is dermatologist recommended. If you would prefer something less processed, try some of the following:


Olive oil
Coconut oil
Shea Butter

, Soap is alkaline in nature and, especially for sensitive skin, can cause irritation, flaking, and cracking of the skin. To prime your skin for polishing, avoid soap. Go for non-soap cleansers instead or simply rinse off unwanted dirt and debris with water., You can use a skin polish from a beauty salon or buy one online. Store bought polishes tend to be pricey, and they may not work for all skin tones, but it can save you the hassle of making one yourself.

As some polishes may irritate some skin types, try buying a sample size first and testing it on a small patch of skin to make sure you react to it properly. If you have a bad reaction, try a different polish or make one at home from natural ingredients.

, Mix one part baking soda with one part of your regular face wash to make a baking soda rub. The natural grains in baking soda help remove dead skin cells and replenish and polish your skin. Use enough baking soda/face wash to form a thick paste that can be applied all over your body., Mix four tablespoons of sea salt, two tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of lemon juice, and half a teaspoon of lavender oil. This mixture can help cleanse the skin and also has a pleasant odor.Avoid using this mixture if your skin is sensitive to essential oils.

, Mix a cup of brown sugar with half a cup of jojoba oil. Also, add in a tablespoon or orange juice and five vitamin E capsules. This mixture is great if your skin is dry, as jojoba oil is a natural moisturizer., Mix two tablespoons of granulated and brown sugar together. Then, add about a tablespoon of apple pulp and a quarter tablespoon of cinnamon. Apples provide a great source of vitamin A and B, which are great for skin health., Before you apply your skin polish, a nice bath is necessary. This helps relax you and open up your pores, allowing your skin to be adequately cleansed and polished.There is no precise time frame for you to be in the bathtub, but 20 minutes should be adequate.

, Dab the polish onto your face, focusing on the cheeks, chin, elbows, and nose. Use your fingers to rub the polish into your face in circular motions until the polish is distributed evenly throughout your face.Rinse your face off with warm water before proceeding., Before applying your polish to rough areas, you should remove callouses and dead skin. This can be done with the assistance of a pumice stone, which you can purchase at most department stores. Gently rub the stone against rough areas, like the heels and elbows. Apply enough pressure to wear down callouses and rough skin, but not so much pressure that you feel in pain., You want to make sure all your skin is targeted during the skin polishing process. Work the polish in throughout your body. It can help to move from head to toes or vice vera. When applying your circular motions, use some force so you can lift dead skin. However, do not push to the point you feel pain.If you have any areas on your body that are extra sensitive, avoid applying skin polish here.

, After polishing your full body once, revisit the areas you treated earlier with the pumice stone. Apply a bit more polish here, just to exfoliate and moisturize the skin a bit more. Rough areas tend to need a little more care during the skin polishing process., You can rinse in the bath or shower, using warm water. Make sure you get any traces of polish off your skin. When you're done, gently pat your body dry with a towel., Skin polish can help remove dead skin cells, but it can also leave your skin feeling a little dry. Apply your regular moisturizer all over your body after skin polishing.If you have body-specific moisturizers, such as moisturizers for your feet and face, use these after polishing.

, As skin polishing is an intense form of exfoliation, it should not be done every day. Exfoliation is generally recommended to be done only once or twice a week, and only once a week for sensitive skin.Therefore, it's a good idea to polish your skin only once a week. If your skin reacts negatively to polishing, cut back that amount further."

Wash with warm water.,
Take one short bath or shower a day.,
Use a body wash.,
Exfoliate regularly.",How to Stop Dry Skin1," A hot shower or bath can be soothing, particularly in cold weather, but the hot water can be very drying. That’s because it washes away the skin’s natural oils. Keep your skin more hydrated by washing with warm or lukewarm water instead.When it’s possible, such as during hot summer months, try to wash with cool or cold water. It’s actually the most beneficial when it comes to stopping dry skin.;
, Even if you’re washing with warm or lukewarm water, long or frequent baths and showers can strip away your skin’s oils so it becomes dehydrated. Limit your bathing time to 5 to 10 minutes a day to put an end to dry skin.If you need to stay in the bath or shower for longer, such as to treat sore muscles, be sure that you’re using a moisturizing bath oil or cream to combat any extra dryness.

, Soap may get you clean, but it can strip away your skin’s natural oils and leave it dry and itchy. Wash with a soapless, alcohol-free, fragrance-free body wash that can help keep your skin hydrated.Avoid using too much body wash. Wash with just enough to remove dirt and oils, but not so much that it creates a thick lather.
If you must use a soap, be sure to choose a moisturizing formula rather than a deodorant or perfumed version.

, Removing the dead, dry cells that sit on the surface of your skin can help put an end of dryness and itchiness. Use a scrub designed for the body two to three times a week, and a scrub with fine, gentle grains designed for the face one to two times a week to keep skin smooth and hydrated.If your skin is sensitive, exfoliating once a week is enough.
Avoid scrubbing your skin too hard when you’re exfoliating. You may wind up irritating it, which can leave it even drier. Apply your exfoliator in gentle circular motions.

Apply a moisturizer right after bathing.,
Use an ointment or cream moisturizer.,
Treat severely dry spots overnight.",How to Stop Dry Skin2," The best way to lock moisture into your skin is to smooth on your moisturizer right after you finish taking a shower or bath. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel, and apply the moisturizer while your skin is still slightly damp to trap the moisture and keep it hydrated.Practice the same routine whenever you wash your face or hands to keep those areas hydrated as well.

, Lotion moisturizers are often too thin and watery to provide significant moisture to the skin. Keep dryness at bay by using a thick ointment or cream moisturizer, which can deliver intense hydration so your skin stays smooth and irritation-free.Look for moisturizer that contain natural oils that mimic skin oils, such as jojoba or olive oil. Shea butter is also an effective natural moisturizer.
Other moisturizer ingredients that can help soothe dry skin include glycerine, hyaluronic acid, mineral oil, dimethicone, lactic acid, urea, petrolatum, and lanolin.

, If you have severely dry spots, such as your feet or elbows, overnight moisturization may be necessary. Use a particularly heavy moisturizing agent, such as petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening, and slather it over the areas. Next, cover the skin with clothing and go to sleep. Your skin will have all night to soak up the extra moisture.Because the moisturizer may stain the clothing, be sure to wear a pair of old socks, gloves, pajamas, or an old-long-sleeve tee to avoid ruining good clothing.
It’s also a good idea to put old sheets on your bed in case any of the moisturizer comes into contact with your bedding.

Soothe dry spots with milk.,
Soak in an oatmeal bath.,
Spot treat areas with aloe vera gel.",How to Stop Dry Skin3," Milk can help soothe dry, itchy skin because it contains lactic acid, which helps promote exfoliation. Soak a washcloth or piece of gauze in cold milk, and hold it over dry areas for approximately 5 minutes. Rinse the area, and apply your usual moisturizer.You can also add a cup (125 g) or so of powdered milk to a bath and soak in it for 5 to 10 minutes to help soften your dry skin., Oatmeal can help soften and soothe dry, itchy skin. Create an oatmeal bath by grinding 1 to 2 cups of quick or old-fashioned oats in a blender or food processor. Sprinkle the powder in your bath while the water is running, and soak in it for approximately 10 minutes.Colloidal oatmeal can also work very well in a bath to treat dry skin.

, Aloe vera gel not only moisturizes the skin; it also forms a protective barrier that can help lock moisture in the skin. Apply a small amount of the gel to particularly dry areas to soothe and hydrate them.While aloe vera is hydrating, it can sometimes make the skin feel tight. It’s a good idea to apply your usual moisturizer over it.

Run a humidifier in your home.,
Avoid clothing with irritating fabrics.,
Protect exposed skin from harsh conditions.,
Choose nourishing foods, and possibly supplements.",How to Stop Dry Skin4," Dry air from the heating system in your home can dehydrate your skin. To combat the dryness, particularly in the winter, it’s a good idea to use a humidifier, which adds moisture to the air. You can plug it in your bedroom and leave it on when you’re sleeping at night, or run it in any room where you spend a lot of time.Set your humidifier to approximately 60%. That is usually enough to replenish the moisture in the top layer of your skin., The clothes that you wear can actually irritate your skin and keep it dehydrated. Instead of scratchy fabrics such as wool and polyester, opt for smooth, natural materials such as cotton or linen.If you plan to wear wool or other potentially irritating fabrics, layer cotton or silk under them to keep your skin protected.
Be sure to use laundry detergent that’s labeled hypoallergenic and fragrance-free.

, If you're going to be outdoors in cold weather or working with harsh chemicals, cover any skin that will be exposed. Cold, dry air and caustic cleaners and other chemicals can irritate and dry out the skin. Cover your hands with gloves, and wear a long sleeve shirt and pants to minimize your exposure.Protect the skin on your neck and throat by covering up with a scarf in the winter too.
Be sure to wear rubber gloves when you're washing dishes. The detergent can dry out your hands.

, The foods and nutrients that we take into our body can affect our skin. Fish oil and flaxseed are particularly effective in keeping the skin hydrated, because they contain essential fatty acids that protect the skin from environmental factors.Talk to your doctor about whether fish oil and flaxseed supplements would be a good addition to your healthcare routine.If you prefer, you can incorporate more fish and flaxseed to your diet directly. Flaxseed should be ground if you wish to receive the full benefits, though.
While drinking plenty of water is good for overall health, it doesn't do much to moisturize the skin specifically. That's because it is filtered through the body, absorbed by the bloodstream, and doesn't ever directly reach the skin cells. "

Use a makeup remover.,
Cleanse your face with warm water.,
Use an exfoliant.,
Moisturize.",How to Shrink Pores1," Buildup from makeup is often responsible for clogging pores. The first step in the exfoliation process is to remove it.


Try to find a natural makeup remover, if possible. The chemicals in many makeup removers can dry out your skin, causing it to flake and increasing the need for exfoliation.;
, There's no need to use any special facial cleanser to unclog your pores. In fact, soaps, perfumes and other ingredients might actually exacerbate the problem by inflaming your skin.


Make sure the water is warm, not hot. Again, reddening and inflaming the skin is not necessary, and not good for reducing the appearance of pores.
Pat your face dry with a soft towel. Don't scrub it, or you may damage your skin, which is more sensitive on your face than other parts of your body.

, Exfoliating skin removes dead skin cells and oils that clog your pores. Consider these different types of exfoliants, and use one as often as needed:

A dry facial brush. Buy a small, soft brush made with natural fibers and use it to gently brush your face. Your face and the brush should both be dry. Use swift, short strokes to brush away flakes around your eyes, cheeks and chin.






Use an exfoliating product. Many creams, gels and cleansers come mixed with small particles that exfoliate the skin. Use these sparingly, since the other ingredients may inflame your skin.







Make your own facial scrub. Sugar, honey and green tea can go a long way toward making your skin glow. These ingredients are gentle on your skin and shouldn't cause inflammation.







, After you're finished exfoliating, apply a light moisturizer or facial oil, like rose hip oil. This will keep your skin from getting dried out and irritated, helping to reduce the appearance of pores.

Start with a clean face.,
Test the facial mask in a small area.,
Apply the mask.,
Rinse the mask.",How to Shrink Pores2," Using the cleansing method outlined above, remove your makeup, splash your face with warm water, and pat it dry with a towel.

, Apply the mask to a small patch on your face. Let it sit for a few minutes and then remove it. If the area looks red or inflamed, don't use the mask. If not, go ahead with the next step.

, Masks pull dirt from your pores and reduce inflammation of the surrounding skin, helping to make the pores appear smaller.


Clay masks are ideal for this purpose, but any natural facial mask will work fine. Try making your own mask with yogurt.
Smooth the mask over your face, concentrating in the areas where your pores appear large.
Allow the mask to stay on your face for about fifteen minutes, or the length of time specified on the package.

Start with a good moisturizer.,
Use a primer.,
Use a concealer.",How to Shrink Pores4," Your skin needs to stay hydrated to prevent it from becoming irritated and inflamed, which makes your pores look larger. A layer of moisturizer also protects your skin from irritating chemicals contained in other makeup products.

, Concealer adds another layer of color and texture and can completely mask the surface of your skin, depending on the brand you choose.


If your pores are large in appearance, you may be tempted to cake on the makeup. Concealer is helpful in small doses, but using a lot of it may call even more attention to areas you're trying to conceal.
Choose your brand wisely. Concealer can clog pores and make them appear to look big. Make sure your concealer isn't actually making the problem worse before you include it in your daily regimen.
Remove your makeup every night. Make sure you take it off before you go to sleep so you wake up with unclogged pores.

However, if you are trying to unveil your body’s natural beauty, use only water and rinse your hair thoroughly to clean it. You will soon find that your body is capable of regulating your hair hygiene without the aid of chemicals.

, You might even consider not shaving your legs, since many men and women have more or less unnoticeable leg hair, or often wear pants. If you would still like to shave your legs, try pure coconut oil instead of shaving lotion."

Get enough exercise.,
Eat healthy foods.,
Limit alcohol consumption.,
Avoid smoking entirely.,
Get enough sleep.,
Limit and address stressors.,
Foster healthy relationships.",How to Show Your Natural Beauty3," This is a key to a healthy lifestyle. The average adult doesn’t have to join a gym or sign up for a marathon to get enough exercise to stay healthy. However, you should try to vary the way you get exercise to get enough aerobic and anaerobic activity.


Some good aerobic activities include long, fast walks; jogging; swimming; and boxing.
Anaerobic activity means getting your heart rate up in shorter bursts. Weight lifting, sprinting, and rowing machines are good ways to improve your heart health.
Daily exercise is a great way to get a workout, but it is not the only part of a healthy lifestyle. Try parking at the back of the parking lot to increase how far you walk to the store, or pledging never to take the elevator at work, for example. These little boosts to your amount of daily exercise will do wonders for your health.

, There is no one diet that is optimal for every person, as we all have natural deficiencies that we need to offset. There are, however, some healthy foods that everyone can do a better job of consuming on a daily basis. Substituting vegetables or herbal tea for unhealthy snacks is a great way to keep your blood pressure down and your whole body healthy. Malnutrition has countless drawbacks on your skin and hair health.


For healthy hair, make sure to get enough iron, protein, vitamins C, A, and E, and omega-3 fatty acids.For healthy skin, eat yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, green vegetables, tomatoes, blueberries, peas and beans, fatty fish, and nuts., There are numerous health drawbacks of alcohol abuse, and some of them are visible. Regular drinking can make it difficult for health issues to clear themselves – which includes skin problems. Drinking also makes you appear tired and unhealthy by causing bags under your eyes.

, Smoking dries out your skin and yellows your teeth and fingers. It also contributes to serious health problems. Keeping your heart and lungs healthy is the best way to promote beauty from the inside out.

, Lack of sleep can have drawbacks on your total body health as well as your outward appearance. Bags under the eyes, bloodshot eyes, swollen eyelids, and pale skin are ways your sleep deprivation will show., Stress can contribute to and even cause numerous health issues, or at least make it difficult for your body to heal itself. It is not easy to recognize and address your stressors. Sometimes this means learning ways to accept the parts of your life you can’t change. Talk to a therapist if you don’t feel you can make adjustments to your life without help.


If you are working too much, ask to have some of your duties shifted elsewhere. Even the promise of working less may help you relax at home.
Try to pick up an old hobby that you used to enjoy, if you have the time. Finding distractions from everyday life is a good way to take the focus off the parts of your life that stress you.

, The flipside of limiting the stressful parts of your life is finding sources of happiness. Healthy human relationships are a great way to promote good mental health. Being happy and healthy on the inside will help you have a radiant personality and appearance.


Owning pets is a great way to create a loving home. However, think hard before you adopt, since pet ownership is a more serious commitment than some realize.

Pat dry with a towel.",How to Wash Your Face With Rice Water," You can prepare rice water with any type of rice, though white, brown, and jasmine rice are common options. If you already own rice, whatever kind of rice you have on hand will work., Put 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of rice into a bowl. If you want to make large quantities of rice water, you can increase the amount of rice that you use, as long as you remember to also increase the water. Keep in mind that rice water has a shelf-life of one week., Strain out the rice and return it to the empty bowl. Repeat the steps to wash your rice a second time.

, You can make rice water by boiling rice, soaking rice, or fermenting soaked rice water. Which type you pick will depend on how much time you have and how you want to use the rice water.


Boiling your rice will create a concentrated batch of rice water, so it’s stronger. You will need to mix it with clean water when you use it.Soaking your rice is the simplest method because you have fewer steps and don’t need to attend your rice water while it’s soaking. Because it’s not concentrated, you may run out faster.
Fermenting your rice water takes the most time, but the fermentation process brings out more vitamins and nutrients., If you are boiling your rice, place it in a lidded pot. Otherwise, place your rice in a clean bowl.

, Measure out 3 cups (705 milliliters) of water. You will use more water than you would normally use to make rice so that you will have leftover water once you’re finished cooking the rice.Ignore the directions on your rice packaging. Using those directions, you will not have leftover rice water.

, Boiling is one of two methods of making rice water. While it takes more effort, the results are more potent, so you can use less of it.Bring the water to a boil.
Pour in your rice, cover, and then cook on medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes.
Allow your boiled rice to cool before handling it.

, Soaking requires less work but the results will be less potent. You will also not need to dilute your rice water if you soak your rice.Put the rice in the water, cover, and then soak for 15-30 minutes.If you plan to ferment your rice water, soaking the rice is the best way to prepare the rice water before fermentation., Drain the rice water into a separate container. Drain it more than once so that you won't find any rice grains in the water.Your rice water will have a milky-white color., To ferment your rice water, place rice water that you prepared by soaking into a container. Allow your rice water to sit for 1-2 days uncovered. When it begins to smell sour, place it into the refrigerator to stop the fermentation process.Dilute fermented rice water with 1-2 cups (235-470 milliliters) of clean water because it is very potent., You will need to store your rice water in a sealed container, so choose something like a jar, a food storage container, or a lidded carafe.

, When you are not using it, your rice water should stay in the refrigerator. It will last for up to a week if properly stored., If you are using boiled or fermented rice water, measure out two-three tablespoons (30-45 milliliters) and add it to 1-2 cups (235-470 milliliters) of water. If you are using soaked rice water, skip this step., Over the sink or in a shower, use your hands to wash your face with the rice water. Repeat this action 4-6 times.

, Cleanse away the rice water using clean water. The nutrients in the rice water will remain in your skin.

, Make sure your towel is clean to avoid transferring bacteria back onto your skin.

Avoid waxing acne prone areas or areas with breakouts.",How to Wax Your Face," Only use wax that is made for use on your face, known as facial wax. It will often come in a kit with an applicator or strips that are made for certain areas of your face. Facial wax will be more gentle on your skin than body wax, as the skin on your face is more sensitive.You can find facial wax at your local beauty supply store or online.;
, If you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin, look for facial wax with aloe vera. The aloe vera will help to soothe your skin and make the wax less harsh on your skin. Get facial wax that is marked “for sensitive skin.”If you use acne medication, use facial wax made for sensitive skin. Acne medication can make your skin extra sensitive to wax.

, If you are using loose facial wax, you will need an applicator stick. You can use an applicator stick made for waxing or popsicle sticks. Get popsicle sticks in a wide and small size, as you can use the small size for applying wax on your eyebrows.You will also need fabric strips to help remove the hair. You can buy pre-made fabric strips for waxing or make your own by buying white, cotton fabric and cutting it into small strips.

, If you are new to waxing your body, particularly your face, look for wax that comes in prepared strips. The strips will often come in a kit for facial waxing. They will be cut to fit certain areas of your face, such as your upper lip, your eyebrows, or your jawline.

It is usually easier to apply wax in strips, rather than have to deal with loose wax and an application stick. If you are a seasoned waxer, you may feel more comfortable with loose wax.

, Start by washing your face your normal facial cleanser. Use lukewarm water to clean your face well. Having a clean face will make waxing easier and reduce your chances of a breakout after waxing.Gently exfoliate your skin as you clean it by pressing the cleanser to your skin in small circles. Exfoliating your skin will help to remove dead skin.

, If you have a long beard or hairs that are longer than 2 cm, trim them with small scissors or a hair trimmer. Only trim your hairs so they are no shorter than 1 cm or 1/6th to 1/8th of an inch.Do not try to wax any hairs on your face that are shorter than 1 cm, as this can lead to ingrown hairs and damage to your skin. Wait until your hair grows out and is long enough to wax off.

, Put baby powder on your upper lip and your eyebrows to make it easier for the wax to grab your hairs. The baby powder will also absorb any excess oil and reduce irritation due to the wax., Clean your hands well with soap and water. Having clean hands will ensure no bacteria or germs end up on your face during the waxing.You may also position yourself in front of a mirror to make it easier for you to see what you are doing as you wax your face.

, Notice if your hair grows downward in a straight line or diagonally towards the center of your face. You will then apply the wax in the direction of your hair growth.Your eyebrow hair and upper lip hair will usually grow at a diagonal. Hair on your cheeks and jawline may grow straight downward or at a diagonal.

, If you are using wax strips, warm the strip up by rubbing them between your hands for 30-40 seconds. If you are using loose wax, warm up the wax over the stove or in the microwave. Check that the wax is not burning hot to the touch. It should be warm enough that the wax is wet and easy to spread, but not boiling hot., If you are using loose wax, use an applicator stick or a popsicle stick to apply a thin layer of wax in the direction of your hair growth. Then, take a strip of fabric and press it down on the wax. Massage the fabric onto the wax using your fingers.If you are using prepared wax strips, peel off the non sticky side and apply it to your skin in the direction of your hair growth. Press down on the strip, massaging it into your skin so it picks up your hairs.

, This will give the wax time to set onto your hairs and onto the strip. Do not let the wax sit for longer than 30 seconds, as it can be difficult to remove and more painful to remove.

The wax should not feel like it is burning your skin when you let it sit. It should feel hot, but not burning.

, After 30 seconds, put one hand underneath the strip and press down on your skin, holding it taut. Grip the bottom edge of the strip with your other hand and pull off the strip upwards, in the opposite direction of your hair growth.You do not have to remove the strip quickly as long as you remove it in one continuous go. Do not tug at the strip too hard.

, Your skin may tingle after the wax has been removed. Use a wet, cool cloth or pad to press your skin and soothe it. Try to do this right after the wax has been removed so the area does not feel too painful.Do not use soothing oils on your skin right after the wax has been removed as this can clog your pores. A wet clean cloth is fine.

, Put small dabs of wax under and above your eyebrows to remove excess hairs. If you want to shape your eyebrows, remove a small amount of hair at a time. This way, you are not at risk of waxing off too much of your brows in one go.

You may want to avoid waxing off too much of your eyebrows or shaping them using the wax. When in doubt, consult a professional.

, If you want to wax your upper lip hairs, use two strips of wax. This will ensure you follow the direction of your hair growth and do not irritate your skin. Apply wax on one side of your upper lip and remove the hair. Then, apply wax to the other side of your lip and remove the hair., Once you are done waxing your skin, apply a facial moisturizer to the area to ensure it does not get dry or irritated. Use a moisturizer with soothing ingredients like aloe vera and shea butter.Do not use moisturizer that is heavy with oils or fragrance, as they can clog your pores.

, To maintain your facial hair, get in the habit of waxing your face every four to six weeks. This will give your hair enough time to grow back. Your facial hair will also be easier to remove if you wax it more regularly., If you develop acne or a break out on your face, do not wax these areas. Waxing these areas can make them worse and lead to scarring. If you notice your skin breaking out due to waxing, you may want to consult a professional."
"
Identify your skin issues.,
Choose the right cleanser.,
Know when to use it.,
Use warm or cool water.,
Wash your face.,
Rinse well with warm or cool water.,
Apply a gentle moisturizer.,
Avoid unnecessary products.,
Determine if your skin's sensitivity has environmental causes.,
Determine if you are allergic to your products.,
Determine if you have other dermatological issues.",How to Wash Your Face when You Have a Sensitive Skin," You've noticed your skin is sensitive, but getting a little more information on what, exactly, is going on with your skin can be very helpful when you are trying to choose the best products for your skin.


If you have acne-prone skin, skin that is especially oily, or skin that has very dry patches, you will need to address those concerns with products formulated for those skin types.
Sensitive skin is prone to irritation, so it's important to use as few products as possible in your skincare routine. Identify your main issues of concern, and address those, but be careful about causing additional issues by using too many products.;
, There are many products on the market, but your sensitive skin is unlikely to react well to a long process of trial-and-error to find the right one. Instead, try these suggestions for sensitive skin.


Choose products that are fragrance-free and alcohol-free to minimize irritation.Look for products that say ""sensitive"" on the label, like Olay Foaming Face Wash.Despite its title, this product does not create much of a lather. In general, the more foam a product creates, the more it will strip your skin of its protective barrier oils, so products with just a touch of lather or none at all are ideal. Other brands with cleansers for sensitive skin include Clinique, Cetaphil, CeraVe, Eucerin, and Avène.Try facial wipes. Wipes are convenient and if you find that they are too harsh for your skin, you can moisten them with water to dilute the ingredients. Many wipes contain fragrances and alcohol, so look for one without these products, like Simple Oil Balancing face wipes.Opt out of ""soaps"" altogether. If you do not get especially dirty on a day-to-day basis, there is no need to use a soap product. Warm water and a washcloth can gently clean your facial skin. Another great option is coconut oil. A small amount rubbed all over the face and removed with warm, wet washcloth can cleanse the skin and also remove even stubborn make-up.
Be cautious when exfoliating. If your skin is sensitive, don't exfoliate more than once or twice weekly. If you have other skin issues, such as inflammatory acne, you will want to speak with a dermatologist before attempting to exfoliate.
Remember that just because a product works well for someone else with sensitive skin, it might not work well for you. Additionally, more expensive products are not necessarily better than cheaper ones.

, Washing your face more often than is necessary strips your skin of its natural protective barrier and leaves it dry and vulnerable to irritation. You should only wash your face once or twice a day.Wash your face at the end of the day, just before bed, and then immediately apply a mild moisturizer or cream. Be sure to remove all makeup or other products from your skin.
In the morning, unless you have very oily skin, you do not need to wash your face. Instead, rub some lukewarm water on your face and then pat dry with a towel. After a night of sleeping on a clean pillow without makeup, you don't need to use a harsh cleanser., The right temperature of water is crucial to avoid irritating your skin. Warm or cool water is usually best for washing your face.


Hot water will strip your skin of its natural protective oils and can also scald it.
While it is a myth that cold water closes your pores, it can help to keep them from producing excess oil, so if that is one of your skincare concerns, consider using cold water., While some products may have different instructions, generally the process is similar regardless of what type of product you choose.


Splash cool or warm water on your face. This will help the product penetrate the oil and dirt on your face.
Apply a very small amount of the product to your fingertips. In general, a pea-sized amount should do, although some products do not spread as well as others so you may need more. Some people prefer to use a washcloth, but unless it is very soft and you use a very light touch, the fibers on a washcloth can be abrasive to sensitive skin.
Rub the product between your hands until it forms a lather (or, if you have a non-lathering product, until the product is evenly distributed between your hands). Then, beginning with your forehead, massage the product gently into the moist skin on your face. Avoid your eye and lip areas and nostrils.

, Splash the water onto your face and gently rub with your hands until the soap is removed.


Be sure to remove all the product from your skin. Again, using a washcloth is not recommended for sensitive skin.
Dry with a clean, soft towel, using a patting motion rather than rubbing in order to protect the skin from abrasion.

, Most people with sensitive skin need a protective layer to re-hydrate the skin after cleansing. Look for products marked specifically for sensitive skin, which tend to be fragrance-free and free of harsh chemicals.


If you will be outdoors at all, even to drive a car, be sure that you use a product with sunscreen. Choose a sunscreen offering broad spectrum coverage and an SPF of 30.If your skin is sensitive to chemical sunscreens, try a broad spectrum sunscreen containing a physical blocker like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which tends to be gentle on sensitive skin.Other gentle moisturizers that often work well for people with sensitive skin include Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion for oily to normal skin or Bare Minerals Purely Nourishing Cream for very dry skin.

, While you may need certain products to address your skin care concerns, a minimalist skincare routine is best for people with sensitive skin.If you have no other major issues with your skin (like eczema, acne, or extreme oiliness or dryness), it is possible that you can reduce your skincare routine to a mild face wash, a sunscreen, and a moisturizer. In some cases, the sunscreen and moisturizer might be the same product.
Remember that cosmetic products can also be irritating, so choose formulas that are fragrance-free, non-comedogenic (that is, won't clog your pores), and with as few ingredients as possible. Some brands that claim to be good for sensitive skin include Clinique and bareMinerals.

, It's possible that your skin's sensitivity is caused by an allergy or similar concern, which can be treated or managed with lifestyle changes.


If the skin on your face or lips is chronically itchy, dry (especially in patches), or red and inflamed, it's possible that environmental allergens (pets, dust, ragweed, etc.) might be to blame. Typically, an allergic reaction won't be localized to your face, so itchy skin on your hands, arms, knees, or other areas might be an indication of an allergy.
Some food allergies, like a gluten or milk allergies, can cause reactions in the skin. Even nut allergies can manifest as hives, itchy skin, or redness around the mouth. An allergist (a doctor specializing in allergies) can help you determine if your sensitive skin is caused by environmental or food allergies by giving you skin-prick or patch test.

, It's possible that your skin's sensitivity is caused by an allergy or sensitivity to the products that you use on your face or around your home, which can be managed by switching products.


If you have itchy, red, uncomfortable, or inflamed skin on your face or lips, it's possible that you have an allergy or sensitivity to a product that you use. Consider whether your face wash, scrub, toner, sunscreen, moisturizer, cosmetics, lip balm, or any other product that comes into contact with your face might be causing a reaction. You can try eliminating products individually for about a week each, in order to see if you have any improvement of your symptoms.
You might also have an allergy or sensitivity to products that you use, such as your laundry detergent, or a perfume or hand lotion that might come in contact with your face. There is also the possibility that a partner's products (cosmetics or after shave, for instance) might be causing a reaction on your skin.
It has been observed that children with sensitive skin or atopic dermatitis may be prone to food allergies. You may want to have a skin prick test to see if food allergies are causing your dermatitis or sensitive skin.

, Most people who say they have sensitive skin never see a dermatologist. If that describes you, it is possible that you are living with a skin condition that is treatable.Some issues that seem like mere skin sensitivity are actually eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, or other skin issues. Each of these skin conditions has its own root cause and treatment plan.If you've never been to a dermatologist, it's a good idea to visit one to rule out other skin conditions. If you do find out you have a skin condition, the dermatologist can prescribe creams or oral medications to treat it.
Eczema or atopic dermatitis can be treated a number of way including creams to affect the immune system, antibiotics to prevent infection, antihistamine to stop itching, and stress modifications."

Schedule some downtime.,
Stop using prescription products on your skin.,
Use a soap-free cleanser.,
Gather your post-peel care products.,
Purchase your peel from a reputable source.,
Apply a prep solution.,
Let your skin dry.,
Use a fan brush to apply the peel.,
Leave the acid on for one minute.,
Use a neutralizing solution.,
Use a cooling product.,
Apply a moisturizer.,
Stay out of the sun.",How to Use a Glycolic Acid Peel," This is especially important if you’ve never done a peel before. Your skin might be red and sensitive after the peel, so plan to do it when you have a few days when you don't have to go to work or any social functions.For example, you could plan on applying the peel to your skin on a Friday afternoon after you get home from work. This gives your skin the rest of the night Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday to heal.;
, If you use prescription anti-acne products on your skin, stop using them two to three days before you plan to do your peel. The chemicals in those medications can prevent the glycolic acid from fully penetrating into your skin.If you're not sure if you should stop using your anti-acne products, check the ingredients list. If the list includes ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, or salicylic acid, discontinue using that medicine two to three days before you plan on doing your peel., A soap-free cleanser won’t include sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate in it. Look for a cleanser with cocomidopropyl betaine in it instead. It's a natural cleanser made from coconuts. Use this cleanser like you would normally, one to two days before you plan on doing your peel.If you have very sensitive skin, you can use micellar water alone in place of your regular soap-based cleansers. You can also use oil-based cleansers - just make sure you rinse really well!

, Once you apply the peel, you won’t have much time to gather the stuff you need for post-peel care. Make sure you have it all together, near where you'll be applying the peel. You'll need a mild cleanser (you can use your soap-free substitute), a cloth dipped in cold water, aloe vera, or cooling masks, and a light moisturizer and sunscreen., Because glycolic acid is, well, an acid, you want to be really careful about where you purchase it from. You can often get glycolic acid peels from a dermatologists’ office, or you can ask for a full kit from beauty stores.If you've never applied an acid peel before it's probably best to ask a dermatologist for the peel. They can also give you some tips for applying it.

, Prep solutions usually come with a peel kit, but you can also make your own. Witch hazel or diluted rubbing alcohol work just as well as what comes in a kit to prepare your skin. Pour the solution you're using on a cotton ball and swab your entire face.You might need to use more than one cotton ball to cover your face completely, and that's okay. It's better to over-prepare your skin than underprepare it.

, Your skin should be completely dry from the prep solution before you apply the peel. Regardless of what type of prep solution you use, you should let your face dry for at least ten minutes.


Once your skin is dry, you can apply petroleum jelly to the sensitive areas of your face – around your eyes, the corners of your lips and your nostrils – to protect sensitive skin from the acid.

, This brush should be clean and should not have any makeup on it. It’s probably best to keep a brush reserved just for applying peels. Drop a few drops of the acid on the brush and then brush it all over your face.You might need to reload the brush one or two times in order to get the glycolic acid over your whole face.
Avoid really sensitive areas of your face like your nostrils, the corners of your lips, and the thin skin around your eyes.

, Don’t go longer than a minute, especially if you’ve never done a peel before, since the acid can damage to your skin. Your skin might tingle a little bit while the peel is on your face. That’s normal, but if your skin starts to burn, remove the acid immediately by rinsing your face with clear water., This prevents the acid from continuing to work into your skin after the minute is up. Peel kits often include a neutralizing solution. You can also use a regular cleanser or plain water to neutralize and remove the acid. Splash the neutralizing solution your face and then rinse it off. Try not to rub the solution in as this will force the acid further into your skin., Glycolic acid can cause your skin to feel a bit like you've been sunburned. You can get some relief by using a cooling product like aloe vera or even just a cold cloth. Spread the aloe vera over the areas of your face that feel uncomfortable, or lay a cold cloth over your whole face., Glycolic acid can cause your skin to dry out, and you don't want that! Using a moisturizer can put some moisture back in your skin. It can also help prevent peeling. Feel free to spread the moisturizer you've chosen over your whole face - you can't over-moisturize!If your skin does start to peel, don’t peel the dead skin off. Put more moisturizer on the flaky areas and let it heal on its own. Pulling the dead skin off can cause serious damage to your skin.

, For a few days after your peel, you should stay out of direct sunlight, since your skin will be very sensitive. If you have to go into the sun, use a very strong SPF – at least a 40 – on your face."

Wet your face with warm water.,
Apply your cleanser of choice.,
Gently exfoliate your skin.,
Rinse and pat it dry.,
Apply toner for a smooth appearance.,
Finish with moisturizer.",How to Wash Your Face1," Pull your hair back and wet your skin with plenty of warm water. Using hot or cold water can be abrasive to your skin, while warm water is gentle and won’t cause irritation.









You can splash water on your face using your hands, or moisten a towel and use that to wet your skin.
Wetting your skin before applying cleanser will help the soap slide more easily across your skin, preventing you from having to use too much.;
, Use a dime-sized amount of cleanser that works with your skin type. Apply it to your face in a circular motion, making sure each spot gets covered with a tiny amount of cleanser. Keep massaging in a circular motion for thirty seconds to a minute.








Avoid using hand or body soap as your facial cleanser. Facial skin is more sensitive than the skin elsewhere on the body, and harsher soaps can cause it to get dry and irritated.If you’re wearing makeup, you may also want to use a special makeup remover, especially around your eyes. Plain coconut oil is a great natural makeup remover.

, Exfoliating is the process of gently scrubbing your skin to remove dirt and dead skin cells. Exfoliating every few days will keep your pores from getting clogged and help your facial skin look fresh and bright. Use a facial scrub or a washcloth to rub your skin in a circular motion, focusing on areas that tend to be dry or oily.








Exfoliating too often or too vigorously can irritate your skin. Do it just a few times a week, and make sure you don’t scrub too hard. On the days when you don’t need to exfoliate, just skip this step when you wash your face.
You can make your own facial scrub using a few household ingredients. Try mixing 1 teaspoon honey, 1 teaspoon granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon water or milk.

, Use warm water to rinse your face, making sure to wash away all traces of your cleanser and scrub. Use a towel to pat your face dry. Try not to rub your face when you dry it, since this can encourage wrinkles and irritate the skin.







, Using toner is an optional step that’s nice to try if you want your skin to look smooth and reduce the appearance of pores. Apply toner using a cotton ball, focusing on areas where your pores appear large.









Many store-bought toners contain alcohol, but this can dry out your skin. Look for an alcohol-free toner, especially if your skin tends to flake.Natural toners tend to work just as well as store-bought toners. Try a mixture of half lemon juice, half water for a great homemade option. Aloe, witch hazel and rose water also work well.

, Choose a moisturizer formulated for facial skin and smooth a dime-sized amount over your face. Moisturizer helps to protect your skin from the elements, keeping it youthful and bright.









If you wash your face just before bed, try a heavier moisturizer meant to help your skin renew overnight.
If you’re heading outside, use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher to protect your face from the sun’s rays.

Wash your skin twice a day.,
Use a cleanser formulated for acne-prone skin.,
Do not scrub your face.,
Avoid using hot water.,
Pat your face dry gently.,
Finish with oil-free moisturizer.",How to Wash Your Face2," Washing once in the morning and once at night is a good routine for those with acne-prone skin. Washing in the morning refreshes your face and cleanses away bacteria that may have grown in the night, while washing at night is important for removing sweat, dirt and makeup from your skin. Washing your face more than twice a day could dry out and irritate your skin.









Many people with acne think that washing more often will result in better skin, but that’s not the case. Facial skin is fragile, and washing too much can cause it to tear and weaken.If you feel your skin needs to be refreshed between washes, it’s better to splash it with plain lukewarm water instead of using soap or chemicals.

, Regular commercial facial cleansers often contain ingredients that make acne worse. Chemicals, alcohols, and oils can irritate your skin or cause your pores to get clogged, which is the opposite of what you want if you’re dealing with acne. Choose a cleanser that is specifically designed to be used on acne-prone skin.








Not all acne-prone skin is oily; many people with dry skin have acne. Make sure you choose a facial cleanser that works with your skin type and won’t dry it out too much.
If your acne is severe, you may want to use a medicated cleanser with ingredients that will kill the bacteria that can clog pores and cause acne. Talk with your doctor about getting a prescription, or look for an over-the-counter cleanser with salicylic acid, sodium sulfacetamide, or benzoyl peroxide., Many people with acne make the mistake of scrubbing hard in an effort to unclog pores. This method creates tiny tears in the skin that can become inflamed and create worse acne problems. When you have acne, it’s important to handle your skin gently. Exfoliate very lightly, and never roughly scrub your skin.








Instead of using a facial scrub, try using a soft washcloth to rub your skin in a circular motion.
Never use a scrub brush on your acne-prone skin.

, Hot water can cause facial skin to become red and inflamed, so err on the side of using cooler water when you’re washing your face. You may also want to avoid facial steams during acne flare-ups, since the heat can make the problem worse.








, With acne, it’s important not to abrade your skin by using a rough towel to dry it off. Purchase a soft facial towel and use it to pat your skin dry after washing. Be sure to wash your towels frequently so you aren’t applying bacteria to your face when you dry it off.








, If you tend to have acne, your pores probably clog easily. Many have found it helpful to use an oil-free moisturizer to protect acne-prone skin. If you do choose to use a moisturizer with oil, you may want to test it on a small patch of skin and wait a few days to see what happens before applying it to you entire face.









Aloe is soothing to irritated skin and makes a great light, oil-free moisturizer.
If your skin is particularly oily, feel free to forego moisturizer completely, or just apply it to the spots where your skin gets dry.

Wash once a day.,
Use light soap or oil as your cleanser.,
Exfoliate often to get rid of dead skin.,
Rinse with cool or warm water.,
Pat your face dry with a soft towel.,
Finish with a rich moisturizer.",How to Wash Your Face3," If your skin is quite dry, washing your face more than once a day will just dry it out even more. It’s important to wash your skin at night to remove makeup, dirt, and sweat from your skin before you go to bed. In the morning, just refresh your face with a splash of lukewarm water or a damp washcloth instead of going through your full cleansing routine. Always finish with moisturizer to keep your skin from flaking.







, Dry skin just gets drier when you wash it, so it’s important to choose your cleanser carefully. Look for a very light cleanser formulated for dry skin, or try using oil as your cleanser.









To use oil, simply wet your face and apply your oil of choice (almond, olive, jojoba, coconut, etc.). Use a washcloth to rub your face in a circular motion, then rinse away the oil with warm water.
If you want to use a store-bought cleanser, look for one that does not contain sodium laurel or laureth sulfate. Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents that will dry out your skin even more.

, If your skin is dry to the point of flaking, you might need to exfoliate more than once or twice a week. Try exfoliating every other day by rubbing a soft washcloth over the dry spots using a circular motion. The key is to exfoliate without drying out your skin further or causing it to get irritated.









If your skin is extremely dry, you can exfoliate using oil. Dip a corner of a soft towel or cotton pad into coconut oil (or another rich oil of your choice). Rub the oil into your face using a circular motion. This will exfoliate your skin while nourishing it at the same time.
Don’t use a loofah, a scrub brush or any other abrasive material on your skin. Dry skin is more prone to tearing and wrinkling than normal or oily skin, so it’s important to handle it gently.

, Hot water will cause dry skin to get even drier, so use cool or lukewarm water for rinsing. Using too much water is another way to dry out your skin, so just use a splash or two. You can also control the amount of water you use by wiping your face with a moist towel instead of splashing it with water.








, Use a soft, fluffy towel to wick the moisture from your skin without pulling it back and forth. Patting it dry will keep your skin from getting inflamed or flaking.








, Choose a moisturizer intended for dry facial skin to keep your skin looking fresh and hydrated. Natural or handmade moisturizers are often best for dry skin, since they don’t contain chemicals that can cause irritation and dryness.








Look for a moisturizer that contains shea butter, coco butter, or another rich, emollient ingredient that will protect your skin from drying out.
If your skin tends to flake a few hours after washing it, try applying a dab of coconut oil or aloe to refresh your skin.

Choose a natural form of vitamin E oil.,
Test the oil on your skin before using.,
Use a small amount.,
Consider taking a vitamin E supplement to promote hair growth.,
Consider adding vitamin C. Vitamins E and C go well together because, in tandem, they are more effective at protecting hair and skin from damaging ultraviolet radiation.,
Apply vitamin E oil like conditioner.,
Use your fingertips to massage the oil into your scalp.,
Wrap your head in a warm, moist cotton towel.,
Rinse out the vitamin E oil.,
Treat split ends with vitamin E oil.",How to Use Vitamin E Oil for Hair," Your body can more easily absorb and utilize natural forms of vitamin E. The synthetic version of vitamin E is called tocopherol acetate. This form may react with some beauty products, so it is best to choose a natural form of vitamin E oil, which you can find in a health food store, the vitamin aisle of a well-stocked grocery store, or online. Some food grade oils contain vitamin E as well, such as wheat germ oil, sunflower oil, and almond oil., Some people are sensitive to vitamin E oil, so it is a good idea to test a little on your skin before using it on your hair. You can also develop a sensitivity to vitamin E oil over time, so pay attention to how the skin on your scalp looks and feels after a few days of using vitamin E oil.


To test the oil, apply 1-2 drops to the inside of your wrist and then massage it in. Wait 24 hours and then check your wrist to see how it looks. If there is any redness, dryness, itching or swelling, do not use the oil. If the area looks and feels normal, then you can use the oil.

, Oil goes a long way, so it is not necessary to use much. Start with a quarter sized amount and then add a little more if necessary. You may need more or less depending on the length and thickness of your hair.

, Vitamin E has been shown to be effective at promoting hair growth when taken as an oral supplement. Try taking two 50 mg capsules of vitamin E oil daily after eating a meal.For example, you could take one capsule after breakfast and the other one after dinner.


As with any supplement, make sure that you check with your doctor first.
Incorporate additional natural sources of vitamin E into your diet, too. Try nuts, seeds, green leafy vegetables, and plant oils, especially wheat germ and sunflower seed oil.

, If you're taking topical vitamin E, you should take topical vitamin C. Similarly, if you take oral vitamin E, you should take oral vitamin C. These two will be more effective than either on their own., You can use Vitamin E oil in place of your daily conditioner to keep your hair soft and manageable. Shampoo your hair and rinse well, then wring out the excess water from your hair. Then, pour a quarter sized amount of Vitamin E oil into the palm of your hand. The oil is typically thick and greasy.


Instead of using it as conditioner, you can also apply it at night instead of a night cream or moisturizer.

, You can apply the oil directly to your scalp and begin working it into the roots of your hair with your fingertips. Use gentle circular motions to work the vitamin E oil into your scalp.


Vitamin E can be absorbed through your skin and it may even be a more effective means of delivering the vitamin into your cells., If you want to give yourself a deep conditioning treatment, then you can wrap a warm moist, cotton towel around your head and leave it on for up to an hour.The heat will help to increase the absorption of vitamin E into your hair and scalp.


To make a towel warm and moist, fill your sink or a large bowl with hot water and dip the towel into it. Then wring out the excess water and wrap the towel around your head.

, When you are ready, remove the towel from your head (if using). Then, rinse the vitamin E oil out of your hair with warm water. Dry your hair and style as usual.

, You can also use vitamin E oil as a spot treatment for split ends. To use vitamin E oil to repair split ends, pour out a quarter sized amount of vitamin E oil into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together then take the ends of your hair between your hands, working the vitamin E oil into the ends. Leave the oil on your hair and style as usual.


You can use this treatment on wet or dry hair.
Vitamin E is a potent moisturizer that may help bind water to skin.For this reason, it may help to repair split ends. If vitamin E does not seem to help, then getting a trim is a good way to reduce split ends.

Try a traditional Indian beauty mask.,
Address skin inflammation with turmeric paste.,
Try the endless array of turmeric skin recipes.,
Buy turmeric skincare products.",How to Use Turmeric for Skincare1," Since turmeric has been used as a skincare product for so long by so many people, it should be no surprise that there are countless recipes out there. The following is a simple, basic, general use facial paste that may be a good choice if you’re new to turmeric skincare:








Add a few tablespoons of turmeric powder to a bowl (start with a smaller amount and mix up more if you need it).
Add a bit of honey and enough full-fat yogurt or milk to create a smooth paste when stirred. Make it thin enough to apply to your skin easily but thick enough that it will stay in place.
Use it as a 20-minute face mask or for topical application on problem areas, which can range from chapping to acne to age spots.;
, If you’re trying to retain or restore your face’s youthful luster, try one of the many turmeric pastes that claim to give your skin some extra glow. The following is a simple example:


In a bowl, mix 2 Tbsp chickpea flour (besan flour), ¼ tsp turmeric powder, 2 tsp raw honey, and enough yogurt, coconut milk, or water to form a smooth but dense paste.
Apply it to your clean face with your clean fingers. Let it dry for 10-15 minutes.
Wipe and rinse your face clean and pat dry. Apply moisturizer if desired.

, Turmeric has long been a staple of both cuisine and skincare in India. To this day, many Indian brides swear by a turmeric beauty mask in the days leading up to the marriage ceremony. The following recipe draws from common beauty mask recipes:Mix 2 tsp of sandalwood powder, 2 tsp of turmeric powder, and one-half cup of chickpea flour (besan flour) in a bowl.
Stir in a small amount of almond oil and/or ghee (clarified butter) and enough water to make a smooth, rich paste.
Apply this facemask, leave it on until it dries, and then wipe and rinse it away completely.

, Turmeric skincare advocates have long championed its supposed anti-inflammatory properties, and modern science has started to uncover shreds of evidence that this may possibly be true.Try the following simple recipe as a face mask or for topical applications:








Mix 1 Tbsp of full-fat yogurt, 1 tsp of turmeric powder, and 1 tsp of raw honey in a bowl. Mix it until a smooth paste forms.
Apply it as a facial or use it topically on inflamed areas of the skin.

, Use your favorite browser to search for “turmeric face masks” or “turmeric skin care” in order to reveal a seemingly limitless number of recipes. Some of them combine turmeric with oatmeal, another food product renowned for its skincare benefits, or other common facemask ingredients like lemon juice, aloe, and rose water.You are very unlikely to see any negative effects from trying a turmeric skincare recipe. However, if you do develop any type of irritation, rash, discomfort, etc., remove the product immediately and discontinue its use. In this case, or in an abundance of caution otherwise, talk to your doctor or dermatologist first., If you have some turmeric powder, honey, and milk or yogurt in your home, you can easily make your own simple turmeric face mask. However, if you don’t want to mix up your own concoction, don’t have easy access to turmeric powder, or simply prefer commercial skincare products, you’ll have your choice from a wide range of products that contain turmeric.You can buy turmeric-infused serums, masks, cleansers, and so on; but be prepared to spend at least $25 for a bottle.

Prepare your skin.,
Relax and enjoy the process.,
Remove the paste and rinse and dry your face thoroughly.,
Watch for turmeric staining.",How to Use Turmeric for Skincare2," To maximize the absorption and impact of a turmeric-based facial paste, you should first thoroughly (but gently) clean your skin and open your pores. And honestly, what better way is there to begin a relaxing facial than with a nice, warm bath?Take a warm bath or shower to open up your pores. While doing so, cleanse your face and body with a gentle soap that removes dirt and impurities without overly drying or irritating your skin. Rinse away the soap completely with clean, warm water, and dry your skin thoroughly but gently with a soft, clean towel.

, Turmeric facials aren’t meant to be a quick, on-the-go treatment. Wait until you have some time to sit back, relax, and enjoy the process without rushing it. Once you’ve applied your turmeric concoction of choice, recline in a comfy bed, chair, or other nice spot where you can wait 20 minutes or more for the paste to dry.








Place cucumber slices or steeped and cooled chamomile tea bags on you eyes to enhance the relaxation quotient.
Use towels to protect your chosen reclining spot, and any clothes you are wearing. Turmeric facial pastes will stain fabrics.

, Although most turmeric facials should be allowed to dry thoroughly on your skin, they can usually be removed fairly easily with a clean cloth, warm water, and gentle but thorough wiping, dabbing, and rubbing. Once again, don’t rush things. Meticulously and calmly wipe away the paste.








You can use moistened cotton balls or swabs to remove the dried paste from creases and crevices. Once the paste is completely removed, rinse your face with warm water, splash it with cool water, and pat it dry with a clean towel.

, The vibrant golden color of turmeric powder lends credence to warnings that pastes that include it can cause yellowish discolorations of your skin. These concerns tend to be overblown, however. If a turmeric facial does cause a yellowing of your skin, it should only be temporary and should wear or wash away without much trouble.If you are getting married or have a big interview the next day, have fair skin, or are simply concerned about possible discoloration, test your paste on a less conspicuous area of your flesh first (akin to testing cleaners on fabrics). If there is staining, see how much time and effort it takes to remove it. You might also want to consider reducing the amount of turmeric in your recipe, if necessary.
Turmeric pastes can, however, cause hard-to-remove stains on clothing, furniture fabrics, carpets, and so on. When mixing, applying, and removing a turmeric facial, use plenty of towels (that are okay to get stained) to protect clothing and fabrics.

Consume turmeric-infused foods and beverages.,
Look into turmeric supplements.,
Accept the limited science behind turmeric benefits.",How to Use Turmeric for Skincare3," Can eating or drinking turmeric improve your skin? As with topical applications, there is scant hard evidence that would support such claims. But, turmeric is unlikely to do any harm and can add quite an appealing zing to a wide range of recipes.


From the countless curry recipes that include turmeric, to turmeric teas and “golden milk,” to turmeric powder sprinkled into soups or scrambled eggs, you really have limitless options for increasing your daily intake through food and drink.
See Include Turmeric in Your Diet for some great ideas, tips, and recipes.

, Turmeric can also be taken directly as a dietary supplement, in powdered, capsule, or other forms. People take turmeric supplements in hope that it will help prevent conditions ranging from Alzheimer’s to cancer and beyond, although, again, such evidence is sketchy at best. But, so long as you stick within recommended dosage ranges (for instance, in powdered form, 400-600 mg three times daily), it is unlikely to cause negative effects.However, if you have high blood pressure, take stomach acid reducing medicines, have gallstones, have diabetes, are pregnant or nursing, take blood thinners, or are going to undergo surgery, consult a doctor first. In reality, it is best practice to consult with your physician regarding all supplements you take.
Check out Take Turmeric Powder for more insights on turmeric supplements and restrictions.

, Beyond the wide-ranging medical benefits claimed for turmeric, advocates for this golden powder say it will help skin and beauty conditions ranging from oil skin to dry skin, excess hair to hair loss, and color, elasticity, blemishes, “glow,” and on and on.Can it do all or any of these things? Maybe. Will it work for you? Maybe.


You simply have to accept that there are a lot of “mays” involved when talking about using turmeric for skincare. For instance, it may have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. There simply have not been many detailed scientific studies done to support or reject turmeric health claims. The bottom line seems to be this: turmeric is unlikely to hurt you; and it may help you, but is at least as likely to do nothing."

Use the oil cleansing method.,
Remove makeup.,
Exfoliate.,
Treat acne.",How to Use Olive Oil on Your Face2," While it may seem counterintuitive, olive oil is a great way to clean your skin.

Lemon juice helps treat acne because it is a disinfectant, which can destroy the bacteria that cause breakouts.Olive oil can also be mixed with aloe vera water to provide extra hydration and to soothe irritated skin while removing makeup.Because it is less abrasive than chemically based makeup removers, olive oil is the preferred makeup remover for people with sensitive skin or who are allergic to ingredients in store-bought removers., Mix olive oil with sea salt or sugar to create a natural exfoliant.Mix about a tablespoon of olive oil with ½ teaspoon of salt or sugar, apply to your face, and then rinse with warm water.Sugar is less abrasive than salt, so use sugar if you have sensitive skin. Brown sugar is even softer than white granulated sugar, so it is best for really sensitive skin., Olive oil has several properties that make it an effective treatment for acne.

Spread over your face and leave on for 20 minutes to moisturize., Olive oil can enhance your skin’s elasticity, which reduces wrinkles.Dab the skin around your eyes with olive oil before bed or first thing in the morning.

To find out if jojoba oil will irritate your skin, try jojoba oil on a small, clear area of your cheek. Do this for three days and then stop using the jojoba oil for a week. After one week, check the area to see if there are any new blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If your skin is clear, you can try using the jojoba for longer periods.;

Thyme boosts the immune system and has antibacterial properties. It also increases circulation of the blood by opening up blood vessels.
Calendula accelerates healing and has antimicrobial properties.
Lavender is soothing and can help with anxiety and depression. It also has antibacterial properties.

, Before using essential oils, always pre-test an area of skin with the oil. Since these herbs are plant-derived, and since people can have allergies and sensitivities to plants, you can have a reaction to the essential oil. The reaction is often a mild rash that may or may not be itchy.


To test the oil on your skin, place a single drop of the oil on your wrist and wait for 10-15 minutes. If there is no irritation, you should be able to use the oil.

, Heat the water until it reaches a boiling temperature. Then, turn off the heat and add 1-2 drops of any of essential oils to the hot water. Never put your face over a pot of boiling water!, After you have added the oils to the water, then cover your head with a towel and place your face over the steaming pot.

Rinse your face with lukewarm water and pat dry with a cotton towel. Don’t rub your skin, just gently pat it dry.

, Use as much as necessary to cover your skin. Work the oil into your skin using your fingertips and small, circular motions.

Drink at least two to three cups of green tea daily.Green tea is a rich source of antioxidants, which neutralize skin-damaging free radicals.,
Brew green tea with water that is near-boiling temperature.,
Be aware of caffeine levels.,
Consider taking green tea extract supplements.",How to Use Green Tea for Skincare1," Because of this, regular consumption of green tea can slow down the signs and symptoms of aging skin.Drinking as little as two to three cups each day can have positive effects. Green tea can be purchased in ready-to-use tea bags or you can buy loose green tea leaves from specialty shops and health markets.

Buy the freshest and highest quality green tea you can. Look for tea that comes in sealed, foil-lined packages.
If you're buying tea from a specialty shop, ask the seller for tea that is less than a year old.;
, Put water on to boil. When it reaches the boiling point, remove the water from heat. Wait until the bubbles created by boiling have completely disappeared before adding the tea. Use one tea bag or one to two teaspoons of loose green tea leaves in tea strainer for each 8 oz. (237 mL) serving. Let the tea steep for five minutes.

Allowing it to steep for longer than five minutes will not increase the antioxidants present in your cup of tea.It will, unfortunately, make it taste increasingly bitter.
Pour the tea over ice if you prefer a cold beverage.

, Although green tea contains a lot less caffeine than coffee or black tea, it still has some. One 8 oz. (237 mL) serving of green tea contains 24 to 45 mg of caffeine. That same amount of regular coffee contains 95 to 200 mg of caffeine. Healthy adults should avoid getting more than 500 mg of caffeine in a 24 hour period. It’s recommended that adolescents get no more than 100 mg of caffeine per day.Keep track of how much caffeine you’re taking in, especially if you intend to drink green tea frequently throughout the day.
Try to drink it early in the day so that it the caffeine won’t affect your sleep that evening.
If you’re sensitive to caffeine or would prefer to avoid it, drink decaffeinated green tea instead. Keep in mind that the decaffeination process makes the antioxidants in the tea less potent., Some green teas can taste quite bitter and not everyone enjoys its taste. If you are having difficulties adjusting to the taste of green tea, consider taking supplements of green tea extract. These can be obtained in most health and vitamin stores.

Supplements aren’t as potent as the tea itself, but they may still provide some benefits.

, The green tea itself doesn’t block UV rays, but because it neutralizes free radicals and reduces inflammation, it works hand-in-hand with sunscreen to enhance sun protection.

Apply the green tea formula before applying sunscreen.
Use a sunscreen that is zinc oxide-based to avoid chemical reactions between the two substances.

, Because the benefits of green tea are so well-documented, green tea has become a very popular ingredient in a variety of skin-care products. Face masks, scrubs, packs, eye compresses and bath soaks are all popular green tea products that may provide skin benefits.

Consuming green tea and applying the fresh, organic leaves topically are the most effective ways to use green tea for skin-care, but commercially available products are worth exploring.
If you find a product that seems to really work for you, incorporate it into your green tea skin-care routine, along with drinking it and using the leaves topically.

The mud minimizes pores and is said to reduce wrinkles!Use 2-4 drops of the myrrh oil and 2 drops of the frankincense oil. The rose otto oil is optional. Mix the concoction together with a spoon.

, It’s important to moisturize your eyes before applying the Dead Sea mask. That’s because the skin around your eyes is thinner and more delicate.


Take a couple drops of a natural oil like coconut or olive oil, and apply it gently to the skin around your eyes. Be careful not to get it in your eyes.
You will naturally apply the oil more gently if you use your ring fingers when touching the area around your eyes.
Take care not to press too hard on the eye area as it’s sensitive. The oil will also protect your eyes when the mask is applied. Also avoid getting the mud around or in your eyes but also avoid areas of the face that you regularly wax.

, Dead Sea mud can be purchased in a jar. It’s not a dry, powder-like beauty clay. Rather, it’s a moist and fairly thick clay-like mud. It also comes in powder form; add water and mix in that case.


The mud doesn’t spoil because of the germicide that’s added to it.Start by applying the mud to your face using your fingers. Remember to apply it in a thin layer.Use small circular movements to apply the mud mask to your face. Be very careful to avoid getting it in the area of your eyes. Try not to get the mud in your hair. Use upward motions to apply the mud.
Skipping the eye area, apply the mud thinly and uniformly throughout your entire face, including underneath your chin. If you have a breakout on any area of your skin, also skip that part.

, This should take about 12-15 minutes. If the mud takes a lot longer to dry, then you’ve probably lathered it on too thick. It’s best to sit up while it dries, but if you do lie down, rest your head on a towel.


The mud should remove impurities from your skin, detoxify it, and cleanse it. Your skin should feel softer and more elastic after the mud has been applied and then removed. It should look brighter.
Remove the mask right away if your skin starts to itch at any point. Some people have had allergic reactions to Dead Sea mud. The mud will tighten pores, remove excess skin oil, and the salt in it should get rid of any surface bacteria which lowers the number of breakouts you could get.
It’s natural for your skin to feel a little tingly as the mask starts to dry. Don’t worry about it unless you feel a stronger burning sensation.

, Once the mud has dried, it’s time to remove it from your skin. This shouldn’t be very difficult to do.


Use warm water to rinse the mud from your skin like you would any other mask. It may take some time rinsing the face to remove all the mud.
Try using a clean washcloth to help you wipe the mud off your face. Dry your face by patting it down with a towel or other clean cloth.
Apply a moisturizer to your face. Coconut oil is a great natural moisturizer, but any moisturizer you regularly use would do. Use the Dead Sea mask weekly.
You can buy Dead Sea mud through some specialty beauty stores and through many online sites. The Egyptians used balms made from the water of the Dead Sea for their mummification process; today you can also find Dead Sea products in the most exclusive spas around the world. However, it's no more expensive than most designer skin lotions if you purchase it online.

, Dead Sea mud isn’t only used to make your face softer; you can also use it to reduce joint and muscle pain. Dead Sea mud has 26 minerals in it! Mix ¼ cup of the mud with 5 drops of lavender essential oil, 2 drops of rosemary essential oil, and 1 drop of peppermint essential oil. In this case, heat the mud by putting the mud over a pan of steaming water. You want it to be a little bit higher than body temperature.
Smear the warmed up mud on any muscles or joints that are hurting. Massage the mud into the areas, let the mask dry, and then wash it off with warm water just as you would your face.
Apply the mud to your knees, elbows or other joints that are afflicted with osteoarthritis. This mineral-rich mud pack has been proven by researchers at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel to reduce inflammation in the joints.

, The mineral-rich mud has many purposes. One of them is to increase the health of your hair.


The mud will also reduce the chances that you will have dandruff, and it’s going to increase the shine in your hair.
Start by massaging the mud into your scalp. Work it throughout all of your hair.
Let the mask remain in your hair for about 20 minutes so that your hair gains the fuller benefit of the many minerals in the mask.
Rinse your hair thoroughly with water as you would rinse out shampoo. It may take a few attempts before you fully remove the mud from your hair.

, The Dead Sea mud will do more than increase your skin's softness; it also can be used to help people with more serious skin issues.


People who suffer with dermatological conditions such as eczema and psoriasis find that the application of Dead Sea mud to afflicted areas not only reduces swelling, but it takes the heat out of inflammations.The Dead Sea mud also vastly reduces the itching, making it an effective holistic treatment to these ailments.Apply the Dead Sea mud like you would apply it for facial beauty purposes. Some people also believe the minerals in the mud can help cancer patients and those undergoing chemotherapy, but this is not proven. Check with your doctor first."

Ask a doctor if you are pregnant, under the age of ten, or have a serious medical condition.,
Select a carrier oil.,
Mix the essential oil into the carrier oil.,
Know your safety procedures.,
Perform a patch test (recommended).,
Cleanse your skin (optional).,
Rub on the oil sparingly.,
Keep the oil away from orifices.,
Repeat as needed.,
Add aroma to your bathtub.,
Clear up stuffy noses.,
Use certain oils as insect repellent.",How to Use Essential Oils on Your Skin," Many essential oils are potentially dangerous to children or fetuses. They can also cause harm to people with a heart, kidney, autoimmune, or lung condition (including asthma), or people at risk of thrombosis.Talk to a doctor to find out more about your situation and how it relates to specific essential oils.



Infused oils are much less concentrated than essential oils. They are typically safe in these situations, though looking up the specific herb or plant is recommended.;
, Essential oils are highly concentrated. When applied directly to skin, they can cause rashes, difficulty breathing, or even anaphylactic shock. Instead, pick a safe carrier oil to dilute the effect. You may use any vegetable oil as a carrier oil, though you may find some more pleasant on your skin than others.


Sweet almond oil, avocado oil, and grapeseed oil are popular options. Olive oil also works well, but some people dislike the smell or thick texture.
You can use a cream as a carrier oil. A basic moisturizing cold cream is best, without too many additives.

, Your bottle of essential oil may come with instructions that recommend a certain dilution. When in doubt, go with a 2% dilution, which works out to about 12 drops of essential oil in 30 mL of carrier oil.


If the person using the oil is a child or elderly person, make a 1% dilution instead (6 drops in 30 mL carrier oil)., Essential oils are much safer when diluted. There are still a few safety instructions to learn before you apply them:If you feel any itching or pain, wipe the oil off with a carrier oil or butter, not water.
Some citrus essential oils can cause sun sensitivity. Avoid direct sunlight and tanning beds while wearing them, or you could get a painful rash.
Essential oils are flammable. Do not use them near naked flames.
Some essential oils are toxic to pets (for example, tea tree oil is toxic to cats). Let the oil on your hands dry completely before touching an animal.

, If you haven't used a particular essential oil before, a patch test will tell you whether or not your skin is too sensitive for that oil. Place one or two drops of the diluted oil on the inside of your wrist. If you are sensitive to that oil, your skin will usually turn red, itchy, or painful within a couple hours, though some aromatherapists and allergists recommend testing for 24 hours.If you notice one of these symptoms, wipe the area with a carrier oil and avoid that type of oil.


Other symptoms are much rarer, but require immediate treatment. Any changes in heart rate, breathing, or the mouth or throat require immediate use of an EpiPen or a visit to the hospital.
Once you know you are not sensitive, you do not need to repeat the patch test each time. You can develop allergies over time, however, so a new patch test may be a good idea if you haven't used that oil recently.

, Washing your skin opens up your pores and leaves you feeling fresh. Many people enjoy using essential oil after their morning or evening wash for this reason.


Moisturiser is not necessary when applying essential oils, but you may apply it sparingly if desired.

, Put a small amount of the diluted oil on your fingers and rub it gently over the area you want to treat. Any oil treatment works well to treat dry skin, and the smell of an essential oil can boost your mood. While other uses are not always well-studied, many people use essential oils to treat acne and muscle pain.


There are dozens of common essential oils, each with different smell and sometimes a different effect on your body. If you don't enjoy one, you may prefer one made with plants from a different family. Remember to repeat the patch test for each new type.

, Never put essential oil next to your eyes, nose or mouth. Careful application elsewhere on your face can work, but start with a small dab to see if it causes your eyes to sting or water.

, It's best to use the essential oil only when needed, to reduce the chance of causing irritation. Try putting on essential oil about three times a week. Increase the frequency only if your skin remains dry and you don't notice any rashes or itchiness.

, Lavender and other calming scents feel wonderful in a hot bath. After the bath is filled, drop about three to four drops of the essential oil into the water and mix it in.


If you have sensitive skin, mix the drops with a little shampoo or a carrier oil first before adding it.

, Eucalyptus and mint essential oils are common treatments for stuffy noses and other symptoms of flu and cold. Wave the open bottle under your nose for a minute; there's no need to inhale. You may also dilute the oil to 1 or 2% with a carrier oil and place a small dab above your upper lip, avoiding the nostrils.


There is not enough scientific evidence to state whether this is effective treatment., There's some evidence that certain essential oils, notably eucalyptus oil, can repel ticks or other insects.This is usually less effective than the strongest commercial product, but may be less toxic as well.

",How to Use Argan Oil for Acne2," After one to two weeks of using argan oil, your skin may show some improvement. If not, then make an appointment with a dermatologist to get some help treating your acne and recommendations on the types of skin products you should use.


If your acne is moderate to severe, then check with a dermatologist before trying argan oil.

, Argan oil is a good source of vitamin E, which is essential for good skin health. You can take argan oil as an oral supplement, but be sure to check with your dermatologist first. High doses of vitamin E have been linked to serious health risks such as increased bleeding while also taking blood thinners., Water can help your body to flush out toxins and it also improves blood flow to your skin, which is why it may also help with acne.Make sure that you drink eight 8 oz (~236ml) glasses of water per day to stay well hydrated. You may even need to drink more if you have an active lifestyle.


Check with your doctor for a specific recommendation on how much water you should drink per day.

, High-glycemic index foods such as products with white flour, baked goods, candy, and other junk foods can increase the amount of insulin in your blood. This insulin spike may cause your pores to get clogged. High-glycemic index foods can also make your skin produce more oil.

pumpernickel bread, whole wheat bread, and other whole grain breads
most non-starchy vegetables
nuts
most fruits except melons and pineapple
beans, peas, and lentils
whole grain pasta

Try to incorporate some foods that are high in Vitamin A, such as sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots, broccoli, red peppers, cantaloupe, mangoes, apricots, and salmon.Choose some foods that are high in Vitamin D such as cod liver oil, tuna, milk, yogurt, and cheese.Select foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, sardines, mackerel, basil, oregano, and marjoram., Adequate rest is essential to reducing stress. Since some people experience more breakouts when they are stressed, getting enough rest is essential to keep acne under control.Try to get eight hours of sleep per night to stay well rested.

Keep in mind that some people may require more or less sleep per night. For example, some people function well on six hours of sleep per night, while others require nine hours to feel rested.

Add 1 tablespoon (21 g) of organic honey, and use your fingers to carefully combine the two to form a paste.Honey has antifungal and antibacterial properties that make it an ideal ingredient in a facial scrub for acne-prone skin.
Honey has moisturizing properties too, so the scrub also works well for normal to dry skin.
If you don’t have any honey, you can substitute 1 ½ teaspoons (7.5 ml) of water.;
, When you’ve combined the baking soda and honey, use your fingers to carefully massage the mixture onto your face. Rub the scrub into your skin in a circular motion to help loosen the dead skin. Allow the mixture to sit on your skin for 1 minute.Don’t rub the scrub too roughly over your skin, or you may cause irritation and redness.

Get aloe vera.,
Test a small amount of the aloe vera on your skin.,
Use aloe vera for spot treatment.,
Use aloe vera to create a facial mask.,
Continue treatments for several weeks.,
Wash your face at least twice a day.,
Use a gentle, plant-oil based product to clean yourself.,
Use your fingertips to apply cleansers.,
Treat broken-out skin gently.,
Stay out of the sun and don’t use tanning beds.,
Do not scrub the skin roughly.,
Avoid eating unhealthy foods.,
Eat a healthy diet.",How to Use Aloe Vera for Acne," You can either buy an aloe vera plant or you can buy pre-made aloe vera gel. An aloe vera plant should be available at your local plant store and pre-made aloe vera gel is available at most pharmacies and grocery stores.


To extract the gel from the leaf you will need to cut a good sized leaf from the aloe vera plant. It should be about 5 – 6 inches long. Wash the leaf well in water and, using a knife, cut it in half lengthwise. Use a spoon or a knife to scoop out as much gel as possible.;
, You should always try a small amount of gel from the plant or a commercial product on a small area before applying all over. You need to make sure you don’t have an allergy or sensitivity to the plant. It is in the same botanical family as lilies, onions and garlic, so if you react to those plants, you will likely react to aloe.Either way, try the gel on your wrist, allow it to dry, and then rinse it off. If there is no reddening, itchiness or swelling, you can try it on your face.

, Take 2 teaspoons of aloe vera gel and add two to three drops of lemon juice. The lemon juice helps maintain the pH of the skin. Mix well.


Use a Q-tip to apply the mixture directly on the acne. Let this stay on your face for at least 20 – 30 minutes or overnight.
Rinse off with lukewarm water and cleanse as usual.
Repeat daily.

, Cut one to two leaves about 6 inches from an aloe plant and trim off the spikes along the sides of the leaf. Cut the leaves open and scoop out the gel.


Add 1 teaspoon of honey (honey has additional antibacterial properties) or five to seven drops of lemon juice to the aloe vera gel.Mix any additives into the gel thoroughly.
Apply the gel all over your face or use a Q-tip to apply the mixture directly on the acne.
If you can, leave the gel on overnight, but for at least 20 – 30 minutes.
Rinse off with lukewarm water and cleanse as usual.
Repeat daily.

, It may take some time for the healing effects of the aloe vera to help your condition. If these treatments don’t improve your acne in three to four weeks, make an appointment with a dermatologist to determine what your best course of action is.

, Wash your face once in the morning and once before bed. If you sweat during the day, such as during exercise or from being out in hot weather, wash your face as soon as possible to remove the perspiration., Look for a cleanser labeled as “non-comedogenic” This means that the product does not promote the formation of comedones, blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples.Examples include products from Neutrogena, Cetaphil and Olay. There are many store-brand products that are non-comedogenic. Read the label to be certain.
There are oils that are used to clean the skin and many of these utilize very non-comedogenic oils. Using these is based on the principle that “like dissolves like.” In other words, oils can be used to dissolve and remove excess skin oils.
Also use alcohol-free products. Alcohol dries and damages the skin.

, You want to be very gentle when cleaning your skin. Using a washcloth or sponge can irritate the skin and cause more problems., Do not pick, pop, squeeze, or touch acne. This can also cause flare-ups, cause scarring, and will cause a longer healing time., Sun (and tanning beds) can damage your skin cells because of damaging UVB radiation. If you are using certain acne medications or certain other types of medication, you should know that some medications can make your skin even more sensitive to the sun.These drugs include antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl); drugs used to treat cancer (5-FU, vinblastine, dacarbazine); heart drugs like amiodarone, nifedipine, quinidine and diltiazem; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen, and the acne medications isotretinoin (Accutane) and acitretin (Soriatane).

, This can cause permanent scarring and the skin will take longer to heal. Exfoliation is popular, but vigorous exfoliation often does more harm than good.Exfoliation can cause micro-scarring (tiny scars that can’t be seen without some sort of magnification), obvious scarring and it can often make acne worse.The “scrubs” which perform the exfoliation may also be pulling off skin that is not yet ready to fall off. It is a bit like pulling off a scab that isn’t ready to fall off on its own.

, While diet doesn’t directly cause acne, despite the stories you may have heard about milk and chocolate, for some people certain foods increase the risk for acne. Some foods, including dairy products and diets high in processed sugars, can increase inflammation and provide an environment in which acne can flourish.


Specifically, high-glycemic index foods, which are carbohydrate-rich foods, are linked to acne., This will help you ensure that you are getting the appropriate nutrients to keep your skin healthy. The vitamins that appear to be most important for the skin are vitamins A and D. In addition, consuming enough omega-3 fats can benefit those with acne.Try to make at least half of your plate is made up of vegetables, particularly at dinner.Foods high in Vitamin A include: sweet potato, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, romaine, kale, red peppers, summer squash, cantaloupe, mangoes, apricots, black-eyed peas, beef liver, herring, and salmon.
Foods high in Vitamin D include: cod liver oil, salmon, tuna, milk, yogurt, and cheese. Many foods are fortified with vitamin D, but the single best way to get Vitamin D is to expose your skin to the sun 10-15 minutes a week, as sunlight triggers Vitamin D production by the skin.Food high in omega-3 fatty acids include: flax seeds and flaxseed oil, soybean oil, canola oil, chia seeds, butternuts, walnuts, salmon, sardines, mackerel, whitefish, shad, basil, oregano, cloves, marjoram, spinach, sprouted radish seeds, Chinese broccoli and small amounts of meats and eggs.

Try out a different scrub if you are unhappy with your first attempt.",How to Use a Facial Scrub," Not everyone should exfoliate their skin using a facial scrub. For example, persons with rosacea, warts, inflammatory acne, or herpes might find their conditions exacerbated by exfoliating scrubs. If you have a history of skin problems, you should consult your dermatologist to determine what kind of skin care regime is most appropriate for you. , Different kinds of skin will react differently to facial scrubs and other products, and some facial scrubs are designed for your particular skin type. Perhaps you already know whether you have normal, dry, oily, or combination skin. If not, you might want to determine your skin type using a tissue test.


Wash your face to ensure that there are no products or cosmetics remaining on your skin.
Allow your face to air-dry and wait at least one hour.
Dab a tissue to your forehead, nose, chin, cheeks, and temples.
If the tissue sticks, that is an indication that the skin is oily. If the tissue does not stick, that is an indication that the skin is dry. If your t-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) are oily but the rest of your face is dry, that is an indicator of combination skin.
Your skin might also be more or less sensitive to skin care products. Usually people with sensitive skin have dry skin or combination skin, but this is not always the case.If your face has reacted poorly to cosmetics or facial products in the past, you might have sensitive skin. Signs of skin sensitivity include redness, uncharacteristic breakouts, bumps, peeling, itchiness, or soreness., Most commercial facial scrubs will state whether they are appropriate for dry, oily, combination, normal, or sensitive skin. Some facial scrubs will also be appropriate for all skin types. However, there are some general guidelines for matching a facial scrub to your skin type:


Facial scrubs made with apricot pits, walnut shells, almonds, or aluminum oxide tend to be better for skin that is oily and not sensitive.Facial scrubs made with plastic beads, alpha hydroxy, or beta hydroxy tend to be better for skin that is dry or sensitive., Some scrubs can be stored in the shower, which is convenient for your routine. However, some scrubs are more effective if stored in a cool, dry place such as a medicine cabinet, linen closet, or kitchen cupboard. Follow the recommendations of the product label if you are using a commercial scrub. If you are making your own facial scrub, follow the recipe's recommendations.

, Pay particular attention to product warnings, expiration dates, possible allergens, or adverse interactions with other facial products. Some facial scrubs are meant solely for exfoliating but do not cleanse the skin, which means you have to wash your face before using the scrub in order for it to be effective.

, If you have long hair, you should pull it back into a ponytail or bun so that it doesn't get in the way. Make sure you moisten your entire face. It is best to use warm water, but avoid using water that is too hot: that can dry out your skin., Take a dab of the scrub and massage it all over your face and neck. Be careful not to rub too hard, so that you can avoid unnecessary redness or peeling. Also be particularly careful not to get the scrub in your eyes.


Note that rubbing for more than 60-90 seconds might cause irritation or sensitivity. Be sure that you are not over-scrubbing or leaving the scrub on your face for too long.

, Make sure you get it all off. When you rinse all of it off, your skin will feel very smooth and soft.

, Gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel and continue with the rest of your skin care routine.

, Even if you have oily or combination skin, moisturizing is a necessary part of a skin care routine, especially after exfoliating with a facial scrub. Moisturizing helps to prevent the overproduction of skin oils and keeps the skin healthy and well-balanced., It might be tempting to get that soft, glowing feeling every morning. However, using a facial scrub too often can peel away your delicate skin cells and leave you feeling red, raw, and sore. Try using the scrub only once a week at first; you can increase the frequency to twice a week if you feel like your skin can handle it.Moderation is key to the effectiveness of a facial scrub. , If the scrub is effective, you should begin seeing signs of softer, smoother, more youthful skin fairly quickly. In which case, congratulations! You have uncovered the best product for exfoliating your skin.

, These are indications of an allergy or sensitivity. If you experience these symptoms, you should discontinue use of this particular scrub immediately and select an alternative product. You might also consider asking your dermatologist to conduct a patch test to determine what exactly you might be allergic or sensitive to. , It might take a few tries in order for you to find the ideal product for your skin type. Remember to be patient and watchful. You will find a good match eventually!

Harvest a leaf from an aloe plant.,
Trim off the thorny edges with a sharp knife.,
Clean the leaf under running water.,
Crack the aloe leaf open into two halves.,
Peel away the yellow layer of the leaf.,
Use a spoon to scoop out the gel.,
Place the aloe gel into a blender or food processor along with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) fresh lemon juice.,
Blend the aloe gel and lemon juice together for two to three minutes.,
Store the mixture in a sealed container inside your refrigerator.",How to Use Aloe Juice As an Astringent1," In order to be the most effective, you should choose a plant that is fully mature. Aloe plants reach maturity after about three to four years.;
, While the thorns may not get stuck in your skin if you touch them, they can hurt. Trimming them off makes it easier to work with the leaf.

, Use your fingers to gently scrub away any dirt or grime that could contaminate your aloe juice.

, Peel off the green rind, revealing the yellow-tinted aloin underneath. Breaking the leaf makes it easier to peel away the rind.


To peel by hand, pinch the top layer of the rind between your index finger and thumb. Lift the rind up and back, passing over the length of the aloe leaf, separating the rind from the rest of the leaf.
If you cannot peel the rind by hand, use a sharp knife. Carefully slide the knife directly beneath the rind. Get the knife as close to the rind as possible to avoid cutting away any of the interior gel. Pass the knife through the length of the leaf, separating the rind from the aloin. You should be able to lift the rind away without any resistance.
Only peel the top layer of rind away, leaving the bottom intact. The interior of an aloe leaf is flimsy, and it will be difficult to remove both halves of the rind without destroying the gel inside.

, This layer, called the aloin, has the consistency of latex. It will not hurt your skin, but if accidentally ingested, the aloin is mildly toxic and will cause stomach cramps and diarrhea. Use a sharp knife to scrape the aloin away. By the end, you should be left with nothing but colorless, translucent gel.


Note that you can remove the aloin by using a solution made of 1 cup (250 milliliters) water and 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) vinegar, but for cosmetic astringent purposes, removing the aloin with a knife is the best option.

, You should be able to scoop away at least 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters).

, Lemon juice is another astringent, which will improve the astringent qualities of your aloe juice. Moreover, the lemon juice will prevent your aloe gel from oxidizing.


Note that the gel oxidizes rapidly, so you will need to work fast. Once the gel oxidizes, it will turn brown and lose many of its beneficial qualities. Even its astringency may be affected.
If you want to create a larger batch of aloe juice, simply use more aloe gel and more lemon juice, maintaining a ratio of 2:1, aloe gel to lemon juice.

, This should produce a thick aloe juice perfect for astringent purposes.

, It should stay fresh for about a week. Discard it at the first sign of browning or oxidation.

Leave the aloe juice on your face.,
Apply a mild moisturizer to your face.,
Repeat this process once a day for several weeks.",How to Use Aloe Juice As an Astringent2," Use warm water to relax your skin and a gentle cleanser. Avoid exfoliating cleansers or harsh cleansers that may dry out the skin. Astringents constrict the skin to close pores, but they also have a tendency to dry the skin out simultaneously. A harsh, drying cleanser may dry your skin out too much.

, Allow the juice to soak into the cotton, thoroughly wetting it.Wipe the aloe-drenched cotton pad over your face and neck. Concentrate on the areas that get oiliest or those that are most prone to break-outs, since these spots will benefit most from the astringent properties of the aloe and lemon.

, Do not wash it off. In order to have time to work correctly as an astringent, the aloe juice should remain on your face for at least 8 hours. You may want to wear the the aloe juice on your face overnight.

, Avoid oily moisturizers. Select a light moisturizing lotion rather than a heavy cream and concentrate on the areas that get the driest. Since the astringency of aloe can dry your skin out, applying a moisturizer after you apply the aloe juice can help prevent your skin from becoming stiff and flaky.

, After enough time passes, the astringent properties of you aloe juice should make your skin firmer and clearer.

Consider giving aloe juice a boost in astringency.,
Place 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) of aloe juice in a blender or food processor with 1 cup (250 milliliters) distilled water.,
Pour the diluted aloe juice into a glass jar.,
Add 10 drops of chamomile oil into the diluted aloe juice.,
Cap the jar and shake it to mix in the chamomile oil.,
Store in the refrigerator and apply as directed above.",How to Use Aloe Juice As an Astringent3," You can add this boost to your homemade aloe juice, or make store-bought aloe gel or aloe juice astringent enough to work as a facial toner. Lemon juice and aloe juice alone can make an effective astringent, especially if you have fairly normal skin. For extremely oily skin, however, you may want to try something more.


Note that you do not need to add lemon juice to store-bought aloe juice before improving it with the below formula. If using fresh aloe gel directly harvested from an aloe leaf, though, you need to add lemon juice in order to preserve the aloe and prevent it from oxidizing.

, Blend the two together for one to two minutes to get a thoroughly diluted aloe juice.


You can also use aloe gel instead of aloe juice to create a slightly thicker diluted aloe juice.

, Leave enough room at the top of the jar, in case your solution expands when cooled inside the refrigerator.

, Chamomile oil is another astringent. It also has a nice smell and contributes vitamins and antioxidant flavonoids that prevent damage to the skin.

, Shake it vigorously to make sure that the oil spreads throughout the entire solution.

, You may need to shake the jar before each use if you notice the aloe, oil, and water separating.

Store the microneedling device in its original case.",How to Use a Home Microneedling Device," Prior to microneedling at home, you need to choose a device that is best suited for you. There are three different types of at home microneedling products: a derma roller, derma stamp, and derma pen. Derma rollers are the least expensive option and roll along your skin like a paint roller. Some dermatologists recommend derma stamps and derma pens because the vertical penetration is less painful and allows for easier maneuvering around the mouth, eyes, and nose.Shop for a microneedling device online.
These devices range in price from about $50 for a derma roller to upwards of $200 for a derma pen.;
, Most at home microneedling is performed using much shorter needles than those used by aestheticians. For instance, at a clinic needles can range in length from 0.5mm to 3mm depending on the type of treatment. When performing the treatment at home, you should use shorter needles. Needle lengths that range from 0.25mm to 1mm are recommended for general anti-aging procedures. If treating acne scars, you may want to use a longer needle around 1.5mm in length.If you are opting for a longer needle, talk with your dermatologist prior to treatment.

, Before using a microneedling device, carefully read all of the instructions. The instructions will provide you with detailed information concerning set up, storage, and how to safely use the product. Each product is slightly different, so it is very important that you read the instructions that accompany the device you purchase.Depending on the type of microneedling device you selected, you may have to insert the needle cartridge into the device as well as other minimal assembly that may be required.

, Before you begin the treatment, sanitize the microneedling device. Place the device, needle side down, in a small bowl of rubbing alcohol. Leave the device immersed in the rubbing alcohol for at least one to two minutes., Finally, before you begin the treatment, wash your face and remove all makeup. Wash your face using a gentle cleanser. This will help remove all dirt, grime, and makeup from the surface of your skin. You do not want any bacteria to get into the skin as a result of the microneedling process. As a result, you should always begin with a clean face.Pat your face dry after washing.
Some people recommend applying a vitamin C serum to your face after it has been cleansed. This is meant to help the skin absorb enzymes and vitamins., Mentally divide your face into approximately six sections. You do not need to actually mark your face. For example, you could try mentally dividing into the following sections: forehead, cheeks, chin, eye area, nose, and upper lip. This will help to ensure that you adequately cover the entire surface of your face and will help to break up the procedure.If desired, you can also use a microneedling device on your neck and upper chest., Turn on the device and gently glide the roller across your face. You should move the roller vertically, horizontally, and diagonally across the surface of your skin. This should be done in stripes covering each section of your face. While moving the roller across your face, use your other hand to pull your skin tight. This will make it easier to maneuver the device.Do not go over the same section of skin too many times in one sitting. It is recommended that you do not pass over the same patch of skin more than ten times per treatment., When using the microneedling roller, stamp, or pen, do not apply too much pressure. Instead, you should apply light to moderate pressure. It may tingle or feel slightly uncomfortable at first, but it will not damage your skin and should not cause bleeding., Always lift the roller completely off of your face when you are changing directions, then return it to your skin facing in the direction you are headed. Never drag or turn the microneedling roller from a vertical position to a diagonal position while it is still touching the surface of your skin. This could cause your skin to tear and may result in damage to your skin., Although microneedling does not damage your skin, it will likely be red and tender immediately following the treatment. Allow your skin to rest and do not wash your face for at least six to eight hours.Some individuals recommend applying a moisturizer or vitamin serum immediately following the procedure. Try this out and see what works best for your skin.
Avoid using makeup for 24 hours but make sure that you use sunblock.

, Once you are finished using the device, rinse the needles under warm water and place it into a bowl of rubbing alcohol. This will disinfect the device of any bacteria that it may have picked up on the surface of the skin. It is very important that you keep the microneedling device clean and sanitary.Do not share your microneedling device with other family members of friends. This should be considered a personal device.

, Following the cleansing process, store your microneedling device in its original case. This will help to ensure that the needles do not break or get damaged and will also keep the needles relatively clean between uses."

You may want a bigger lip mask to get the dry skin around your lips or if you have plumper lips to begin with, for instance.Some also have tasty flavors, and that can be a deciding factor.Most of these masks have hydrating ingredients, so you if you have an allergy, be sure to check out the ingredients before buying.;
, Most lip masks recommend exfoliating your lips first, especially if your lips are a bit shaggy with dry skin. You can use a lip scrub, or you can simply rub a wet washcloth over them to help remove dead skin., Before applying the lip mask, your lips need to be dry. Otherwise, the mask will have trouble sticking to your face. Plus, you don't want to dilute the product with water, as you want its full benefits.

, Most lip masks will come in a large box. Inside the box, you'll find individual packages of lip masks. Take them out of the box, then remove one mask from an individual package. Be careful when opening the individual package, as most lip masks are packed in liquid., The mask goes over your mouth. Make sure you cover all of your lips, so the mask has a chance to work. In fact, some masks extend well beyond the edges of your lips.Some masks are one whole piece, meaning you can't breathe through your mouth, so keep that in mind if you have a stuffy nose., To work well, the mask needs to stay on your mouth for about 10 to 15 minutes, though some run up to 30 minutes or longer. Read the directions for your specific mask. Set a timer so that you're not tempted to pull it off early.You may need to lay down while it's working, as some aren't terribly sticky.In fact, some masks are meant to be left on during the night., Once the time is up, you simply peel the mask off. These masks are not reusable, so you toss it in the trash at the end. After you're done, apply your makeup or go on with your day as you normally do.

When you choose your cleansing balm, you want to make sure that it’s formulated for the type of skin you have.If you have oily skin, using a cleansing balm with a soft cloth may help you prevent your skin from over-producing oils.;
, Cleansing balms contain different vitamins and nutrients that improve the look and feel of your skin. Look for the formulas that offer what you’re looking for.For example, you could choose a balm that exfoliates dead skin cells, hydrates dry skin, acts as an anti-inflammatory, or gives your collagen a boost.
Some brands offer a wide-range of antioxidants from fruit, vegetable, and tea additives. These ingredients can firm and brighten your skin.
You can also find brands that offer organic or all-natural formulas.

, In addition to finding advice in magazines, you can find lists of the best cleansing balms for different skin types by consulting beauty guides online. Leading authorities on beauty have compiled lists of products that meet different needs at a variety of price points.


For example, to read Allure magazine’s recommendations, visit http://www.allure.com/gallery/best-cleansing-balms.

, Your cleansing balm will remove your makeup, dirt, and impurities, so don’t wash your face or wet it before you use it. The oils in the balm need to interact with the oils in your face and in your makeup, so avoid water when initially applying the balm.There is no need to remove your makeup before cleansing with a balm.

, Make sure that your hands are dry when you touch the balm. The cleansing balm should be hard and almost solid, so you may need to dig in your fingers. Your scoop should be enough balm to cover the tips of two fingers.


Make sure that you use enough balm to completely clean your face. If you don’t use enough, then your face won’t be clean., Your balm should start to melt a little in your hand, making it easier to apply it to your skin. It should only take a few seconds for your balm to warm up enough for you to use it., Using your fingertips, make circular movements to work in the balm. Continue to rub in the balm so that the oils in the balm have time to mix with the oils on your face.As you massage your face, you’ll also be improving your circulation.
Don’t forget to apply the balm to the eye area. Unlike other products, cleansing balms can be used around the eyes.

, While you can remove the product with warm water, using a cloth will ensure that you get off all of the product. Cleansing balms are harder to remove than standard cleansers, so using only water can result in a residue on your skin.Some balms come with a muslin cloth to remove the makeup, but any soft facial cloth will work.With some cleansing balms, it’s okay to leave the residue on your skin as a moisturizer, so you may decide to use just water so that your product can be used as both a cleanser and a moisturizer., Gently pat your face to remove the remaining wetness. Use a fresh hand towel or face cloth to make sure that you don’t transfer dirt or bacteria back onto your face.


If you still have makeup around your eye area, then you may need to use an eye makeup remover to clear away remaining eye makeup, especially if you wear dark eyeliner or mascara., Follow your cleansing balm with a night cream or serum.If you use a toner or other face products, you can apply them as well.

Undergo sclerotherapy.,
Consider a surface laser treatment.",How to Remove Spider Veins1," In this medical procedure, a saline solution or detergent is inserted into the vein, causing it to become irritated and collapse. Once the vein has collapsed, it is no longer visible under the skin.You can expect one injection per inch of spider vein. The procedure is quick and usually quite painless - the prick of the needle is the only thing you feel.


The side effects include redness, stinging, swelling, and bruising. These usually go away quickly and shouldn't prevent you from doing your normal activities.
The best time to get sclerotherapy is during the winter, when your veins are most visible and easiest to protect. Skin tanned by the summer sun makes spider veins more difficult to see and remove.
The procedure permanently removes existing spider veins, but new ones can develop over time. Additional treatments may be required to keep your legs free of spider veins.You can expect to pay between $300 and $1,000, depending on how many spider veins you have and whether both legs need the treatment.;
, If you are sensitive to needles or allergic to the saline solution used in sclerotherapy, you may want to have a surface laser treatment instead. Strong bursts of light are sent through the skin to the veins, which fade and disappear afterward.


Laser treatment is often painful due to the high temperature of the laser. After treatment, which usually lasts about 20 minutes, a cooling agent is applied to the skin to ease the pain.
Side effects can include redness and swelling, discoloration of the skin, and in extreme cases, scars or burns.
People with certain skin colors and conditions should not use laser treatment, since it can permanently discolor the skin. Ask your doctor whether you're a good candidate for the treatment.

Get Kool Aid out of clothing.,
Remove Kool Aid from carpet.,
Clean Kool Aid off furniture.",How to Remove Kool Aid from Skin," Toothpaste is generally considered the best method for removing Kool Aid. If you have toothpaste on hand, use that before trying other means. Stain removal or whitening toothpastes are probably your best option as they're designed to remove set in stains on teeth and will act similarly on your hands. Look for toothpaste that contains blue covarine, as this has the most immediate effect. You don't need to leave the toothpaste in any longer than it takes to remove the stain., If toothpaste is unavailable, try oils. While not generally recommended to treat Kool Aid stains specifically, oils are often useful for removing dye from skin. They might be helpful for Kool Aid as well. The following oils may help remove Kool Aid:Olive oil
Vegetable oil
Baby oil

, Yet again, kitchen products are not recommended for Kool Aid specifically but have been shown effective at removing dyes. Make sure you dilute any acidic kitchen products, like vinegar or those containing citrus fruit, with water before using them on your skin and avoid contact with cuts or sores. If toothpaste is unsuccessful, you may want to try some of the following kitchen products:Lemon juice
Salt
Vinegar

, As a strong dish soap is used to remove stains from dishes, using a small amount of dish soap on your hands may successfully remove Kool Aid stains. If other means do not work, try simply washing your hands with warm water and dish soap., If the Kool Aid stain is on your hands, you should wash your hands. Do so like you would normally wash your hands, but use the stain remover you chose instead of hand soap.


Run your hands under clean water. Let your hands get wet before turning off the tap. Be careful, however, as the Kool Aid may drip when wet and you don't want to stain your sink. It might be a good idea to lay a washable cloth towel or paper towel down on the sink while you wash your hands.
Lather your hands with the strain remover. Once your hands are wet, apply whatever stain removal method you chose and lather your hands. Make sure you get between your fingers and the back of your hands. Lather your hands for about 20 seconds. It can help to hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice to keep track.Rinse your hands thoroughly and pat dry., Oftentimes, Kool Aid gets stained on the upper lip. This is sometimes referred to as a ""Kool Aid mustache"" and is fairly easy to remove.


Add a small amount of the stain remover to a damp washcloth. If you're using something more acidic, like vinegar or lemon juice, you only need to add a few drops as any more could irritate your skin.Gently dab your upper lip with the washcloth until the Kool Aid comes off.Rinse off your upper lip with cool water and then pat dry., Oftentimes, people use Kool Aid to dye their hair and end up staining their hairline. If this is the case with you, you can mix in your chosen stain remover with your regular shampoo and take a shower. Be careful to rinse your hair thoroughly, especially if you used something like toothpaste which can be hard to get out of hair. You might want to do one wash using the stain remover along with your shampoo and then another wash with plain shampoo., If you also got Kool Aid on your clothes, it may not easily come out in a normal washer cycle. There are other tricks to get Kool Aid out of clothes, however.


Add liquid laundry detergent to the stained area before putting the clothing through the washer. Then, rinse it off with cool water. Make sure the water is cold and not warm, as warm water could cause colors to bleed.Run the clothing through a washer. The strain should be gone when it comes out of the washing cycle., If Kool Aid spilled on the carpet, this can be difficult to get out. Water, dishwashing liquid, and vinegar can remove Kool Aid from carpeting.


Mix together two cups of cool water, one tablespoon of dishwashing liquid, and one tablespoon of white vinegar.Clean the Kool Aid from the carpet using a washcloth. Blot at the stain until it's absorbed or removed.Wet a washcloth with clean, cold water and blot the spot on the carpet to remove the solution used to remove the stain., Use the same solution to clean Kool Aid off furniture as you used for the carpeting. Blot at the spot where the stain was until it's absorbed and then use a clean, damp washcloth to remove the cleaning solution."

You're more likely to get a purer product. For example, if you're looking for essential oils, contact a company that primarily produces essential oils. Always read labels which should tell you the name of the product, where it came from, how it was produced, when it expires, and whether it's organic or certified.If you're having trouble finding what you need, look online.
Many online retailers also sell containers, tins, and bottles specifically for skincare products.;
, Many homemade skincare products contain herbs, oils, or other natural ingredients that can cause side effects in some people. Anytime you make your own skincare products, be on the lookout for any symptoms. If you notice symptoms, stop using your product and see a doctor if it doesn't quickly clear up. Side effects of natural skincare products include:Irritation
Redness or blotchy skin
Itchy scaling skin
Breakouts
Chemical burns

, If you know you're allergic to certain products in conventional skincare products, avoid using them even if you prepare them in natural skincare products. For example, if you're allergic to tea tree oil toner, avoid making any skincare products with tea tree essential oil.Other natural ingredients that commonly cause allergies in people include: tea tree oil, feverfew, lavender, and jasmine.

, Since homemade skincare products don't contain preservatives, you'll probably need to refrigerate some of them or toss them after a few days. This is especially important if the product is based on a food item because it could begin growing fungus, bacteria, or yeast.If your product is water or food based, you should refrigerate it and use it within three days.

, If making your own skincare products using recipes seems intimidating, you can easily swap out natural items for skincare products you'd normally purchase. For example, try using:Pure coconut oil instead of lotion
Diluted apple cider vinegar instead of facial toner
Olive oil instead of mascara remover

, Just because a product claims that it's natural doesn't necessarily make it good for you. On the other hand, just because a product sounds unnatural doesn't make it bad for you. It's important to research the ingredients in your skincare products, especially if you don't know what it is or what it does.


For example, vitamin E is also known as tocopherol and vitamin D is also known as cholecalciferol.

, Since there are no government databases that research and share skincare product information, use the EWG database. This searchable database lists recommendations on what to avoid, what's in your skincare products, and the toxicity levels of products. Since the terms ""natural"" and ""all-natural"" aren't regulated, you should find out exactly what's in your skincare products. Other good databases or apps to use include:


Environmental Working Group database: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/

Think Dirty app: http://www.thinkdirtyapp.com/

GoodGuide database: http://www.goodguide.com/


, Many fragrances (listed as ""parfum"") contain chemicals (phthalates) which are associated with possible birth defects, cancer, allergic skin reactions and other health problems. You should also avoid plastic packaging since it can release chemicals into your skincare product. Choose products in packaging like PET (with recycling code #1) and HDPE (#2) since these are considered to be the safest plastics.Avoid polycarbonate (#7) which contains the endocrine disruptor bisphenol-A (BPA) and avoid PVC (#3) which contains a variety of heavy metals, phthalates and chemicals.
Essential oils are a better natural way to add fragrance to a product since they don't contain phthalates.

, Since skincare products are not heavily regulated, research the company to find out their specific policies. Some companies have signed a Compact for Safe Cosmetics which voluntarily pledges to remove any known or potentially harmful chemicals from their ingredients. You might want to find out:


If a company tests on animals
The company's mission statement
Whether or not the company is an environmentally conscious company

, Although organic products can still contain emollients, preservatives, and emulsifiers, they usually use the natural versions instead of harmful synthetic versions. Try to buy organic skincare products when you can and look for the USDA National Organic Program seal. This means that the product has been through a certification program.Biodynamic certification is an even higher standard for skincare products. Just look for for a biodynamic or Demeter seal of approval., You'll probably see that many products claim to be hypoallergenic (at a low risk of causing allergies). This term is unregulated so there's no research to support this claim. Instead, test a product by applying a coin-sized amount to the skin on your elbow crease. Do this in the morning and at night for up to a week to see if it irritates your skin. If it doesn't, you can use the product. If you see signs of irritation, avoid the product. Signs of irritation include:Small bumps
Redness
Swelling
Burning sensation

, You might be surprised to see products that claim to be natural might contain parabens. Parabens are chemicals used to prevent the growth of microorganisms in cosmetics. Parabens have been associated with cancer so check the label for any ingredients that list paraben as part of the name. For example, avoid methylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben.You should also avoid other toxic chemicals like formaldehyde, toluene, dibutyl phthalate, and petroleum products (including petroleum jelly, petrolatum, mineral oil and paraffin.)

, While many manufactured skincare products contain preservatives, the products do have a shelf life. Expired skincare products may not be as effective and may grow bacteria so it's important to toss your old skincare products. In general, throw out:Swipe-on pads after 2 months or when they dry out
Peels and masks after 3 months
Acne products after 4 months (consider refrigerating them)
Retinoid creams after 9 to 11 months
Sunscreens after one or two years
Moisturizing creams after 1 year
Grainy scrubs after 2 years

, Pregnancy is a sensitive time for your growing baby. While your baby is developing, exposure to chemicals from skincare products could cause health problems. This is why it's even more important to make or find natural skincare products. Try to cut back on wearing skincare products or cosmetics during pregnancy and avoid products that contain hormone disrupting chemicals if you're nursing.Common hormone disrupting chemicals include triclosan (found in hand sanitizers), parabens (found in skincare and cosmetic products), BPA, lead, and mercury., Use as few products with as few ingredients as possible. This way, if your skin reacts to something in a product, you'll easily be able to determine what ingredient caused the reaction. Also, the more ingredients in a product, the greater the chance that they may interact and cause health problems.


Teens use 17 products on average and adults use an average of 12 products a day. This can mean an average use of almost 170 different ingredients., Since babies and children are still developing, they're more sensitive to ingredients in skincare products. Try to cut back on the number of products you use on your babies or children since these have never been tested for safety in babies and children.Choose products with no fragrance since fragrances (parfum) can cause irritation or allergies in small children.
Minimize product use, but be sure to protect your kids. For example, apply sunblock, but remember to cover your child's head with a hat when you're all out in the sun.

Don't inhibit circulation in your legs.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Wear compression hose.,
Take care of your skin.",How to Remove Spider Veins2," The veins in your legs have to work against gravity to carry blood back to your heart. Certain habits can make this process harder on the veins, causing them to become strained and enlarged, which makes them visible.Aid the circulation in your legs by practicing the following habits:


Don't stay in the same position for long periods. Whether you're sitting at a desk all day or standing in front of a classroom for hours at a time, staying in the same position inhibits circulation. Find time to change things up by taking a walk around your office or putting your feet up between classes.
Don't cross your legs. This cuts off circulation and puts unnecessary stress on your veins. Sit with your feet flat on the floor to allow the veins in your legs to circulate blood unobstructed.

, Your feet are an important part of the circulation in your legs, and if you wear shoes that pinch or otherwise inhibit blood flow, it can lead to the appearance of spider veins.


Avoid high heels. Heels put extra pressure on your legs and make your veins work harder to carry blood back to the heart. Wear low heels or flat shoes instead.
Avoid tight boots. Knee-length boots, especially, can constrict your legs and inhibit circulation.

, Available at drugstores and other stores that sell medical equipment, compression hose provide extra support to your legs to aid in blood circulation and prevent your veins from getting strained.Compression hose are not the same as support stockings and other fashion stockings. Compression hose apply pressure in certain spots to help your circulation.
Prescription-strength gradient compression hose must be fitted by a professional but they offer even more pressure than regular support pantyhose and gradient compression hose.
Wear hose as often as possible, and not just when you're wearing a dress or skirt. Wear hose under pants, too.
Compression hose can also help ease the swelling or stinging that results from sclerotherapy or laser treatment.

, Keeping your skin healthy protects the veins beneath it and decreases the chance that spider veins will show through. Care for your skin in the following ways:


Wear sunscreen. The sun's rays damage and weaken skin, making veins below more apparent. Use it on your face to prevent spider veins from appearing there, and don't forget your legs and ankles.
Moisturize your skin. Keeping your skin from drying out helps improve your skin's elasticity and appearance, making it less likely that spider veins will show through.

"
"
Eliminate foods that make you retain water.,
Eat more fiber.,
Exercise every day.",How to Remove Spider Veins3," When your body retains extra water, it puts unnecessary pressure on your veins, which can cause them to enlarge and become visible. Decrease your intake of the following foods that cause water retention:


Foods with a lot of salt. Fried foods, canned soups and salty snacks can cause you to retain water. Try reducing or eliminating the amount of salt you use in everyday cooking and baking.
Alcoholic drinks. A few beers or glasses of wine a week shouldn't cause a problem, but more alcohol than that can cause your body to retain water and strain your veins.

, Constipation is another form of pressure that can lead to over-strained veins. Eating foods high in fiber helps your digestive system work properly and prevents this type of pressure from accumulating.


Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid juice, and eat whole fruit instead, since it contains a lot of fiber. Try making whole-food smoothies with spinach, blueberries and bananas.
Eat whole grains. Quinoa, steel-cut oatmeal, oat bran, and other whole grains help relieve the pressure of constipation.
Take fiber supplements if your system still seems to need more fiber.

, Regular exercise keeps you moving and improves your circulation, and it also helps the body maintain a healthy weight, decreasing pressure on the veins in your legs.


Focus on exercises that work out your legs, like running, swimming or biking.
Daily walks are another great form of exercise. Fit them in on your lunch break or before and after work.

Use social media to promote your product.,

Stay in contact.,
Choose quality over quantity.,
Be patient.,
Sell with online craft vendors.",How to Sell Skin Care Products1," Social media is one of the best ways to promote and sell a product, as it gives you an opportunity to build a fan base for little-to-know cost. You can set up business pages on many social media platforms, though for some, you'll just set up a regular page.For instance, on a platform like Facebook, you can set up a business page, which you can then use to invite friends to like and promote your product. However, because Facebook has changed some of their policies regarding how people see business posts, you sometimes need to pay a small fee to promote your posts if you want to reach new customers.
Another good platform for businesses is Instagram. One reason this platform works well is you can use hashtags to gather new followers, as hashtags gather posts into categories that users can scroll through. Just be sure to pick more popular hashtags to garner more attention. When you're typing in a hashtag, Instagram will tell you how many items are under that hashtag, so you can gauge how popular it is.;
, To build your own business, you must support other businesses by commenting and liking on their pages. The more you interact with other people, the more you get your name out there for the world to see, which only helps you.Part of building relationships is not posting exclusively about your business, especially when you're first getting started. You need to establish that you're interesting and worthy of being followed before jumping into your business talk.
Stick to promoting yourself on your page about 10% of the time. The rest of the time, try to push other types of content.
That means posting content that's relevant to your business and interesting, either other people's content or content that you've created. For instance, if you're using Tumblr, you can post a short infographic on moisturizing that can be reblogged by other people.

, It's important to continually keep in contact with your fan base, as in today's fast-paced media world, you're forgotten quickly. That means posting on all your platforms often, at least once a day if you can manage it. If you don't have the time to do it yourself, you can hire someone to post for you.Another option is setting aside a day to put together a variety of posts that you can schedule to pop up at a later date. That way, you can just devote one day to it instead of messing with it every day.

, While it's important to be up-to-date on posts, it's even more important that you're making quality posts. That's because quality posts build quality relationships, and if you have 200 people that are devoted followers, that's better than many more followers who will leave you at a whim., It takes time to build up a fanbase on social media, but it does happen as long as you're consistent with your content and you keep working at it day after day. You won't get 5,000 followers overnight, but over time, you can easily build up to that and more., Once you've got followers, you need to direct them to places that sell your products, either your own website or online handmade or skincare sites. Listing on a site like Etsy or eBay is easy to set up, and you don't need to pitch your products to a manager.Once you set up a shop, you list your products individually with a price and a shipping cost. The site will charge a listing fee and usually a percentage of the sale.
You'll need high-quality photos of your products to draw customers in. Be sure to take photos in good natural light that highlights the product with a fairly blank background.
You'll also need good descriptions listing all your ingredients and describing your product. It helps if you can tell a story about your product, such as why you created it or why you believe in it.
Most sites also allow you to list keywords for your product to help people find it. Be sure to pick unique keywords that people are likely to search.

Shave your stomach.,
Pluck the hair.,
Wax or sugar your stomach area.,
Apply a depilatory product.",How to Remove Stomach Hair1," One of the simplest ways in which to remove hair from your stomach is by shaving it. Shaving will quickly remove hair from your stomach, though it may require more frequent upkeep than other methods, depending on the texture and amount of hair.Only shave your stomach hair when your skin is wet, which can help soften the follicles, making removal easier.Only shave your stomach hair in the direction in which the hair grows. This can lessen irritation and the likelihood of cutting yourself.Use a clean razor with sharp blade to help prevent infection and likelihood of cutting yourself.Consider using an electric razor or clipper if your stomach hair is especially thick and copious.;
, If you don’t have a large amount of hair on your stomach, you can simply pluck it either with tweezers or have someone pluck the hair by threading. These methods pluck the hair below the surface at the follicle and thus only require upkeep whenever new hair grows.You can pluck stomach hairs with tweezers or make an appointment at a local salon or spa that offers hair removal services.Threading, which is an ancient form of hair removal, rotates a looped piece of thread across the skin to pluck hairs.Inquire with local salon or spa if they offer threading services. Depending on where you live, it may be difficult to find a trained threader.
Be aware that plucking and threading can be painful and irritate skin, though threading may be a better option for sensitive skin., Like plucking, waxing and sugaring remove hair at the follicle, which can hinder hair growth for longer than shaving. Waxing and sugaring can be very effective if a large portion of your stomach has hair and may also reduce overall growth if done over a longer period of time.Waxing involves applying a thin layer of warm, melted or cold wax to your skin and then pulling it off in the opposite direction of the hair growth. This uproots hair at the follicle.Like waxing, sugaring entails the application of a thin layer of heated sugar mixture that is then lifted off your skin to remove the hair.Sugaring may be a better option for more sensitive skin.
Choose to wax or sugar yourself or have a professional remove stomach hair using these methods.Trim long or thick stomach hair before waxing or sugaring for better results and less pain.
You can purchase home waxing and sugaring kits at many pharmacies. Most salons and spas will offer waxing and sugaring services, which can be expensive, but effective.
Be aware that waxing and sugaring can be very painful, especially during initial treatments and on very sensitive stomach skin. In most cases, you’ll need to undergo treatments every 4-6 weeks to remove your stomach hair.
Do or have a small skin test with a wax or sugar mixture to ensure that you don’t have an allergic reaction to it. In addition, you should never use wax or sugar on broken or inflamed skin because it can exacerbate irritation., Depilatories are chemical formulations that break down the protein structure of hair and dissolve it into a jellylike mass.This can be a quick and painless way to remove stomach hair, especially if it is thick and spread across a wide area.Depilatories come in various forms including gels, creams, lotions, aerosols, and roll-ons.Because you are putting a chemical on your skin, it is important to first do a patch test to see if your skin reacts.You also shouldn’t use a depilatory on broken or inflamed skin.Apply the depilatory to the stomach hair you want to remove. Leave on the product for the length of time the packaging recommends and then wipe or rinse it off, along with the hair mass.If your skin burns at any time, remove the product immediately.
Depilatory creams keep hair growth at bay for anywhere from 1 day to 10 days."

Go to craft fairs.,
Sell in a local booth store.,
Sell in boutiques.",How to Sell Skin Care Products2," One option for selling your product in person is to buy space at local craft fairs. Most craft fairs are 1 to 3 days long, and you rent your booth space for that period of time. Craft fairs can be lucrative, if the shows are well advertised and the community supports them.It's important to make your setup as professional as possible. Tablecloths, decorations, lights, and a professional sign can all add flair to your booth to draw customers in. Also, don't forget to bring your business cards to hand out.
If you want to take credit cards, many booths now use card readers that can attach to your smartphone, such as Square or PayPal.
Some craft fairs limit direct sales to one person per company or none at all. Therefore, if you're selling for a company, make sure to call or email as early as possible to reserve a space, so you can get in ahead of other sellers in your company.

, One easy option for selling your products is to try a local store where you can rent a booth. You pay a monthly fee for your booth, and in return, the store sells your product for you. The only problem with this setup is you must pay whether you sell anything or not.


One upside of this approach is that you can get into these stores more easily than other stores.
Also, you may able to use this approach for direct sales, depending on the store.

, Another option is to sell in a local store. Many stores that are not connected to a big chain will take local products to sell. Check your local listings or even drive around in areas with boutique stores to figure out which ones may be right for you. Then, do your research online and in person before approaching the store.Stores generally sell in two ways. In some craft shops, the shops will display your goods, then take a commission when the item sells. Others will buy your goods outright to sell in your stores, though they will likely want them at a discounted rate.
However, stores will not sell for you if you're doing direct sales.
Check online to see if the store lists how they prefer someone to approach them about selling. Many places would prefer you not come during business hours to show your products.
Make sure to have pictures of your products, along with a variety of samples for the store owner to try.

Know your product.,
Be able to tell a story.,
Talk to them.,
Let them know how it can help them.",How to Sell Skin Care Products3," First and foremost, you need to know everything about your product. When someone asks a question, you need to be able to answer it without hesitation. If you can't, that person may walk away, and you miss a potential sale., People don't just want to connect with a product on a logical level. They want to connect on a emotional level, as well. You need to make a connection with each person by being able to tell what's special about your product and why they should use it.You need to have a spiel that you can give out to people, but you also need to be able to change it up a little so that it doesn't sound rehearsed.
For example, if you started the skincare line so your kid would have products to use, that's something you can tell a story about. You've created a line of all-natural skincare products so that everyone can have healthy skin, just like your kid.

, You're building a relationship with your customers, even if it's only a 5 minute conversation. That means you need to try to connect with them with what you're saying, so don't be afraid to just strike up a conversation.One way to connect is to ask questions about what your customer wants. Once you figure out what he or she wants, you can better address how your product is right for them.

, Don't just tell them how great your product is; let them know how it will help them in the long run. Show them the way that it can help create healthier skin, for instance, as that's a long term goal they can connect with.One way to help customers focus on how the product can help them is to provide samples. If they see how great your lotion feels on their hands, they'll be more inclined to buy it.

Choose a name.,
Create a logo.,
Make a website.,
Print business cards.",How to Sell Skin Care Products4," Start by choosing a name for your product line, if you haven't already. Make sure your name is simple enough that customers understand its meaning, but catchy enough that the name sticks with the customer. It has to be unique and help you stand out at the same time. A good name can help you sell your product, especially if it's catchy and memorable.Try to avoid pun names, as they can become cheesy and devalue your name.
Pick something that reflects your business, but that allows you to play off it for your line. For example, a name like ""The Cat's Meow"" would give you an opportunity to use names like ""Cat Paw Cream"" and ""Whisker Moisturizer"" for your products.
Take some time to brainstorm different ideas, and then run a few past friends and family to see if any of them stick.
Make sure the name reflects the style of your business. ""The Cat's Meow"" wouldn't be a great name for sophisticated line, but it would work for a whimsical line of products.

, Next, you need to create a logo that establishes your brand. A logo tells your customer something about your brand. You can use a text-based logo or a picture-type logo that shows what you do. Whatever you choose, your logo should say who you are to your customers.Your logo should establish not only what your brand is, but also it should show the type of company you are. In other words, if you're selling high-end products, your logo needs to be sophisticated, while if you're selling a family-friendly line, you need to design something more playful. In other words, your logo does some of the selling for you.
Keep it simple. If it's too complicated, it will clutter up your packaging and not send a clear message to your customers.
If you're not comfortable with design work, you can hire a designer to create a logo for you.

, A website represents your brand to your customers and establishes a web presence. The first thing you need to do with your website is to decide what its purpose is. It can be merely informational, redirecting customers to purchase items on other websites, but it can also be a place customers can shop, though an estore is a bit more complicated to set up. Either way, the end goal should be selling your product, whether on the website you create or on another website built for selling.You'll need to choose a domain name and a host. The domain name should reflect your business, but it must be unique. You'll need to purchase your name through a domain register, once you confirm no one else has the name you want. If you can't get the name you want, you might consider using a .net or .biz domain instead of a .com domain.
You'll also need to decide on a host. Generally, you'll pick a shared hosting site, where your website is hosted with other businesses, and you pay a yearly or monthly fee to stay on the server.
Once you've determined where to host your site, you need to build it. Once again, if you're not good on graphic design, you can hire a web designer. However, you can use any number of programs to help you design your own site without having to deal with code.
Make sure you provide enough information about your business, including an ""About"" section, as well as information about your ingredients. However, the information should be grouped into smaller chunks so it's more readable. Also, your site should be easy to navigate, so that customers can find what they need.

, Business cards are a physical item you can hand out for people to remember you with. They should feature your logo, your business name, your name, and contact information, such as your web address and email. You can also include a business phone if you would like. Hand out business cards wherever you are selling products to help people remember you.Business cards can also help with repeat customers. If someone likes your product, they have your information on your business card, so they can easily purchase your product again.

Make an oil cleanser.,
Rub the cleanser into your facial skin.,
Steam your facial skin.,
Experiment with other oils.",How to Remove Oil from Your Face2," Washing off oil with oil may sound weird, but using oil as a cleanser is the best way to remove the oil that's already there. To make your own oil cleanser, mix these ingredients and store them in a jar:


2 parts castor oil
1 part extra virgin olive oil
A few drops of your favorite essential oil, like lavender or lemon

, Saturate a cotton ball or pour some of the oil mixture directly onto your hand. Rub the oil gently into your skin in a circular motion, concentrating on the areas that are the oiliest., Wet a washcloth with hot water. Gently apply it to your face, letting it steam your skin for about a minute. Use it to wipe away the oil, and with it the dirt, makeup and dead skin cells that were clogging your pores.








, Olive oil has the same pH as your skin's oil, so it's the perfect cleanser. However, all skin is unique, and some skin types respond well to different types of oil. Try the following options:


Coconut oil. Many people use this as both a moisturizer and a cleanser.
Tea tree oil. It's good to add a few drops of this if your skin is prone to acne, since it's a natural antibiotic.Flaxseed oil. This light oil is great for all skin types.

"
Wash your face less often.,
Remove your makeup every night.,
Don't use drying products.,
Use makeup that won't cause your face to produce more oil.,
Finished.

",How to Remove Oil from Your Face3," The oil our faces naturally produce is called sebum. It's a beneficial oil that protects our skin and keeps it flexible and healthy. Washing it away too frequently results in your pores producing more oil to make up for what was lost. This overproduction is what leads to the appearance of oily skin. To prevent this from happening:


Wash your face (with oil) just once a day. If you need to remove oil in between washings, use blotting paper instead of washing your face.
Moisturize your face after washing it. If your face gets too dry, your pores will produce oil to make up for it.
It may take a few days of using this new routine for your face to balance out.

, Wash your face every night before going to bed. It's important to remove makeup and the dust from the day before you go to sleep at night, so that your pores don't get clogged. There's no need to wash it again in the morning.








, Using soaps and facial cleansers in an attempt to get rid of your face's oil will cause your pores to produce extra to make up for it. Wean yourself off of your soap-based facial cleansers, especially those containing harsh cleaning agents like sodium laurel sulfate.


It's better to wash your face with plain water than to use a facial cleanser. Use the oil cleansing method when your face needs a deep cleansing.
If you're worried about acne, use tea tree oil and other natural methods instead of resorting to harsh cleansers, which tend to irritate acne more.

, Choosing your makeup wisely is a big part of oil control. Caking on the makeup isn't going to solve the problem, so use it sparingly. Go for matte foundation and mineral powders to help absorb the oil and keep your face from looking shiny.

Have laser hair removal treatments.,
Get electrolysis.,
Epilate with needles.,
See your doctor.",How to Remove Stomach Hair2," If you do not want to deal with stomach hair in the long run, get your hair removed with laser treatments, which use a pulse of light to destroy hair follicles. Although it requires multiple treatments, laser hair removal can provide extended hair-free periods or completed removal of your stomach hair.Laser hair removal is most effective on individuals with light skin and dark hair because it is easier for the laser to penetrate the hair follicle with these conditions.Laser hair removal is a medical procedure and should be done under the supervision of a doctor or trained professional for best results and to help minimize the risk of burning your skin.The number of treatments you require depends on how much hair you have. You may need four to six treatments scheduled approximately six weeks apart.Laser hair removal doesn’t always guarantee permanent hair removal and may require periodic maintenance treatments.The Food and Drug Administration has approved at-home laser devices for hair removal below the neck. Talk to your doctor to see if this is a viable option for you, knowing that performing laser treatments at home comes with significant risks., Like laser treatments, electrolysis is a medical procedure that destroys hair growth, though it uses shortwave radio instead of light. Electrolysis can effectively and permanently remove hair from your stomach area.Electrolysis involves a thin probe being placed under the skin and into the hair follicle. A pulse of shortwave radio is then sent through the probe to destroy the follicle.You will likely require a series of treatments over a period of time to fully remove your stomach hair.Have electrolysis done by a medical or trained electrolysis professional to minimize your risk of infection from unsterile needles or scarring from bad technique., Similar to both lasers and electrolysis, needle epilation uses an electric current to destroy hair follicles. This can be an effective and permanent way to remove smaller amounts of stomach hair, though not necessarily practical for something who requires extensive removal.Needle epilation involves inserting a fine wire close to the hair shaft under the skin. Your doctor or epilation professional will then send an electric current down the wire to destroy the hair at the base of the follicle.After this, she may use tweezers to remove loosened hairs.You may also require a series of treatments with needle epilation to remove all of your stomach hair.

, If your stomach hair is especially bothersome or doesn’t go away with treatments, it may be a sign of an underlying medical condition such as hirsutism.Schedule an appointment with your doctor to ensure that you do not have any condition that may be affecting the efficacy of your hair removal treatments.Hirsutism is a condition in women and some men that presents as unwanted male-pattern hair growth in women as a result of excess androgens including testosterone.Hypertrichosis is a condition that presents with excessive hair growth on some part of the body that is not related to androgens.There are few treatments available to persons with hypertrichosis and the results are often unsatisfactory.In most cases, doctors suggest hair removal procedures to alleviate excessive hair growth associated with hypertrichosis."

Determine the product you want to make.,
Educate yourself on ingredients.,
Create your line through trial and error.,
Pick from already established lines.",How to Sell Skin Care Products5," When making a product, you need to decide what your angle will be. Maybe you want to use all-natural ingredients or maybe you're focus is on a particular type of ingredient. Maybe you want to create high-end luxurious products or maybe you want to focus primarily on products a family could use. You have to figure out what will make your product stick out from others in the skincare industry.Figuring out an angle will help you sell your product, as it will not only give you a niche, it can help you determine how you will market your product.

, Many people are concerned about what is in their skincare products. You need to research what ingredients cause concern for people and decide if you want to include those ingredients or not. If you do, you must be willing to defend why you added that ingredient. You also need to know what ingredients are best for moisturizing, what works well for sensitive skin, and what works best for oily skin.Certain ingredients become trendy at times, so make sure that the ingredients you use are a part of the trend to help sell your product.
Once again, figuring out the best ingredients to use gives you an edge when selling, as more people are likely to gravitate to your products if you're using trendy ingredients.

, Work on creating your skincare line through a process of trial and error. You can use books and internet research to help you get started on your recipes, and you can ask friends to try out your products to see how they like them.Remember that it often takes a lot of trials to figure out the perfect recipe. Don't be afraid to mix things up to get a better result.

, If you're looking to sell from home or to your friends and family, you have many options to choose from, as many skincare lines are designed to be sold by people like you. Compare the different lines to see which one you like best, based on the product, the startup costs, and how much of the commission you get to keep.You can use comparison websites to look at different companies and what they pay, such as http://work-at-home.careertrends.com/d/p/Skincare-Products.
It can also be good to use a company you already trust. If you use products from a direct sales skincare line, look into selling for the company yourself.
Search for reviews. Look for reviews of the product, and make sure they're mostly positive. Also, make sure to look for information from other sellers to see if they like the company and the product.
Ask questions. When you meet with someone who could be your sponsor, ask them how much money they made in the last year with the company, what expenses they had, and how much time they spent on their business.

You can discuss your options to see what works best for you.Your doctor may prescribe an acid lotion, either lactic acid lotion (such as AmLactin or Lac-Hydrin), salicylic acid lotion (such as Salex lotion), retinoic acid products (such as Retin-A or Differin), urea cream (such as Carmol 10, 20, or 40), or alpha hydroxy acid lotion (such as Glytone).These acids help dissolve the hard, scaly outer layer of your skin, reducing the appearance of keratosis pilaris.Your doctor may also prescribe a steroid cream (such as triamcinolone 0.1%), which can reduce redness.;
, If other treatments do not work, your doctor may try an emollient-based steroid creams. Some creams in this class are Cloderm and Locoid Lipocream. You can only use these creams for about a week., Basically, this treatment uses light and photosensitizer that you apply to your skin to work on the condition; however, using it for keratosis pilaris is an off-label use, so it may not be covered by your insurance.Remember you can't actually cure this condition — you can only make it better., Though lack of vitamin A does not necessarily cause keratosis pilaris, it can cause you to exhibit similar symptoms.Ask your doctor for a blood test and about whether a vitamin A supplement can help., Do not use hot water when bathing or showering, as hot water dries out the skin and causes this particular skin condition to worsen. In addition, limit how long you are in the shower, as showering strips your body of its natural oils., The best soaps are mild ones that have added oils. Look for ""added moisturizers"" or ""moisturizing"" on the package. Skip ones that have antibacterial properties or that have added scents or alcohol.In fact, it may be best to skip soap altogether and go for cleansers instead., You don't want to scrub your skin raw. However, using a light exfoliant can help. An exfoliant just sloughs off the top layer of dead skin. You can try a loofah or washcloth with your soap; reserve pumice stones for really rough areas, such as your feet., Every time you hop in the shower, make sure you use a moisturizer when you get out. The same holds for when you wash your hands. When you get your body wet, you need to be applying a moisturizer. Washing skin can remove natural oils, and applying a moisturizer immediately can help trap the water near your skin, providing moisture.Apply your moisturizer while the skin is still damp, just after showering.
If you're having trouble with dry skin, pick a moisturizer that includes an oil or fat to help moisturize your skin., In addition to applying moisturizer after you shower, you should also apply it throughout day. Try applying it both when you get up and when you go to bed., Natural fabrics are better for your skin because they allow air in. The exception to the rule is wool, which can be itchy. Stick to cotton or silk., When picking out your detergent, look for ones that are free of dyes. Dyes can irritate your skin. Similarly, it's good to pick one that's scent-free for the same reason., A humidifier can help moisturize your skin, especially if you live in a dry climate. The ideal humidity for your home is between 30 and 50 percent. If your home falls below that range, you should be using a humidifier to help your dry skin.If you need to test the humidity, you can find hygrometers at your local hardware store. They look and work basically like a thermometer. Some humidifiers come with a hygrometer attached., It's important to keep your humidifier clean because otherwise it can breed bacteria and fungus, making you sick. One step you can take to help keep it clean is to use distilled water, as it doesn't contain minerals that can encourage bacteria to grow.Change out the water everyday if possible. To change out the water, unplug the unit. Pour out the water. Dry it out, and then refill with clean water.Clean it out completely every three days. Unplug the unit. Make sure the unit doesn't have mineral deposits by using hydrogen peroxide on it (3 percent). Rinse it out afterwards., Humidifiers can build up bacteria over time. If you have an old one around the house, consider replacing it., The point is to help your skin, and it can't do that if it's in a room you're not in much. A good choice is your living room or bedroom. If you can, consider having one in each room.

Enjoy your soft, sleek feet!",How to Remove Dry Skin from Your Feet Using Epsom Salt," Epsom salt is available at most drug stores. You’ll likely find it in the same section as painkillers (aspirin, ibuprofen etc.) and bandages, since it’s often used for muscle aches. Make sure that the packaging of your Epsom salt specifies that they are suitable for human use (in the USA, the package would show a USP designation).All Epsom salt contains the same naturally occurring minerals (magnesium and sulfate), but there are different “grades” depending on how you intend to use the Epsom salt (for example, “human use” or “agricultural applications”).;
, Foot baths (also known as pedicure bowls) or appropriately sized wash basins should be easy to find at your local department stores or big-box stores (also known as superstores). They might also be available at larger drugstores.


If you’re on a budget, a wash basin will be cheaper than a foot bath. As it is not specifically designed for feet, make sure you buy something large enough to comfortably fit both your feet (you might even try standing in it in the store). Ensure that you also consider the depth of the basin — you’ll want the water to reach just above your ankles.
If you buy a foot bath/pedicure bowl, make sure that you’re able to put ingredients besides water into the tub before you buy it.

, There are many types of pumice stones available. They should be easy to find at your local drugstores or superstores. Some pumice stones just look like a stone, others come on rope, and others come on sticks. None are inherently better than the others; just choose what you like the best.


Avoid natural-looking pumice stones, which are hard like rocks. If you don’t use a pumice stone specifically made for beauty purposes, you’ll risk damaging your skin.

, Will you do it in the living room while watching TV? Will you do it in the bathroom while listening to music or reading a book? Wherever you decide to soak your feet, ensure that you’ve got the area properly set up before moving on to the next steps.

, If you are on tiles or hardwood, place a towel on the floor so that you won’t slip on any water that might spill as you soak and exfoliate your feet. If you are on carpet, you may want to put the basin/foot bath on a place mat or some other form of waterproof material to protect your carpet.

, Before soaking your feet in the foot bath, give them a quick wash to remove any excess dirt. Stand in your bathtub or shower, get your feet wet, soap them up, and rinse them.


Be sure to use a mild soap that won’t irritate the skin of your feet.

, Be sure to wash between your toes, around your ankles, and at the tops of your feet in addition to your soles. This is particularly important if you’re often barefoot or in sandals.

, As you do so, pay attention to any particularly dry areas of your feet, as they might be less obvious once they’re in the bath. You’ll want to remember them for when you exfoliate your feet later.

, Use the hottest water that you can tolerate without scalding your feet. Be careful not to over fill it; leave enough room for your feet, which will displace water once you put them in the basin/foot bath.


Check to make sure you can tolerate the water before adding the Epsom salt to avoid wasting the salt if you later need to dump some hot water out and add some cool water.
If you have a foot bath/pedicure tub, consider taking advantage of additional settings like vibrations to boost your experience.

, How much you need to add will vary depending on the volume of water you’re adding it to. For a standard-sized foot bath (or foot bath-sized basin), add 1/2 a cup of Epsom salt.

, Place them into the basin carefully, making sure that the water isn’t too hot and that it’s not spilling out of the tub. Once your feet are in the tub, you can move them around gently to help mix the Epsom salt into the water.

, When they’ve reached this stage, they’re ready to be exfoliated.

, Add a small amount of hot water to a handful of Epsom salt and combine them until they form a paste. Massage the paste into your feet for a couple of minutes to help remove rough skin.Don’t forget to exfoliate around your toes and the backs of your heels where dead skin may be less apparent.

, Rinse off the paste by dipping your feet back into the foot bath after you’ve applied the exfoliating Epsom salt scrub.

, Lift your feet out of the tub — you do not need to dry them beforehand. Ensure that you’ve wet the stone before you use it on your feet. Applying light to medium pressure, rub the pumice stone on the wet, callused parts of your feet for 2 to 3 minutes to remove dead skin.Rubbing too hard with a pumice stone can result in irritated skin and infection.It shouldn’t hurt, so if it begins to, either rub more gently or, if your skin is very irritated, stop all together until it heals.
You can use a pumice stone daily, but be sure to rinse it after every use. If it looks particularly worn, try boiling it or, if that doesn’t seem to refresh it, replace it.If you can’t find or don’t want to use a pumice stone, you can also purchase a foot file at most drugstores and superstores. You use it much like a pumice stone, rubbing it against the callused parts of your feet with gentle to medium pressure, and backing off if it hurts.

, If your foot bath is still clean — not full of dead skin flakes — you can put your feet back into the bath to give them a final rinse before drying them off. If the bath is full of dead skin bits or if you just feel cleaner rinsing with clean water after the soak, place your feet under a tap and rinse your feet using lukewarm water.


Some people claim that Epsom salt is detoxifying, and that it is necessary to rinse after soaking in an Epsom salt bath so as to remove the toxins that have come to the surface of your skin. There is little to no scientific evidence to show this is true, but it also doesn’t hurt to rinse!, Wrap your feet in a towel to soak up most of the water, then pat them dry. Avoid rubbing your feet as this might irritate your skin.

, After drying your feet, apply a moisturizing lotion. What you use will depend on your own preference, but it’s best to use something with little to no scent.


If your feet aren’t super cracked or dry, you can get away with a lighter moisturizer; if they’re very dry, you might want to use something heavier or even made specifically for cracked, dry feet.
A popular recommendation on beauty websites is to apply petroleum jelly to your feet and cover your feet up with socks before bed.

, Depending on how rough your feet are, it may take more than one soak to get them soft. If you consistently follow these steps two to three times per week, you should see results within one to two weeks.

, Don’t stop once you’re happy with your feet. Keeping your feet soft over the long term means continuing to take care of them; however, you may not have to soak your feet as often.

Remove the dye as soon as possible.,
Apply baking soda or toothpaste containing baking soda.,
Use olive oil, baby oil, or an oil-based moisturizer.,
Combine laundry detergent and dish soap.,
Try hairspray or vinegar.,
Avoid harsh products like nail polish remover.",How to Remove Dye from Skin1," Once you finish dying your hair, you need to act fast to remove any dye on your hands or on your hairline so it does not soak into your skin. Dye that is absorbed into your skin will be very difficult to remove and require a lot of scrubbing., Baking soda is great at breaking down the dye’s active ingredients and is only mildly abrasive. It will act like an all natural scrub for your hands and your hairline.However, if you have sensitive skin, only apply a little baking soda mixed with water to your skin and rub lightly. If your skin turns red or feels irritated, try a different method.
You can add lemon juice to the baking soda and water for a more powerful all natural stain remover.

, Most commercial dyes will break down when you apply oil-based products on them and lift off of your skin. Olive oil, baby oil, or an oil-based moisturizer all work well to help remove dye. They are also good options if you have sensitive skin.Dip a cotton ball into the oil and rub it on the dyed area on your skin for several minutes.
Rinse it off with warm water. Check if the dye is still on your skin. If so, apply the oil-based product again and let it soak for a longer period of time before rubbing and washing off the oil.
You can also leave the baby oil or olive oil on your dyed skin overnight to allow the oil to break down the dye. Place a towel over your pillow so you do not get dye on your pillow case. Rinse the oil and the dye off in the morning with warm water., The properties in laundry detergent will act fast to remove the dye. However, it may be too harsh for the delicate skin on your face. Use unscented dish soap for the skin on your face if you do not have sensitive skin.Place a small amount of detergent on a damp wash cloth and rub it on your dyed skin. If you think detergent will be too harsh for your skin, use a small amount of dish soap on a damp wash cloth to try to rub off the dye on your skin.
If you notice any redness or skin irritation, stop using the mixture.

, Both of these options are confirmed home remedies that can remove dye from your skin. Hairspray and vinegar remove dead skin cells, including dye, and allow fresher skin to appear, like an exfoliant.Use a cotton ball to apply a small amount of hair spray or vinegar to the stained area. Rub in small circles to remove the dye.
Reapply as needed.
If you experience irritation or redness from the products, stop using them and try something milder.

, Nail polish remover contains ingredients that can be too harsh on your skin, especially the delicate skin on your face. Instead, use a remedy made for sensitive skin, like an oil based solution."

Figure out what type of face skin you have.,
Purchase products with great ingredients for your skin type.,
Wash and prep your face for lotion.,
Pat your face with a clean, soft cloth until it is damp.,
Apply the appropriate amount of lotion onto your damp skin.,
Extend your lotion application to your neck.,
Let your lotion sink in.",How to Put On Lotion1," Lotions are formulated for the specific needs of different kinds of skin, so the first step is determining the type of skin your face has so you can buy the best product. If you have face lotion already, check the label to make sure it is the right product for what your skin is like now. Skin changes all the time due to things like weather and aging, so be sure you keep in mind what your skin is like currently. The different skin types are:Normal skin is neither dry nor oily and is not prone to blemishes or skin sensitivity or irritation.
Oily skin often looks shiny or greasy due to overactive oil glands in the face. This skin type is prone to blemishes and often has larger-appearing pores.
Dry skin suffers from a lack of oil and moisture, often appearing flaky with visible lines and reddish patches of skin.
Sensitive skin is commonly mistaken for dry skin because it also appears red and dry; however, irritation for sensitive skin types is caused by a particular ingredient in a skin care product and not a lack of oil production.
Combination skin is skin that has patches of oily areas and other areas that are more dry or normal. Most often combination skin is oilier on the forehead, nose, and chin and normal to dry on the rest of the face.;
, Now that you know what type of skin you have on your face, you want to purchase products with ingredients that are best suited for your skin needs. Certain ingredients are scientifically proven to help specific skin needs, so finding products that contain these will help maximize the benefits of the lotion. Some ingredients that are great for each skin type are:Normal skin: Look for cream-based moisturizers that contain vitamin C to help manage antioxidant damage. Avoid gels which will be too drying or thicker ointment creams that will be too heavy.
Oily skin: Use a lightweight, water-based gel formula, which absorb faster than other lotions. Look for ones containing zinc oxide, aloe barbadensis gel, or seaweed extract. Avoid products that contain alcohol and petrolatum.
Dry skin: Try thicker, cream-based lotions or heavy-duty ointments to help provide a thicker layer of protection from the elements. Look for ingredients like jojoba oil, sunflower seed oil, or rosehip seed oil. Avoid products that contain alcohol, which it too drying for dry skin.
Sensitive skin: Look for products that contain soothing ingredients like Echinacea, hyaluronic acid, and cucumber extract. Avoid products that contain chemicals, dyes, or perfumes.
Combination skin: Look for oil-free formulas containing panthenol, zinc oxide, and lycopene. These will help balance out the areas that are oily while providing moisture to areas that are dry.

, In order to be sure you are getting the maximum benefits from your lotion, you need to be sure your skin is prepped properly. You should wash your face twice a day, first thing in the morning and before bed, with a cleanser that is also designed for your particular skin type. Using clean hands or a clean washcloth, gently massage the cleanser into your skin with slow, circular motions. Once a week use an exfoliator in place of the cleanser to remove dead skin cells and buildup from the top layers of the skin, which can prevent the absorption of lotion and its active ingredients. Keep in mind:Be sure to keep the water temperature lukewarm. Water that is extremely hot can damage the skin, and cold water will close the pores, trapping dirt and bacteria inside the skin.
Avoid scrubbing too hard as this can cause skin irritation, redness, or breakouts.
Be sure to rinse your face thoroughly, as any remaining product can clog your pores and cause irritation and blemishes.

, Do not dry your face thoroughly. You also don’t want your face to be too wet because your lotion will just slide off when you apply it. You want your face to be damp because the ingredients in face lotions penetrate the skin better when they are dissolved. Applying lotion to damp skin will also create a seal on the top layer of the skin that holds in all of the hydration and nutrients. Be sure to change the towel or cloth regularly to avoid spreading old bacteria onto your newly washed skin., Because face lotions are tailored to specific skin types, the consistency of each lotion can vary greatly between lotions. Each product will come with recommendations for how much to apply, but typically thinner lotions require a little more product than thicker ones. Typically the amount of product will range from a pea-sized amount to a quarter-sized dollop. Using the right amount, gently apply the lotion in circular motions using your (clean) fingertips. For extra dry areas, lightly press the lotion into the skin as you apply it.Some additional tips include:


Avoid applying face lotion to the area around your eyes because it is very delicate and many moisturizers can be too rich. This can cause the eye skin to retain fluid and appear puffy. Only apply eye cream to the eye area.
It’s ideal if your face lotion has at least SPF 15 in it to help protect your skin throughout the day; however, avoid putting SPF lotion on your face at night because it can clog your pores and cause blemishes.

, Many people remember to put lotion on their face after cleansing, but the neck is often forgotten. The skin on your neck is more similar to the skin on your face than it is to the skin on your body, so including it in your face lotion routine is key.Using long, gentle strokes upward from the base of your neck to your jawline, apply face lotion to your neck after your cleanse your face each time. This will help keep the skin on your neck looking hydrated and youthful.

, After applying lotion to your face and neck, wait about 5 minutes before you put on your shirt, apply any makeup, or get into bed. You want to give the lotion time to sink in before doing anything that can disturb the hydrating seal the lotion creates on the upper layers of the skin. Applying makeup too soon can cause the cosmetic products to seep into your pores along with the lotion and clog your pores or appear streaky. If you get dressed too soon or lay your face down on a pillow, the cloth will absorb the lotion instead of the skin, and you won’t get the maximum benefits from the lotion."

Talk to your dermatologist about prescription skin medications.,
Investigate laser therapy.,
Consider cryosurgery to remove birthmarks.,
Look into surgical excision.,
Ask about a surgical shave.",How to Remove Birthmarks1," Oftentimes, you can get rid of a vascular birthmark (such as hemangiomas) by taking corticosteroids. Corticosteroids slow down the development of birthmarks and reduce their size but they do not actually remove the mark.Corticosteroids can be taken orally, injected into the birthmark, or used topically.
Other medications used for birthmarks include propranolol and vincristine, which are used for hemangiomas (see the last section below for more details).;
, Laser therapy can help to reduce the size and halt the development of vascular birthmarks. Laser therapy involves the application of focused, short laser light bursts to the birthmark and can be used to lessen the color, reduce the size, and even stop certain birthmarks from growing.Laser therapy can be used to remove port-wine stains and café au lait spots but is not always successful, causing the spots to return.Although total removal of birthmarks may be impossible, they can be lightened considerably after several sessions of laser therapy.
Laser therapy can be an effective treatment method, but it can also be very expensive.

, Cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and fade spots, causing them to peel off.During the procedure, liquid nitrogen is applied on the mark to freeze the skin on and under the spot. Then, the skin is scraped off using an instrument known as curette.
Complications of cryosurgery include scarring and lightened skin color.

, Skin surgery can be done as an outpatient procedure and only involves a removal of very limited amounts of outer skin. Although surgical removal of skin is considered a minor procedure, it is still invasive and a preoperative assessment of the patient should be done by the doctor.Surgery can be done to remove moles and hemangiomas
Depending on the size of the birthmark, surgery may leave a permanent scar.
During the procedure, your doctor will provide a local anesthesia to numb the area and then removes the birthmark with a scalpel. The skin is then stitched together using dissolving suture.
Surgical excision is often intended for deeper birthmarks.

, A surgical shave is an incision done without the need for stitches. It is performed either through the use of a traditional blade or an electric cautery machine.During the procedure, your doctor uses local anesthesia to numb the area around the mark and then cuts the area around and beneath the birthmark with a small scalpel.
Surgical shaving is often used for smaller moles or skin tags and rarely needs sutures.

Talk to your hairdresser about a professional stain removal product.",How to Remove Dye from Skin2," If you are not able to get stubborn hair dye off your skin, consider investing in an over-the-counter stain remover. Many drug stores sell stain removers that can remove excess color from the ends of your hair, any stains on your clothes, and any stains on your skin.

, For very easy application, look for hair dye remover wipes at your local drug store. These wipes dissolve any color stains on your skin and are often made with products that will not irritate your skin.

Consider using natural hair dyes.,
Finished.

",How to Remove Dye from Skin3," The first step to avoiding dye on your skin is to be prepared before you do a home dye. Buy a pair of latex or plastic gloves to protect your hands. Lay down a plastic sheet or newspaper to protect the surfaces around your dye area, and wear old clothes you won’t mind staining.After you dye your hair, you should also use a plastic hair cap to protect your hair and avoid getting dye on your skin or your clothing.

, Another great tip is to create a home skin protector around your hairline so the dye cannot be absorbed by your skin.Use products like Vaseline petroleum jelly, an oil based lotion, or even lip balm. Apply the product with your fingers around your hairline, behind your ears, and on the back of your neck so its more difficult for dye to get on your skin in these areas.

, Natural hair dye, like henna, are usually less difficult to remove from your skin than commercial dyes. Most henna stains will dissolve from your skin within 48 hours and do not contain any toxic ingredients that could get into your skin.,"

Figure out what skin type your body is.,
Purchase body lotion with active ingredients for your skin type.,
Prepare your body for lotion.,
Pat yourself dry with a clean, soft towel until you are damp.,
Apply lotion immediately.,
Let the lotion sink in.",How to Put On Lotion2," Just like with your face, you want to use a lotion that is designed for your particular skin type. Don’t assume your body has the same skin type as your face either. Sometimes the skin on your body is drier or more acne prone than the skin on your face, and determining the distinct skin type that your body is currently is important., As with face lotions, you want to look for body lotions that include the best ingredients for moisturizing your skin type. This is why it’s especially important to first determine your body skin type, since assuming it is the same as your face could mean applying ingredients that could damage the skin or cause breakouts. Some ingredients that are great for each skin type are:Normal skin: Look for thicker lotions or moisturizing creams that include ingredients like vitamin C to help manage antioxidant damage and vitamin E to satiate thirsty skin. Licorice as an ingredient will also help reduce any pigmentation damage.
Oily skin: Use lightweight, non-greasy formulas, especially ones that are fast absorbing or contain witch hazel, which is a great natural ingredient for reducing excess oil production and body acne by unclogging pores. Avoid thick, greasy products or ones that contain alcohol or petrolatum.
Dry skin: Look for thick cream-based lotions or healing ointments, especially ones that contain shea butter or coconut oil, two intensely moisturizing ingredients that repair the skin’s moisture barrier. Avoid products that contain alcohol, which will dry out the skin further.
Sensitive skin: Look for products that contain soothing ingredients like Echinacea to sooth the skin and avocado oil, which contains fatty acids and tons of vitamin B to moisturize the skin and regulate cell function. Avoid products that contain chemicals, dyes, or perfumes.
Combination skin: Look for oil-free formulas containing panthenol, zinc oxide, and lycopene. Avoid thick creams and water-based gels, which will be too heavy or drying for the combination areas.

, Though the skin on your body is not as delicate as the skin on your face, you still need to properly prep your skin for lotion in order to get the maximum benefits. You want to shower or bathe every day, washing your body with a cleanser for your body skin type. Use a clean washcloth or loofah to gently scrub your body clean using circular motions. You should also use a body exfoliator in place of the cleanser twice a week to get rid of dead skin cells and product buildup so that your lotion can sink in better. Keep in mind:Limit your showers to 5 - 10 minutes to avoid stripping your skin of any moisturizing properties in the cleanser.
Only use water that is warm-to-hot in temperature. You want the water to be slightly hotter than the water you use to wash your face, but water that is too hot will strip your skin of its natural oils.
Rinse your body thoroughly so no product remains to clog your pores or cause irritation and blemishes.
Shaving also exfoliates the skin, so skip exfoliating on days where you shaved your legs, neck, or other areas.

, Just like with your face, you do not want to towel off completely. You want your skin to remain a little damp to help your lotion absorb fully and lock in moisture. Don’t open the bathroom door yet either so that you keep all of the humid air inside the bathroom. The combination of damp, warm skin and moist air will help activate the ingredients in your lotion and keep your skin looking its best., Taking into consideration the consistency of the lotion and the directions on the product, pump or squeeze a suitable amount of lotion into your hands. You don’t want to pump lotion for your entire body into your hands all at once; you want to focus on one area of your body at a time. Rub your hands together to warm up the lotion and then apply it to your body. Gently press the lotion into your skin with slow sweeping motions, focusing your application on areas that are particularly dry, like the knees and elbows., Before you exit the steamy bathroom or put on clothes, give the lotion about 5 minutes to sink into your skin. The humidity will keep your pores open, which will allow the lotion to sink in faster and hydrate your skin better. Putting clothes on or wrapping a towel around yourself too soon will wipe away the lotion you just applied, and you will lose all of the moisturizing benefits."

Consider your skin needs.,
Use eye cream around the eyes.,
Moisturize the hands and cuticles.,
Put lotion on your feet before bed.,
Don’t forget your lips.",How to Put On Lotion3," The skin on your face and body is easily affected by things like stress, weather, and age, so it’s not uncommon to have a variety of products to address these changing needs. When you shop for lotions, consider what your skin goals are and find a lotion that helps you achieve that goal. In addition to products that treat the standard skin types, you can also find products geared towards:Firming or toning
Self-tanning
Acne treatment
Age defying or preventative treatments
Wrinkle reducing
Eczema treatment

, Many face moisturizers are too rich for the eye area, which is some of the most delicate skin on the body. Treating this skin roughly or with the wrong products can cause wrinkling and sagging of the skin prematurely. Using a lotion specifically designed for the eye area, dot the cream under your eye from the inner to outer corner with your ring finger. The ring finger has the lightest touch, and this dotting motion will reduce the amount of pressure and pull on the skin. Still with the ring finger, finish distributing these dots of lotion by gently patting the lotion into the skin., Because you are constantly using your hands throughout the day, the skin on your hands is exposed to a lot of moisture-wicking abuse. Washing your hands and antibacterial hand sanitizers especially deplete the skin on your hands of natural oils, which can cause dryness, redness, and cracking. To help combat dryness and keep your hands soft and supple, apply lotion to your hands several times throughout the day, especially after washing or sanitizing them. A lotion specifically designed for hands is best because these lotions are often thicker than other options, which helps them stay on to moisturize your hands as much as possible., Even though you’re on your feet all day, many people forget to put lotion on their feet as well. Like the hands, your feet take a lot throughout the day and also have delicate cuticles that need to be cared for. Extremely dry feet can crack at the heel and be extremely painful or unsightly. To help combat heel cracks and dry, scaly feet, apply a thick lotion to your feet when you get into bed. This way your feet have all night to absorb the moisturizing nutrients. For best results, you can put on a pair of thick socks after applying lotion to reduce the lotion wiping off on your sheets., The skin on your lips is also extremely delicate and prone to dryness. Smiling, talking, and exposure to the wind and sun can really dry out your skin, especially your lips. Many people only notice that their lips are dry once they are already peeling, so try to be proactive in your treatment of this delicate area and apply lip balm before your lips are dried out. Try to find a lip balm that includes natural oils like coconut oil or argan oil for maximum suppleness."

Apply olive oil to moisturize your skin.,
Put tomato juice on your birthmark.,
Investigate vitamin A cream to promote skin cell regeneration.,
Apply vitamin E oil onto the skin.",How to Remove Birthmarks2," Lemon juice contains ingredients that can naturally lighten the skin. However, the efficacy of lemon juice in treating birthmarks has not been scientifically confirmed and thus, you should use this method with reservations.Apply fresh lemon juice on the birthmark for 20 minutes and rinse off. Repeat several times a week.
Do not use if the lemon juice causes skin irritation.
Keep in mind that you will probably have to repeat this treatment (or any home remedy) many times over many months to see an improvement. You may be better off speaking with a dermatologist about medical treatment options if you want to remove a birthmark.

, Iodine may help fade birthmarks but again, this method has not been scientifically proven. Apply iodine solution over the spot twice daily.However, remember that iodine solution is a medical product and should be used with caution. Also, avoid using this treatment if you have an allergy to iodine or shell fish.
Do not use if any irritation occurs and consult your doctor if you have any concerns.

, Olive oil is a powerful natural moisturizer that can restore skin and make birthmarks appear softer and smoother. Apply olive oil at least three times over the spot, leave on to dry or rinse off.Use a cotton ball to apply the oil directly onto the birthmark 2 to 3 times a day.

, Tomato juice has skin bleaching properties and may help fade birthmarks. Apply slightly warm tomato juice on the spot and let it air-dry. Repeat a few times a day for a month.Make sure that the tomato juice is not too hot or you may burn your skin.

, Vitamin A stimulates mitotic activity (cell division) and the production of collagen (the protein that builds the skin). Although vitamin A creams (often called Retinol) are used to treat hyperpigmentation, their efficacy in lightening birthmarks is not known., The antioxidant properties of vitamin E may help with birthmarks. Mix vitamin E oil with orange oil and apply over the birthmark."

Identify if your birthmark is a café au lait.,
Know if you have Mongolian spots.,
Diagnose macular stains.,
Spot a port-wine stain.,
Identify if you or your child has hemangiomas.",How to Remove Birthmarks3," A mole (also called congenital nevi) is a pigmented birthmark (caused by an overgrowth of the melanin-producing cells) on the skin that generally appears during childhood. The typical characteristics of moles include:Tan, brown, red, pink, blue or black color.
Smooth, flat, wrinkled or raised texture.
Oval to round shape.
Typically less than 1/4 inch in diameter but sometimes moles can be bigger.
Sometimes moles have hair growing on them.
Most moles are harmless but in rare cases they can become cancerous. Monitor your moles and contact your doctor if their appearance changes.

, These pigmented birthmarks are sometimes caused by a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis. This condition is divided into three distinct types; the mildest form (neurofibromatosis 1) appears in childhood and is characterized by flat, light brown-colored birthmarks on the skin:Café au lait spots can be present at birth or appear during childhood and then stabilize. They can be treated with lasers but often return.In addition to birthmarks, neurofibromatosis 1 may be characterized by freckling in the armpit, soft bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas or benign tumors), tiny, harmless bumps on the eye (called Lisch nodules), and/or bone deformities.
The two other types (neurofibromatosis 2 and 3) are much less common than the first type and are characterized by more serious symptoms and tumors.
If you suspect your child has neurofibromatosis, consult the pediatrician. Neurofibromatosis can't be cured, but your child’s pediatrician will monitor the complications and treat the symptoms., These are pigmentation birthmarks in children that commonly disappear when the child reaches school age. Typical characteristics of Mongolian spots include:Blue or blue-gray-colored spots on the buttocks, back, spine, shoulders, or other areas.
Flat and irregular shape.
The skin texture is normal.
Typical size is between 2 and 8 centimeters wide.
Because these marks disappear on their own, no treatment is recommended., Also known as salmon patches, stork bites or angel kisses, these are faint red vascular birthmarks (a result of blood vessels not forming correctly) most commonly present on the forehead, eyelids, back of the neck, nose, upper lip, or on the back of the head.They are characterizes by flat, light pink patches on the skin.
Macular stains typically fade away on their own by the time your child is 1 to 2 years old but some may last into adulthood.

, This is a vascular birthmark that usually is permanent and does not disappear on its own. However, some treatments can make these marks less noticeable.Laser treatment, such as the pulsed dye laser, is the only way to reduce the appearance of port wine stains. Laser treatment can lighten the mark but often works better in children.
You can also try to use cosmetics to hide these birthmarks if laser treatment proves unsuccessful.

, These are vascular birthmarks that appear within a couple weeks after birth and are often found on the head and neck.Hemangiomas are characterized by skin discoloration that may disappear within few months after birth or can take up to 12 years to fade away.Hemangiomas in the eye and mouth may cause complications, such as ulcers, and sometimes they can appear on the internal organs (stomach, kidneys and liver).
Consult your doctor if you suspect your child has internal hemangiomas that may cause complications.
Most hemangiomas can be treated or shrunk with medical treatment, such as oral propranolol, steroids or vincristine. In some cases, plastic surgery may be needed."

Don't avoid the sun too often out of fear, but try to limit your direct exposure, especially during the summer between 10am and 3pm.In most climates, you can get your daily requirement of vitamin D by spending just three to eight minutes in the sun with your arms and legs exposed.If you have lighter skin, you don't have to stay out as long as darker-skinned people. Don't stay out long enough for your skin to turn pink.
If you have to be outside longer, cover up with a hat, sunglasses, lip balm containing sunscreen, and long sleeved clothes. Don't forget to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, and stay in the shade as much as possible.
If you get a bit of sunburn on your skin, apply some aloe vera gel — it's great for soothing inflamed skin and promoting healing.;
, Washing your skin and keeping it clean of dirt, debris, bacteria and other microbes is important for protecting it, but too much washing/scrubbing can damage sensitive skin. Aim for once daily and use gentle, hypoallergenic soap on your skin. Don't bathe or shower in hot water, because it can scald skin and draw moisture out of it, leading to dehydration and flaky skin.Too much bathing removes all the natural oils from your skin. These oils are needed for protection from microbes and to keep moisture in.
Gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel instead of rubbing it aggressively.
Exfoliate your skin on a regular basis also (weekly) with a mildly abrasive cleanser and an exfoliating pad, such as a loofah. Exfoliating removes dead skin (allowing the living cells underneath to breathe) and helps to prevent wrinkles.

, Smoking has a long list of health hazards, including lung cancer and stroke, but it also negatively impacts your skin — particularly facial skin.Yellow coloration, wrinkles and other signs of premature aging are common with cigarette smokers because they don't get enough oxygen from their lungs and they are putting more toxins into their bodies.Thus, protect your skin and other organs by quitting smoking as soon as you can.


Chewing tobacco is also very damaging to your body including your skin. Chew contributes to signs of premature aging by depriving the skin of oxygen due to its negative effect on the cardiovascular system and it is loaded with free radicals which damage cells.
Pipe and cigar smoking offer the same — if not greater — risks as smoking cigarettes., There is also a long list of health problems associated with alcohol abuse, particularly liver and pancreas cancers, but skin is susceptible to ethanol poisoning too.Patchy, puffy skin with many burst blood vessels just below the skin's surface are common signs of alcohol abuse; therefore, either stop drinking alcoholic beverages or limit your consumption to no more than one per 24-hour period.


Ethanol, the type of alcohol in beer, wine and spirits, is classified as a human carcinogen (cancer causing compound).
Red wine is often touted as the most beneficial alcoholic beverage because it contains antioxidants (resveratrol), but overdoing it is not good for your health.

, In addition to water, your skin also needs various nutrients to remain healthy. In general, you should eat food rich in antioxidants and limit your consumption of preservatives and artificial additives. Antioxidants are compounds found in fruits and veggies that prevent oxidation of ""free radicals,"" which damage tissues such as the skin.An overabundance of free radicals is linked to cancer and premature aging.


Compounds known as strong antioxidants include vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, selenium, glutathione, co-enzyme Q10, lipoic acid, flavonoids and phenols.Foods rich in antioxidants include virtually all dark-colored berries, strawberries, apples, dark cherries, artichokes, tomatoes, kidney beans, pinto beans and walnuts.
Preservatives are found in almost all prepared foods that have long shelf lives at grocery stores. Avoid foods that have long lists of chemicals on their ingredient labels.

, Another way of protecting your skin and making it healthy is from the inside out, which means putting all the necessary nutrients into your body. Eating nutritiously is obviously important for skin health (see above), but getting enough of specific vitamins, minerals and fats can be a challenge. As such, consider supplementing with biotin (vitamin B7), vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids to protect your skin.Biotin and other B-vitamins can help reduce skin dryness and flakiness.
Vitamin C is needed to make collagen, the elastic fibers in skin that allow it to stretch without ripping and it is also an antioxidant.
Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and allow your skin to produce its naturally protective oils.
Speak with your doctor or pharmacist before starting a supplement. They can react with other medications you may be taking.

, Keeping well-hydrated is also important for protecting skin and making it look healthy. Hydrated skin can better protect you from sunburn and help regulate body temperature more efficiently. At least eight 8-ounce glasses (2 liters) of water is recommended daily, although you might need more if you spend time outside when it's hot and humid.Some fresh squeezed fruit and/or veggie juice is healthy also and provides essential vitamins and minerals.


Avoid drinks with caffeine because they can actually dehydrate you in the long run. Coffee, black tea, soda pop (especially colas) and energy drinks all contain caffeine.
Bathing (especially in a bathtub) can be a source of hydration as long as the water is not too hot.

, Some form of sunscreen (the more natural the better) should be worn on your skin if you intend on spending significant time in the sun — it protects your skin from harmful UV radiation reduces your risk of skin cancers.Everyone defines ""significant time"" differently, but anything over 30 minutes in the sun needs protection of some sort, especially children who are more susceptible to burning.


Everyone should use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it every few hours while outdoors.Some newer sunscreens have SPFs of 45 or higher.
You should also reapply after you've been in the water or if you've been sweating.
The more sunburns you experience in your life, particularly while younger, the higher the risk of getting skin cancer in the future.
Although sunscreen blocks UV radiation, many products contain chemicals that increase your risk of skin cancer, so the advantages of always using it are not cut and dry.Sunscreen also blocks the production of vitamin D in your skin, which is needed for calcium absorption, strong bones and mood regulation.

, Keeping your skin moisturized will protect it from the outside elements and help to prevent dryness, flaking, irritation, itchiness and redness. After you jump out of the tub or shower, immediately apply generous amounts of moisturizing cream or lotion (such as Eucerin or Aquaphor) to your skin to seal in the moisture.Reapply moisturizer later in the day, especially if you have a sunburn or notice that your skin is dry and flaky. Have a skin care routine for your particular type of skin.


If you have oily skin, use a gentle purifying wash, a non-oily moisturizer, and a dry sunscreen. Look for moisturizers that are lotions, not creams, as these will contain more water.
If your skin is dry, use a hydrating wash and moisturizer, as well as a creamy sunscreen. Look for a moisturizer that is richer — a cream or milk — as the oil in these will hydrate your skin and shouldn't cause you to break out.
If your skin is in between the two extremes, use a gentle wash, an ordinary moisturizer and sunscreen.
Consider natural moisturizers that contain vitamins C and E, aloe vera, cucumber extract and/or calendula — all are great for protecting and repairing skin.Don't use butter, petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or other oil-based products regularly as moisturizers — they block skin pores and prevent heat and sweat from escaping., Protecting your skin from bug bites is also important, especially species that can transmit serious diseases, such as mosquitoes and ticks.In addition to possibly wearing long pants, long shirts, gloves and hats with special netting, apply insect repellent to your skin when you're outdoors — especially if you're near forests or standing bodies of water. Most repellents last for up to six hours and some are water resistant.


If you are also wearing sunscreen apply the sunscreen first, let it dry, then apply the insect repellent.
For protection against most insects and some spiders, use a repellent that contains 20% or more DEET (Off!, Cutter, Sawyer, Ultrathon).

, Skin is also susceptible to various irritants and allergens — any compound that triggers an allergic reaction, also called contact dermatitis. The skin produces lots of histamine in response to an allergen, which leads to inflammation, redness and sometimes hives (swollen and itchy welts). Common irritants include: nickel (found in costume jewelry), various fragrances, cosmetics, some sunscreens and rubber ingredients (especially latex).Instead of wearing a watch made of cheap metal that contains nickel, wear a leather or rubber band instead.
If much of your skin is irritated and itchy, particularly your legs, buttocks and upper arms, switch to a more natural laundry detergent and see if that helps.
If exposed to allergens, wash the affected area gently with mild hypoallergenic soap.
Occupations that trigger the most contact dermatitis include dental professionals, healthcare workers, florists, landscapers, hairdressers and machinists.

, Another common skin irritant you should consider protecting yourself from is chlorine, which is added to water as a disinfectant. Chlorine can cause severe dermatitis in some people (itchy red hives and bumps), but all people react negatively to it at high enough doses or concentrations.At higher doses, chlorine can really dry the skin, cause flakiness and give you mild chemical burns.


Buy a shower filter for your shower to reduce your exposure to chlorine. There are different types that use different compounds for filtration.
Take shorter and less frequent showers.
Take cooler showers to avoid exposure to chlorine gas present in steam.
Chlorine evaporates pretty quickly from hot water, so draw a really hot bath and let it cool down for 15 minutes or so to reduce the chlorine concentration.

, Skin is also susceptible to frostbite during cold weather. Frostbite is caused by freezing of the skin, which eventually leads to tissue death.With frostbite, your skin becomes very cold and red-colored, then it becomes numb, hard and pale. It's most common in fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin. As such, always keep these body parts covered when in cold weather.


Exposed skin in cold, windy and damp weather is most vulnerable to frostbite.
Dress in several layers of loose, warm clothing that's windproof and waterproof. The layers insulate your body parts from the cold.Wear mittens instead of gloves as they provide better protection and create more warmth for your fingers.
Always wear a hat or toque that fully covers your ears when in cold, windy weather. Heavy woolen or windproof materials (Gortex) provide great protection.

Avoid periods of peak sunlight.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Wear a hat and sunglasses.,
Use sunscreen.,
Seek shade whenever possible.",How to Prevent Tanning During Excessive Outdoor Activities1," Try to avoid scheduling the activity between the hours of 10 AM and 4 PM when the sun’s UV rays are the strongest. In addition to time of day, also keep in mind that UV rays are more intense:


At higher altitude
During the late spring and summer months
Closer to the equator
When reflected off of surfaces such as snow, ice, water, sand, and concrete;
, In tandem with the following steps, protective clothing can be one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from overexposure to UV rays during outdoor activities. The ideal clothing to protect you from the sun includes:


Bright- or dark-colored fabrics, which have a much higher Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) than light-colored clothing.
Densely woven, lightweight fabrics. If you can see light through the fabric, this also means that UV light is getting through to your skin!
Long sleeves and long pants will decrease skin exposure and provide the most protection. If you are wearing shorts, try to wear a longer pair that covers most of the thighs. For shirts, collared shirts can also help protect your neck from tanning.
Many brands specifically designed for sun protection offer their UPF rating on the label. Seek out a UPF rating of 30 and above for substantial protection from the sun., The skin on your face and your eyes are very sensitive to sun exposure, so additional precautions must be taken to protect them during outdoor activities. While many hats and sunglasses will help curb some of the risks, to most effectively reduce exposure risks with the use of a hat and sunglasses, choose:


A wide-brimmed hat (minimum of 3”), which will keep the sun off of the face, neck (front and back), and ears, as well as any bald spots or parts in the hair. Like protective clothing, the most effective hats will also be made of tightly-woven fabric that you cannot see light through when held up to the sun.
Sunglasses that provide 100% UV ray protection, particularly models indicating that they provide UVB and UVA protection. Do not assume that dark-tinted lenses provide more protection as light-tinted lenses; it is not the darkness of the lens that indicates its ability to protect the eye from sun damage, and many light-colored lenses provide UVB and UVA protection (if indicated on the label).Wraparound sunglasses are even better, as they provide UV ray protection to the entire eye area, including the delicate skin around the eye and the eyelid. By blocking 99 - 100% of UV rays, wraparound sunglasses most effectively help to prevent serious conditions like cataracts and melanomas of the eye., Sunscreen should be used every day to avoid sun exposure risks, but the use of sunscreen to avoid tanning during excessive outdoor activities is an absolute must, even if it is cloudy.When using sunscreen, consider the following for optimum protection:


Choose a sunscreen that is labeled as “broad spectrum” or “UVA/UVB protection” to shield your skin from both the UVB rays that tan and burn the skin, as well as the UVA rays that penetrate the skin more deeply and cause sun-induced skin aging, called photoaging.Choose a sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 15 or higher. If you have fair skin, you should consider choosing a higher minimum SPF of 30 to 50.
Apply 1 ounce (a golf ball-sized amount) of sunscreen 30 minutes before going outside, and then reapply every 2 hours or after swimming, sweating, or toweling off. Even if the sunscreen is labeled as “water-resistant” be sure to reapply often as this does not mean waterproof!
Be careful to apply sunscreen to your entire body, especially the most commonly missed area like the ears, back of the neck, lips, hairlines, and the tops of feet.

, Though shade does not block all UV rays, when combined with the other steps listed, shade can help provide relief from the heat and protection from the glare of reflected UV rays. When participating in outdoor activities, seek out areas of natural shade, or create your own shade with an umbrella or tarp to avoid as much UV exposure as possible during peak sunlight hours.

Wear protective clothing while gardening.,
Apply sunscreen to parts of your skin that will be exposed to direct sunlight.,
Protect your skin from mosquitoes and other pests.,
Apply moisturizer or lip balm to your lips.,
Familiarize yourself with poisonous types of plants.",How to Protect Your Skin While Gardening,"


Wear gardening gloves to protect the skin on your hands and arms from blistering, getting calluses, and from being cut or scraped by thorns or sharp plants.
Wear comfortable shoes or waterproof, rubber boots to prevent the skin on your feet from blistering in wet weather conditions.
Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to protect your skin from sunburn, windburn, and to prevent your skin from coming into direct contact with chemicals.
Wear a hat with a wide brim to protect the skin on your face and neck from being exposed to direct sunlight.;
,


Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 with moisturizer added to keep your skin soft.
Reapply the sunscreen to your skin on an hourly basis or as needed; especially in hot temperatures that can cause you to sweat and wear the sunscreen off your skin at a faster pace.

,


Wear clothing that is light in color, as mosquitoes and other insects are attracted to darker colors such as black, dark brown, navy blue, and dark purple.
Spray insect repellent on your exposed arms and legs or directly on your clothing as permitted by the manufacturer's instructions.

, This will provide your lips with protection against the sun and wind.


Use lip balm with ingredients that contain SPF or that provide your lips with UV protection against the sun.

, If your skin comes into contact with certain plants, they can cause you to experience a rash, extreme itchiness, or other unpleasant and potentially fatal symptoms.

Wear protective clothing despite the heat.,
Consider your surroundings.,
Reapply sunscreen more often than you think.",How to Prevent Tanning During Excessive Outdoor Activities2," While it may be tempting to wear minimal clothing to beat the heat during outdoor activities in the summer, exposing that much skin to the sun will result in tanning and possibly sunburn. Keep in mind that densely woven, lightweight fabrics will provide protection and shade the skin while running, biking, playing golf, and other outdoor activities.

, Depending on the type of outdoor activity you are participating in, different measures can be taken to increase protection against harmful UV rays.


Golf: With long hours on the course and increased UV reflections from the ponds and sand traps, you experience higher exposure to UV rays. Be sure to always wear a broad-brimmed hat (not a visor or a baseball hat!) and sunglasses, along with long pants or longer shorts and a shirt that minimally covers your shoulders and upper arms.
Tennis, Running, and Hiking: Due to the excessive perspiration that accompanies these activities, participants are at an increased risk of sweating off their sunscreen. Because of this, reapplication of sunscreen is not enough protection, and clothing and hats with a UPF of 30 or higher are necessary to provide extra defense from prolonged sun exposure.
Biking: Because of the posture your body is in while riding a bike, the back of the neck, the forearms, and the upper thighs receive much more sun exposure than the rest of the body. To avoid tanning or sunburn during a long bike ride, wear to-the-knee bike shorts, long sleeves, and a wide-brimmed hat and/or cover your neck with the collar of a shirt or a bandana.
Sailing and Swimming: These activities have some of the highest UV exposure levels due to excessive reflection of UV rays off of the water. In addition to protective clothing and liberal reapplication of sunscreen, sailors and swimmers are recommended to choose sunscreen brands that include zinc oxide or titanium dioxide because they block and reflect UV rays better than other types of sunscreen ingredients that absorb UV rays.

, It’s easy to forget to reapply sunscreen when you’re whipping down a bike trail or raising the jib on a sailboat, but sunscreen reapplication is one of the most important ways to prevent tanning during excessive outdoor activity. While the rule for normal activity is reapplication every two hours, be sure to apply more UVA/UVB sunscreen to all exposed skin areas after swimming, sweating, or toweling off.

"
"
Be aware that your skin is at risk even in cold weather.,
Take extra precaution when in higher altitudes.,
Understand the added effects of wind on your sunscreen.",How to Prevent Tanning During Excessive Outdoor Activities3," Many people assume that a sunburn or sun tan is only a threat when you feel the hot sun beating down on your skin, but this is not true. In fact, the white snow and ice reflect more UV rays than water, sand, and concrete, so exposed skin is at a higher risk during outdoor winter activities. Do not skip the sunscreen just because you’re not at the beach!

, UV ray exposure increases at higher altitudes, with altitudes of 9,000 - 10,000 feet having 35 - 45% more intense radiation exposure than at sea level.Between the increased UV exposure and the reflection of sun off of the snow and ice, your skin is doubly exposed to UV rays during outdoor winter activities.

, While sweat is the main reason for sunscreen wearing away during summer activities, being active outdoors in the winter means you have to contend with sweat, snow, and wind. To safeguard your skin during outdoor winter activities:


Choose a sunscreen that not only has UVA/UVB protection, but that also has a lot of moisturizer in it to combat windburn. Try to find a sunscreen with ingredients like lanolin or glycerin.
Don’t forget your lips! The skin on your lips is very delicate and prone to sunburn and windburn, so be sure to also wear a moisturizing lip balm with an SPF of 15 or higher.
When choosing protective winter clothes and gear, be sure to cover up as much skin as possible; wear a hat, gloves, balaclava or scarf for face and neck protection, and sunglasses or goggles that offer UV protection. A ski mask with UV protection is an especially prudent choice, as it covers much of the face.

Avoid rapid weight gain.,
Avoid rapid weight loss.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Prevent Stretch Marks1," Stretch marks are most likely to appear when you gain or lose a significant amount of weight in a short time. Research shows that traditional treatments like applying cocoa butter, olive oil or gotu kola extract to your skin are largely ineffective, and that the best way to prevent stretch marks is to control your weight, especially during times of growth such as pregnancy and adolescence.During adolescence, it is normal for your body to grow rapidly. Follow a healthy diet and talk to your doctor about what kind of growth to expect. Stretch marks that appear during adolescence are likely to fade in time because the body is still developing.Weightlifting and bodybuilding to gain weight and/or increase muscle mass can also cause stretch marks if it happens too quickly.This is because the rapid growth in size causes the connective tissues of the skin to break. Try to make weight changes gradually, and talk to your trainer and/or doctor about the best practices to follow. A common places to develop stretch marks is under your arm from doing upper body exercises.;
, If you want to lose weight, do so gradually by following a healthy diet and exercising regularly. Avoid ""crash diets,"" and aim to lose no more than approximately half a kilogram (one pound) per week.The efforts required to lose weight rapidly can be unhealthy, whether they involve crash dieting, extreme exercise, or supplements and pills. In addition, sudden changes in weight can cause stretch marks, as your skin cannot accommodate such rapid shifts.

, Following a good exercise plan benefits your overall health and weight maintenance. In addition, it can improve your circulation and skin elasticity.All of this can help reduce your chances of developing stretch marks.


You should get 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of exercise each week. Adults should do moderate intensity aerobic physical exercise. Strength training should be done as well on 2-3 days a week. Examples of moderate intensity exercise include the following: biking slowly, canoeing, gardening, walking briskly, and swimming activities."

Wear a clay mask.,
Consider a mud mask.,
Use a purifying wipe.,
Apply a cleansing cream.,
Try an astringent.,
Exfoliate your skin.",How to Purify Your Skin Quickly1," There are a vast number of specialist products available to buy in your local supermarket or drug store than can help you to purify your skin. Everybody's skin is different, so there is no fixed guarantee of what treatments will work for which people. One of the most common ways to purify your skin is by applying a clay mask.


You will find a number of possible options, two ingredients to look out for a Bentonite and Kaolin.It can be a matter of trial and error to find which one works best for you.
You will need to apply the mask to a clean face and leave it to dry before rinsing off.;
, An alternative to a clay mask, is a mud mask. Just like the clay mask, there are a huge number of products out there to try. But look out for one that is rich in minerals and designed for your skin type. If you have oily or dry skin, read the label on the containers and find the one closest to your skin.


You will need to apply as per the instructions or the bottle.
Typically you will leave the mask on for between ten minutes and half an hour.

, Undoubtedly the quickest way to purify your skin is by simply using a specialist purifying face wipe. You can find different brands in your local drug store or pharmacy. These wipes can be particularly good after removing make-up.


Some varieties to look out for include coconut water wipes, and Manuka honey wipes.
Avoid fragranced wipes which might be harsher on your skin.
If you have sensitive skin, look for wipes designed for your skin type.

, You can buy cleansing creams from you local store that will work to purify you skin, and wash away the the bacteria that has built up on your skin. As with other face wash products there is a large selection of brands to choose from. Take the time to look for one that matches your skin type, oily, dry, sensitive or combination.


If you have sensitive skin avoid creams that are alcohol or petroleum based.Don't be afraid to try a few different creams until you find the one that work best for you.

, Another alternative product you can try is an astringent. Again there are many brands that produce astringents. These are particularly good at sealing up your pores, and are best used by those with oily skin. If you have dry skin they will dry it out further and can cause irritation.If you use astringent, it can be a good idea to follow it with a moisturiser.

, You can use an exfoliating cleanser to help clear your skin of bacteria, dead skin cells and toxins. As well as using a store-bought exfoliating cream, you can try very gently scrubbing your skin with a dry brush. This is reported to promote better circulation, and help to get rid of dead skin cells and toxins, which could lead to purified skin."

Refrain from any other chemical peels.,
Avoid microdermabrasion treatments.,
Cut out tanning booths.,
Limit sun exposure.,
Be gentle on your skin.,
Take antiviral medication as needed.,
Apply prescribed lotions.,
Use a bleaching agent.,
Learn about medication interactions.,
Avoid smoking.,
Take antibiotics.,
Learn if you have medical allergies.,
Arrange for a ride home.",How to Prepare Skin for a Chemical Peel," In the two weeks leading up to a chemical peel, it is imperative that you refrain from having any other chemical peel treatments. If it has been less than two weeks since your last chemical peel, you should wait until at least 14 days have passed., Microdermabrasion treatments work similar to chemical peels, except this treatment uses a gentle abrasive tool to peel off the outer layer of skin.If you are planning on having a chemical peel performed, you should avoid having a microdermabrasion treatment for at least 14 days before the procedure., Tanning, including the use of artificial UV radiation in tanning booths, can cause significant damage to the skin.For this reason, it is imperative that anyone planning on having a chemical peel avoid tanning for at least two to three weeks before the treatment., While you should not engage in tanning for two to three weeks before a chemical peel, you should also limit all sun exposure for at least ten days before the treatment.If you must be in the sun for any duration of time in the two to three weeks before a treatment, you should wear sunscreen and try to limit your time outdoors as much as possible., As you prepare for a chemical peel, you will need to refrain from waxing your skin or using chemical depilatory (hair removal) treatments for at least five to seven days before treatment.You should also avoid all chemical injection treatments, including Botox and collagen injections, for at least one week before the treatment., Some people preparing for a chemical peel will not need to take antiviral medication. However, if you have a history of herpes infections on or around your mouth, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication for you to take before and after the treatment.Acyclovir (Zovirax) is a common antiviral medication used to prevent cold sore/herpes outbreaks prior to a chemical peel. Acyclovir is typically taken for between two days and one week before the treatment and up to two weeks after the treatment.This medication is commonly dosed at 200 mg five times each day.Valacyclovir is another common antiviral medication. It is typically dosed at one gram three times daily. Valacyclovir should be taken for at least two days before the treatment and for 10 to 14 days after the treatment., Depending on the depth of chemical peel you will be undergoing, your doctor may recommend that you use a moisturizing and healing lotion on your skin before the treatment.


Glycolic acid lotion is typically recommended for light chemical peels. This lotion is used for two weeks before the treatment to help ensure that your skin peels uniformly and heals more easily.A retinoid cream like tretinoin or Retin-A is used for light or medium chemical peels to help shorten the duration of your treatment and speed up the healing process.Retinoid use is typically discontinued three days before the treatment., Depending on your skin complexion, your doctor may recommend the use of a bleaching agent like hydroquinone, especially in conjunction with a retinoid cream like tretinoin. Using a bleaching agent before treatment can help prevent your skin from darkening during the treatment.Hydroquinone (skin bleaching) is most commonly recommended for people with darker skin complexions to prepare for a chemical peel.You will most likely be instructed to discontinue the use of bleaching products for at least one week before the treatment., Depending on what medications your are currently taking, your doctor may recommend that you discontinue some of those medications before undergoing your chemical peel.The most common medications that must be discontinued before treatment are photosensitizing drugs, which increase your sensitivity to sunlight and may cause inflammation after exposure to sunlight.Common photosensitizing drugs include:


antihistaminescoal tar and coal tar derivativescertain contraceptives (birth control pills and female sex hormones)non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsphenothiazines (tranquilizers)psoralenssulfonamides (antimicrobials)sulfonylureas (oral diabetes medications)thiazide diuretics (water pills)tetracyclines (antibiotics)tricyclic antidepressants, If you are a smoker, you will most likely need to discontinue smoking well in advance of your procedure.Talk to your doctor about when to quit and how to follow through on your plan to quit smoking.

, If your doctor has recommended that you take antibiotics before having a chemical peel, you should begin taking those at least 24 hours before the procedure. If you are required to take antiviral medication, you should also be taking that medication for at least 24 hours before your treatment., Some patients undergoing a deep-tissue chemical peel will be required to undergo sedation before the procedure. If you have any known allergies to sedatives or pain medications, you should let your doctor know right away to avoid any potential drug allergies., If you are undergoing a deep-tissue chemical peel, you may be required to undergo sedation in order to effectively penetrate to deeper skin depths. If you know you will be undergoing sedation during your procedure, arrange for a ride home ahead of time, as you will not be able to drive home after sedation."

Stay hydrated.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Increase your intake of vitamin E. Vitamin E helps to regenerate the skin and increase its elasticity, and to repair body tissues and promote blood flow.Vitamin E also encourages the production of collagen, a protein found in the skin and elsewhere that helps wounds heal, including stretch marks.You can get more vitamin E by choosing certain foods, and perhaps from certain skin creams.,
Consume plenty of vitamin C. Vitamin C is the most plentiful antioxidant in the skin, and helps neutralize free radicals (damaging molecules) and promote skin health.Like vitamin E, vitamin C also helps the body make collagen.Foods high in vitamin C include: cantaloupe, citrus fruits and juices (such as orange and grapefruit), mango, pineapple, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, spinach, and cabbage.,
Make sure you get enough vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and B3 (niacin).,
Get the right amount of zinc.,
Ensure that you get enough dietary silica.",How to Prevent Stretch Marks2," Drinking plenty of water keeps your skin healthy and reduces your chances of developing stretch marks. Try to drink approximately two liters per day., A balanced, nutritious diet is good for your overall health, and can also reduce your chances of developing stretch marks. Supplements are not necessary to prevent stretch marks, but you should try to get enough of certain vitamins and minerals that can help protect against stretch marks.,


Foods high in vitamin E include: eggs, fortified cereals, fruit, green leafy vegetables (such as spinach), meat, nuts, nut oils, poultry, olive oil, and whole grains.Wheat germ is high in vitamin E, so you can include more of it in your diet. Anecdotal evidence suggests that wheat germ oil as an ointment can help your skin.Creams containing vitamin E aren't likely to prevent stretch marks as such.However, they may help with itching and skin dryness.The recommended daily allowance of vitamin E is 15 mg per day for both men and women.
Exfoliating creams containing vitamin E can scrub away old skin and promote the growth of new skin.,
You can also use topical creams containing vitamin C. As with vitamin E creams, these cannot prevent stretch marks, but there is a chance that they may discourage them.
Recommended daily allowances for vitamin C are 90 and 75 mg per day for both men and women, respectively., Riboflavin promotes healthy skin and skin function.It also widens blood vessels and increases blood circulation.Niacin helps deter many kinds of skin disorders.Foods high in riboflavin include: milk and other dairy products, fish, meats, green leafy vegetables, enriched cereals and breads, and whole grains.Foods high in niacin include: meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and whole grains., Zinc helps prevent stretch marks by softening and tightening the skin.Foods high in zinc include: beef, pork, shellfish, peanuts, and legumes (such as beans and lentils).Excessive zinc intake can cause a range of health problems.While the amount of zinc consumed in common foods is perfectly safe, supplements and other products can be overused. Talk with your doctor about the proper dosage of zinc for you, given your age, health, and other factors.
Zinc also plays an important role in immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc toxicity has been seen in the consumption of greater than 225 mg of zinc., Some studies suggest that silica can improve the appearance and strength of skin.It is also associated with collagen production, connective tissue in the skin, and the repair of the skin.Dietary sources of silica include: whole grains, cereals, beer, and green beans."
"
Keep your skin moisturized.,
Try retinoid creams.Retinoids are types of chemical compounds related to vitamin A.,
Get a massage.",How to Prevent Stretch Marks3," While they cannot prevent stretch marks, moisturizing creams and lotions such as cocoa butter or shea butter may help reduce your chances of developing them, by keeping your skin supple.Some evidence suggests that the act of massaging alone (and not the lotion or cream itself) may protect your skin from stretch marks.An ointment containing vitamin E can be especially beneficial, because of its rejuvenating effect on skin.If you plan to use cocoa butter, you should apply it to the affected area at least two times a day for a a couple of months., While they may not be able to prevent stretch marks, they can lessen the appearance of existing marks.You can find retinol creams at pharmacies.Retinoid creams are not safe for use during pregnancy.
Retinoids, a derivative of vitamin A, and helps to rebuild collagen and make stretch mark look more like normal skin. A typical medication used for this purpose is Retin-A or Tretinoin., Massaging your skin or receiving massage therapy can have additional benefits for reducing the incidence of stretch marks.The action of massage promotes skin regeneration, increasing its overall health and appearance.


Rub the skin gently but firmly in a circular motion for at least ninety seconds in the target area.Use an approved lotion, ointment, or oil as desired.Massaging any area at risk for stretch marks (breasts, thighs, etc.) with something as common as olive oil or cocoa butter may have some effect."

Get the facts.,
Monitor your weight gain during pregnancy.,
Stay hydrated.,
Moisturize your skin.",How to Prevent Stretch Marks4," Stretch marks during pregnancy are very common. As at other times in life, there is little that can be done to directly prevent them. However, they will often fade in time, and you can take many steps to reduce the chance of stretch marks. Watching your weight, eating right, exercising, and other standard advice to counter stretch marks all apply during pregnancy as well, with some slight modifications.

, Your weight gain in pregnancy should be slow and gradual. Gaining 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy is a rough expectation.The exact amount you may gain depends on your pre-pregnancy weight and other factors, so talk to your doctor about what kind of weight gain to expect.


During pregnancy, avoid the conventional wisdom that you are “eating for two.”Your eating habits should not change much, even while you are pregnant. Focus on eating a variety of healthy foods that are rich in vitamins adrenals.
Typically, doctors recommend eating approximately 300 calories more than normal during your second and third trimesters. You should continue to select foods that are healthy and rich in vitamins E, C, B2, and B3 as well as zinc and dietary silica to promote skin health (as described above). In addition, your doctor may prescribe a daily multivitamin to ensure you get enough of the right nutrients.

, Drink 8-12 glasses (approximately 2 liters) of water per day during pregnancy to stay hydrated and to promote good skin.Avoid products containing caffeine, as these can increase urine production and lead to dehydration.

, Creams containing vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin A, as well as ointments like cocoa butter and lanolin cannot prevent stretch marks entirely. However, they do help repair skin tissue damaged by stretch marks.Use these products as desired for dry, irritated, or damaged skin.


Retinoid creams are thought to lessen the appearance of existing stretch marks. However, these are not safe for use during pregnancy.

Exercise moderately.,
Exercise in the right environment.,
Dress appropriately for exercise.,
Follow a good exercise routine.",How to Prevent Stretch Marks5," Exercise has a host of benefits for pregnant women, including mood enhancement, stress relief, relief from discomforts like backaches, weight control, and the promotion of healthy skin and the possible avoidance of stretch marks. Safe, moderate exercise at least three times per week is recommended.Follow your doctor’s advice if he or she gives you different recommendations for exercise, or instructs to you avoid strenuous physical activity during pregnancy.
You can exercise at approximately your pre-pregnancy level, but don't overdo it. Your heart rate should stay without about 70 percent of your target rate (220 minus your current age).
Try moderate activities such as swimming, brisk walking, stationary cycling, yoga, and aerobics.
Avoid exercises which can cause injury, including: horseback riding, contact sports (football, basketball, etc.), hopping, jumping, skipping, bouncing, or running, and sit-ups.

, You can prevent discomfort and possible health problems by avoiding exercise in hot and humid weather. You should also avoid hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms. When exercising during pregnancy, you should be able to breathe normally.

, Loose-fitting comfortable clothes, and a good support bra are recommended for exercise. Footwear should be appropriate to your exercise, but must always be comfortable and good-fitting.

, Warm up and stretch for five minutes before beginning exercise. Then try cardio/aerobic activity for about 15 minutes, followed by 5 to 10 minutes of less strenuous exercise. End by stretching again.


Do not exercise for more than 45 minutes at a time.Make sure to drink water before, during and after your exercise routine, and wait at least an hour after eating to engage in exercise.
Stop exercising if you feel pain, dizziness, suddenly cold, changes in your heartbeat, or anything else unusual. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.

Humidify your home and office.,
Moisturize your skin frequently with an oil-based moisturizer.,
Look for moisturizing products that contain glycerin, shea butter, jojoba oil or sunflower oil.

,
Apply sunscreen to exposed skin when you go outdoors.,
Wear gloves to help keep hands dry and protected from harsh conditions and rough fabrics.,
Wear layers of clothing so it is less likely you will overheat, sweat and lose moisture.,
Avoid any skin products containing alcohol or those that reduce oiliness.,
Remember to keep your lips moist.,
Keep baths short.,
Exfoliate gently.,
Use Vitamin C to repair your damaged skin.,
Hydrate yourself.,
Protect your child by following many of these recommendations.,
Visit your doctor or dermatologist if your skin becomes severely damaged.",How to Prepare for Winter Skin," Heated homes and offices make the air around you very dry. Humidifiers don't have to be expensive. You can buy a basic humidifier at your local drug or discount store relatively inexpensively. Place several humidifiers around your home.;
, Ointments contain more oil than do lotions and will help better protect your skin in winter. Petroleum jelly is a good moisturizer to use in the winter although some experts suggest lighter ointments.

,, If you live in an area where there is a lot of snow, this is even more important as snow reflects 80 percent of the sun's light. Look for sunscreen products with built-in moisturizing cream.

, Be sure the material used in your gloves doesn't irritate your skin. A pair of thin cotton gloves worn underneath heavier gloves or mittens will keep your hands from becoming irritated.

, Wet clothing irritates your skin. When you dress in layers, you can remove excess clothing as you warm up.

, Try not to use anti-aging products or those for treatment of acne if possible as those tend to dry out skin even more.

, Since your lips are moist to begin with, exposure to harsh elements makes them especially susceptible to damage. Use lip balm or other protection at all times.

, Don't use extremely hot water. Pat yourself dry instead of rubbing. Moisturize after your bath.

, If possible exfoliate and moisturize at the same time. Any skin that has been irritated is more susceptible to additional damage.

, Find a serum product with L-ascorbic acid or Vitamin C Ester as an ingredient.

, Drink water and other hydrating fluids and eat foods rich in oils such as salmon and avocado. Limit caffeine and alcohol.

, Children's skin is especially sensitive and it's important to moisturize and protect their skin whenever they go outdoors in the winter.

, Besides skin becoming painful, unsightly and uncomfortable, broken skin invites infection.

Discuss your medications with your doctor.,
Be ready for what will happen.,
Ask about photo-patch testing.,
Don't be afraid if you think it will be painful.,
Keep the area dry.,
Wait two days.,
Wait another two days.,
Avoid the irritants.",How to Patch Test Skin1," Patch tests are used to test how allergic you are when you come into contact with certain substances. Patch tests are different from prick or scratch tests.A scratch test checks for reactions to common allergens that may give you symptoms from hives to a runny nose. The nurse scratches or pricks the skin to get the allergen under the skin.A patch test checks for just the skin's reaction to the allergen. A reaction to an allergen by the skin is known as contact dermatitis.;
, Certain medications can affect a patch test. Antihistamines, for instance, are designed to suppress allergic reactions, which can change the outcome of your patch test. Your doctor may want you to go off of these medications for a bit before your test, up to 10 days ahead of time.Other medications that may cause problems include tricyclic antidepressants, some medications for acid reflux (such as ranitidine), and omalizumab (an asthma medication)., During a patch test, the nurse or doctor will make up a series of small patches. Each patch will contain a small amount of a different substance that has been known to cause reactions in some people. For instance, some patch tests use everything from metals such as cobalt and nickel to lanolin and certain plant types. The patches will be attached to your skin with medical tape. Most of the time, the patches are applied to your back or arm., If you commonly have rashes on the back of your hands, your neck, or arms, you may react to a substance only when it comes into contact with sunlight. A special test exists for this purpose; if you need a photo-patch test, your doctor will place two of each substance and expose one of them to light, while not exposing the other., In fact, unlike scratch tests, patch tests don't use needles at all. Therefore, you won't experience any pain when the patches are being applied., While the patches are on, you should avoid getting the patches wet, which means avoiding extremes of heat and humidity and heavy sweating. Do not swim, shower, take a bath, exercise or do anything that might cause the patch to get wet., Generally, the patches are left on you for two days. You return to the doctor after the time period is up. The nurse or doctor will remove your patches and look at your skin. One of them will see which substances your skin shows a reaction to.Reactions on your skin may appear as a rash, possibly with small, raised areas that resemble pimples or fluid-filled sacs.

, Sometimes, the doctor will have you return again, four days after the original test. This step is to see if you had a delayed reaction to an allergen., Once you know what causes you trouble, you know what to avoid. Your doctor can give you advice on avoiding your particular irritant. On the other hand, if you don't react to anything, your doctor will look to other issues as the cause of any rashes you may have."

Consider a honey treatment.,
Favour organic honey.,
Prepare the treatment.,
Soak gauze in honey.,
Mix honey and lemon juice.,
Combine honey and yoghurt.,
Use honey and cinnamon.",How to Purify Your Skin Quickly2," Honey has strong antibacterial properties and a long history of use as a topical treatment for skin complaints and wounds. As with most natural remedies it is not guaranteed to work for everybody, but its antibacterial qualities, which can help to purify your skin, are beyond doubt.Honey's thick consistency also makes it easy to apply to your face.

, If you decide to try a honey treatment try to choose organic rather than processed honey. The enzymes in the honey which will be absorbed into your skin are typically destroyed when honey is processed. Manuka honey is considered to be particularly potent with strong antibacterial properties.


Look for a Manuka honey with a minimum rating of 10 UMF.
This is often marketed as ""UMF Manuka Honey"" or ""Active Manuka Honey""., The most straightforward way to purify your skin with honey is simply to gently massage it onto your face. Spoon or pour a few tablespoons of honey out into a bowl and then, with clean hands, apply it to you face. Leave it to soak in for around 30 minutes, before rinsing it off.If you notice your skin becoming red or feel any irritation remove it quicker.
Keep an eye on your skin, especially the first time you try it.

, An alternative to applying the honey straight onto you face is to soak some gauze or bandages in honey.Honey soaked bandages are sometimes used to help heal wounds, and you can use them help purify your skin.Once the gauze is nicely saturated in the honey place them onto your face.


The stickiness of the honey should mean that they stay on without any problems.
After around half an hour rinse off your face and gently remove the gauze or bandages.
Just do this once or twice a week.

, You can keep honey as a key ingredient in your purifying treatment, but mix it with other ingredients to potentially boost the effect. For this method squeeze out half a lemon, so you have the juice in a bowl or dish. Then add a few drops of honey (a couple of teaspoons) to the lemon and mix it in. Wash your face first, and then rub the mixture onto your face and leave it for around five minutes.Rinse it off with cool water.
The lemon can be harsh on your skin, so rinse it off quickly if it irritates you.

, You can create a mixture of honey and yoghurt to use as a topical treatment to help purify your skin. Pour out 1 tablespoon of honey into a bowl or dish. Then mix in 1 teaspoon of plain yoghurt. Stir it thoroughly. After you have washed your face and hands, massage the mixture onto your face.Leave it for around 10 or 15 minutes before washing it off with warm water.
After you have washed it off you can apply a moisturiser.
Alternatively you can try four tablespoons of yoghurt mixed with two tablespoons of honey., This mixture can be applied before you go to bed and left on all night. Spoon two tablespoons of honey into a small dish. Then drop in a teaspoon of cinnamon powder. Mix it together thoroughly until it forms a paste. Once you have a good consistency, apply it to your face carefully.Allow it to dry before you get into bed.
Rinse it off with warm water in the morning.
Another option is just to rinse it off after 30 minutes.

Get a organic avocado.,
Scoop out the avocado.,
Apply it to your face.",How to Purify Your Skin Quickly3," One slightly odd-sounding treatment is to cover your face with avocado. As with all homemade remedies, its effectiveness is questionable. Avocados do, however, have plenty of antioxidants and moisturising qualities. If you decide to try this get an organic avocado so it is free from any pesticides or other chemicals., Now scoop out the avocado flesh from the skin and drop into a small bowl. Mash it up with a fork so it becomes smooth and like a paste. You can add a few drops of water to help the process along.


You can also add a few drops of lemon juice to add extra kick to your avocado mask.
Remember if you have dry or sensitive skin lemon juice could make it worse.

, Once you have prepared your avocado, clean your face and hands before applying the paste to your skin. Leave it on for between 20 and 30 minutes, before rinsing it off with warm water and patting your face dry with a towel."
"
Mix an egg white mask.,
Apply the mask.,
Wait before washing it off.",How to Purify Your Skin Quickly4," Egg whites are rich in collagen and protein, and can help to tighten your pores, which has purifying effects. This option is more advisable for those with oily rather than dry skin. If you have dry skin it could cause irritation and excessive dryness. Similarly if you have sensitive skin the vitamin A could cause breakouts, and it best to speak to your dermatologist first.To make the mask just whip up some eggs whites in a bowl.
You want a good frothy consistency.

, Once you have got the egg whites prepared, and cleaned your face and hands, simply apply the mask to your face with your finger tips. Gently massage it into your face, taking care to avoid any areas that are particularly sensitive, such as the area around the eyes.

, Allow the egg white mask to dry on you face. When you feel it has dried you will most likely feel your skin tightening.Now gently rinse it off with warm water. Be sure to clean off any residue and then apply a moisturiser. Egg white will dry out your skin, so moisturising after you use it will help re-hydrate your skin.

Understand product skin testing.,
Put a small amount on your inner arm.,
Wait for 24 hours.,
Test a more sensitive area.,
Wait another day.",How to Patch Test Skin2," When you get a new product, such as a chemical peel or even just a facial cleanser, it's important to patch test it first, especially if you have sensitive skin. Patch testing just means you use a small amount on part of your skin to see how you react.In other words, you don't want to rub something all over your face or body and break out in hives everywhere. It's best to limit the area at first.You should also skin test other products, such as shampoos, conditioner, and hair dyes. Basically, if you have sensitive skin, you should skin test any product that comes in contact with your skin.

, Your inner arm is a good place to test because generally that skin is fairly sensitive. In addition, it won't be too noticeable if you do have a reaction.If the product burns or causes an immediate reaction, wash it off as quickly as possible., If it's a product such as lotion, leave it on your skin.If it's a product like a chemical peel that's meant to be rinsed off, rinse it off at the appropriate time.Wait a full day to see if you have a reaction to the product.


A reaction could be your skin turning red, welting up, or showing a rash. You could also have scaliness or oozing skin. Another symptom is itchiness., Next, move to skin testing a more sensitive area. This time, pick a place where the product will be used. For instance, if you are using a facial cleanser, try it just under your ear in a small spot. The reason you need to test it again is because it may affect a more sensitive area of skin even if it doesn't affect your arm., Once again, wait for a full day to see if your skin reacts to the product. If it doesn't, you should be fine to use it."

Get other cosmetic procedures at least a day after Botox.,
Use blood thinners as directed by your doctor.,
Watch for side effects.",How to Prepare for a Botox Treatment," Any type of medical appointment can be stressful. Although most Botox appointments are over quickly, getting an injection can scare or cause anxiety in some people.Make your Botox appointment at a time that is convenient for you and won’t cause stress. Give yourself a nice cushion of time both before and after the injection so that you aren’t rushed or stressed.


Consider scheduling your appointment in the morning. You may be less stressed and can go to the appointment when you’re relaxed after a shower or bath.;
, If you haven’t done so already, take some time to gather some information about Botox. You might want to know about the drug itself, potential risks, and review the results of others who have had Botox. Some of the most common reasons for getting Botox are:Smoothing facial wrinkles
Improving the appearance of your skin
Controlling severe underarm sweating
Calming cervical dystonia, a neurological condition that causes severe muscle contraction in the neck and shoulders
Reducing uncontrollable blinking
Relieving strabismus, which causes misaligned eyes
Preventing chronic migraines
Controlling an overactive bladder.
Preventing esophageal spasms., Different types of medications, such as blood thinners, NSAIDsand muscle relaxants, can cause bleeding or bruising when used in conjunction with Botox. You may need to avoid taking prescription medication or other drugs a few days before your Botox treatment. Ask your doctors before the procedure what is safe or if you should avoid the medication or supplement for a certain time period before the injection. If you use the following medication or supplements, ask your doctor if it is safe for you to get Botox:Blood thinners such as warfarin
Muscle relaxants
Sleeping aids
Allergy medications
AspirinIbuprofen
St. John’s WortVitamin E
Fish or Omega-3 oils
Ginkgo biloba
Ginseng

, Smoking before a Botox appointment can increase your risk of bruising from the injection and slow healing time.Avoid or limit smoking at least a few days before your treatment and consult with your doctor about how long is appropriate. , If you are especially prone to bruising, use Arnica cream before your appointment. This can reduce the risk of bruises developing at the Botox injection sites.However, do not rub the injection site itself after the procedure and ask your doctor before using it.


Don't apply arnica cream on an open wound.
Do not take arnica orally. While homeopathic arnica preparations are available and safe to consume, they are no better than placebo in trial and the actual herb is toxic when consumed in high amounts., Using an ice pack on the area being injected with Botox can minimize possible signs of bruising from the injection. You can use the ice pack before, during, and after your procedure.Apply an ice pack wrapped with a towel or cloth to your skin for 20 minutes at a time. Consider icing a day before your Botox treatment. You can use a professional ice pack or make one yourself with a bag of frozen fruits or vegetables. Place a towel between the ice pack and your skin, which can prevent frostbite. Remove the pack if your skin gets too cold or feels numb.

, Many doctors suggest waiting at least 4 hours to exercise or exert yourself after your treatment. If you work out every day, do it before your appointment. A little physical activity can relax you before the appointment and ensure that you get in your daily workout without any stress., Your doctor needs your skin to be free of any dirt, moisturizers, or cosmetics before your treatment. Make sure that you cleanse your skin thoroughly before your appointment and don’t apply anything until after the treatment.Wash your face with a mild soap or cleanser and warm water. Make sure to rinse it thoroughly to prevent any residue on your skin. Pat dry with a soft towel so you don’t irritate your skin.Recognize that your doctor may clean your skin again with rubbing alcohol or an antiseptic cleanser before the injection to remove anything you weren’t able to wash off., Even if you exercised to help relax yourself, you may still be nervous or have anxiety before your Botox treatment. You can help relieve your nerves and anxiety by trying some of the following techniques:Distracting yourself by talking to your doctor or a nurse
Breathing slowly and deeply
Listening to music
Thinking of yourself in a calm and relaxing place such as the beach
Trying aromatherapy
Taking a sedative prescribed by your doctor.

, Before your doctor injects you with Botox, he or she should consult with you. Letting him or her know about your medications, allergies, or other illnesses can help the doctor assess that it’s safe to inject you with Botox.You should also ask your doctor any questions you have about Botox or the treatment. Your doctor should know if:


You are taking medications, supplements, and herbs
You have allergies
You have medical conditions, illnesses, or disease
You have had or will have surgery, recent Botox, or other medical treatments
You are pregnant, may be pregnant, or breastfeeding, Botox is injected into one specific site and the toxin stays in that area. Rubbing or massaging the treated area can cause the toxin to migrate, making it less effective where you need it. Keeping your fingers and hands away from the site can help your Botox treatment be more effective.Be careful touching the skin where you had the injection.

, Avoid lying down or getting physical activity for a minimum of four hours after your Botox treatment. This can help the Botox settle in the treated area and not spread to other sites., You should avoid drinking alcohol or limit your consumption after having a Botox treatment.Drinking alcohol can lead to fluid retention, which may cause more bruising., If you were using Arnica Montana before your Botox treatment, continue your regimen after the injection, but avoid applying it to the injected site itself.

, If you want to get a facial, chemical peel, or microdermabrasion for your skin, make sure you schedule it at least 24 hours after your Botox treatment. This can prevent bruising and the Botox from moving to other areas of your skin.Make sure your doctor or aesthetician knows that you had a Botox treatment recently. He or she may suggest waiting longer than 24 hours to get your next cosmetic skin procedure.

, In the hours following a Botox treatment, you can develop bruising. Taking blood thinners such as warfarin and aspirin (and any other NSAIDs) after the treatment can encourage bruising or make it worse. If you are on blood thinners, ask your doctor when you may continue your regimen again. Make sure to follow his or her directions closely to minimize your risk for potential health problems., If you get your Botox treatment from an experienced doctor, it is relatively safe. You may experience some side effects that you should watch closely. Let your doctor know if they don’t go away within a few days. Potential side effects you may notice are:Pain, swelling, or bruising at the injection site
Headache
Flu-like symptoms
Droopy eyelid
Uneven eyebrows
Crooked smile
Drooling
Eye dryness
Excessive tearing
Muscle weakness in your entire body
Vision problems
Trouble speaking or swallowing
Loss of bladder control

Follow up the mask with moisturizer.",How to Open up Your Pores1," To prepare your face for the clay mask, wash it with warm water and pat it dry.

Be sure the water is warm, not hot.;
, With your fingertips or a fan brush, apply a thin layer of the clay mask on your face in sweeping motions. Avoid your eyes and mouth. Clay masks will pull out the dirt and oil in your pores.Clay masks are best for people with oily, non-sensitive skin. They may be too intense for sensitive skin types.

, Don't let the mask dry completely. It should start to change colors (look lighter) but still feel tacky to the touch. If you let it dry completely, it pulls the moisture out of your skin.If the clay mask comes off when you touch it, it's still too wet.

, Use water to soften the clay. Use a washcloth to scrub your face clean, being sure to remove all the mask., Lightly apply an oil-free moisturizer after you've dried your face off.


You can use clay masks up to 2-3 times per week, depending on how your skin responds.

Use a humidifier.",How to Prevent Skin Irritation During Winter1," Moisturizing lotion or cream can help to keep your skin hydrated and healthy. Choose a product intended for dry skin or ""combination"" skin, ideally one without fragrance or allergens. Apply it as needed, no more than twice a day.


For severely dry skin, use thicker creams or warm coconut oil.
Do not use body products on your face, which has more sensitive skin.
If your skin is already red and irritated, lotion can prevent your body from returning to a healthy level of oil production. Moisturize as necessary to avoid pain or cracking, but give your skin some time to heal on its on.;
, Hard scrubbing and harsh soaps strip away the oils that protect your skin. Avoid excessive washing, and stick to gentle soaps and light scrubbing. Hot water opens up the pores so more oil escapes, so go with warm or room temperature water if you can stand it.


Your face is especially sensitive to soaps and heat. A splash of cool water before bed should keep it clean without irritation.

, If your hands suffer from eczema or another form of irritated skin, take special care to protect them from soap and heat. Wear rubber gloves while doing the dishes. Wipe them with sweet almond oil or another soothing oil before showering.


If they get especially bad, wear 100% cotton gloves while sleeping. You can find gloves designed for this at pharmacies.

, Your lips are especially vulnerable to dry winter air. Apply a hydrating lip balm before going outside, or whenever your lips feel chapped. Switch to a product with different ingredients if your lips sting or feel sore after using the balm. Balms with beeswax or petroleum jelly (Vaseline) work well for most people, but some additions such as menthol or alcohol can be too harsh for some.


Make your own by melting beeswax and coconut oil together. Optionally, mix in a scented extract, essential oil and/or lipstick for smell and color. Freeze for fifteen minutes or until solid.

, Scratching your skin will strip down its layers. Every time the layers are removed or damaged, the skin gets itchy again, setting you up for a vicious cycle of it never quite curing and always feeling itchy. Do your best to control the itching and give your skin time to heal.

, This helps to keep your skin hydrated. Drink whenever you feel thirsty, and enough to make your urine pale or clear. (The popular ""eight glasses a day"" factoid isn't really a universal requirement.)

, Wear a scarf, coat, gloves and cap to prevent dry air from drying out your skin.

, Ultraviolet light is still around in winter, even on overcast days. Put on SPF 30 or higher sunscreen before you go out.

, Heaters dry out the air, which in turn dries your skin. A humidifier will restore moisture to your home environment.

Avoid masks with abrasives or substances with harsh pH (both bases such as baking soda and strong acids such as lemon juice). These can damage already irritated skin., Some people with dry skin swear by lifestyle changes, especially new eating habits. Consider these approaches and see if they're right for you:


Restore healthy oils by eating foods with monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish, nuts, olive oil, flax, sardines, and avocados.
Eat foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruit and dark leafy green vegetables. Your body needs vitamin C to build collagen, a major component of skin.Consider an alkali diet. Although specific claims about this diet are not supported by evidence, it's hard to argue with some of its recommendations, such as cutting back on processed sugar and red meat."

Eat well.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Open up Your Pores7," What you put into your body affects how it looks on the outside, and your skin is no exception. For clearer pores, eat a balanced diet heavy in fruits and veggies. Try to eat at least 5 portions a day--your skin will thank you for the antioxidant boost. Avoid simple sugars, like white bread, pasta, and rice, which can trigger inflammation. Instead, go for whole grains.Healthy fats, like those found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and fish, are also great for your skin.
For better skin, focus on incorporating more whole, unprocessed foods into your diet, including vegetables, fruits, nuts, yogurt, eggs, and multigrain bread., Moisture helps keep your skin healthy and supple. Try to drink 6 to 8 glasses a day. Keeping a refillable water bottle on hand makes staying hydrated easier.Try to minimize your consumption of alcoholic and caffeinated beverages.
If you are bored with plain water, make a fruit-infused water or an herbal, caffeine-free tea!

, While it might seem counterintuitive, working up a sweat can actually improve skin health. Exercise increases blood flow, bringing oxygen and nutrients to skin cells while carrying away waste.Be sure to wear sunscreen when exercising outside to protect your skin.
Avoid wearing makeup while exercising, as this can lead to clogged pores. To keep your pores clean, wash your face before you workout and shower immediately after.

Determine your skin type.,
Find an appropriate moisturizer.,
Consider seeing a dermatologist for a prescription, especially if you have chronic dry skin.,
Determine whether or not you have dry skin.,
Take care not to dry your skin more when showering.,
Apply lip balm if necessary.,
Avoid using your regular skin care products unless they are formulated for gentle skin.,
Wear gloves if dry skin is affecting your hands.,
Stay away from heat sources and use a humidifier during the treatment.,

Make lifestyle choices that benefit your skin.",How to Moisturize Your Skin," You need to know this before before you can choose the right moisturizer. To figure out your skin type, first wash and dry your face and wait an hour. Then, note how dry or oily your skin is. A more detailed guide can be found here.;
, Once you know your skin type, there are a few basic categories into which your skin will likely fall. Most skin will range from ‘oily’ to ‘dry,’ with ‘normal’ between the two. The other two main categories are ‘sensitive’ and ‘mature.’


Moisturizers for dry skin are generally petroleum or oil-based.
Oily skin calls for a water-based moisturizer. It should also be noncomedogenic to prevent your pores from clogging.
Normal skin also needs a water-based moisturizer, but one which contains some oils, though much less than dry skin needs.
Sensitive skin needs a moisturizer with medicinal or soothing properties. Look for moisturizers with chamomile or aloe, but stay away from those with fragrances, dyes, or acids.
For older mature skin, you should look for a petroleum-based moisturizer rich in oils. There are many moisturizers on the market designed for mature skin that contain ingredients to help reduce wrinkles as well., It is quite common for a person's skin to be a combination of skin type categories. Your dermatologist will be able to prescribe a moisturizer tailored to your skin's needs. They will also be able to recommend additional skin care practices.

, Does your skin feel especially tight, cracked, itchy or rough after a shower? For people with lighter skin, is your skin redder than usual? For people with darker skin, is your skin gray or ashy? If your skin is afflicted in these ways, you should pay extra attention to moisturizing to restore your natural oils.

, Close the bathroom door to keep humidity in the room, and shower more quickly and at a lower temperature than usual. Since air-drying leaves your skin drier than before, use a towel - but make sure to blot rather than rub. Follow up the shower by applying your moisturizer.







, Lip balms are an advisable part of a daily moisturizing routine, and especially important to use when treating dry skin. Avoid licking your lips, which can exacerbate the problem. Many lip balms also contain sun protective ingredients, which will protect your skin in their vulnerable state. If a new lip balm causes an adverse reaction, such as swelling, burning sensation, or redness, try a different product.







, Some examples of harsh skin care products are aftershaves or colognes containing alcohol or alpha-hydroxy acid, and deodorant soaps. While your skin may normally be resilient enough to combat the negative side effects of these products, you should give yourself a chance to catch up. You may also look into buying special laundry detergent for gentle skin, at least during the treatment period for dry skin.

, This is important in the winter, especially in windy and sub-zero temperatures. Wear gloves made of rubber or a similar material when washing dishes, since hot water and soap contribute to dry skin. Make sure you also apply a moisturizing lotion or cream to your hands regularly while treating dry skin, if that is an affected area.








, Prolonged exposure to dry heat is the fastest way to dry out your skin. While a campfire may be fun in colder temperatures, make sure you are not too close to a dry heat sources like this because it will make your dry skin worse. When you are inside, make sure you use a humidifier or similar appliance to keep moisture in the air.







, Good body wash products normally contain essential oils such as: coconut oil, olive oil and jojoba oils that help retain moisture. If you can, visit shops that specialize in natural products or consult a dermatologist for recommendations. Avoid cleansers with alcohol because they strip the skin of its natural oils.

, Though it seems unlikely, showering can dry out your skin unless you take proper precautions. Methods for treating dry skin apply to regular maintenance in this area: towel-dry your skin, and make sure to blot rather than rub. Afterwards, apply moisturizer to areas prone to dry skin or exposed to open air, such as the hands and face.








, For men, hydrate your face using a special pre-shave moisturizer or wet towel prior to shaving. Avoid using aftershave balms and lotions that contain alcohol, since this dries out your skin. For people who shave their legs, make sure to use moisturizing cleansers in the shower to prepare your skin.








, Remember that those products are usually quite different from each other. Depending on where you are in the world, some moisturizers may need to have high SPF to protect your skin from sunlight and UV rays. Keeping moisturizer in your bag also reminds you to moisturize your hands after you have washed your hands.








, Remember that the best cure for dry skin is prevention. Make sure you plan for healthy skin care practices even when you are traveling. Having a routine also allows you to practice good hygiene without having to devote unnecessary attention to your skin.








, There are several lifestyle choices you can make that will help your skin stay healthy and moisturized. Here are a few:


Stay hydrated with water. Drink at least 2.2 liters of water every day (if you're a woman) and 3 liters (if you're a man).Don't smoke. Smoking makes your skin age faster, so you will develop wrinkles earlier than you would have. The only way to prevent skin damage from smoking is to quit smoking."

Use an all-natural toner to deep clean your pores.,
Make a toner from apple cider vinegar.,
Try a toner made from lemon juice as another option.",How to Minimize Pores Naturally2," Avoid products that contain alcohol or benzoyl peroxide because these can dry your skin, similar to the way that these ingredients can dry out your hair.It is very important to emphasize that once your pores are enlarged, they might not shrink back down entirely. Natural products can help to minimize their appearance but they aren't a miracle cure. Over the counter and prescription treatments are usually more effective, but they aren't all natural.Do a little research on the ingredients in these products to help you choose the best product for your skin.
Toners get deep into the pores, cleaning out oil, dirt, and dead skin cells. Buildup of these products in your pores make them appear larger.

Soak a cotton ball in this mixture and wipe it across your face, or you can use a small spray bottle.
Put this toner on just after cleansing for best results.
Don't worry, the vinegar smell will dissipate after a few minutes.
Follow up with a light moisturizer to avoid dry skin. This method can be a little harsh for people with sensitive skin.
If you find the vinegar a little bit harsh, try a different method for making a natural toner.

, Lemon juice is a natural astringent and very cost effective.Squeeze 1/4 cup of lemon juice.
Add ¾ cup of witch hazel. You can find this at natural food stores and herbal supply shops.
Combine ingredients in a spray bottle and store in the refrigerator for up to a month.
Results will vary per person, but you can expect this toner to clean pores to aid in reducing their appearance and brighten the tone of your skin.

Begin by removing your makeup.,
Wash your face with warm water.,
Exfoliate your face.,
Moisturize every night.",How to Minimize the Size of Your Pores1," Buildup from makeup is often responsible for clogging pores, so removing it properly is an important step in minimizing their size. Use makeup remover pads or a cotton ball saturated in makeup remover to gently wipe it all away.


Vaseline makes a good natural makeup remover. Rub it over the areas of your face with heavy makeup and wipe it off with a cotton ball.
Never go to bed wearing makeup. Your pores will look larger in the morning.;
, Splash water on your face a few times in a row to remove all traces of the makeup remover. This gentle washing technique is sufficient for removing everyday buildup from your face. Avoid using cleansers that contain sulfates and other harsh cleansers; these irritate the face, causing pores to appear larger.


Use warm, not hot, water to cleanse your face. Hot water can cause skin irritation and dryness, leading to bigger-looking pores.
Blot your face dry with a soft towel, rather than scrubbing it, to prevent skin irritation.

, Exfoliating regularly removes dead skin cells, which can otherwise accumulate, mix with dirt and sweat and clog your pores. Use one of the following exfoliation techniques a few times a week to help your pores look smaller:


Try dry brushing. Buy a small, soft-bristled brush (a baby brush will work) and use it to gently brush dead skin from your face while it's dry.
Use an exfoliation product. If possible, choose a facial exfoliation product made with natural ingredients that won't scratch your face. Many facial scrubs are made with ground nuts or sugar that are rubbed onto your face to lift off the dirt and dead skin.
Make a facial scrub. Make a cup of green tea and add a tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon of honey. Smooth the mixture over your face and gently rub it in circles to exfoliate your face. Rinse with warm water and pat your face dry when you're finished.

, Keeping your skin hydrated makes your pores look smaller by keeping your skin from drying out and accumulating in your pores. Use oil, lotion or cream every night after completing your washing and exfoliation routine to wake up with smaller pores.

Remember to apply sunscreen.,
Improve your face's appearance by using a face mask.",How to Moisturize Your Face," When you have dry skin on your face, it feels dry and perhaps even stiff when you move your face's muscles quickly or try stretching your face. Your dry facial skin may look flakey or like it needs to peel on occasion. Your dry skin might form cracks that bleed. It may also look noticeably like it needs hydration or moisturizing.Many people get more severe dry skin in the winter because of the climate change.;
, Immediately after you wash your face, oily skin won't stay matte for long. It gets shiny again very quickly. Your face will shine because of the oil produced on the surface of your skin. There will likely be many breakouts on your face if you have oily skin.Oily skin is more common in younger people. Skin typically gets more dried out as we age.

, If your face is oily in the T-zone (the area of your nose, between your eyes and eyebrows, and forehead only) but everywhere else is dry, you probably have combination-type skin.If you have combination skin, then you will need to moisturize the different areas of your face appropriately. Follow guidelines for oily skin for your T-zone and follow guidelines for dry skin for the rest of your face.
Combination skin usually involves pores that look larger than normal because they are more open. This can also lead to more frequent breakouts.

, Frequent washing will cause your face to dry out even more. Additional water will not add hydration. When washing the face, it is best if you wash your face with warm water.When showering or washing your face, use warm or lukewarm water instead of hot water.
Use a gentle cleanser that is fragrance-free.
Avoid using hot or cold water when washing your face. Exposing the skin on your face to these extreme temperatures can cause excess dryness, irritation, or even rupture blood vessels., Start using a moisturizer product that is labeled ""for dry to very dry skin."" If you think that your skin is only a little dry, pick the product that is labeled ""for normal to dry skin.""If you want to use a natural ingredient, use an oil, such as olive oil or coconut oil.
A cream is better for dry skin than a lotion because it contains more oil and is, therefore, better at locking in moisture and helping to hydrate dry skin.

, It is important to apply your moisturizer immediately after washing your face so that the cream can help hold in any added moisture remaining from washing your face. Apply evenly and leave it for few minutes, until your face feels more hydrated. After this, you can apply your makeup.Do not apply too much, as this is a waste of product; adding more doesn't do more.

, A hydrating sunscreen that is broad spectrum (protects from both UVA and UVB rays) will protect you from burns and sun damage that ages the skin and will also prevent skin from drying out further.

Apply sunscreen as your morning moisturizer. You shouldn't need more than that, but if you want to supplement with an additional moisturizer, apply the SPF first. Wait a few minutes and allow it to dry, then apply the moisturizer on top.

, Facial masks can treat all kinds of skin issues, including dry skin. For dry skin, do this no more than twice a month. To combat dry skin, you’ll want to use a facial mask that contains one of the following:Olive oil
Argan oil
Coconut oil
Honey
Egg yolk
Carrot
Tomato

, If you have oily skin, you should wash your face a little more often than people with dry skin. It is recommended that you wash your face at least twice a day with a cleansing soap. Don't use hot water or steam to clean your face, as this removes essential fatty acids from your skin.And since oily skin is the easiest type of skin for acne to emerge on (owing to the excessive oil that is trapped inside the pores), it is better to have a cleansing face soap that contains tea tree oil/lemon/salicylic acid.
You may need to wash your face between two and three times daily, but be careful not to overdo it. Over-washing can dry your skin, which can actually cause it to produce more oil to compensate.

, Look for a moisturizer labeled ""for oily to normal skin."" Having an oily face does not mean you shouldn't use a moisturizer; it just needs to be a suitable moisturizer. Only use a water-based products though; you don't want to add more oil.A lotion is better for oily skin because it doesn’t contain the extra oils found in moisturizing creams.
While some recommend using various types of oil to cleanse faces with an oily skin type, most experts say that this method can do more harm than good — often leading to breakouts and other types of skin damage., To protect your skin and prevent sun damage and burns, you want to make sure you wear a sunscreen every day. If your skin is oily, look for an oil-free preparation made specifically for use on your face.Sunscreen should offer broad-spectrum coverage and an SPF of at least 30.If you apply a sunscreen, that should be enough to moisturize oily skin. There is no need to apply a moisturizer on top of that., Regularly using a face mask/exfoliating mask will help to make your skin feel better. For oily skin, use this treatment method less than twice a week. You can use either mask products or a DIY mask; both can be really helpful.

Consider a separate under-eye primer.,
Remember to wear sun protection.,
Wash your hands and face.,
Apply moisturizer.,
Wait at least five minutes.,
Put on primer.,
Do your makeup.",How to Moisturize Before Makeup," You can get moisturizer oil-free, extra heavy, or anywhere in between. Oil-free or light moisturizers are best for people with oily, combination, or normal skin. Heavier moisturizers are often necessary for dry skin, but they can be a slippery base for makeup.


Heavy moisturizers add a dewy effect to your appearance. Avoid using dewy foundation on top of that, which can overdo it.
You don't need to use the same moisturizer across your whole face. If you get dry patches in certain areas, use a heavy moisturizer on those spots.;
, Foundation for dry skin usually has moisturizer in it already. If you plan to use this type of foundation, stick to a lighter moisturizer than you normally would.

, If you find it difficult to put on makeup after moisturizer, try this 2-in-1 option. This product moisturizes your skin, while still providing a base that helps your makeup stay in place longer.

, The thin skin around your eyes tends to dry out easily. If your eye makeup often cracks, look for a moisturizing under-eye primer as well. Although some facial primers are safe for the eye area (check the label), an under-eye primer is less likely to irritate this sensitive area.

, Anytime you expect sun exposure (even on an overcast day), one of the products on your face should have sun protection. This could be your moisturizer, or your foundation.


Aim for a Sun Protection Factor of at least 15.

, Scrub your hands to avoid transferring anything to your face. Wash your face with water or your favorite facial cleanser.


Don't scrub your skin raw; just wipe gently.

, Dab on a small amount of moisturizer with your fingers. Spread outward and pat in the moisturizer with your fingers. Repeat until your face is covered, without putting any excess moisturizer on your skin.

, The moisturizer needs some time to form a smooth, even surface over your skin. Wait anywhere from five to thirty minutes before putting on makeup, or you may struggle with uneven application or even acne breakouts.

, If you haven't already put on moisturizing primer, you'll need a layer of primer so your makeup can stay on.

, You can now put on makeup as you normally would. If you still encounter problems, here's a little troubleshooting advice:


If your makeup has trouble staying in place, you may not be using enough moisturizer (or you may need to use a primer).
If your makeup ends up mixing into the moisturizer when you apply it, decrease the amount of moisturizer or wait longer between moisturizer and makeup.

Use a protective moisturizer.,
Apply foundation or concealer.,
Use mineral powder.",How to Minimize the Size of Your Pores2," Since makeup contributes to clogged pores, you need a protective layer of moisturizer between the makeup and your skin. Apply a light, natural moisturizer, and let your face absorb it for a few minutes before proceeding.








, Depending on your skin type, you might want to choose a matte or glossy concealer. Make sure it matches your skin tone, and apply it using a cotton ball.









Don't be tempted to use too much concealer in an effort to hide your pores. Caking makeup on will only draw more attention to areas you're trying to minimize.
Experiment with different brands. Some concealers may not work for your individual skin type. If one concealer seems to dry out your face or make your pores look bigger, try another one.

, A light application of powder over concealer can make pores appear much smaller. Wait until the concealer has set before using a blush or bronzer brush to lightly dust powder over your face.

Make your own clay mask.,
Try an alpha hydroxy or beta hydroxy acid mask.",How to Minimize the Size of Your Pores4," Clay masks are spread over the face and allowed to dry. As the water from the mask begins to evaporate, the clay pulls away from the skin and takes dead skin cells and debris that clog pores with it. Make your own clay mask using the following technique:


Mix 1 tablespoon of bentonite clay, 1 tablespoon of oatmeal and 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Use a spoon to stir until the ingredients are combined.
Apply the mixture to your face, taking care to cover all the areas where your pores are clogged. Allow it to sit until it dries, about 15 minutes.
Wash off the mask with warm water and pat your face dry with a soft towel. Your pores should no longer be clogged.

Cut the tops off of four caplets of vitamin E (400 IU each).,
Add a few drops of essential oil if desired.,
Mix the oils together.",How to Make Vitamin E Oil1," Use your measuring cup to measure out your oil. Since you will be using this oil on your skin and hair, you will need to make sure that the oil you choose is organic and non-comedogenic. Non-comedogenic oils will not clog your pores and are less likely to cause breakouts. Some good choices include:argan oil
hemp seed oil
sunflower oil
safflower oil;
, The funnel will help to make sure that you do not spill the oil. Insert the funnel into the bottle and then pour in the four ounces of oil that you have measured out. The dark brown or blue bottle will protect the vitamin E oil from getting degraded and oxidized by light.

, Leave the funnel in place and pour the vitamin E oil out of the caplets and into the bottle containing the base oil. Or, if you prefer, you can use a needle to make a hole in the caplet and then squeeze the Vitamin E into the bottle.


If you have vitamin E oil in liquid form instead of in caplets, then measure out about one teaspoon and add it to the base oil., To add a scent, add 3-5 drops of an essential oil of your choice. Pour the drops into the bottle containing the base oil and vitamin E oil. Some great essential oils to use include:rose
lilac
lavender
orange
lemon
peppermint

, Secure the cap on the bottle and turn the bottle upside down. Then turn it right-side up and then upside down again. Repeat this inversion several times to make sure that the oils are all mixed together.

Eat your vitamin E. Vitamin E helps keep your skin healthy by supporting new growth.,
Stock up on vitamin C. You probably know that vitamin C supports your immune system.,
Lean towards omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.,
Get enough vitamin A. Vitamin A plays an essential role in keeping your skin healthy.,
Eat the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables.,
Reach for whole grains.,
Choose lean protein.,
Skip sweets and refined foods.,
See a dermatologist yearly if you have skin problems.,
Always wear sunscreen.,
Ditch cigarettes.,
Manage stress.",How to Nourish Your Skin Through Diet," It also protects your skin from cellular damage to a degree.One reason it protects your skin is by being a powerful antioxidant, which helps slow down the damage of free radicals. Free radicals are responsible for aging, as well as one of the leading causes of cancer.

To incorporate vitamin E into your diet, eat foods like nuts and seeds, nut and seed oils, broccoli, spinach, and kiwi.;
, As a correlation, it also helps your skin blemishes heal faster. In addition, it helps with clear, radiant skin.Like vitamin E, it's a powerful antioxidant.
Citrus fruit, kiwi, mangoes, cantaloupe, leafy greens, broccoli, and peppers are just a few foods high in vitamin C., You've probably heard the myth that fat is bad for you. It's true that certain kinds of fat aren't very good for you. However, certain fats, like omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are not only good for you, they are essential to your overall health and your skin health.These fatty acids may help protect against aging.
It's particularly important to get omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids from your diet, as your body can't make them from other components like it can with other essential nutrients.
Eat foods like nut oils, fish, leafy greens, and flaxseed to incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids into your diet.Omega-6 fatty acids are primarily found in oils, such as sunflower, corn, soy, sesame, and safflower., Without enough of this vitamin, you can develop skin problems. In fact, many skin creams use this vitamin in topical form, but eating it can have benefits, too.Vitamin A is primarily found in liver, dairy foods, and eggs. Also, your body can produce vitamin A from beta carotene, found in leafy greens, carrots, peaches, and pretty much any yellow-orange fruit or vegetable.

, Getting a wide variety of fruit and vegetables is essential for good health, including skin health. You should be getting at least one to two servings of fruit and three to five servings of vegetables every day.Fruits and vegetables are high in many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support skin health.
A 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 cup of vegetables, or 2 cups of (raw) leafy greens equals a serving.

, Although whole grains don't have as many antioxidants or vitamins as fruits and vegetables, they are an important source of fiber. In addition, eating whole grains instead of refined grains may reduce inflammation on your skin.100% whole grains are higher in fiber than refined grains due to the minimal processing they go through. However, while refined grains don't have as much fiber, they are often fortified with vitamins that whole grains are not.
Fiber helps slow the release of glucose or sugar into your blood stream, which helps stabilize your blood sugar levels. Stabilized blood sugar levels may prevent excess oil production and the formation of acne.
Measure out a 1/2 cup or about 1 ounce of whole grains for a serving. Whole grains include foods such as brown rice, quinoa, whole grain bread, whole wheat pasta, bulgur, or millet., Protein is also essential to skin health, as it helps maintain the structure of your skin.For the healthiest diet, pick lean sources of protein, particularly ones rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

A serving of protein is usually three to four ounces or the size of a deck of cards. Lean protein sources include poultry, fish, low-fat dairy, and eggs.You should also include protein from legumes like beans, nuts, and seeds as these foods have a variety of nutrients that help protect and nourish your skin.

, Sugary foods like soda, fruit juices, and desserts, as well as processed foods like frozen dinners and fast food, may contribute to acne and blemishes. Consider avoiding these foods for healthier skin., Just like any other type of doctor, it's be a good idea to check in with a dermatologist. They can evaluate the condition of your skin and give you advice on how to improve it.


You should especially see a dermatologist if you have skin dryness, acne, age sports or you want to improve your skin in any other way.
Discuss the general health of your skin and talk about the ways you're looking to improve it.
Talk about your diet with the dermatologist. Certain foods you're eating could be leading to some of your skin issues.

, Ask any dermatologist or another health professional about skin health, and they'll most likely start by suggesting you wear sunscreen. Sunscreen protects your skin from the sun's harmful rays, which can cause your skin to age faster.Repeated exposure to the sun's rays can increase your risk for wrinkles, age spots, and skin cancer.
Apply a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Reapply at least every 2 hours.
Stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day, between 10 am and 2 pm, when the sun's rays are the most harmful.

, Smoking is another common cause of skin problems and premature aging. If you currently smoke, consider quitting to help protect and nourish your skin.Smoking narrows the tiny blood vessels in your face, which reduces the overall blood flow to your skin. This process contributes to the formation of wrinkles on your face, especially around your mouth.
Smoking also destroys the collagen in your skin. Collagen supports the elasticity and suppleness of your skin.
Try going cold turkey or talk to your doctor about medications that may help. You could also join a program to help you quit smoking.

, You can't control every stressful event in your life. However, managing your overall stress level may also help improve your skin. Studies have shown that increased stressed may trigger acne breakouts and other skin issues.If you have stress going on in your life, try to find time to relax and de-stress as much as possible.
To de-stress, try talking to a friend, taking a hot bath, reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, going for a walk, meditating, or going to bed early.
If you're having difficulty managing your overall stress levels, especially if your stress is significantly affecting your skin, consider talking to your doctor or a psychologist about managing your stress more effectively.

Heat the mixture to the right temperature.,
Lower the mixture’s temperature.,
Stir the mixture until it thickens properly.,
Remove the pan from the heat and add the salt.,
Allow the mixture to cool.,
Skim the top layer from the mixture.,
Pour the glycerin into a glass bottle.",How to Make Vegetable Glycerin," Add 1 cup (200 g) of coconut oil and 1 cup (237 ml) of olive oil to a large saucepan. Stir the two together briefly, though they won’t blend completely until they are heated.You can substitute palm, vegetable, soybean, or jojoba oil for the coconut and olive oils.;
, Place the saucepan with the oils on your stovetop. Turn the heat to high, and allow the mixture to heat for 1 or 2 minutes or until the coconut oil begins to melt.Make sure to wear safety goggles or glasses, rubber gloves, and a face mask to protect yourself from the high temperature and the lye that you’ll use in the next step. Wearing long pants and a long-sleeve top are also a good idea.

, While the oils are heating, add 2 tablespoons (30 g) of lye into 1 cup (237 ml) of water in a heat-safe glass container. Be sure to add the lye into the water and not the other way around, because adding water to lye can cause the lye to expand out of the container.Online retailers are usually the best place to purchase lye. It can be difficult to find in brick and mortar stores.
When you’re working with lye, adequate ventilation is important. Open some windows and/or turn on a fan.

, Once you’ve mixed the lye and water, carefully pour the mixture into the oils in the saucepan. Mix well to ensure that the ingredients are thoroughly combined.Be careful as you mix the lye and water in so the mixture doesn’t come into contact with your skin.
If you get lye on your skin, flush your skin immediately with cold water and take off any clothing that it may have splashed on. Continue flushing the skin with water for 15 minutes, and then seek medical attention.

, After you’ve added the lye solution to the oils, attach a clip-on candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan. Continue heating the mixture on high until the temperature reaches 125 degrees Fahrenheit (52 degrees Celsius), which should take approximately 20 minutes.Getting the mixture to the right temperature is very important when making vegetable glycerin so you must use a thermometer to make sure that the mixture is hot enough.
Make sure to stir the mixture regularly so all of the ingredients are well blended.

, Once the mixture reaches 125 degrees Fahrenheit (52 degrees Celsius), turn down the heat to medium or medium-low. You want to bring the mixture’s temperature down until it falls to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius)., After you’ve brought the mixture’s temperature down to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), continue stirring it for another 10 to 15 minutes over the heat. The mixture should thicken enough that the outline of the spoon’s path remains visible for a few seconds after you trace it through.Don’t cook the mixture too long, or it may become too thick to stir.

, Once the mixture has reached the proper consistency, take the pan off the heat. Mix in ½ cup (150 g) of salt, and stir well so it is thoroughly incorporated.Make sure that the mixture is still hot when you add in the salt.

, After you’ve mixed the salt into the lye and oil mixture, leave it to cool completely, which should take 20 to 30 minutes. As it cools, the soap and glycerin will gradually separate into different layers.The soap will solidify into a thick layer on the top of the mixture, while the glycerine will remain liquid-y on the bottom.

, When the mixture has cooled completely, pour off the top soap layer from the top of the glycerin. You may find it easier to use a spoon to gently lift the soap off, though.If you want to use the soap, add it to a soap mold and put it in the freezer for 24 hours. Let the soap bars air dry for at least 2 to 3 weeks to finish curing them.
If you don’t want to make soap, you can discard the soap layer.

, Once you’ve removed the soap from the top of the mixture, transfer the liquid vegetable glycerine to a glass bottle. Seal the container tightly, and store it in the refrigerator.The vegetable glycerin should keep in the fridge for at least 3 to 4 weeks. You'll know that it has gone bad if it is no longer clear and instead appears cloudy. Glycerin that has gone bad may also develop a foul smell.

Reduce shine.,
Keep skin healthy.,
Even skin tone.",How to Make an Upturned Nose Look Good1," If your nose is shiny and oily, it will attract more attention. If you feel self-conscious about your upturned nose, more attention may be the last thing that you want. Reducing shine will help minimize the attention that is drawn to your nose.


Try oil-absorbing sheets or wipes. For example, the company Clean & Clear makes oil absorbing sheets that soak up excess oil without smudging makeup or leaving behind traces of powder. They come in small, portable packs and are an easy solution for an oily or shiny nose.
Use a matte foundation. A matte foundation, especially one designed for use on oily skin, can help reduce the shine around your nose. You can choose between a liquid or powder foundation, but the most important thing is to find one that reduces shine. For example, Nars makes a mattifying, sheer foundation that helps to control shine and even skin tone.;
, Acne, especially if it is located mainly on or around your nose, can draw more attention to your upturned nose than you would like. An easy way to make any kind of nose look good is by taking care of your skin.


Use an anti-acne face wash. Neutrogena, Clean & Clear, Cetaphil, L’Oreal, and Garnier all make anti-acne face washes that can be found easily at most drugstores or grocery stores. Follow the instructions on the bottle, which usually include washing your face twice a day and following up with a light, oil-free moisturizer.
Look for face washes with benzoyl peroxide, which kills acne-causing bacteria, reduces inflammation, and helps to clear blocked pores.As an alternative, look for face washes with salicylic acid, which helps to unclog pores and correct the abnormal shedding of cells., If you have an uneven skin tone, certain parts of your face, such as your upturned nose, may be more noticeable. Luckily, evening out your skin tone is easily achieved.


For short term improvement, you can apply a concealer or foundation. Concealers and foundation can be found to match your natural skin tone, and with correct use, no one will notice that you are wearing makeup. Try MAC Studio Finish SPF 35 Concealer- it comes in eight different skin tones and offers SPF protection as well.
For a long term solution, you can look into getting a laser treatment or having a microdermabrasion session. These professional treatments will help remove dead skin and discoloration and will often result in a significant improvement to the evenness of your skin tone. These treatments require a visit to a dermatologist or skincare professional.

Draw attention to your eyes.,
Draw attention to your lips.,
Get a flattering haircut.,
Try contouring.",How to Make an Upturned Nose Look Good2," You can use eyeliner, accentuated lashes, and eye shadow to emphasize your eyes, which will make your upturned nose less noticeable on your face.Making your eyes look bigger will make your nose look smaller in comparison.


Consider using eyeliner to make a “cat eye” look, which is a dramatic way to draw attention to your eyes.
Several coats of mascara can lengthen and emphasize your eyelashes; in addition, an eyelash curler can enhance the effects of your mascara. If you really want to go for a dramatic look, apply false eyelashes, which can add length and volume to your normal eyelashes.
A dramatic “smoky eye,” created by a combination of dark eyeshadows (think blues, browns, greys) can also make your eyes the focal point of your face. Try to work with eyeshadow that will draw out the natural color of your eyes to make them stand out., If you feel like your lips are a strong feature on your face, accentuating them with color or shine will draw attention away from your upturned nose and make your lips the focal point of your face.


Select a lipstick color that enhances your lips. Choose a bright red, a dark color (such as maroon), or a bright pink. This is certain to make your lips your focal feature!
Wear lip gloss. If you don’t want to make a dramatic statement with lip color, try wearing a shiny coat of gloss on your lips. This will also draw attention away from your upturned nose and is more suitable for situations where wearing a bright lip color would not be appropriate, such as in many workplaces.

, A haircut is a great way to change the appearance of your nose. People with upturned noses can often pull off a short and/or shaggy hair.


Talk to your hair stylist and explain your desire to hide your upturned nose as much as possible. As they are hair professionals, he or she may have a recommendation for a hair style that will flatter your hair type and texture as well as reduce the appearance of your upturned nose.
Consider getting layers or messy bangs. If your hair looks like it’s meant to be covering parts of your face, your upturned nose will be less noticeable; plus, these hairstyles are very fashionable today!

, Contouring involves strategically placing dark or light color foundation or powder on your skin in order to make particular features recede and others become more prominent. Do a Google search for “facial contouring,” or watch “contouring with makeup” videos on YouTube to see the best tips and tricks for accentuating the natural features of your face.


You will need to buy a foundation 2-3 shades darker than your skin tone (either powder or cream) for creating contour, as well as a foundation 2-3 shades lighter than your skin tone (either powder or cream) for highlighting.
If you want to minimize your upturned nose, draw a line with contour powder/cream down each side of your nose. Next, draw a down-facing arrow with contour cream/powder once you get to the tip of your nose, creating the illusion of a slimmer nose tip. Finally, draw a slender line with highlighter powder/cream down the center of your nose.Don’t forget to blend your contouring well before leaving the house! Looking at your contouring in different types of light can help minimize the appearance of makeup on your face.

Smile, but not too widely.,
Don’t flare your nostrils.",How to Make an Upturned Nose Look Good3," If your chin is tilted down slightly, your upturned nose will be much less obvious, and people will not be able to see inside your nostrils.Tilting your chin down can also be an effective way of turning the focus onto your eyes and can help make your face look more slender as well.


Practice your head tilt in the mirror. You want to make this head tilt look natural, and not forced. If you practice while looking in the mirror, you can find an angle at which to hold your head that minimizes the appearance of your nose and still looks comfortable.

, Smiling widely will make your nose appear wider, and your nostrils appear wider as well. Controlling your smile can be an especially useful trick for when you wish to draw attention away from your upturned nose in photos.


Maintain white teeth. If your teeth are healthy and pearly white, they will receive more attention than your upturned nose. This will also enhance your smile, drawing more focus to your mouth.

, Because people with upturned noses have visible nostrils, they are more noticeable when they flare. Try to prevent flaring your nostrils to reduce the appearance of your upturned nose.

Make applying sunscreen a daily practice.,
Put a hat on.,
Add a pair of sunglasses.,
Skip tanning.",How to Maintain the Beauty of Your Face1," The sun damages the skin on your face (and the rest of your body) over time. Therefore, make it a practice to apply sunscreen on your face every day, as well as the rest of your body (if it's exposed to the sun). When you're looking at sunscreens, make sure to choose one that blocks out both UVB and UVA rays and has a SPF of 30 or more.If you want to keep your stunning good looks, the sun isn't your friend - it will result in your skin appearing to be dry, and discolored after many years of exposure.Pick a sunscreen specially formulated for your face so it won't clog pores. Alternatively, try picking a moisturizer that already has sunscreen built in.;
, Similarly, adding shade to your face can help protect your skin from the sun. Try wearing a hat when you venture outside, especially on very sunny days., Sunglasses help you see better and protect your eyes from sun damage that can lead to cataracts.Additionally, they also offer protection to the sensitive skin around your eyes. Look for ones that block UVB and UVA rays - which most do. Ones that are larger and around the side of your head offer more protection.If you already wear eyeglasses, the best option is sunglasses that fit over your glasses, blocking both the front and sides of your eyes from the sun. Clip-ons and transition lenses provide some protection but not as much as compared to sunglasses., Tanning beds are just as harmful to your skin as tanning in the sun is - sometimes they are even more detrimental to your skin. It - the tanning bed- floods your body and face with both UVA and UVB rays, which you should be protecting your face and skin against instead of willingly subjecting them to."

Pick mild soaps.,
Keep your showers short.,
Pat your skin dry.,
Be gentle when removing makeup.,
Add a moisturizer.,
Fight against acne.",How to Maintain the Beauty of Your Face2," When looking for soaps, choose ones that are meant for sensitive skin or are moisturizing. If you choose a harsh soap for your face, it can strip your skin of its natural oils. These oils are important for keeping your skin moisturized, which in turn, helps your face stay looking young., Long, hot showers strip your skin of moisture. Over time, that can wear on your face. Therefore, keep your showers short, and use warm water rather than very hot water., Rather than roughly rubbing your skin after you shower or wash your face, pat it gently instead. When you're rough, you remove oils from your skin. In addition, being too rough can cause aging., The more you pull and yank your skin, the more likely you are to end up with wrinkles. In fact, the same goes for applying makeup. For example, if you're constantly pulling your skin down to apply makeup to your eyes, it can lead to more wrinkles.That being said, it's important to remove your makeup before you go to sleep. If you don't, it can clog your pores over time, causing them to become larger. Even if you're not wearing makeup, you should wash your face before bed, as grime and dirt build up during the day. Both makeup and dirt can cause damage to collagen - which helps keep your skin elastic., You should use a moisturizer after you shower or wash your face, as well as before you go to sleep. Moisturizers keep your skin hydrated, helping you maintain beautiful skin. If you choose one with an SPF built into it, you don't need to apply a separate sunscreen.When looking for a moisturizer, choose one that's appropriate for your skin type. A wide variety are available, meant for skin from dry to oily., Acne can mar the beauty of your face. Therefore, use tips to treat it, keeping your face clearer and more beautiful.Use a mild acne cleanser to treat acne, using it to clean your face two times a day. Acne creams and lotions can also be helpful.Lower your stress levels. Stress can cause breakouts, so if you want to minimize them, try to keep stress to a minimum. Yoga and meditation can help you manage your stress, as can cutting back on the number of activities you're involved in.Talk to your doctor. If over-the-counter treatments aren't working, try asking your doctor for something stronger. You can also ask about birth control, which helps some women control acne."

Don't forget to add a smile.",How to Maintain the Beauty of Your Face3," Smoking is, of course, terrible for your overall health. It's been linked to lung cancer, among other diseases. In addition, it's bad for your skin. Mostly, it can cause wrinkles because it lowers the amount of collagen and elastin, which help prevent wrinkles., Don't forget to include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Also, stick to healthy fats and try to pick foods high in vitamin C. The healthy diet will help keep your skin healthy, but it will also help keep your face from breakouts.Healthy fats can be found in seeds, nuts, fish, avocado, olives, and some types of oil such as olive oil and flaxseed oil.Fruits and veggies that are high in vitamin C include : citrus fruits, strawberries, raspberries, watermelon, spinach, bell peppers, cauliflower, pineapple, kiwi, potatoes, cantaloupe, and tomatoes., If you are constantly dehydrated, your skin will suffer. Dehydration leads to dry skin, which in turn makes wrinkles to form easily.You don't need to drink extra water to help your skin. You just need to drink enough to make sure you are hydrated.Men should drink 13 cups of water a day, while women should consume 9 cups of water a day., Smiling has been proven to make you look younger. Though it may add to laugh or smile lines over time, smiling can take years off your face."

Hot water is harsh on skin and will strip your skin of its protective oils. Cool water, on the other hand, can help prevent your face from overproducing oil.Apply a small amount of facial cleanser, and use a soft wash cloth or facial sponge to massage into skin. Rinse completely and pat dry.;
, Everyone's face is different, so it can take some trial and error to find the kind that works to keep your skin balanced. It's important to find one that is clinically proven to be ""noncomedogenic,"" which means it won't clog your pores and lead to more breakouts.Look for a cleanser that is pH balanced, to help prevent drying out your skin.If you have acne-prone skin, you might need to use a special cleanser formulated for your skin. Cleansers with salicylic acid can clear out blocked pores, while those with benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria and gently exfoliates the top layer of dead skin, which can help prevent clogged pores as well. Sodium sulfacetamide can help fight bacteria growth.If your skin is typically clear and you just want to prevent the occasional breakout, avoid using cleansers made for skin with problem acne. Those tend to be harsh and can dry out your skin unnecessarily.
If you wear make-up, it is important that you remove all of it every night before bed so that your pores don't become clogged, leading to blackheads and break-outs. However, some super gentle facial cleansers are not tough enough to remove some types of make-up (such as waterproof mascara or full-coverage foundation). In that case, you might try using an oil-based make-up remover or plain, unrefined coconut oil to remove the make-up first, then use your regular cleanser to rid your face of oil., Often, you can find a product that will do double-duty as both a sunscreen and a moisturizer. Just be sure the product contains an SPF of 30 or more and blocks both UVA and UVB rays.Since acne-prone skin is typically already oily, be sure the sunscreen and moisturizer are water-based, not oil-based., Many people suffer with acne in places other than the face, such as the chest, back, or neck. These areas can become oily and sweaty, which encourages bacteria to multiply and contributes to breakouts. If you have acne prone skin elsewhere on your body, it is a good idea to cleanse and treat these areas just as you would the face.In most cases you can use the same gentle cleanser for your body as you use on your face. However, if you have more severe acne in other areas than you do on your face, you may want to use a stronger medicated cleanser for your body area than you do for your face. Some body washes are specially formulated with acne-fighting ingredients, and because they tend to come in a bigger tube, can be a cheaper way to treat your body acne.
You can skip the moisturizer if these areas are not prone to dryness. Similarly, if your acne-prone areas are not in places that are exposed to sunlight (like your back or chest), feel free to skip the sunscreen. The less product you can apply to any given area, the better.

, Some people have a whole arsenal of products to apply to their face daily, but too many products can actually be counter-productive. Most people just need a cleanser, sunscreen, and moisturizer (and these last two can often come in one product).


If you use an acne-fighting cleanser containing benzoyl peroxideor alpha hydroxy acid, you do not need to also use a physical exfoliator like a face or body scrub. The chemical ingredients dissolve dead skin cells, and excessive exfoliation can irritate the skin and cause small tears that can introduce bacteria, leading to more acne.

, If you have clear skin, you don’t need to use a strong anti-acne cream or treatment all over your face. Instead, use it only where you are prone to get acne (generally in the ""T-zone"" across the forehead and down the nose and chin), or where you already have an active breakout.


Try applying lemon juice and then ice to your blemish to dry it out and reduce swelling. Put a small amount of juice on a cotton ball and hold it on your pimple for two minutes, then apply a compress made with an ice cube and wash cloth for two minutes.Apply a spot treatment using a q-tip or cotton ball. These come at all price points; cheaper options can be purchased at your local drugstore or big box store, or more expensive (and more effective) options can be purchased at a dermatologist's office. Some brands include Burt's Bees Natural Acne Solution, Murad Acne Blemish Spot Treatment, and Bye Bye Blemish Drying Lotion.
If you wear makeup, consider using a concealer or foundation that contains acne-fighting ingredients, such as Clinique Acne Solutions Liquid Makeup, Almay Clear Complexion Blemish Healing Makeup, or Cover FX Blemish Treatment Concealer.

, Even if you shower before bed every night, your pillowcase is a hotbed of germs and grease from your hair, face, nose, and mouth. Wash your pillowcase every few days to prevent these germs from causing further skin issues.


If you have an especially oily face, flip your pillow over and use the back after you've used the other side. Then, wash the pillow case the next day. It helps if you have several pillowcases so you don't have to wash laundry every two days.
If you struggle with acne in other places like your chest or back, be sure to change your whole sheet set and not just your pillowcase, since bacteria on your sheets combined with excess oil can lead to more breakouts., Just like fingers, hair contains oils from your scalp as well as from styling products, conditioner, and shampoo. When your hair rests on your skin, these oils transfer and can lead to a breakout that dermatologists call ""pomade acne.""Style your hair out of your face.


If you are prone to breakouts on the forehead and have oily hair, you might consider avoiding hairstyles that touch the face such as bangs and layers.

, If you use makeup, be sure the makeup does not contribute to break-outs. Just like your fingers and hair, some makeup contains ingredients that clog pores and cause breakouts. You might also be sensitive to other ingredients in the makeup, and what looks like a breakout might actually be an allergic reaction.


Go makeup free for a week or try a brand with different ingredients to determine if your makeup is causing skin issues.
Some brands that claim to be good for very sensitive, acne-prone skin include BareMinerals and Clinique.

, Just like your pillowcase, your phone comes in regular contact with the grease and germs on your face and fingers. To make matters worse, the warmth of your phone makes it a ideal spot for germs to breed and multiply.Use a headset or speakerphone if you can, and be sure to sanitize your phone with a paper towel and a small bit of hand sanitizer every day., Water helps reduce blemishes and keeps the skin hydrated and plump, which helps with your skin tone by giving you a natural glow. If you drink one more bottle of water a day you will notice results in your skin.


Generally, most men need to drink about 3 liters (or 13 cups) of beverages daily, while most women need about 2.2 liters (9 cups) a day. Drink more if you are larger than average, very active, nursing a baby or pregnant, or if you live in a dry or hot climate., Believe it or not, what you eat affects your skin. Scientists have found that certain foods that cause your blood-sugar levels to spike raise your body's insulin levels, which causes a reaction that blocks your pores and creates blemishes.Foods to avoid include sugary foods and refined grains like white bread, pasta, or rice. Try to eat as many unprocessed or minimally processed foods as possible, including whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.Some people swear that greasy, fried foods like fried chicken or French fries can cause pimples. Other people say that they always break out after eating particular junk foods like candy bars or chocolate. If you are not sure what your dietary triggers might be, it can help to keep a food diary to see when new pimples emerge.
Try to include healthy oils in your diet, which can help your body produce the right level of natural oils on your skin. Walnuts, salmon, avocados, and olive oil all contain healthy fats, or you can add an Omega-3 supplement to your diet., You probably know that a lack of sleep will leave you with dark circles and puffy bags under your eyes, but chronic sleep deprivation can also cause skin to appear older, with premature dull tone and fine lines.Additionally, scientists believe that a lack of adequate sleep can cause acne breakouts, since a lack of sleep causes increased stress levels, which are linked with breakouts.Everyone needs at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep at night, and some people need even more., Exercise has so many benefits, and it turns out that it can also reduce your risk for acne breakouts. This is because, like adequate sleep, adequate exercise is related to a lower stress level, which is linked to less frequent breakouts.Exercise also helps by boosting blood circulation, which makes your body more efficient at eliminating waste (and thus getting rid of the gunk that otherwise would have clogged your pores). Exercise wearing breathable cotton materials, and be sure to take a shower right after exercising. Your sweat combined with the bacteria and oil on your skin can lead to more breakouts., Sun damaged skin is more prone to acne and discoloration, but using a sunscreen with an SPF level of at least 30 can prevent damage and also keep your face looking young and healthy. Acne prone skin sometimes reacts to certain chemicals in sunscreen, causing a breakout. Look for a brand that uses a gentle sunscreen ingredient, such as oxybenzone, zinc oxide, avobenzone, or octocrylene. Be sure the label says that the sunscreen is ""noncomedogenic,"" which means it will not clog your pores., There are several options for people who suffer with chronic acne, and if you struggle to maintain clear skin after following all of these suggestions, you might consider talking to your doctor or dermatologist about what is best for you.


Many people have had success with products that contain retinoids, which are sold under prescription names Retin-A, Renova, and generic Tretinoin. Non-prescription options also work, but contain less of the active ingredient and so you need to use them more frequently. These products can reduce acne and also improve the appearance of skin tone and fine lines."

, Pour 100 grams of distilled water into your large glass bowl. Put the 68 grams of lye into the distilled water.

Moisturize your skin.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Rub an ice cube on your face or dunk your face in ice water—seriously.,
Soothe your skin by soaking a washcloth in cold milk and laying it over your face for 10 minutes.Milk is filled with healthy proteins and amino acids; it will keep your skin looking young and soft—it has the added benefit of reducing the appearance of red or blotchy skin.

",How to Look Younger in 10 Minutes2," This is a fast process; it can be an easy part of your morning routine. Moisturizing is often thought of as a part of female skin care, but men will benefit from moisturizing as well.This will prevent your facial skin from drying out, and moisturized skin is a valuable part of a youthful appearance. Moisturizers will need to be applied daily to remain effective over time.

, Like moisturizing, exfoliation is a quick process that will keep your face looking young, and maintain the health of your skin. Many grainy scrubs can be purchased in drug stores or grocery stores; these inexpensive exfoliating products will clean your face, boost collagen production (which keeps your skin taut) and help remove dead skin cells., This will immediately help your skin look fresher and younger. Just rub an ice cube around your eyes, mouth, nose, and over your cheeks—or if you have time, fill your sink with ice water and let your face soak in it. The ice will constrict the blood veins in your face and help your skin appear less puffy in general.Cooling your face will also:


Tighten your facial skin, helping it look better rested and younger.
Decrease the visibility of facial wrinkles.
Cleanse your pores and help prevent acne.

Groom your eyebrows into a fuller, thicker shape.,
Change your lipstick or lip gloss routine.,
Emphasize the natural rosy color of your cheeks.,
Avoid wearing powder-based makeups.",How to Look Younger in 10 Minutes3," A thicker, more developed eyebrow will have a youthful feel and shape to it.Of course, you can still groom your eyebrows and maintain a shape that you like—but let them grow out into a more natural shape. At the same time, avoid molding your brows with any unnatural angles or harsh outlines—this looks more artificial, which in turn indicates age., Lipsticks or lip glosses in lighter colors—red or pink, especially—can help you look younger, without drawing unnecessary attention to wrinkles or thinning skin around your mouth.If you don’t usually use lipstick or a colored lip gloss (which, to some, brings back high-school memories), a neutral lip color can also connote youthfulness. Try a glossy look, which will add fullness to your lips., A slightly flushed facial color will connote youthfulness and bring an energetic feel. This can be easy to overdo, however; start with a little color and add more as needed.


You can color your cheeks using a shade that is a little more red and flushed than your skin tone and brushing it lightly over your cheekbones.If you would prefer to lightly blush without the use of makeup, splash your cheeks with cold water to redden them naturally.

, While powdery makeups are readily accessible and generally popular, they can actually make you look older by drawing attention to growing pores or developing lines on your face.Instead of a powder, try an alternative like:


applying a tinted moisturizer.
using a liquid foundation.

Act, move, and smile with confidence.",How to Look Younger in 10 Minutes4," Dressing yourself in the morning is often a hasty part of everyone’s daily routine—however, minor alterations to the way you dress yourself can have a significant effect on how old you look.Try wearing outfits with a slimmer, more fitted look.


Avoid clothing that looks too baggy or neutral—try wearing clothes with more color, especially a color that highlights your flatters your complexion or matches your eyes.
When changing your outfit, try different things. See which clothes make you feel best; you’ll feel better and look more confident if you dress in a way that feels natural to you.

, When someone stands with a slumped posture or keeps their eyes downcast, they often appear older than they are. A confident, erect posture will help you look and feel younger.

stand with your feet shoulder-width apart,
inclined your weight backwards (towards your heels),
square your shoulders to keep your chest open; avoid hunching forward.

, If you don’t already wear a cologne or perfume, it can be a great way to draw positive attention to yourself and be perceived as more attractive and youthful. Experiment with a variety of scents—in general, floral or rose-scented perfumes and colognes are reminiscent of old age.Avoid these, and instead try a more fruity (or earth-toned), vibrant scent.

, Confidence connotes vitality and other youthful characteristics—try to act confidently and move with assertion. In addition to making your body appear younger through better posture and quicker movements, smiling more will help you look more appealing, engaging, and younger."

Normal skin has an even tone, smooth texture and it generally doesn't suffer from blemishes. It will feel neither dry or greasy to the touch.
Dry skin is often flakey as it suffers from a lack of water and/or oil. It might be uneven in texture and in tone and generally appear to be rough or scaly.
Oily skin tends to look very shiny and is often plagued by blackheads, pimples or cysts. Your pores might be more visible if your have oily skin.
Sensitive skin is often red and irritated; sometimes, irritations are triggered from chemicals in skin care products. Flare ups in the skin can also be caused by heavily fragranced products.
Sometimes sensitive skin is caused by a larger condition such as acne, eczema, rosacea, etc. If you suffer from one of these conditions, it might be best to consult a dermatologist to help treat it.;
, The most beneficial thing you can do for your skin is to protect it from the harmful, damaging rays of the sun. You should invest in an effective sunscreen with a minimum SPF 30 and wear it every day, even when it is cloudy or raining.Most importantly, sunscreen can protect you from developing skin cancer. Be sure to wear a full-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays.
If you start wearing sunscreen in your teens and 20s, it will help prevent wrinkles from developing decades down the road in your 40s and 50s.
Wearing sunscreen every day will also cut down on any redness or uneven patches in your complexion, giving you a more even skin tone without makeup.

, Using the right cleanser for your skin type can dramatically improve the quality of your complexion. For most skin types, bar soaps will be too harsh for your skin. Instead, use a liquid cleanser specifically designed for the face.


If you have oily skin, you might need to cleanse two or three times a day; if you have very dry skin, you might only want to cleanse in the evening. Be sure to avoid cleansers with harsh detergents or alcohol as these can damage the protective layer of moisture on your skin.If you have oily, acne prone skin, consider using a cleanser which contains salicylic acid, which can help unclog pores and prevent break outs.
If you have dry or sensitive skin, you should avoid foaming cleansers on your face, which can strip moisture from your skin. Instead, consider using a cleanser with a creamy, milk-like texture or a gel-based consistency., Any basic skin care routine should include moisturizing; it maintains the protective barrier of your skin. Oily skin types should consider a moisturizer that has a thinner, lotion-like consistency. Dry skin types might need a thicker cream.


If you have oily skin, you might resist using a moisturizer. But if you properly hydrate your skin with a moisturizer, then your skin won't produce as much oil, reducing your risk for acne.
Consider using a moisturizer that contains some of the following ingredients, which can improve the stratum corneum, or the outermost layer of skin: ceramides, fatty acids, and hyaluronic acid (all help bind moisture to the skin).
Many common oils are also effective moisturizers. You can consider using oils found in your own kitchen cabinet -- like olive oil or coconut oil -- or more less common oils such argan, marula, jojoba or almond oil.

, To get a truly smooth, bright complexion, consider using an exfoliating mask to even out the texture of the skin. You should use a mask or treatment that has a combination of Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs). Avoid using face scrubs with harsh beads because this can do more damage to the skin.


You should especially avoid masks with pieces of almond or fruit stones in it; these can often make cuts into the skin.

, A Vitamin C serum can help even out sun spots or other forms of discoloration on your skin. Apply this before your sunscreen to get a great, natural glow., Start with your eye lashes. Where you might normally apply mascara, use your finger to gently push your eyelashes upward. You can also use an eyelash curler to give you eyes a fuller look.


Avoid licking your finger as you curl up your eyelashes as this can put bacteria into a very sensitive area of your face.

, You don't need tons of lipstick to create an alluring pout. Instead, use a hydrating lip balm that will enhance the natural plumpness of your lips.


You can also rub a strawberry or other red berry onto your lips to add a flush of color. This trick was popular in ancient Greece when make up was frowned upon socially.

, If you really miss your blush, you might be tempted to hit or pinch your cheeks in an attempt to make them turn red. Don't do this as it could cause injury to the skin. Instead, gently pucker your lips so they are sucked under the hollow of your cheekbones. Hold for three seconds and then exhale. The rush of blood back to your cheeks will add a rosy glow.

, Although this is typically a product used before you apply foundation, a good primer can help blur imperfections on its own without adding artificial color to your face. Use a silicone-based primer to help cover up noticeable pores.

, Although some cosmetics companies consider these products to fall under the category of ""make up,"" you will find they are lighter and offer less coverage than a traditional liquid or powder foundation. If you are primarily concerned with evening out your skin tone, then these products can help.


BB creams were originally created in Germany, but they really made a splash on the Korean beauty market before coming over to the United States. ""BB"" initially stood for ""blemish balm,"" but in the U.S. they have been rebranded as ""beauty balm.""
In texture, BB creams are actually not balm-like, but more like a lighter, thinner liquid foundation. They often come with a small amount of SPF in them (such as SPF 15 or 20). Do not rely on these as your primary form of SPF.You can apply these products to you skin after your sunscreen. Use clean hands, a brush or a sponge to blend them into your skin.

, Skin often looks its worst when it is dehydrated and sallow. Drink plenty of water to maintain a ""lit from within"" look. Water from fruits, vegetables and milk will also help keep you hydrated.

, Avoiding sugars and processed foods will help not only your waistline, but your skin. Foods with the antioxidant selenium (found commonly in Brazil nuts, shrimp, and other seafoods) have been shown to improve skin health and reduce the risk of skin cancer.

, The CDC recommends between 7-9 hours for most adults. Nothing will age your skin faster than dark circles under your eyes. Nothing will make you look more well-rested than an actual good night's sleep.

, Stress can negatively impact your hormones, which in turn can overproduce oil that leads to breakouts. Exercise, meditation, and making time for friends and family can help relieve stress.

Use a translucent mineral powder to stop shininess.,
Use tinted moisturizer on your skin.,
Borrow a look from your favorite freckled celebrity.",How to Look Good with Freckles1," Freckles are unique and can be quite beautiful! Instead of hiding your freckles, try letting them stand out on your own.


One way you can do this is by playing up another facial feature like your eyes. It will draw people’s attention to your eyes and they will be more likely to notice the freckles on your cheeks.;
, This will make your freckles look dull and your complexion look unnatural. Instead, match your foundation and your makeup to the skin tone between the freckles. This is your natural skin tone.If you are having trouble matching your skin tone on your face, try matching foundation with the skin color on your wrist. The inside of your wrist is the same skin tone of your face.

, Foundation straight on your skin may not truly cover your face. Primer will help give you a basic tone for your foundation to rest on. This will help hide or tone down your freckles., Beauty expert Robin Black recommends to use blush to bring out your features, not your freckles. If you pick a blush the same color as your freckles, she says, it will make them look gray. , A brown or black smokey eye can really make the freckles on your face pop and draw attention to your eyes. Cosmo suggests following a “map” tutorial when creating a perfect smokey eye.To do this, first use multiple shades (3-4) of eyeshadows from the same color family. This may be shades of brown or black for a classic look.
Then, starting with the lightest shade first, apply a layer of eyeshadow on the inside half of your eyelid (closest to nose).
After that, apply the next darkest shade on the outside of your lid.
You should apply the darker shades in equal parts on the outside of your lid all the way to the bottom of your eyelid.
Apply a nude pencil line between your eyebrow and the top of your eyeshadow.
Apply your favorite eyeliner and mascara.

, Use a lighter shade of foundation -- such as one that promotes to be “barely there” -- to avoid making your skin look gray.


Other foundation products you might try are “neutralizing” products that will help moisturize your skin without covering up your features.

, Not being able to use a heavier foundation may cause the problem of your skin looking oily or shiny. To avoid this, use a translucent mineral powder. This will help your skin, but not hide your freckles!

, If you want to skip makeup, try just using a tinted moisturizer or a BB cream. This will keep your face moisturize but give it a little bit of made-up look., There are many freckled celebrities that embrace their beautiful features. Lucy Liu, Emma Watson, and Morgan Freeman are all known for the freckles!


Makeup may not be Freeman’s forte, but he rocks the freckles with pride!

Wrap up from head to toe.,
At home, keep warm but not hot.,
Adapt your hair care to the weather changes.,
As with your hair, your skin care routine should also be adjusted.,
Give your lips extra attention to avoid them becoming chapped and splitting.,
Apply a good hand cream daily and whenever needed.,
Eat a balanced diet and stay hydrated.",How to Look After Your Skin and Hair in Winter," Invest in a warm pair of gloves to protect your hands and prevent the skin on them from becoming dry and flaky. Waterproof ones are recommended if you are going out in the snow as they don't soak your hands when you touch the snow. Don't forget to wear a hat as they help protect your hair from drying out and they keep your head nice and warm. Too much exposure to cold, harsh weather can leave hair brittle and dry making it more susceptible to damage. As well as this, wear a scarf when possible to protect the skin on your neck and chest.;
, If the temperature inside is much hotter than outside it can irritate your skin and can even cause broken capillaries from the temperature shock when you get home or when you go out. While walking around at home wear slippers or warm socks to prevent getting cold feet which can cause chilblains, which cause your toes to swell, the skin to become sore and sometimes causes permanent disfigurement.


The same applies for when you are washing. Having a hot shower or bath can cause skin irritation if the weather is cold. As well as this it strips the natural moisture out of the skin and hair. So turn the temperature down from hot to warm.

, There are plenty of shampoos that help your hair be strong and healthy during winter. Hair goes dry, weak and brittle during winter, but if you give it the right treatment you'll avoid it becoming a big issue. Look for shampoos and conditioners which aim to protect and heal your hair, making sure it's slightly more moisturizing than what you use normally, but still good for your hair type. Also, it may be a good idea to try a moisturising hair treatment once or twice a fortnight to help repair the effects of winter, you could even make one yourself!

, Skin becomes drier in cold weather, especially if it's windy, because the moisture off the skin is evaporated more quickly by the wind, and the skin doesn't produce as much oil. Try using a slightly heavier moisturizer than you use in the summer, although still make sure that it's suitable for your skin type. Make sure you moisturize every morning, especially if you are going outside, to prevent your skin from becoming dry and flaky. Then at night, before going to bed, wash your face to remove make up and pollutants which could irritate your skin, and apply moisturizer to treat your skin while you sleep. A couple of times a week you should use a gentle exfoliater to scrub away dry skin which can become an issue in cold weather.


As well as looking after the skin on your face, don't forget to use a body butter on the skin on your body to prevent that skin from drying out. It doesn't need quite as much attention as the skin on your face as it's not often exposed, but it will still need more care than it gets in the warmer months.
Remember to give your neck and chest the same treatment as you give your face as these areas are often exposed too.

, Apply a moisturizing lip balm when you are doing the rest of your skin care, make it part of your routine. As well as this, before you go outside apply some Vaseline/petroleum jelly to your lips as this creates a protective barrier between the cold air and your lips, locking in moisture (remember that Vaseline isn't actually moisturizing, it's only protective, so use another lip balm alongside it).


You could also easily make a lip scrub to smooth away and dead or flaky skin. Do this by applying a generous amount of Vaseline to your lips, then rub either with sugar, a finger covered with a coarse flannel or with a soft toothbrush. Use circular motions and then rinse your lips and apply balm. Be gentle when exfoliating your lips, you don't want to damage the delicate skin, you shouldn't need to rub hard. If the flakes won't scrub off easily then wait until the next day and do it again when it's become a bit looser.

, This is especially important if you don't wear gloves as the skin would be constantly exposed, and yet many of us forget about it until the skin becomes dry and flaky, and in some cases splits. To keep the skin soft and comfortable, massage hand moisturizer into your hands in the morning and evening, as well as every time you wash your hands. If you're worried about having greasy hands, there are non-greasy feeling hand creams available. If your hands are extremely dry, apply a suitable moisturizer at night and then wear light cotton gloves which are available for wearing at night to keep the moisture on them.


Once you've washed your hands, make sure you dry them before going out into the cold. Not doing so will make your skin more vulnerable to dryness.

, Eating a healthy diet full of nutrients and vitamins is the best way to keep your hair and skin from looking and feeling healthy. It's also important to drink enough water to keep your skin and hair hydrated from within. Eating an unbalanced diet will leave your body lacking in the nutrition needed for keeping your skin and hair looking great. Eating well will also make you feel great too! If you have trouble with maintaining a balanced diet then take multivitamins, but remember that this is not an effective replacement for the real thing.

Trim your hairs to a manageable length.,
Make sure the wax is hot enough.,
Prevent yourself from sweating.,
Hold your skin taut.,
Pull the wax strips off quickly.",How to Get Wax Off Skin," Any type of oil will remove wax from your skin. The oil seeps under the edge of the wax to make your skin slippery, helping the wax slide right off. Waxing kits often come with a nourishing mineral oil that is meant to be used for removing extra bits of wax. You can also buy a ""wax-off"" formula that contains ingredients that remove wax from skin. However, any of the following oils will work just as well:


Baby oil
Massage oil
Olive oil
Canola oil
Melted coconut oil
Oil-based lotion;
, Dip a cotton ball into the oil until it becomes loaded with oil. You can also use a cotton pad, a folded tissue or clean cloth. You could technically just pour the oil onto your skin, but using a cotton ball to apply the oil will keep things from getting too messy.







, Make sure the oil makes contact with your skin around the edges of the wax. That way it can seep between the wax and your skin to loosen the wax. Press lightly on the cotton ball to release more oil so that the wax spot gets completely saturated.









If you're dealing with wax covering a large area, you might want to soak paper towels in oil and lay them over the wax. Press down to help the oil release the was from your skin.
If you have wax spots in more than one place, use more than one cotton ball to take care of multiple spots at once.

, Use the cotton ball to rub the wax, which should easily come loose from your skin. If the wax still won't pry up easily, apply more oil. Keep applying oil and rubbing the wax away until your skin is clear of wax.









If you're having a lot of trouble removing the wax, you probably need to use more oil. Patiently apply oil and make sure the wax spot is completely soaked.
Try using a terrycloth washcloth to scrub away remaining bits of wax.

, Use soap and water to wash away the excess oil. Pat your skin dry with a towel. Your skin should now feel soft and fresh, thanks to the oil treatment you just provided.







, If your skin is dry before you apply wax, it will try to soak up the moisture in the wax. This causes the wax to sink into your skin a little and stick to it, making it difficult to pull off. The morning before you plan to wax your skin, apply a moisturizer to make sure your skin is well hydrated.


Be sure to allow the moisturizer to completely soak into your skin before you apply the wax. You want your skin to be hydrated, but not greasy, or else the wax won't effectively pull out your hair.Avoid using an oil-based moisturizer, since the oil takes longer to soak in and may render the wax ineffective.

, Your hair is easiest to wax if it is between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch long. Hair that's longer than this will get tangled up in the wax, making it much more difficult to pull it out cleanly. This results in wax sticking to skin where it shouldn't.Try shaving a week or so before you plan to wax. This gives your hair time to grow in to the right length.
Or trim your hair in areas where it's too long to wax, such as your bikini line.

, Hot wax is thin and easy to apply, while cooler wax thickens up and becomes difficult to handle. Make sure the wax is completely melted and has a runny consistency before you apply it.









Test the hot wax on a small patch of skin before you slather it all over. The wax should feel hot, but not so hot that it burns.
During the process of waxing your body, you may need to stop and reheat the wax if it cools (unless you have a wax melter).

, Wax tends to stick to wet skin, so before you apply it you need to make sure your skin will stay dry throughout the process. You can keep your skin dry using the following methods:









Sprinkle baby powder on the area you plan to wax. This will keep the wax from sticking to your skin, while still allowing it to pull out hair.
Wax in a well-ventilated room. Turn on the air conditioner, open a window or have a fan going so you don't overheat while you're waxing.
Avoid working out or raising your blood pressure before waxing. Do it while you're calm and relaxed so you aren't sweaty when you start.

, After you apply the wax and wax strip and are ready to pull it off, use one hand to hold your skin right next to the wax strip. Keeping your skin taut, use the other hand to pull off the strip. If your skin is taut, the wax will come off more easily. If it's wrinkled, the wax will get caught in the crevices of your skin and may end up sticking.








, Pulling slowly gives the wax time to cool and adhere to your skin. Pull the wax strips off quickly, like you would a band-aid. Not only will your hair be more likely to pull out cleanly, your skin will stay clean, too.

Use bug-spray.",How to Get Tree Sap Off Your Hands2," Do not just spray a bunch of WD40 on some fabric and try and rub it out. Make sure that your solution, no matter what it is, won't ruin your clothing or surface by finding an inconspicuous ""test area."" Place a small drop of the cleaner on this surface and rub it in. Return 20 minutes later and check to make sure that the surface didn't discolor or warp as a result., Using cotton-balls dipped in rubbing alcohol (90% whenever possible), rub the sap stain with a circular motion to lift it from the fabric. This works for clothes, carpets, and curtains. Try and remove the sap before washing and drying your clothes, as this can harden the sap and make it impossible to remove., Mineral oils will gently remove the sap from your car, floors, or any other hard surfaces it might adhere to. The gentle, oil-based cleaner will need to be rubbed into the sap, but it should pull it off quickly.

, Odd as it sounds, a couple of squirts from some powerful bug spray can loosen the sap off of fabrics, flooring, and car roofs. Squirt the surface with spray and let it soak for a few minutes, then try and rub it away."

Skin that is healthy is supple and radiant, and will look great without the use of makeup.Usually, a good routine will involve cleansing your face with a gentle cleanser in the morning and at night before bed, using a toner to help wipe away any makeup or bacteria you missed, as well as application of a good moisturizer.;
, In the morning and at night before going to bed wash your face using a gentle cleanser that has been designed for your face. If you have oily skin, a foaming cleanser will help wash away excess oil. If you have a dry skin, a cream cleanser can help cleanse the skin without drying it out even more. Splash lukewarm water onto your face using your hands, then massage a dime sized amount of your chosen cleanser all over your face (avoid your eyes), massage the product on your skin for a minute or two to give it time to work.Be gentle when washing your face. The skin here is thin and sensitive, so using the soft part of your finger tips to massage the cleanser into your skin will be sufficient.
When you are finished, rinse your face thoroughly with lukewarm water. Make sure you get all of the cleanser off your skin. Finish by patting (not rubbing!) your face with a clean towel until it is dry.
If you are trying to treat acne, look for cleanser that include salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil.

, Toner is great for removing any excess oil, makeup, or bacteria you might have missed. All you have to do is squeeze a bit of the toner onto a cotton pad or ball and swipe it gently over your face. You only need to use a little bit of toner as there is no need to soak your skin in the product.Avoid toners including alcohol if you have sensitive or dry skin as alcohol will only irritate and dry out your skin even more.

, For the day, you will want to use a light moisturizer that includes an SPF to protect your skin from the sun. At night, though, you will want a heavier moisturizer that can replenish your skin. If your skin is quite dry, consider mixing a facial serum into your moisturizer to give it an extra boost.


If you have trouble with breakouts, be sure to get an oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer that won’t clog your pores.
Apply a thin, even layer of moisturizer all over your face using your finger tips.

, The health of your skin is an indicator of your health on the inside. Research has shown that consuming healthy foods and drinking plenty of water can help improve the appearance of your skin considerably.As a general rule of thumb, try to stick to eating fresh fruits and vegetables. To make sure that you are getting all the vitamins and minerals you need, try to eat the rainbow. This means that you should try to eat a variety of different colored fruits and vegetables. For example, red tomatoes, green peppers, blue blueberries, purple grapes, and orange oranges. Don’t just assume that eating a green salad will give you everything you need.

, If you have not been in the habit of taking good care of your skin, it can take awhile before you notice any improvements in your complexion. You may even break out a bit before your skin improves. Try to give your new routine about six weeks to take effect before assuming it isn’t working.If you try out a product for six weeks (for example, an acne face wash) and you haven’t noticed a difference after that, then it is safe to assume the product isn’t helping. Try out a different product that contains a different active ingredient.

, While there are some things you can do to treat certain skin conditions, there are some things that cannot be easily remedied. Rather than constantly thinking negative thoughts about your skin, try embracing your flaws if that’s how you see your freckles, acne, or uneven skin.


For example, you should remember that freckles are seen as very beautiful by many people, and some people have become famous models due to their uneven skin tone.
Remember that acne is something that nearly everyone experiences at some point or another, so it can be viewed as a part of life rather than as something that is bad about you.

, Try to become comfortable in your skin. It can be hard to look past your own imperfections, but everyone has them, and to be honest, most people don't notice those minor details about other people. Try to find confidence in how you look, and play up the features that you do love about your face.


For example, if you really like your eyes or your lips, you can use makeup to draw attention to those features.
If you don’t want to wear makeup, you can draw attention to your hair by styling it nicely, or you can wear interesting glasses, hats, or jewelry to take the attention off your skin.

, If your skin is really causing you stress, try visiting a dermatologist. There are treatments that they can use to lighten blemishes and freckles, and other treatments they can recommend for treating acne. However, realize that some treatments (for example, for skin lightening) can be very expensive.


If you really feel like you cannot live with your freckles, you may be able to have them removed by your dermatologist via laser treatment.
Many dermatologists can also prescribe medications that are designed to target specific causes of acne.Dermatologists can also recommend treatment options for uneven skin tone; however, the specific treatment will depend on the reason behind the cause of the uneven skin tone., If you want to cover up your freckles, acne, or uneven skin tone you will need to use a foundation. The best way to make sure that your foundation goes on evenly is to first apply a makeup primer, which provides a layer that the foundation can hold on to. It can also help add moisture where needed, and absorb excess oil on your skin.Primer will also help your makeup stay in place better and longer.
Apply primer all over your face using your fingertips, this will also help draw blood to your face, giving you a glowing appearance.

, If you have any pimples or other blemishes on your face that you want to cover up, using a concealer will apply coverage to that specific area without requiring you to use a heavy foundation. All you have to do is dab a tiny bit of concealer on the area you wish to cover, and then use a makeup sponge or brush to gently dab the concealer evenly over the area.If you don’t want to wear a lot of makeup, choose a lightweight concealer that matches your skin tone to hide any areas that bother you.
If you are covering pimples or other redness on your skin, a green concealer works well to counteract the redness.

, Try to stick to a lightweight or medium-coverage foundation. While full-coverage foundation can work wonders, it is difficult to get a fresh, natural look with this type of product. Therefore, try to start out with lighter coverage BB creams or tinted moisturizers before jumping to a full-coverage foundation.The idea is to give your skin a healthy, fresh look. Jumping right to a full-coverage foundation may cover up blemishes, but it won’t look natural at all.
You can apply your foundation with your fingers, with a sponge or with a brush. Start with a small amount of product and apply it to the center of your face, blending it outwards as you go.

, A lot of people pile on the makeup thinking this will make them look better, but in reality, over-application of makeup leaves most people looking greasy and unnatural. If you take good care of your skin, you will notice improvements. Then you can just apply a bit of makeup to accentuate your features rather than to try and cover everything up.


Wearing a lot of makeup may even lead to more skin issues than what you started with.
Keep any makeup application brushes or sponges clean to avoid rubbing bacteria all over your face.

Take a shower.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Keep your skin moisturized.",How to Maintain a Tan During Winter1," Showering before your tanning session can help prepare your skin by moisturizing it. Moisturized skin will allow the tanning process to create a darker and longer lasting tan. Always make sure that you have showered and moisturized before going tanning to have your tan last longer., Once you've moisturized your skin, it's time to exfoliate. You want the tanning process to go as deep into your skin as possible. Removing the top layer of skin using exfoliation can help the UV rays reach deeper, making your tan last longer Always exfoliate before tanning to make your tan last as long as possible.You don't want to tan skin cells that are about to fall away. Exfoliation will remove old skin cells and let the fresh skin cells get the tan.

, Once you've got a good tan, it's important that you keep your skin moisturized. Dry skin cells will fall away much faster than moisturized ones, causing your tan to fade quickly. Keeping your skin moisturized will help your tan last through the winter months.


Winter is especially dry and will tend to dry your skin out quickly.Cold winds and air will dry your skin out more quickly than warmer temperatures.
Apply moisturizing lotions often to help protect your skin. Try using heavier lotions in the winter.

Start each day with dry brushing.,
Take a cool shower.,
Exfoliate in the shower.,
Don't use too much soap.,
Moisturize your skin.,
Cater to your skin type.","How to Get Your Skin Silky, Smooth, Soft, Shining and Healthy1"," Dry brushing is an ancient exfoliation technique designed to slough off dead skin and stimulate your body's circulation. Dry brushing every day immediately makes your skin look brighter, and if you keep up the routine your skin will begin to glow.


Choose a dry brush made from natural fibers, rather than plastic bristles. Natural bristles aren't as rough on your skin.
Brush your body using short, firm strokes from your outer extremities toward your heart. Brush your legs, torso and arms. Use a softer, smaller brush for your face.
Always start with dry skin and a dry brush. Brushing your skin while wet won't achieve the same effect.;
, Rinse off your skin with cool, not hot, water. Hot water is hard on your skin and causes it to dry out and toughen. Use warm water at the beginning of your shower to gently wash away dirt. At the end, switch to cool water to tighten and tone your skin.

Generally, you should only shower once a day for about ten minutes. Longer showers can dry out your skin.
When you wash your face, splash it with cool water instead of hot water.
Save hot baths for special occasions. They're good for the soul, but not necessarily for the skin.

, You can use a loofah, wash cloth, or exfoliating mitts to scrub your skin while showering. You also use a body scrub. Gently rub the cloth over your skin. You may want to use a separate wash cloth for your body and your face.

Make sure to clean these tools regularly to prevent the build-up of bacteria. Bacteria can cause blemishes and make your skin texture appear rough.

, Commercial body washes and scrubs, as well as many bar soaps, contain detergents that dry out your skin and leave a residue that causes it to look dull. Use a natural, oil-based soap, or forego soap and use plain water.


Try only washing areas of your body that regularly become dirty or sweaty, such as feet, genitals, and armpits. For dry areas of your skin, such as elbows, shins, and forearms, you just need water.

, Dry your skin by patting yourself dry thoroughly. Do not leave your skin damp. Then apply lotion or another healing moisturizer to your skin to seal in the moisture and protect your skin from dry air throughout the day. Try these moisturizers for shining, healthy skin:


Coconut oil. This sweet-smelling substance melts into your skin and gives it a beautiful glow.
Shea butter. This moisturizer is especially good for use on your fragile facial skin. You can also apply it to your lips.
Lanolin. Sheep produce lanolin to keep their wool soft and dry, and it acts as an excellent defense against cold winter air.
Olive oil. For those occasions when your skin needs a deep-conditioning treatment, smooth olive oil over your body and let it seep in for 10 minutes. Rinse it off with lukewarm water and pat dry.
Lactic acid lotion is available from drugstores. It leaves dry, scaly skin feeling pliable and soft.
Aloe vera gel is a natural option that is perfect for sensitive or sun-damaged skin.

, Some people have dry, flaky skin, others have oily skin, and many have some combination of the two. Know what parts of your body need special care, and make sure your daily routine takes them into account.


Treat acne, whether on your face or body, with extra care. Avoid dry brushing over acne, and don't use harsh soaps or chemicals that might exacerbate it.
Eczema, rosacea and other issues associated with dry skin must be handled with care. Use products that don't irritate your condition further, and talk to your doctor about getting a prescription to treat your skin if necessary.

Use a loofah or washcloth.,
Try dry brushing.,
Use a body scrub.,
Use a product with alpha-hydroxy acid.,
Don't overdo it.",How to Get Soft Skin1," This basic shower tool makes a big difference when it comes to having softer skin. Dry, dead skin builds up on the body, and plain water usually isn't enough to wash it away. A quick rubdown with a loofah or washcloth every time you take a shower will help slough away the dead skin and allow fresh, healthy, soft skin to shine through.


Try using a squirt of moisturizing body wash or body oil with your loofah or washcloth.
If your skin tends to be dry, avoid using plain bar soap to cleanse and during exfoliation. It can dry out your skin, resulting in a surface that ends up rougher instead of softer.;
, Dry brushing is an exfoliating technique that brushes away skin flakes and improves circulation, promoting the growth of healthy skin. This technique is particularly effective if your skin is very dry and tends to flake or get scaly during the drier parts of the year. Dry brushing should be done while both the brush and your skin are totally dry. The technique is gentle enough to do every day. Get a body brush with natural bristles and use it the following way:


Spend three or four minutes brushing the skin on your legs using upward strokes, from your ankles up toward your torso. Focus on areas that are particularly dry.
Spend another three or four minutes on your arms, brushing your skin from your wrists up toward your shoulders.
Gently brush your belly, backside, and other areas that are dry.
Avoid brushing your face with a body brush; use a facial brush with special bristles designed to be gentle on the face.

, Body scrub contains a mixture of oils and an exfoliating substance like salt, sugar, or ground oatmeal. As you gently rub it into your skin, it sloughs away the dead skin while also conditioning it with the oil. When you rinse it away, your skin will be soft and smooth. Use a body scrub to exfoliate once or twice a week. You can make your own body scrub using one of the following recipes:


1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup coarse sugar, for dry skin
1/2 cup aloe and 1/2 cup sea salt, for oily skin

, Alpha hydroxy acids, including citric acid, lactic acid, and glycolic acid, act as gentle exfoliants that don't abrade your skin. These acids are naturally found in fruit, milk, and sugar cane. When you apply them to your skin, they remove dead skin cells.Products containing 5 to 10 percent alpha hydroxy acids are available over-the-counter in the form of lotions and creams.
Be sure not to use more than the recommended dosage per day. Overusing acids, or any type of exfoliation technique, can be harmful to your skin.
Facial peels and treatments with a concentration of more than 10 percent alpha hydroxy acids should only be used after consulting with your dermatologist., Exfoliation is a necessary part of a good skin-care routine, but it's important not to take it too far. Exfoliating too harshly or too often can lead to damaged or irritated skin, completely defeating the purpose when your goal is softer skin. Keep the following pointers in mind:


Only use body scrubs once or twice a week. The scrubs remove protective oils from your skin, and using them too often can dry your skin out.
Do not scrub your skin with too much force. No matter what technique you're using, apply gentle pressure.
Be careful when you exfoliate your face. The skin there is more delicate than the skin on the rest of your body. Remember to use a special facial brush if you want to dry brush your face.

Err on the side of cooler water when bathing.",How to Get Stubble," Before you throw out your shaving cream and swear yourself to a new, manlier life, it's best to have an idea of what you want to eventually look like. There's no ""right"" way to grow stubble, so feel free to be creative with your choice. However, there are a few popular ""looks"" that tend to look good on a wide variety of faces that you may want to consider. We've given these our own names below (and suggested a few celebrities that wear these sorts of stubbles as examples):



The All-over: This natural look uses a short-to-medium length stubble that's about the same length all over the face, making it easy to grow and maintain. Examples: Gerard Butler, Bradley Cooper

The Peach Fuzz: This style uses very short stubble to give a delicate, almost clean-cut look. Examples: Robert Pattinson, Ryan Gosling.

The Faux-tee: This stubble looks like a very short version of a goatee or a van dyke beard — the stubble is mainly around the nose and mouth, while the cheeks are clean-shaven. Examples: Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom.

The Shaggy: This style uses a somewhat longer stubble and a relaxed approach to grooming to give a rugged look. Examples: George Clooney, Idris Elba

The Wilderness: This wild, unkempt look is almost more of a short beard than it is a stubble style — wearing this will take some confidence, but when pulled off, the impression it gives is a strikingly masculine one. Examples: Russel Brand, Bear Grylls after a week in the woods.;
, Let's face it: not everyone grows facial hair in the same way. Some people have to shave every single day to stay clean-shaven, while others can put down the razor for weeks at a time and grow only a few wisps of hair. Keep in mind your natural ability to grow hair as you pick your stubble style — ideally, you want to pick a look that makes the most of your natural facial hair patterns, not one that's held back by them. Here are just a few things to consider:


If your facial hair comes in patchy, don't pick a style that requires thick hair growth on parts of your face where you can't grow any. For example, if you grow hair around your mouth, nose, and chin, but you have a hard time growing hair on your cheeks, don't pick a style like the ""All-over"" above — you're probably better off with a ""Faux-tee"" or a ""Peach Fuzz.""
If you have facial hair that's close to the color of your skin, be prepared to grow a little extra if you'd like your stubble to ""stand out.""

, When you're picking out a stubble style, don't forget about the hair on your head! In general, the more hair you have overall (head + face), the ""shaggier"" the impression you'll give. Use this to your advantage as you pick your stubble style and ensure that the look you choose is the one you want.


For instance, if you have a long hairdo and long stubble, you can give yourself a very ""Old Testament"" vibe. This can be a good look for some, but not for all!
On the other hand, if your hairline is receding, you may be able to get away with growing thicker stubble than you normally would — simply put, this can ""balance out"" the amount of hair on your face.

, Before you find yourself with stubble that you have no way of maintaining, get yourself the tools you need to stay looking great. Below is a small selection of supplies frequently recommended for stubble maintenance — you may not need all of them:


Adjustable beard trimmer
Stubble trimmer/mini foil shaver
Safety razors
Exfoliating, moisturizing skin lotion
Shaving gel

, Growing a good layer of stubble is just as much about what you don't do than about what you do. If you're clean shaven, start by simply not shaving! Depending on the speed at which your hair grows, you should start seeing stubble form within about one to three days.


If you currently have a beard and you want to switch to stubble, give yourself a clean shave, then wait for your hair to grow. Alternatively, you can use a very short setting on your beard trimmer to go directly from a beard to an All-over stubble style.

, This step will be different for everyone — some people may only need to wait a day to get to the amount of stubble they want, while others may need to take a week or more. This also depends on the style of stubble you've chosen. For example, all other things being equal, the ""Wilderness"" stubble style described above will take longer to grow than the ""Peach Fuzz"" style. Be patient — the average beard grows about 1/2 inch per month.Keep in mind that, for many people, certain patches of hair on the face grow faster than others. If this is the case for you, you'll want to wait until the fasting-growing patch of hair on your face is the right length. In other words, don't wait for your slow-growing patches to ""catch up"" to the fast-growing ones before you go to the next step.

, Once you've got your stubble to just the right length, it's time to shape it. Again, there's no ""right"" way to do this, but if you don't have any special opinion on the matter, use the short steps below to give yourself a ""clean"" look and a well-defined chin. If you're going for a ""shaggier"" look, you don't have to trim your neck hair, but don't let the hair on your neck get longer or more prominent than the hair on your face.


Use a stubble trimmer, a mini foil shaver, or a safety razor to shave a line under your chin. Unless you're going for a ""chinstrap"" look, this should be a few inches behind your natural chin line — to about where the bottom of the chin meets your neck.
Shave the hair on the neck below your new stubble line. Take care around the Adam's apple to avoid cuts.
Give your neck a final review to ensure it's looking good. Your neck itself should be clean-shaven and tidy, while your stubble should wrap around the bottom of your chin all the way to your sideburns (or, if you don't have any, where they would be) with a straight, clean line.

, Now, if you'd like to, it's time to shape the top of your beard. Again, for shaggier stubble styles, this isn't necessary, but it won't hurt either. There are generally two ways to do this:Use a stubble trimmer or a safety razor to shave a straight line from the bottoms of your sideburns to the outer edges of your mustache.
Shave a curved line in a downward ""oval"" pattern so that your beard connects with the edges of your mustache.

, When you're satisfied with your stubble, remove stray hairs from your face and leave yourself feeling great with a cold water rinse. This will also close your pores and soothe your skin, which is nice if you have delicate skin that is irritated by shaving.You may also want to use a gentle non-scented lotion at this point to moisturize your skin and keep it feeling soft. Refrain if you cut yourself shaving — lotion in a cut can seriously sting.

, The tricky thing about wearing stubble is that you can't simply let it be — you have to trim it about as frequently as you'd shave your face to stay clean-shaven. Otherwise, you'll eventually grow a beard! Use an adjustable beard trimmer or stubble trimmer set to the same length as your stubble to keep it looking just right.


If different patches of your facial hair grow at different rates, this is extra important. If you followed the instructions above, you started your stubble when the fastest-growing patch of your facial hair was the correct length. This means that you need to keep your fast-growing patch to a reasonable length while the rest of your hair ""catches up."" If you don't do this, by the time all of you hair is the correct length, part of your beard may be beard-length, giving you an uneven appearance.

, In addition to controlling the length of your stubble, you'll want to keep the lines that mark the top and bottom of the stubble clean unless you're deliberately going for a ""rough"" look. This is fairly easy: just use a safety razor or a trimmer set to its closest setting to re-shave the lines on your cheeks and beneath your chin, taking care not to shave any of your stubble off by accident.


As mentioned above, if you're going for a more unkempt look, you can let the lines that define your stubble get a little blurry. However, you'll still probably want to keep hair off of your neck and cheekbones.

, You don't necessarily need to use any product on your stubble to keep it looking good (especially if it's on the shorter side.) However, a little exfoliating action on the face is always a good option to consider, as this removes dead skin cells, leaving the skin under your stubble brighter and clearer. In addition, exfoliation lifts the hairs of your beard, making them slightly easier to shave.


To exfoliate, use a mild, micro-bead free rub — micro-beads, the tiny plastic beads in many exfoliating products, are known to pollute local water supplies after they're washed down the drain.You can also try exfoliating your facial skin with a mild brush while you bathe. Don't scrub so hard or so long that your skin becomes sore. Not only will this hurt — it will also leave your skin irritated, flaky, and vulnerable to infection.

, Piping hot showers can feel great on cold mornings, but if you can stand it, try to turn the temperature down to mildly warm. Hot water can strip your skin of its vital oils, leaving your skin delicate and dried-out.If you have stubble (particularly thick stubble), this can be especially bad, as it can give you a condition a little like ""facial dandruff"" where tiny flakes of skin fall off of your face when you rub your stubble.


A moisturizing lotion can help with dry skin underneath your stubble. Try applying it once in the morning and once before you go to bed for lasting softness and smoothness.

Use tanning lotions.,
Use a tanning bed.,
Try bronzing powder or serums.",How to Maintain a Tan During Winter2," Tanning lotions work to give your skin a darker look, lasting longer than other topically applied tanning methods. These lotions are easy to apply and can be a great way to keep your tan lasting during the winter months.If you notice your tan fading, try reapplying the lotion.
Tans from tanning lotions will fade after a few days.
Applying too much tanning lotion can cause your skin to turn very dark or orange.
Some tanning lotions may also moisturize your skin.

, Many people enjoy visiting their local tanning salons to use a tanning bed. Tanning beds use UV lights to tan the entire surface of your skin. These beds can be a good idea if you need to improve your tan during the winter months. Check your local area for any salons or businesses that offer tanning beds.


UV rays can be harmful to your skin and may cause skin cancer. Avoid using tanning beds often to avoid this risk., Bronzing powder or tanning serum is applied on the surface of your skin and will temporarily make your skin look darker. These bronzing powders can be a great way to quickly get a tanned look during the winter months.You will likely want to use these bronzing powders on or around your face or neck.
Bronzing serums may also help to keep your face moisturized.
Apply bronzing serums before putting on makeup.

Avoid exfoliating.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat healthy foods.",How to Maintain a Tan During Winter3," Exfoliating can bring certain benefits with it. However, when you are trying to maintain a tan, exfoliating can be a bad idea. When you exfoliate, skin cells are removed and they can take your tanned look with them. Always avoid exfoliating when trying to preserve your tan through the winter months.

, It's important that you keep yourself well hydrated when trying to make your tan last through winter. Without proper hydration, your skin will tend to dry up and won't be as healthy as it could be. This may cause you skin cells to fall away faster than normal, resulting in your tan fading quickly. Always make sure you are drinking plenty of water during the dry winter months to make your tan last longer.Drink water whenever you feel thirsty.
Certain foods can help with hydration as well. Try eating cucumbers, melons and celery for a healthy hydration boost.

, Part of having healthy skin is having a healthy diet. Your skin needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrition in order to function properly and prevent skin cells from falling away faster than they would otherwise. To make your tan last into the winter months, make sure your diet is healthy and that you eat plenty of foods that are good for your skin.Foods that are rich in beta-carotene have been recommend for maintaining a tan. Spinach, carrots, and kale can be tasty options.
Supplements or foods that contain antioxidants can help your skin stay healthy.

Incorporate the following types of exercises into your routine three or more times per week:


Cardio exercises like power walking, running, biking, or swimming. These exercises get your blood pumping and give your skin a healthy hue.
Weight training exercises with dumbbells. Strengthening your muscles improves your skin tone, making it look smoother.
Yoga and flexibility exercises. These types of exercises tone your muscles and make your skin look tighter.

Avocados and nuts. These contain healthy fats that your skin needs to retain its elasticity.
Nutrient-rich plants. Focus on produce that contains vitamin A, E, and C, like sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, spinach, broccoli, mangoes and blueberries.

, Water plumps up your skin cells and makes your skin look fresh and bright. When you're dehydrated, your skin starts to dry out. Drink at least 8 glasses of water every day to keep your skin healthy. If you don't enjoy drinking glass after glass of water, these choices will also keep you hydrated:


Watery fruits and vegetables, like cucumbers, lettuce, apples, and berries.
Herbal tea and other tea that isn't caffeinated.
Try a glass of soda water with a squeeze of lemon for a refreshing alternative.
If plain water isn't your thing, you can make flavored water by letting fruit or herbs soak in the water before drinking.

, No matter how religiously you stick to your daily skin care routine, using certain substances will set you back on your quest for beautiful skin. Limit or completely cut out these skin-harming substances:


Tobacco. Tobacco stains skin and causes premature wrinkles. When it comes to damaging skin, tobacco is one of the worst culprits.
Alcohol. Too much alcohol can stretch skin out, especially around and under the eyes, because it causes the body to retain water. It also reduces Vitamin A in the skin and can cause broken blood vessels.Limit alcohol to one or two drinks a few times a week.
Caffeine. Drinking a lot of caffeine dehydrates your body, which has an adverse effect on your skin. Limit your coffee to one cup a day, and follow it with a big glass of water.

Use sunscreen every day.,
Don't wear makeup to bed.,
Protect your skin from harsh elements.","How to Get Your Skin Silky, Smooth, Soft, Shining and Healthy3"," Sun exposure can temporarily brighten skin by giving you a tan, but in the long term it is extremely damaging. Letting your skin burn or get tan all summer long can lead to wrinkles, spots, and the possibility of skin cancer.


Apply sunscreen to your face before you leave the house, even during the winter.
Use sunscreen on your neck, shoulders, chest, arms, and everywhere else that tends to get more exposure. When you're wearing shorts or going to the beach, make sure you cover your legs, too.

, Leaving makeup on your face overnight is hard on your skin, because you're allowing chemicals to seep in all night. By morning your skin has completely absorbed the makeup, and it's probably the worse for wear. Use makeup remover and rinse off the traces with cool or lukewarm water every night before you go to bed.


Don't scrub makeup off your face, since this can cause it to get irritated and damage the skin. Use a good makeup remover and dab it with a towel instead.
Try this trick for removing eye makeup: dab a cotton swab soaked in makeup remover on your eyelashes and around your eyes. The makeup will wipe right off.


, Skin toughens in response to exposure to chemicals, extreme temperatures, and abrasive materials. Keep your skin soft and sensitive by taking these precautions:


Wear gloves during the winter to keep your hands from getting chapped. Protect the rest of your body with appropriately warm clothing.
Wear gloves when you're cleaning with strong chemicals.
Protect yourself from callouses by using knee pads, thick work clothes, and the proper safety equipment when you're working under harsh conditions.

Use hydrating lotion.,
Use body oil.,
Try a skin mask.,
Hydrate from the inside-out.,
Use a humidifier.",How to Get Soft Skin2," Lotion helps to keep your skin soft by combining hydrating ingredients (like water or aloe) with humectants that trap the moisture against your skin (like shea butter, lanolin or cocoa butter). Dermatologists recommend using lotion right when you get out of the shower to keep your skin as hydrated as possible.Many commercially-produced lotions have ingredients that can actually dry out your skin, like alcohols and fragrance chemicals. Even when a bottle of lotion proclaims to be formulated for very dry skin, it might do more harm than good.
Look for all-natural lotions with high-quality, nourishing ingredients like shea butter, lanolin, cocoa butter, aloe, and oils.
For very dry skin, talk to your dermatologist about getting a prescription for medicated lotion containing a corticosteroid or an immune modulator., Oil has taken off as a great alternative to lotion for those with drier skin. Simply smooth on some baby oil or an adult-formulated oil after you take a bath or shower. The oil will keep the moisture from leaving your body too quickly by acting as a protective barrier between your skin and the air.Baby oil, almond oil, argan oil, coconut oil and jojoba oil are all great choices.
If you don't like the feeling of being covered in oil, try rubbing some oil into your skin where it tends to be extra dry, like on your elbows and knees.

, If your skin has been feeling rough and dry, doing a rejuvenating, hydrating skin mask can help bring it back to life. Once a week or so, set aside about half an hour to treat yourself to a full-body mask. You can make your own skin mask using ingredients you probably already have on hand. Take a warm shower, spread the mask over your wet skin, and let it sit for 20 minutes before rinsing.


To make your own mask, try mixing 1/2 cup cream, 2 tablespoons honey, and 1 banana. Blend until smooth.
Or try 1/2 cup aloe, 2 tablespoons honey, and 1 avocado. Blend until smooth.
These masks are safe to use anywhere on your body, including your face.

, If your skin is dry and rough no matter what you put on it, you might need to focus on hydrating your body the good old-fashioned way: with water. Drinking plenty of water is an important way to keep your skin healthy, supple and soft. As a general rule, drink water whenever you're thirsty. Drink more water when you're physically active to keep yourself well hydrated.Try replacing coffee, alcohol and soda with water whenever possible.
Bring a water bottle with you so you'll be able to stay hydrated throughout the day.

, If you're surrounded by dry air, it can be difficult to keep your skin feeling soft and fresh. Depending on where you live, the air may be drier during the summer or the winter. Either way, it tends to leave your skin flaky and irritated. The solution is to add moisture to the air using a humidifier. It's a simple machine that pumps a fine mist of water into the air to increase the air humidity in your home.


The ideal humidity level for a home is between 30 and 50 percent.You can measure your home's humidity using a hygrometer, an instrument similar to a thermometer available in hardware stores.
Humidifiers have the added benefit of helping prevent sinus and breathing problems and healing cracked lips.

Change your bathing routine.,
Dry your skin gently.,
Use sunscreen frequently.,
Eat well.,
See a doctor to treat very dry skin.",How to Get Soft Skin3," If you tend to take long, hot baths, you may be unintentionally hurting your skin. When you soak in water for a long period of time, your skin loses moisture and essential protective oils, causing it to become dry and rough. The heat from the water is also hard on skin and can lead to irritation. Whenever possible, take shorter, cooler showers to keep your skin fresh and soft.


When you do take a bath, add ingredients to the water that will help moisturize your skin. Try adding a few spoonfuls of oil. Go easy on the soap, since that can strip your skin of oils.
When you do use hot water, apply a rich lotion or oil immediately after you dry off.

, Do you towel off roughly, scrubbing your skin dry? That can cause irritation and roughness. For the softest skin, pat yourself dry with a soft towel. That way you won't rub away your skin's natural oils, and you won't soak up too much moisture before you have a chance to apply lotion.


This is especially important when you're drying your face. Scrubbing your facial skin can lead to irritation and skin damage. Use a very soft towel and pat dry.
Air drying is even better for your skin, if you have the time to do it.

, Sun exposure does more than leave dark spots on your skin: it causes dryness, roughness and wrinkling. Keep your skin moist and soft by applying plenty of sunscreen whenever you plan on spending time outside. Use SPF 30 or higher for the best protective benefits.

, What you put inside your body is reflected in the texture of your skin. If you're serious about getting soft skin, it might be time to alter your diet. Try adding the following nourishing foods to your meals. After a few weeks or months, you should see a difference in your skin.


Walnuts, flaxseed, and fish like salmon and sardines contain omega-3 fats that are essential for skin health.For vitamin A, eat carrots and low-fat dairy products.
Eat Blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and plums for their antioxidant value. These fruits help repair skin damage after sun exposure.Green tea has anti-inflammatory properties, helping skin look smooth and healthy., If your skin stays dry no matter how well you take care of it, you may have a condition that requires medical treatment to correct. Eczema, psoriasis, and chronic dry skin often require intervention beyond using regular lotion and skin care techniques. See a doctor if you believe you may have one of the following conditions:


Eczema: this condition causes patches of dry, red, itchy skin. It is usually treated with over-the-counter or prescription ointments or creams containing corticosteroids. Severe eczema may be treated with barrier repair moisturizers or topical immunomodulators.Psoriasis: this condition causes the skin to become very dry with large flakes and scaly patches. It can be treated with creams or ointments containing salicylic acid, steroids, or calcipotriene. Coal-tar ointments and shampoos are commonly prescribed, and some find that prescription retinoids help. Severe psoriasis is also treated with light therapy or oral drugs such as methotrexate."

Understand why you have dark spots around your mouth.,
Consider the climate.,
Know that the skin around your mouth is thin.,
See a dermatologist.",How to Get Rid of the Dark Area Around the Mouth1," These spots often result from high amounts of skin-darkening melanin in certain areas of your skin. This melanin can be set off by triggers from inside and outside your body. This melanin condition is called hyperpigmentation. The triggers might include sun exposure, melasma, and skin inflammation.


Sun spots: These dark brown clusters can take months, or even years, to show up in sun-exposed areas. Once they show up, they usually don't fade unless you treat them. This pigment shift stays near the surface of the skin, so you can treat it with creams and scrubs. Use sunscreen often to prevent sun spots or to keep them from getting worse.
Melasma (Chloasma): These dusky, symmetrical spots stem from hormone changes during birth-control use or pregnancy. When these hormones combine with sun exposure, dark spots can appear on the cheeks, forehead, and upper lip. This form of hyperpigmentation tends to return easily, even if you treat it.
Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation: If you have a darker skin tone, you may get dark spots that linger after a burn, pimple, or other skin abrasion. In this case, the melanin is deep within your skin, and the dark spots may take three to six months to fade.;
, The skin around your mouth is drier during cold season. Some people tend to wet that area with their saliva, which can darken the skin. If you haven't been out in the sun much, you may be over-wetting the area around your mouth., This can lead to discoloration, dry skin, and mouth wrinkles. These problems do not go deep into the skin, so you will probably not need an invasive treatment. You may be able to easily get rid of your discoloration by treating or exfoliating the skin.

, If you aren't sure what's causing the dark area around your mouth, a dermatologist may be able to diagnose the problem and suggest a treatment. Changes in the skin can be early warning signs of skin cancer and other serious disorders, so it might be wise to have a doctor check out your symptoms just in case.

Use lemon juice.,
Apply sour cream or buttermilk.,
Think about laser surgery.",How to Get Rid of Spots on Your Skin1," It's possible to do a lot more with lemon juice than make drinks. You can use it to sanitize a counter top, brighten white loads of laundry, and, believe it or not, you can even use it to treat freckles.

This treatment doesn't remove freckles but it does lighten your skin, and with it, your freckles. It's similar to the way people use it to highlight streaks of hair during the summer.



 


Take some fresh-squeezed lemon juice and apply it onto a cotton ball. After weeks of diligence, your freckles should start to fade.





;
, The lactic acids present in sour milk can help a lot to get rid of unwanted freckles. Take some sour cream, directly apply it on the affected skin area, and allow it to dry for 10 minutes. Instead of rinsing it off completely with water, you must gently wipe it off with a soft tissue or a towel. Lastly, apply some moisturizer.


Another option is to make a thick paste of powdered oatmeal and buttermilk. Apply this paste on the affected area, leave for about half an hour, and wash it off with cold water.







, If your freckles are seriously getting to you, home remedies may not do the trick. Laser surgery is an option, but it is permanent, expensive, and may not leave you with perfect results.


A pulsed-dye laser is the most common method used during this type of laser surgery. In this case, the laser actually emits pulses of a certain wavelength to the site of the freckles, targeting the blood vessels that lie just beneath the surface of the skin. Those blood vessels are then destroyed by the heat emitted from the laser, but the surrounding skin is basically untouched. The laser used for freckle removal is yellow in color, which is known for being safe for use on patients without producing any long-term skin-damaging effects.

Exfoliate daily with a mild facial scrub.,
Use an over-the-counter skin-brightening cream.,
Consider using a prescription cream.,
Try a laser treatment.,
Try a glycolic or salicylic acid peel.",How to Get Rid of the Dark Area Around the Mouth2," The exfoliant will lift dead skin cells, and over time it may fade the dark areas around your mouth. Dab a damp washcloth with a pea-sized amount of the facial scrub. Gently rub the washcloth on your face to remove pigmented skin cells and clean the skin.


You can find facial scrubs in drugstores, grocery stores, and bath-and-body stores. Read reviews of a product before you buy it. Some scrubs may be sold to treat acne and other skin conditions; these scrubs often use acids and chemicals to deep-clean your skin.

, You can find moisturizing, skin-brightening pigment products in drugstores and beauty-product stores. Find a cream that contains Vitamin C, kojic acid (extracted from certain fungi species), arbutin (taken from the bearberry plant), azelaic acid (found in wheat, barley, and rye), licorice extract, niacinamide, or grapeseed extract: these ingredients help to block the enzyme tyrosinase, which your skin cells need to produce melanin. Spread a thin layer of the cream around your mouth. Follow the instructions, and don’t use these skin-lightening products for more than three weeks.Kojic acid is a popular treatment, but it can irritate sensitive skin. Be careful.

, If your spots won't go away, your dermatologist may prescribe a drug-based cream like hydroquinone. Hydroquinone limits your pigment-making cells and slows your skin's production of tyrosinase. Dark spots tend to vanish quickly with lower pigment production.


Animal studies have linked hydroquinone with cancer, but those animals were fed and injected with the drug. Most human treatments stop at topical application, and no research suggests toxicity in humans. Many dermatologists deny the cancer link.Most patients show the first signs of skin lightening within a few days, and most of the effects act within six weeks. After the treatment, you can switch to an over-the-counter cream to keep up the brighter pigment.

, Lasers like Fraxel tend to be the most lasting and effective way to treat discolorations that are close to the surface of the skin. However, laser pigment work is not always permanent. The effect will depend upon your genetics, your UV exposure, and your skincare habits. Lasers also tend to be more expensive than other treatments.

, Your dermatologist may suggest these peels to reach and treat damaged cells deep within your skin. Bear in mind that these treatments are not permanent. Depending on your genetic predisposition to dark spots—and how much UV exposure you get—your spots may return as soon as a few weeks or as late as a few years. Stay out of the sun and treat your dark spots early to make sure that your treatment lasts longer.

Invest in a good makeup.",How to Get Rid of Spots on Your Skin2," They may be able to, but it'll take a long time and the results certainly won't be magical. That being said, there's no harm in trying.


Aloe vera gel can bleach the skin to even out skin tone and it has amazing healing abilities. You can get Aloe Vera gel products from the market if you think it’s a hassle to extract it yourself, but taking the effort to extract fresh gel from Aloe Vera leaves is totally worth it. You may want to add castor oil with fresh aloe vera gel to make it more effective. Apply the gel on skin, leave it to dry and wash it off.
UV rays cause our body to produce free radicals. They cause a chain reaction which keeps on damaging our skin and it often gets out of control. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that neutralizes these free radicals to protect and repair our skin. Break Vitamin E capsules to get access to the powder inside it. Dab it on sunspots with the help of a cotton dab

, Many of the world's largest make-up manufacturers offer products just for this problem. You should be able to go to your nearest shopping center (or drugstore) and pick one up for a not-too-hefty fee.


Garnier has as skin renewing, dark spot corrector for about $15. It uses clinical doses of pure Vitamin C to brighten and even skin tone. Follow the directions for best results.

Salicylic acid is an option that will make your skin shed faster.,
Talk to a dermatologist.",How to Get Rid of Spots on Your Skin3," As you wander about the world, grease, grime, and dirt build up on your face, leading to breakouts. Cigarette smoke, air pollution, and just general living can wreak havoc on your complexion. Spending 5 minutes washing your face twice a day is an easy way to beat these everyday culprits.


Washing it more won't help, however; that'll just dry out your face (which could lead to breakouts, too). Wash your face in the morning and before bed with a clean washcloth, warm water, and a mild cleanser.

, It is one of the most common treatments. You can get stronger versions through your doctor, but there are some creams and cleansers available over the counter.


Benzoyl peroxide comes in a variety of forms, but most are creams or gels. You apply it to breakouts only - it kills the bacteria that causes inflammation in blocked pores. Be patient, though; results can take up to three weeks. Don't increase your usage! Too much is a bad thing, too.

, By getting rid of dead skin cells, your pores don't have the ability to build up bacteria and create blockages. It doesn't affect sebum production, but it prevents accumulation on your face.


If you have sensitive skin, you may want to avoid using this product. And definitely don't put it on any open wounds or sores. That's a recipe for aggravation.

, A professional may be able to pinpoint just what kind of spots you are dealing with. There are many different kinds of skin conditions and yours may may not be what you think.

, If you have more than 100 moles, you are a higher risk for skin cancer. You should make an appointment with a dermatologist. , Before you even consider removing a mole, you should know the type of mole and its symptoms. Some moles can be safe to remove, while others are not.


Atypical mole — Atypical moles, or dysplastic moles, can look suspicious in color and size.They can sometime be larger than an eraser head, have an odd shape, or have many colors. If you have this type of mole, consult your doctor to be sure it is not cancerous.
Congenital mole — This is the type of mole you are born with. Roughly, 1 in 100 people are born with moles. They can range in size from tiny (size of a pin head) to giant (larger than a pencil eraser). Doctors suspect that people born with giant moles are at a higher risk for skin cancer.Spitz nevus — This mole looks pink, raised, and dome shaped. It often looks like melanoma. It may ooze. It may itch or bleed. These are uncommon and mostly benign. Acquired Mole — This term means moles that are acquired after birth. These are often called common moles.

, A common way to do so is to remember the “ABCD” rule.If you suspect that you have melanoma, seek medical attention immediately.


Asymmetry — The mole looks uneven, or one side does not match the other in size, shape, or color.
Border that is irregular — The mole has ragged, blurred, or uneven edges.
Color that is uneven — The mole has multiple shades, including black, brown, tan, or blue.
Diameter — The mole is large in diameter (typically around ¼ inch wide).
Evolving — The mole changes size, shape, and/or color in weeks or months time.

, Moles on the face can be removed by surgical cutting. A dermatologist will either shave the mole off or make a surgical excision depending on the nature of the mole.If a mole is small and mainly exists above the surface of the skin, a doctor will likely perform a surgical shave. He or she will numb the skin and use sterile scalpel to cut around and beneath the mole. No stitches will be required, but the healing process can leave a flat scar that will vary in color from the rest of your skin. This scar may or may not be as visible as the original mole.If the mole is flat or otherwise has cells that go deeper into the skin, the doctor will perform a surgical excision. During this procedure, the mole and a margin of unaffected skin will be removed with a scalpel or sharp punch device. You will need stitches to close this wound, and the procedure often leaves a scar in the form of a thin, light line. Since the procedure does scar, however, it is often not preferred for moles on the face.

, This procedure is also referred to as ""cryosurgery."" The doctor will apply a small amount of cold liquid nitrogen directly to the mole by spraying or swabbing it on. This liquid nitrogen is so cold that it destroys the cells of the mole.Usually, this procedure leaves a small blister behind in place of the mole. This blister will heal on its own in a matter of days to weeks.
Once the blister heals, you may or may not be left with a light scar. Even if this should happen, though, the scar is typically much lighter and more difficult to spot than the original mole, so it might still be worth considering if you have a mole on your face.

, A dermatologist can burn a mole off the face using a laser or by trying a procedure known as ""electrosurgery.""


During laser surgery, the doctor will use a small, specialized laser to target the mole. As the laser heats the mole tissue, it breaks it down, causing the cells to die off. A small blister may result from the procedure, but this blister will heal on its own and may or may not leave a scar in its place. Note that laser removal is not usually used for deep facial moles since the laser does not usually go deep enough into the skin.
During electrosurgery, the doctor will shave the top portion of the mole with a scalpel and use an electric needle to destroy the tissue beneath it. An electric current passes through the wire of the needle, heating it and causing the upper layers of skin to burn off. You might need multiple treatments, but this option leaves behind very little scarring, making it a good option to consider for moles on the face.

, Mild acids can be used to get rid of moles as long as they are packaged for that purpose. Try an over-the-counter version or a prescription version.


Always follow the instructions on the label to avoid damaging healthy skin surrounding the mole. As a general rule, you should apply the acid directly to the mole and avoid letting it come into contact with unaffected skin.
One acid commonly used to treat moles is salicylic acid.
Acid treatments can come in the form of lotions, liquids, sticks, cleansing pads, and creams.
Sometimes an acid treatment will get rid of a mole completely, but some weaker treatments may only fade the mole.

, The only herbal treatment occasionally used by dermatologists is BIO-T. This solution is applied directly to the mole. A bandage will be placed over the treated mole, and the BIO-T will be left to work on its own. The mole can disappear in five days or so.


This treatment is gentle and leaves virtually no scar behind, so it works well as an option for moles on the face.
The usefulness of this treatment is still up for debate in some medical circles, so your dermatologist may or may not recommend it. If your doctor does not mention it as an option, though, you should bring it up and ask for his or her professional advice and opinion on it.

, Most home remedies are based on anecdotal evidence (or personal experience) and have little or no medical evidence supporting their effectiveness. Furthermore, there is a possibility that they could result in permanent damage to the skin on your face, leaving a scar or discoloration. Speak with your physician before attempting any of these remedies.

, The enzymes in garlic are believed to dissolve moles by breaking apart the cell clusters that make them up. It can lighten the pigmentation of the moles, and in some cases, it may even get rid of the mole completely.


Cut a thin slice of garlic and place it directly on the mole. Cover the area with a bandage. This technique should be repeated twice a day for two to seven days, or until the mole goes away.
Alternatively, grind a clove of garlic in a food processor until it breaks down into a paste-like consistency. Dab a little of the paste onto your facial mole and cover it with a bandage. Leave this paste on overnight and rinse it off in the morning. Repeat this procedure for up to one week.

, There are various types of fruit and vegetable juice that can be applied to the mole.Usually, some acidic or astringent element in these juices can attack the cells of the mole, causing the mole to fade and even disappear.


Apply sour apple juice three times a day for up to three weeks.
Dab onion juice onto the mole two to four times a day for two to four weeks. Wash the juice off 40 minutes after applying it.
Spread pineapple juice over the mole and let it sit overnight before rinsing it off in the morning. You could also apply slices of pineapple directly to the mole. Repeat this once a night for a couple of weeks.
Crush coriander leaves until juice forms and dab that juice directly on the mole. Let it dry, the wash it off. Repeat once a day for a couple of weeks.
Mix equal parts roasted pomegranate and lime juice until a paste forms. Apply this paste to the mole at night, cover the mole with a bandage, then wash the paste off in the morning. Repeat this for as long as a week.

, Combine a pinch of baking soda with a drop or two of caster oil. Mix with a toothpick until a paste forms. Apply this paste to the mole just before you go to bed and cover the area with a bandage. Rinse the dried paste off in the morning.


Repeat this technique for about a week, or until the mole fades or disappears.

, Cut the root of a dandelion in half. Squeeze the root until a little of the milky liquid is released, and dab this liquid directly on the mole. Leave it in place for 30 minutes before washing it off. Repeat this treatment once daily for at least a week.


No scientific evidence supports the notion, but it is commonly held that the milky liquid inside the dandelion root can help fade flat facial moles from sight.

, Combine equal parts flaxseed oil and honey. Gradually add in a pinch or so of ground flaxseed until a paste forms. Apply this paste directly to the mole and leave it on for an hour before washing it off. Repeat once a day for a week or so.


While there is no scientific explanation for it, flaxseed is a popular folk remedy for many different types of skin blemishes.

, Apple cider vinegar is a very gentle and natural acid. Like prescription acid treatments, it is believed to gradually burn the cells of the mole until they die off, causing the mole to disappear, as well.


Wash the mole for 15 to 20 minutes using warm water so that the skin becomes soft.
Soak a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar. Apply the vinegar to the mole for 10 to 15 minutes.
Wash the apple cider vinegar off with clean water and dry the area.
Repeat these steps four times a day for a week or so.
Typically, the mole will turn black and become a scab. That scab will fall off, leaving the skin beneath it mole-free., It is a commonly held belief that iodine can break into the cells of the mole and wipe them out using a natural, gentle chemical reaction.


Apply a bit of iodine directly to the mole at night and cover the area with a bandage. Rinse it off in the morning.
Repeat this treatment for two to three days. The mole should begin disappearing in this time period.

, Steep extract of milkweed herb in warm water for 10 minutes. Apply this ""tea"" to the mole on your face and leave it on overnight. Clean the area in the morning.


Do this every night for a week.

, Use a cotton swab to apply aloe vera gel directly to the mole. Cover it with a cotton bandage and leave it on for three hours so that your skin can soak the aloe vera in fully. Apply a fresh bandage afterward.


Repeat this once a day for several weeks. Theoretically, the mole should disappear in this time period.

The active ingredient, absorbed by skin cells in the damaged area, works to reduce the inflammation and improve the appearance of the blemish.
Apply the cream or ointment several times a day according to the product directions. General recommendations limit the use of topical steroid products to no more than seven days.
Monitor the area for any unwanted effects. Sometimes the prolonged use of topical steroid products can cause the skin to atrophy, or start to break down. This reaction most commonly occurs with use in moist areas of the body and on the face.;
, Studies support the benefit of using products containing onion skin derivatives mixed with other ingredients, such as allantoin, for its healing abilities.Products that contain onion skin derivatives are available without a prescription.
Recommendations for use include a once daily application for several months. It takes time to alter the skin tissue and allow for remodeling to occur.

, Sun protection is vital for minimizing scars. Choose a sunscreen with zinc or titanium oxide to protect against both UVA and UVB rays. Choose a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher., Green tea contains chemical compounds called phenols that have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Applying green tea topically causes a release of a phenol compound that provides benefit in treating scar tissue.Research supports the topical use of green tea extract. One study was able to show a significant reduction in the growth of scar tissue as well as shrinking tissue that was already developed.
Every scar is different. Green tea extract was studied in the types of scars called keloid scars. This generally means that the scar tissue formed above the regular skin tissue, causing a raised scar that can be felt.
Green tea extract creams can be purchased at most pharmacies or online.

, There is no scientific or absolute recipe for making your own topical green tea extract product, so use caution. Adjust your recipe as you learn what works best for your skin.One recipe suggests using two tablespoons full of green tea added to ¾ cup of very hot, but not boiling, water.

Select your base cream. Basic emollient creams that do not contain any added preservatives or fragrances are available for purchase and are not expensive.
Use a sturdy spatula, or even a blender or electric mixer, and add cream to the tea in small portions until you have the desired thickness.

, Some scars are too large and possibly too old to respond well to topical remedies. In some cases, you may want to talk to a dermatologist about procedures available to remove your scars.Laser resurfacing is a procedure that removes the external surface layers of the skin where the scar or skin damage is located. Newer techniques and equipment accomplish the desired results in very little time.
Dermabrasion uses special equipment and procedures that target the damaged or scarred areas. The procedure removes the outer layers of skin in those areas and stimulates the growth of new skin.
Microdermabrasion is a milder form of dermabrasion. This procedure is helpful in reducing scars and imperfections that are more superficial.
Steroid injections into the skin can soften existing scar tissue. Steroid injections often need repeated treatments.
Injectable fillers, such as collagen and fat injections, can immediately raise sunken scars, making them more level with the natural surface of the skin. However, this treatment is not permanent and may need to be repeated.
Radiotherapy is not used often due to the potential problem with longer term side effects. Radiotherapy uses low-dose radiation to prevent the formation of certain types of scar tissue.
Surgery can be performed to alter the size, depth, or color of a scar, although it can’t be removed completely. However, surgery isn’t suggested for hypertrophic or keloid scars because it can make them worse.

, Putting concealer on a scar is a good way to hide it temporarily. Pick a shade that is as similar to the color of your skin as possible. If the scar is red or pink, try a concealer with a green undertone. If the scar is brown, try a concealer with a yellow undertone. Be sure to choose a waterproof concealer."

The aloe vera has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, so it can help protect your skin while you sleep., Again, use lukewarm water to rinse your skin, and let air dry. The aloe vera gel should have decreased the inflammation and redness of your pimple, and it should be less noticeable. If your pimple was previously punctured or bleeding, the aloe vera gel will have helped skin regenerate and heal.Apply aloe vera gel to your pimples as often as you like. It’s most beneficial if you apply directly after a face wash or a shower.

Get rid of dark spots.,
Use bleaching creams.,
Ask your doctor about a procedure.",How to Get Rid of Skin Imperfections2," Age spots, liver spots, and solar lentigines, are all names used to describe places on the skin that change to a darker color over time. Most people experience this type of skin pigmentation change, especially in areas exposed to sunlight over the years.Changes in coloration of your skin can be alarming since they may appear to be signs of skin cancer.
See as dermatologist if you are suspicious. Your doctor may take a small skin sample of the area called a tissue biopsy to test for the presence of early skin cancer cells. Always see a doctor as soon as possible if you experience any changes that may indicate the development of a serious disease.
Age spots are not cancerous. They occur from sun exposure and usually develop on areas of the skin that have been repeatedly exposed to the sun, like the face, shoulders, and arms.

The laser disrupts the melanin-producing cells that are causing the area to be darker. Several treatments may be needed to lighten larger or very dark areas.
Cryotherapy is a process used that freezes areas of the skin. The process of freezing destroys the melanin cells in the area that are causing the pigment changes. Cryosurgery and laser surgery can destroy age spots but may leave a temporary or permanent white or dark spot.
Dermabrasion and microdermabrasion are options that can be used to treat dark spots on the skin. The procedure is performed in the same manner as that for reducing visible scars. Destroying the outermost layer(s) of the skin allows for new skin to grow in its place without the darkened areas.
A chemical peel uses topical acids that destroy the outer layer of the skin. It may take more than one treatment to get rid of larger areas of dark pigmentation.

, Niacinamide is also known as vitamin B3. Look on product labels for either description, vitamin B3 or niacinamide as part of the active ingredients.Niacinamide works in a way similar to soy. It helps to lighten areas of the skin and prevent the dark pigmented cells from reaching the surface of the skin.
As the existing skin cells slough away over time, the newer skin cells with not contain the darker pigment with continued use.

, Ellagic acid has antioxidant properties and inhibits certain enzymes needed for the production of melanin, which is the source of the dark areas on the skin. Research suggests that ellagic acid is one of the most potent natural skin lighteners available.Ellagic acid is commonly found in natural food sources that include strawberries, cherries, and pomegranates. Other natural sources include blackberries, cranberries, raspberries, wolfberries, grapes, walnuts, and peaches
Non-food sources of ellagic acid include the North American white oak and the European red oak.
Some medicinal mushroom species contain ellagic acid, such as the phellinus linteus.

, Lignin peroxidase is an enzyme that breaks down the melanin in the layers of the skin. Breaking down the melanin reduces the appearance and formation of dark spots. Many products contain this enzyme, even though the research is still ongoing to determine the role of lignin peroxidase as a skin lightener.Lignin peroxidase is derived from a fungus. It is most commonly found in wood pulp as it breaks down and becomes lighter.
This enzyme is used to lighten wood pulp during the paper manufacturing process.
The use of lignin peroxidase in lightening wood pulp led to its discovery as a source for skin lightening.

, Arbutin, sometimes referred to as alpha arbutin, is a natural product derived from plant sources. Arbutin is considered a natural form of hydroquinone which is scientifically proven to lighten skin.Plant sources for arbutin include bearberry, blueberry, cranberry, mulberry, and pears.
The substance comes in two forms. The alpha arbutin isomer is more potent in lightening skin than the beta arbutin isomer.
Available products contain as much as 3% arbutin concentrations. Arbutin works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin.

, This a substance produced as a byproduct during the process of rice fermentation to make sake. Pure kojic acid can be unstable when exposed to air, so many companies use a derivative of kojic acid called kojic dipalmitate.Research with this agent is ongoing. Some concern exists. Using large concentrations of kojic acid has created concerns of possible unwanted and serious skin changes, as well a risk of an allergic reaction.
Kojic acid is also derived from plant fungus.
Many available products contain concentrations that range from 1-4% of kojic acid or a derivative. The active agent is sometimes combined with other skin lightening agents to enhance the effectiveness of the product.

, While ingesting licorice can have several unwanted side effects, using licorice or licorice derivatives in a topical manner has been shown to lighten areas of the skin.Some products used for skin lightening, including topical patches among other types of topical preparations, are available that contain licorice, licorice extracts, or licorice root.
Recipes to make licorice preparations are available on line. Preparing your own topical preparation may result in some difficulty with application since the results are usually sticky and somewhat smelly preparations.

Ask your doctor about surgery.",How to Get Rid of Skin Imperfections4," Wrinkles are the creases in your skin that form over time in areas of repeated muscle movements. For example, smiling and squinting causes creases that become wrinkles. Even though most factors that cause your skin to wrinkle as you age are beyond your control, there may some things you can do to minimize those unwanted wrinkles.As we get older, our skin naturally loses elasticity and flexibility, accompanied by natural changes in the texture and fragility of our skin.
Three primary factors cause the development of wrinkles: genetics, sun exposure over the years, and smoking.
Other environmental causes of early wrinkles include prolonged exposure to pollutants in the workplace and possible in the air, depending on where you live.

, Genetics set the stage for changes that occur in your skin that lead to wrinkles.Those changes include the gradual loss of elasticity in your skin, decreased production of natural oils, and loss of fat in the deeper layers of the skin.
The fat deposits in the deeper layers of your skin help to prevent the development of wrinkles over time, or at least help to minimize the appearance of some wrinkles.
Research suggests that your facial wrinkles linked to genetic changes most likely come from your mother. In other words, if your mother has very few wrinkles compared to other people her age, then you will likely follow the same pattern.

, Regardless of your age, protect your skin from the sun. Sun damage is a major contributor to the development of wrinkles. Always apply a sunscreen product that has broad spectrum coverage against UVA and UVB light and has a SPF of at least 30.Exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun is a major cause of wrinkling.
Ultraviolet light rays from the sun cause the connective tissue in your skin to break down prematurely.
Connective tissue contains collagen and elastin fibers. Protecting your skin from connective tissue damage results in maintaining flexible skin that is less susceptible to premature aging and the development of wrinkles.

, Smoking contributes to premature skin aging and causes wrinkles. The more cigarettes you smoke and the length of time you have smoked contribute to the severity of the wrinkles.The nicotine in cigarettes causes narrowing of the blood vessels in the outermost layers of your skin, which restricts blood flow and reduces oxygen to your skin. As a result, skin begins to sag and wrinkle prematurely because of smoking.
Many of the chemicals in tobacco smoke also damage collagen and elastin, which are fibers that give your skin its strength and elasticity.

, Products are available with a prescription that contain tretinoin. This is an agent derived from retinoids found in vitamin A.Regular application of topical retinoid products can help to reduce fine wrinkles, minimize the appearance of rough areas, and even out blotchy areas of discoloration.
Topical application of retinoid products can cause your skin to be more sensitive to sunlight and burn easier. Be sure you wear protective clothing and use the appropriate sunscreen.
Common changes with the use of retinoids include a burning or tingling feeling in the skin, redness, and dryness.
If you experience any type of unwanted skin reaction, contact your doctor. These products come in a range of strengths. You many need to stop using the product, or you may be able to try a reduced strength.

, Alpha hydroxy acids are a group of chemical compounds that restore some of the skin's natural elasticity. Topical products have proven to be somewhat helpful in reducing wrinkles in the skin. The best results cause only slight to modest changes in the appearance of wrinkles.Alpha hydroxyl acids are derived from natural sources.
Examples of alpha hydroxy acids and their common sources include glycolic acid which comes from sugar cane, lactic acid which is available from many sources including sour milk, malic acid which comes from apples, citric acid which is derived from citrus fruits, and tartaric acid which is an extract of wine products made from grapes.

, For any alpha hydroxy acid product to improve the appearance of wrinkles, the chemical has to be able to penetrate deep into the layers of the skin. This group of chemicals are included in a variety of cosmetics, or pharmaceuticals, and are available in a range of concentrations.Alpha hydroxy acids can help to restore oils and flexibility of the skin. The agent in this group of compounds that has the best absorption into the skin is glycolic acid.
Cosmetic products contain lower concentrations of glycolic acid, or other alpha hydroxy acids, at a concentration of 5 to 10%.
Slightly higher strengths provide greater benefit, but continued use is needed to maintain the results even if you use a product with a higher concentration.
The highest concentrations do the most good, but are not available for general purchase. For example, concentrations of glycolic acid as high as 50-70% are used in chemical peels that are done only with medical supervision.

, Medical procedures used to treat wrinkles have the greatest visible benefit and the longest lasting effects. Some people get the greatest benefit from using a combination of procedures under the supervision of their doctor.Regardless of the procedure chosen, be sure to take care of your skin by using protective clothing, wearing the appropriate sunscreen, and stop smoking if you are a smoker.
Cost is a consideration in pursuing medical procedures, as is the potential risks associated with some methods.
Talk to your doctor and be sure you have all your questions answered before you proceed.

, All three procedures involve some form of physical and/or chemical resurfacing the outermost layer of the skin.Dermabrasion uses a hand tool that sands away the surface of the skin. New skin growth is promoted and has the results of fewer and minimized wrinkles.
Dermabrasion can usually done in one office visit.
Microdermabrasion follows the same principle but removes only the fine outermost layer. It often takes several treatments to get good results.
Chemical peels use acids to dissolve the outer layers of the skin. It may take more than one treatment to get the results you want.

, Methods used to resurfacing the skin with laser light sources use either ablative or nonablative techniques to reduce the appearance and size of wrinkles.Ablative treatment destroys the outer layer(s) of skin. At the same time, layers beneath the outer layer are heated to promote the growth of new skin and new collagen.
Laser resurfacing done in this manner may require several months for the skin to grow back in a healthy manner.
Non-ablative treatments use the same general process, only this type of treatment often needs more than one treatment. Nonablative treatment means less skin is damaged or wounded. New laser technology has improved these procedures.

, Botulinum toxin and dermal filler injections are the most recent approaches to getting rid of wrinkles. These methods of treatment are effective and last for several months or even longer. Variables that impact the duration of efficacy include the product used, the depth of the wrinkles, the overall size of the wrinkle, and location of the treatment area.Botulinum toxin, or botox, injections prevent the muscle tissue from contracting causing the wrinkles to be more obvious. The results of botox injections can last as long as four months.
Botox injections work well in the areas between the eyebrows, the forehead area, and sections of wrinkled skin along the outside edge of the eyes.
Dermal filler injections involve injecting material into the areas on your face where the deeper and more visible wrinkles have developed.
Ingredients used in soft filler injections include fat, collagen, and hyaluronic acid gel. The agents work to fill up the areas that are the sunken part of the wrinkles. This serves to plump up those areas making the skin surface even.
This type of procedure is less costly than a face-lift but requires repeat treatments. It depends on the severity and depth of the original wrinkles and the success of the treatment to determine the time frame for repeating the filler injections.

, Recent developments have led to the use of radiofrequency treatment devices that use electromagnetic waves to heat the skin. Once the target temperature is reached, collagen is stimulated to develop from within the deeper layers of the skin. The collagen production significantly reduces the appearance of wrinkles.Heat treatments involve promoting collagen development and skin tightening by the use of a heat source. The procedure is relatively inexpensive and is noninvasive.
Different devices are available for use to tighten the skin using applications of heat. Expect to receive several sessions of treatment and wait four to six months for best results.

, Face-lift surgery is still a good option for those that want to tighten their facial skin and reduce wrinkles and imperfections.Face-lift surgery is the process of surgically removing skin and fat in areas of your face and neck, then tightening the muscles and connective tissues.
It takes several weeks for bruising and swelling to subside after surgery but the results can last for as long as five to ten years.
Choose your plastic surgeon, the specialist who does face-lifts, very carefully. Check reviews and use word of mouth to find out which doctor is the best in their field. Research where they doctor went to school and for how long. Make sure they are accredited in the field of plastic surgery as well as reconstructive facial surgery.

Don't mistake Fordyce spots for folliculitis.",How to Get Rid of Fordyce Spots," If you notice little bumps on your genitals or around the borders of your lips that aren't going away or are bothering you, get a referral from your family doctor to a dermatologist, who are skin specialists. The dermatologist will be able to diagnose your condition and put your mind at ease, because Fordyce spots can sometimes look like small warts or the initial stages of a herpes outbreak. Fordyce spots are a very common phenomenon and appear in about 85% of the population at some time in their lives— males are a little more likely to develop them than females are.It's important to realize that Fordyce spots are harmless, painless, not infectious and do not require treatment. Their removal should be for cosmetic reasons only.
Fordyce spots are much more noticeable when the skin is stretched, and may only be seen during an erection (in males) or during pubic hair management (bikini wax) for females.;
, If you decide to remove some Fordyce spots for cosmetic reasons, talk to your dermatologist about available laser treatments, which are the most common method of getting rid of them and certain other skin conditions.Vaporizing laser treatments, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers, have been used with some success on Fordyce spots, but so have pulsed dye lasers. Ask your doctor which may be most appropriate for your condition and budget.


CO2 lasers were the earliest gas lasers developed and remains the highest-power continuous wave laser treatment currently available for various skin conditions.
However, CO2 laser ablation can leave scars afterwards, so it may not be appropriate for Fordyce spots on the face.
In contrast, treatment with pulsed dye lasers is more expensive than CO2 lasers, but may be less likely to leave scars., Micro-punch surgery is a procedure that involves using a pen-like device to punch a small hole in the skin and remove tissue. It's often used in hair transplant surgery, but research indicates in can be very effective for removing Fordyce spots also, especially on the genitalia.The risk of scarring with micro-punch surgery is less than CO2 lasers and the spots don't seem to return, which is a possibility with CO2 and pulsed dye laser treatments.


A local anesthetic is needed to eliminate the pain of micro-punch surgery.
The tissue removed with micro-punch techniques is not destroyed (unlike laser therapy), so it can be looked at under a microscope to rule out other more serious skin conditions, such as warts or cancer.
Micro-punch treatments are generally very quick and can remove dozens of Fordyce spots within minutes — making it ideal for people who have hundreds of spots on their genitalia or face.

, There's some evidence to suggest that hormonal imbalance triggered by puberty, pregnancy and menopause can cause or contribute to Fordyce spots in the same way they can contribute to acne (pimples).As such, a variety of prescription creams that are normally used on acne and other skin blemishes can sometimes yield results on Fordyce spots. Ask your dermatologist about the potential for using topical glucocorticoids, retinoids, clindamycin, pimecrolimus or benzoyl peroxide.


Clindamycin cream is especially helpful for combating inflamed sebaceous glands, although it's rare for Fordyce spots to become swollen.
For younger women, going on oral contraceptives may reduce or eliminate Fordyce spots, much like how they impact acne.
CO2 laser ablation is often combined with the use of topical exfoliating acids, such as trichloracetic and bichloracetic acids., A medication called 5-aminolevulinic acid is applied to the skin, allowed to penetrate, and then is activated with a light source, such as a blue light or a pulsed dye laser. This treatment can also treat and prevent certain skin cancers and acne.


Be aware that this treatment can be expensive.
This treatment also makes the skin more sensitive to the sun temporarily.

, This treatment works well for acne and other similar conditions of the sebaceous glands.


Isotretinoin has some serious risks and possible side-effects, including possible birth defects, so it should only be considered for serious conditions, and women who take isotretinoin must abstain from sex or use birth control.

, Cryotherapy is the process of freezing off the bumps using liquid nitrogen.Talk to your dermatologist about the possibility of using this treatment to get rid of Fordyce spots.

, This is a form of laser therapy that burns off the Fordyce spots.Talk to your dermatologist about whether or not this might be an option for you.

, Keeping your skin clean and free of excess oils and bacteria can help reduce the occurrence of Fordyce spots in some people, particularly during teen years and pregnancy when hormone levels soar, but it's not a reliable way of getting rid of existing spots in most cases.Using clarifying agents to clean your face and genitals may help to unclog pores and sebaceous glands, which is also an effective strategy to prevent black heads / pimples.


Wash your genitals and face thoroughly on a regular basis, particularly after exercising and sweating.
Consider using a mild exfoliating agent, such as a loofah pad, when cleaning your skin.
If you have Fordyce spots on your genitalia, avoid shaving your pubic hair because the spots might become more noticeable. Laser hair removal may be a better choice.

, Although Fordyce spots appear in the same areas of the body as herpes lesions (around the lips and genitalia), they are very different conditions. Unlike Fordyce spots, herpes lesions look like red blisters or ulcers and they are initially very itchy before becoming painful — usually described as burning pain.Also, herpes lesions are usually larger than Fordyce spots.


Herpes are caused by the herpes simplex virus (either type 1 or 2) and are very contagious. In contrast, Fordyce spots are not contagious.
After an outbreak, herpes lesions fade away and usually only reappear in times of stress. Fordyce spots sometimes fade away, but usually they are permanent or even get a little worse with age.

, Fordyce spots can look a lot like genital warts, particularly during their early stages when the warts are quite small. Both conditions also appear around the genitalia. However, genital warts can grow to be much larger than Fordyce spots and are caused by HPV or human papillomavirus.HPV is also contagious and transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact — through a cut, abrasion or small tear in your skin.


As genital warts grow, they often develop into cauliflower-like bumps or tiny stem-like protrusions. In contrast, Fordyce spots often look like ""chicken skin"" or sometimes ""goose bumps"" especially when the skin is stretched.
Genital warts often spread to the anus regions, whereas Fordyce spots rarely do.
Genital warts increase your risk of cancer of the cervix. In contrast, Fordyce spots are not associated with any other condition.

, Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles that's commonly seen around the opening of the vagina and base of the penis.Folliculitis involves the formation of little pustules around the pubic hair follicles. They are frequently itchy, sometimes painful and red and release some pus if squeezed — similar to a pustule pimple. In contrast, Fordyce spots are rarely itchy, never painful and can sometimes release a thick, oily discharge if squeezed — similar to a black head pimple. Folliculitis is often caused by shaving the pubic region and irritating hair follicles. Bacteria are sometimes involved, although it's not considered a contagious condition.


Folliculitis is often successfully treated with topical creams or oral antibiotics, and better hygiene measures, including quitting shaving with a razor.
It's not recommended to squeeze Fordyce spots because you may inflame them and make them larger.

Avoid irritating your face if shaving facial hair.,
Avoid irritating your eyelids with too much mascara.,
Keep your face covered when needed.,
Run a humidifier.",How to Get Rid of Dry Skin on Face," Warm water relaxes your pores and makes it easier to wash your face, but hot water can cause your skin to dry out faster.The ideal water temperature when washing your face would be just a fraction warmer than lukewarm. Heat is a natural exfoliator, so hot water is great when you want to strip your skin of dead skin cells and oils, but if the skin on your face has been suffering a dry spell, you will need to stay away from hot temperatures.
If you do need to use hot water on your face, quickly rinse your face with cold water afterward to reduce the amount of time heat lingers on your face.
Similarly, on very hot days, you should come inside your home and quickly splash cold water on your face to cool the skin down. The humidity in the air will usually help your skin retain some of its natural moisture, but you will be able to keep even more of it if you can cool your skin down regularly.;
, Body soaps are too harsh for the skin on your face, so you should look for a cleanser specifically meant for your face.


Many soap-based cleansers contain sodium lauryl sulfate, a surfactant known to steal away moisture. For your face, non-soap cleansers or non-sudsy cleansers are a safer way to go.
You should also avoid cleansers with added fragrances, since these often include some form of alcohol, which is an astringent that can severely dry your skin out.
Also consider using a cleanser that contains ceramides, a type of fatty molecule usually found on the outer layer of your skin. Synthetic ceramides can help your skin retain more moisture.

, Never rub a dry towel over your skin after washing your face. Instead, gently pat your face dry with a dry, soft towel.


In order to minimize potential irritation as much as possible, you should only pat your skin dry for about 20 seconds or less.
Use a soft cloth but make sure that it is made from fibers that can actually absorb water. A soft terry cloth works well.
Ideally, you should dry your face so that it is slightly moist to the touch but not dripping wet. However, if you know you're going to be using certain creams (such as Hydrocortisone) then make sure your skin is 100% dry before applying to the dry areas. This will avoid watering down the cream and having a lower concentration of medicine in the bit you apply

, A moisturizing lotion or cream should be applied generously over your face right after you wash it. Preferably, the skin should still retain a little moisture, as well, since applying moisturizer on wet skin can trap more of that moisture on your skin for a longer period.


Any moisturizing cream or lotion meant for your face is worth a shot if you do not know what to look for, but if you already use a moisturizer and need something a little stronger, look for one with shea butter, ceramides, stearic acid, or glycerin listed somewhere in the ingredients. These are moisturizers that help you replace the outer protective layer on your skin responsible for keeping moisture inside.

, Instead of using a harsh scrub to strip your skin of excess oil and dead skin, wipe them away with a soft baby's washcloth, which will get the job done while causing less irritation to your face.


Your skin needs to be exfoliated from time to time so that dead skin cells can be stripped away, but if you exfoliate too roughly, you can cause even more damage to the outer layer of your skin and make dryness even worse.
A baby's washcloth is softer than a standard washcloth, and some are even made from smooth, plush materials like satin. In order to use this washcloth to exfoliate your skin, splash a bit of water on your face and slowly massage your face in small, circular patterns.

, Occasionally apply a thin coating of petroleum jelly over areas of your face that dry out easily to lock in your skin's natural moisture.


This can be especially helpful during the winter, when the skin of your face is frequently exposed to harsh, drying air. For winter use, apply the petroleum jelly before stepping outside, especially if you plan to be out for quite some time.
For year-round use, apply a little petroleum jelly over notably dry areas of your skin. Let it sit for 10 minutes before gently washing it off. You can repeat this procedure twice a week., Strange as it may seem, milk is both a natural cleanser and a natural moisturizer.Soak a soft baby washcloth in ice cold water, wringing out any excess over the skin to reduce the overall mess. Drape the cloth over your face and let it sit there for 10 minutes.
The lactic acid in milk is a natural yet gentle cleanser. It can reduce redness and remove dead skin.
The lipids in the milk can infuse the skin with additional moisture, causing the skin on your face to look re-hydrated, plump, and soft.
Note that skim milk will not moisturize very well, so you should use 2 percent or whole milk.
If you suspect that your nightly facial cleanser is a little rougher on your skin than it should be, you do not have to toss it out just yet. Swapping your usual cleanser out for milk two to three times a week can give your skin the break it needs.
Milk cannot strip away makeup, however, so you should remove any cosmetics on your face before applying the milk.

, The aloe plant contains properties which can soothe red, irritated skin and re-hydrated dry, flaking skin.The best way to go about this is by going straight to the source. Break a fresh aloe leaf open and gently massage the sap that leaks out onto your face after washing your skin. Let it sit on your skin for 15 minutes before you rinse it off.
This mask can be applied as often as once a week.
If you cannot find fresh aloe plants, you can use a commercial aloe vera gel or a commercial mask with aloe vera as an ingredient.

, The eyelids are especially likely to dry out. If the skin there becomes dry and itchy, carefully apply a light layer of hydrocortisone cream over the eyelids to reduce itchiness and re-hydrate the skin.


The reason the skin on your eyelids dries out so easily is that it is especially thin has almost no callus layer. This also puts eyelids at risk of further thinning if hydrocortisone creams are overused or used for extended periods of time.Remove any eye makeup before you apply it and make sure that the hydrocortisone cream does not get into your eyes when you apply it. Be aware, too, that the cream migrates and can get onto your eyeball surface no matter how carefully you apply it. (At least one doctor suspects that chronic hydrocortisone cream contact with the eyeball might trigger glaucoma.)You can use this treatment twice daily, but be leery of long term, continued use., Separate an egg; whip the egg whites. Spread it all over your face. Wait 10 minutes, then wash it off. Repeat with egg yolk. Pat your face down. Moisturize face with lotion. Enjoy your soft, smooth skin.

, Men have an extra concern when it comes to dry skin on the face. Poor shaving habits can actually result in drier skin, so guys should take note and shave carefully to avoid making matters worse.


The shaving process removes both hair and oil from your skin, and the removal of natural oil can cause your skin to dry out.
To reduce the damage done by shaving, shave after you wash your face, when hairs are softer and easier to remove. Always use a sharp razor blade, as well, which can cut individual hairs more readily than a dull blade.
Always use shaving cream or gel to protect your skin while shaving and drag the razor in the direction the hair is growing.

, For women, cosmetics can be another cause for concern when trying to get rid of dry skin on the face. Mascara, in particular, can have a damaging effect on the eyelids.


Use an actual makeup remover instead of a standard facial cleanser for best results. Oftentimes, standard cleansers do not remove every last trace of makeup, and some may still linger on your skin even after you wash it. Makeup removers do a much more thorough job.
Try to give your skin a break from mascara and other cosmetics at least a couple of days each week.

, Use sunscreen to protect your face from harsh UV rays when going outside. In the winter, when the air is cold and dry, wrap a scarf around the lower half of your face before heading out.


Sun damage is one of the main culprits behind most skin problems, including dry skin on your face. Apply a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 year-round. If you are concerned about applying heavy sunscreens on your face, check out a facial lotion with its own SPF and apply that instead of standard sunscreen.
You should also protect the skin on your lips with a lip balm that has an SPF of at least 15.
During winter, the dry air naturally sucks moisture from your skin, especially from exposed skin. Wear a scarf or a hat with a mask to cover as much of your face as possible, thereby protecting the skin from harsh winter air.

, Dry air can dry your skin out as much as anything else. Running a humidifier in your bedroom at night can prevent the air from becoming too dry while infusing the skin on your face with more moisture.Try to keep the humidity in your room at about 50 percent.
A humidifier is especially important at night since your resting hours are the time your body takes to repair your skin. Too much dryness in the air can cause your face to shed skin cells too quickly, which means you might wake up and find a layer of flaky skin over some areas of your face unless you make sure that the room you sleep in is somewhat humid.
As an alternative, you could also place a pot of water near your radiator or place a naturally humidifying plant, like a Boston palm, bamboo fern, or Ficus alii, in your bedroom.

Consider a chemical peel.",How to Get Rid of Dark Spots," Lemon juice has natural bleaching properties, which can help reduce the appearance of dark spots and create more even, lighter skin. Rub freshly squeezed lemon juice onto your dark spots and leave the juice on for about 10 minutes before rinsing. Repeat this treatment three times a week.


Lemon juice dries out the skin and makes it hypersensitive to the sun, so it is important to follow this treatment with a moisturizer and sunscreen.;
, Apple cider vinegar works by speeding up the process by which your skin naturally sheds, which can help even out skin tone.Dab the vinegar onto your dark spots with a cotton ball and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing.

, The acid in onions has natural skin-lightening properties, which can help fight dark spots.Extract the juice from the onion by either squeezing it or putting it in the blender. Use a cotton ball to dab the juice onto your dark spots and leave it on for about 10 minutes before rinsing. Repeat this treatment daily.

, Cut a fresh garlic clove in half and rub it onto your dark spots. Alternatively, blend the garlic in a food processor to create a paste and use a cotton swab to dab it onto your skin. Leave the garlic on for 30 minutes to an hour and then rinse.

, *Caution! Read warnings about this method* If you want to lighten a dark spot, take a needle and SOFTLY prick the area. Not enough to make it bleed, of course, but enough so that the skin on it appears to flake a bit. Don't peel it off, but leave the area for a few days. Eventually, the skin flakes off, leaving you with a lighter spot than before., There are prescription dark spot treatments on the market that contain a skin-lightening agent called hydroquinone.Additionally, topical cysteamine has also proven effective treating pigmentation.With continued use, these types of lotions can fade existing dark spots and create a more even skin tone.


The bleaching agent in hydroquinone creams may cause temporary itching, burning, redness, and other discomfort.
Non-prescription lotions are also available that claim to treat dark spots. Most major cosmetic companies like Clinique, Estée Lauder, Maybelline, Proactive, and Garnier carry such products.
Avoid skin-lightening creams that contain mercury, as this chemical can be toxic in humans.

, Laser treatments are available that target melanin-producing cells, which are responsible for skin pigmentation.Laser therapy can gradually lighten the appearance of dark spots after several treatments.


Laser therapy carries some risk factors, which include discoloration of the skin.

, This treatment involves applying an acid to the skin that causes the outer layer to peel and a new, fresh layer to form underneath it.You may need to get multiple treatments before seeing the results you want.


It is important to protect your skin from the sun following this type of treatment. Like laser therapy, chemical peels carry a risk of skin discoloration.

Make a fruit peel.",How to Get Rid of Freckles1," Lemon juice is a natural bleaching agent that can be used to make freckles look lighter and disappear. It works best on natural freckles, rather than freckles caused by sun exposure, since those tend to be darker and less uniform in appearance.


Buy a few fresh lemons and squeeze the juice into a bowl. You can also use pre-squeezed lemon juice.
Dip a cotton ball in the lemon juice and apply it to your face in the freckled area. Let the lemon juice soak into your skin for 10 minutes, then rinse it off with cool water.
Apply lemon juice every day to lighten your freckles over time.;
, Another natural method for lightening freckles is to apply a milk-based mask to your face and let it soak into your skin. The lactic acid in milk peels away the top layer of skin, making freckles lighter in appearance. This method is better for natural freckles than sun-induced freckles.


Spread 1/4 cup of sour cream over the areas most affected by freckles. Let the sour cream soak into your skin for 10 minutes, then rinse it away with cool water and pat dry.
Use a whole milk wash. Simply pour some whole milk into a bowl and rub it over your face. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse your face with cool water and pat dry.

, Mixing fruits together and letting them dry on your skin is a natural way to peel away the top layer of skin to lighten the appearance of your freckles. The sticky fruit bonds with the skin and helps it gently peel away.


Mash up strawberries and a kiwi in a bowl. Rub the mixture over your face, concentrating in the areas where you have the most freckles. Let the mixture dry completely, which should take about 20 minutes. Peel the fruit away and rinse your skin with cool water.
Try cucumbers or apricots as a substitute for strawberries or kiwis.

Use fresh mint.",How to Get Rid of Itchy Skin with Home Remedies1," Scientists are still unsure of the exact mechanisms by which itching occurs, but it is possible that itching is relieved when a “counter-irritant” (such as scratching) occurs.Cold water can easily be used to relieve itching on the skin.


Take a cold bath or shower. Since cold is so effective, it can be beneficial to take a cold shower and to let cool water run across the itchy area. If you prefer baths, soak in a bathtub filled with cold water for as long as you can.
You can also add essential oils that can help to sooth the skin and stop irritation to the bathwater. Add 2-3 drops of oil to a bath of cool water.Roman chamomile is soothing and anti-inflammatory.Frankincense (Boswellia frereana) can soothe inflamed skin.Lavender can help calm stress and reduce itching.Calendula oil can help reduce itching by increasing your skin’s hydration.Avoid the following essential oils, which are known to irritate your skin: bay, cinnamon, clove, citronella, cumin, lemongrass, lemon verbena, oregano, tagetes, and thyme.;
, Wet a towel or cloth in cold water then and place it over the itchy area of the skin until your skin feels soothed. Try for about 30 minutes.This soothing occurs because the wet cloths “macerate” (soften) the irritated skinand help “debride” (remove dead skin) the area.You can also press ice packs or frozen bags of peas or beans against the itchy area, although these should be wrapped in a towel before being placed on the skin. Apply frozen items for between 10-20 minutes, but no more than that.
Applying hot water or hot compresses could further irritate the skin.

, Baking soda is a natural antipruritic, or anti-itch treatment, that can be used on all kinds of itches, although it is especially effective in reducing itching caused by bee stings and insect bites.Add 1 cup of baking soda into a bathtub filled with cool water. Soak yourself for anywhere between 30 minutes to 1 hour., Oatmeal has compounds that act as antioxidants, which help to sooth the skin and stop the irritation. It is advisable to use colloidal oatmeal, but in cases where this is not available, whole oats or unprocessed oat flour can be used, too. You can use your food processor or coffee grinder to grind them. The effective compounds are more prevalent in the oats that have not been processed (avenanthramides).Add 2 cups of unprocessed and uncooked oatmeal or oat flour to your bathing water. Keep in mind that the water should be cool to lukewarm, but not hot because this can cause more damage to the skin. Soak for one hour in the water daily until the itching has stopped.
Unprocessed and uncooked oat flour can also be mixed with water to form a thick paste. The paste can be applied on the itchy skin and left on for 20-30 minutes.

, Aloe vera contains anti-fungal, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It also has plenty of vitamin E that is useful in the treatment of burns and helps to reduce inflammation and itching.Fresh aloe vera is ideal! If you have a whole aloe plant, take a piece, cut it open, and then apply the gel over the itchy skin. Leave it to soak into your skin and sooth it. Otherwise, you can purchase aloe vera gel from any pharmacy or drug store. Look for 100% all-natural aloe vera gel.
Do not apply aloe vera gel to open wounds or irritated or red skin., Research suggests that bathing with water that is mixed with mint leaves and peppermint oil is beneficial for itchy skin. Mint contains anti-inflammatory and anesthetic agents that help to reduce and stop itching on the skin.Mint leaves that have been brewed in hot water are even more potent because the steeping helps release the mint oil in the leaves. Make sure to cool the water before you apply the steeped solution to the skin with a cloth.You can also apply peppermint oil directly to itchy skin with a clean cotton pad."

Make sure to bleach your hair before you dye. This step of course is optional. If you skip this step you will have healthier hair and less work to do, however the color will be much darker and may not stay as long.;
,, You may want to speed up your hair growth. If you are doing this, Make sure not to put it up every day. Eat lots of foods rich in protein, Use the healthiest shampoos and conditioners you can find. Try using Bioxin shampoo and/or Mane 'n tail shampoo. Use Mane 'n tail conditioner too.

Use a lightening cream.,
Try microdermabrasion.,
Do a chemical peel.,
Get laser treatment.",How to Get Rid of Freckles2," Drugstores and beauty stores carry skin-lightening creams with a variety of different ingredient bases that are designed to remove freckles and other dark spots. Skin lightening creams may be effective for both natural and sun-related freckles. For best results, apply it every day.


Look for a cream with licorice extract, which has been shown to have skin-lightening properties.
Aloe is another popular ingredient in lightening creams. It can help lighten and moisturize the skin without causing damage.
Many creams contain chemicals like hydroquinone and oxybenzone. These ingredients may help lighten skin, but they can also be damaging. Read up on the side effects and test the product in a less sensitive area before you decide to use a cream containing these ingredients.

, This technique uses a stream of tiny particles to remove the outer layer of skin, lightening natural freckles or those caused by moderate sun damage. Microdermabrasion is usually performed over the course of several sessions.

, Peeling away the top layer of skin is an effective way to reduce the appearance of freckles, and may even lead to the elimination of lighter freckles. Chemical peels are usually used on the face, but they can also be used on the arms and hands.


Chemical peels come in three different strengths: superficial peels, which use alpha or beta hydroxy acids to remove the top layer of skin; medium peels, which use trichloroacetic acid to penetrate deeper into the skin and remove more layers; and deep peels, which use high concentrations of trichloroacetic acid or phenol to remove even more layers of skin.
After getting a chemical peel, your skin will take 2 - 3 days to heal from the procedure. It is not recommended to get chemical peels too often, since they are hard on the body.

, Lasers can be used to burn the blood vessels just underneath the freckles, reducing their appearance or removing them entirely. The procedure is not known to have any long-term damaging effects, but it may cause temporary bruising, redness and swelling.


Laser treatments are typically administered in 3 or so 10 to 15 minute sessions.
The skin is pre-treated with a cool spray to make sure the heat of the laser doesn't cause the patient pain.

Protect yourself from the sun.,
Get vitamin C. This nutrient helps to lighten freckles, so make sure you're getting plenty of it in your daily diet.",How to Get Rid of Freckles3," Some people are born with freckles, but many others develop them over time as a result of sun exposure. They may fade during the winter, but they come back darker every summer if you don't take precautions to keep the sun's rays off of your skin.


Use plenty of sunscreen. Make sure you cover your face every couple of hours while you're out in the sun, and more often if you're going swimming. Use a strong sunscreen on the rest of your body as well, since freckles can develop anywhere.
Wear a hat and other protective clothing. Sunscreen can only to so far to protect your skin from the sun. Having a layer of clothing over your skin is a much more effective way to prevent freckles from forming. Wear light, airy long-sleeved shirts and pants during the summer to keep cool and protect your skin at the same time.

, Citrus fruits, kiwis, spinach, and other leafy greens are all excellent sources of vitamin C.


Start your day with a burst of vitamin C with a fruit and vegetable smoothie. Add a kiwi, a nectarine, and a cup of raw spinach to your blender. Puree the produce with almond milk or another healthy base.
Vitamin C supplements are another option you can choose to make sure you're getting enough. Take pure vitamin C or a multivitamin that contains it.

Try natural mineral foundation.,
Use a cream foundation.",How to Get Rid of Freckles4," Mineral foundation helps conceal and blend freckles with your natural skin tone. Consult a mineral makeup consultant to determine which foundation color works best for your particular complexion.


Choose a foundation in between your lighter color and the color of your freckles.
Apply the mineral foundation all over with a kabuki brush to get the natural, flawless look mineral makeup is known for.

, This type of foundation is great for people with dry skin. Choose a color slightly lighter than the color of your freckles. Apply the foundation with a cotton ball or makeup applicator, and make sure to blend it well for best results.


Applying a small amount of powder over the foundation helps it set and stay in place all day.
Avoid the temptation to apply more than one layer of foundation. You may end up drawing extra attention to the areas you'd like to cover.

Give yourself time to be stylish.,
Wash your hair and towel it dry until it is damp.,
Straighten your hair for especially curly manes.,
Apply styling mousse to your hair.,
Blow dry your hair to one side of your head.,
Switch hands and blow dry your hair from the opposite side.,
Style your hair with a styling wax.,
Apply your styling gel.,
Accentuate the ridge of your fauxhawk.",How to Get a Fohawk," Though the fauxhawk can be styled in as few as 5 minutes by someone practiced at shaping it, by setting aside ample time you can ensure that your fauxhawk doesn't turn into an oh-no-hawk. Even if this is your first time, you should be able to complete this style in about 10 minutes.You may even want to give yourself an extra 5 minutes leeway, setting aside 15 minutes total for styling. This way, you're not in a rush, and you can take the time you need to make sure you leave the house looking your best.;
, Your hair will be easiest to style while it's still slightly damp from the shower. Additionally, washing before styling cleanses your hair of dirt, oil, and dandruff, all which can make even a stylish head of hair look unappealing.







, Hair that is naturally curly will be more resistant to the hand styling and shaping you'll be doing to form your fauxhawk. But the fauxhawk is still well within your reach! Use a flat iron or straightening products on the hair around the top of your head, leaving the hair on the sides as it is. Now you're ready for mousse!








Straightening your hair can add some time to your fauxhawk styling, especially if you're inexperienced. You may want to give yourself an extra 5 to 10 minutes so you don't run late wherever it is you're headed.

, You only need a small amount to give your hair the lift you'll need when styling your fauxhawk. Spray the mousse into the palm of one hand, rub your hands together lightly to equally distribute the mousse between your hands, and then apply it by combing your fingers through your hair.









Be sure you apply your mousse to all sides of your head. It's easy to miss the shorter hairs on the side or at the back, but missing these areas could give you an irregular look., With one hand point the blow dryer at your head from the side and orient it to face the middle of your head. While the blow dryer is running, use the fingers of your free hand to comb your hair in the direction the blow dryer is blowing - toward the middle of your head.









The hair on the side of your head does not need to be combed toward the middle of your head., Performing the same motion, hold the blow dryer in your opposite hand point it at the middle of your head from that side. Use the fingers of your free hand to comb your hair toward the middle of your head, leaving the hair on the side of your head as it is normally.







, When applying styling wax to your hair, a little goes a long way. A small dab, about the size of a pea, should be enough to create a classy fauxhawk. Rub your hands together to evenly distribute the wax, then use your fingers to tease the hair on both sides of the top of your head inward and upward to form a crest.








Always start with a small amount of styling product. You can always add more if there is a need. However, if you use too much, you'll have to wash your hair and start from scratch, or else your hair might have to spend the day with hair that looks clumpy with product.

, Apply your styling gel to one hand and then rub your hands together to spread the gel evenly between both. Comb the hair on the sides of your head forward, flattening it with your hands as you do so. Then finger comb the back of your hair so it lies flat.







, Use your fingers to tuck loose strands of hair to join the crest at the middle of your head. Then gently push the hair at the top-back of your head forward while guiding it into a more distinct crest shape.









To add texture to your fauxhawk, take small strands of hair between your pointer finger and thumb, then twist the strand upwards."

Keep yourself hydrated.,
Avoid showering more than once a day.,
Use high-quality moisturizing cream on your skin.,
Make a homemade moisturizer.,
Exfoliate (with caution!).",How to Get Rid of Itchy Skin with Home Remedies2," The most common cause of itchy skin is dry skin. The more water you drink, the more water gets absorbed into the skin. The recommendation is to drink at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day.If you are very active or sweat a lot, you will need to drink more water.

, Use lukewarm or cool water and be sure to moisturize your whole body after each shower. Don’t stay in the shower or bath longer than 30 minutes.Many people don’t realize it but showering or bathing actually dries out the skin, especially if you use harsh or heavy soaps. Avoid any soaps that contain dyes, perfumes, or alcohol.Lukewarm water is recommended because water that is too hot can damage the skin by stripping off protective oils that help to keep the skin moisturized.

, Select a moisturizer with as few added chemical ingredients as possible. In so doing, you will reduce your skin’s exposure to chemicals that you may be sensitive to or which may actually worsen the itching.


Avoid products with added alcohol or fragrances. Alcohol can dry out your skin and again, make the itching problem worse. Fragrances, which are often dissolved in alcohol, can do the same.Petroleum jelly is fragrance-free and can often work very well to keep irritated patches moisturized.Studies suggest that creams that include omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful in reducing symptoms of eczema, a condition that causes severe skin itching., You can also make a moisturizing cream yourself. Apply any of the following homemade moisturizers on your face, body, and hands. Let the moisturizer soak in for a few minutes and then wipe or rinse off any excess.



Cream-Avocado-Honey moisturizer - Mix 3 tablespoons of fresh heavy cream, 1/4 fresh avocado and 1 tablespoon of honey in a blender until it is smooth.Shea butter moisturizer - Take 4 ounces of shea butter at room temperature and mash it using a wooden spoon. Add 2 tablespoons of either almond oil or olive oil (whichever you prefer or whichever you have handy). Add 8-10 drops of lavender oil or any scent you prefer (such as lemon, orange, mint or gardenia). Using an electric mixer, mix the ingredients for about 2-4 minutes on high speed or until creamy. Store in a closed glass jar (with lid) in a cool, dark place.Aloe vera-almond oil-chamomile lotion - Mix 1/2 cup of almond oil and 1/2 cup of chamomile tea in a mixer (to make the tea, steep two teabags into 1/2 cup of boiling water for at least 5 minutes). Slowly, at low speed, add one cup of aloe vera gel. Use a spatula to ensure that all the aloe vera gel is mixed in. Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature before mixing. Spoon into a clean, lidded jar and keep in refrigerator. Take out a small amount and warm in your hand and apply to skin.Coconut oil is also helpful for improving your skin’s ability to retain moisture. Apply directly to irritated or itchy skin., The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that you see a dermatologist for a skin evaluation before you exfoliate because not every type of exfoliation works for every skin type.Incorrect or very aggressive or abrasive exfoliation could actually damage your skin, potentially increasing inflammation and itching and aggravating any existing skin conditions. Moreover, how often you exfoliate and what method you use should be determined by your skin type, something a dermatologist can advise on.However, there are still some approaches you could try:


Try dry brushing. This is a traditional Chinese medicine approach that has been shown to remove dead skin cells on the surface of your skin and help increase blood circulation. Use a natural bristle brush with a long handle. Starting at your feet, brush in long, gentle strokes. For large areas such as the torso and back, use a long circular motion. Brush each area 3-4 times, overlapping sections, and covering your entire body. Shower and pat dry, then apply a moisturizer. Do not dry brush on broken skin.Try an exfoliating cloth. These cloths mostly made of finely woven synthetic fibers like nylon, though some natural fibers, such as silk or linen, are also available. Use these gently over your whole body; they're available in various sizes. After use, shower off and pat dry, then apply a moisturizer.
Never scrub your skin. This can actually cause further irritation and itching. Use gentle strokes instead.

Avoid scratching.,
Avoid harsh detergents.,
Wear loose clothing made of natural fibers.,
Avoid using scented personal care products.,
Use a humidifier.,
Take supplements and/or supplement your diet.,
Reduce stress.",How to Get Rid of Itchy Skin with Home Remedies3," While it is easier said than done, avoid scratching as much as possible. Scratching can further irritate the skin by releasing substances such histamine and other cytokines, which increase and spread itching. In addition, the action of scratching an itch causes the brain to release a chemical messenger that intensifies the itch. Also, if the skin is broken because of scratching, the skin can become infected, which will only further irritate the area. Finally, long term scratching can alter the skin’s structure and result in scarring, changes in thickness (lichenification), and skin color (hyperpigmentation).If any area begins itching, use one of the quick treatments above to “spot treat” the area.
Keep your nails short and if you get particularly itchy at night, try wearing gloves to bed in case you have the urge to scratch.

, Use only unscented detergents; some brands even have detergents designed for sensitive skin. In addition, trying putting all your clothes through an extra-rinse cycle to remove any lingering traces of the detergent.


In addition, you may also want to consider using all-natural or organic cleaning products that minimize added chemicals., For example, try to wear pure, 100% cotton clothing as much as possible, especially for undergarments. Cotton is hypoallergenic and a natural fiber without added chemicals, thus decreasing the likelihood of adverse skin reactions and irritation.Cotton and linen also allow your skin to breathe, enabling sweat to evaporate and air to flow through it. As an added bonus, cotton is easier to wash, dry, and maintain than many other fabrics.
Other fabrics made of natural fibers include linen, hemp, silk, and silk.Be careful with wool, though, as many people find it irritates, rather than soothes, the skin., Avoid using perfumes, soaps, lotions, shampoos, and any other personal care or beauty products with fragrances and added chemicals. In many people, these products irritate the skin and worsen itching symptoms.Use mild soaps made with plant glycerine-- these can be found in most pharmacies and grocery stores. Examples of popular brands include Clearly Natural, Pears, and Sappo Hill. These soaps will not irritate or dry out the skin. Glycerine is a non-toxic, odorless, colorless thick gel used for centuries to moisturize and clean skin.Always be sure to completely rinse soap off of your body and apply moisturizer after using soap., A humidifier will help ensure that the air is not too dry, which can dry out your skin and cause itchiness.If you don't have a humidifier, don't rush out to buy one. You can make a DIY-humidifier right at home! Put bowls of water around the room -- make sure to place them out of the way of small children and pets. During colder months, place the water bowls near the heat source. In the warmer months, leave them near windows and exposed to full sun. This will help the water more efficiently evaporate and humidify the air.
Check your humidifier, whether commercial or homemade. Make sure it is always full of water.
Routinely clean your humidifier according to its instruction manual. The moist environment allows bacteria, mold, and mildew to thrive if it is not cleaned regularly.

, Consult your physician before you take or add anything to your diet. While vitamins, minerals and most supplements are generally safe when used according to directions, there are supplements that can cause side effects, particularly if you are taking any medications. The following may be useful supplements to consider taking in pill form or adding to your diet:


Plant polyphenols (flavonoids). Flavonoids such as quercetin and rutin are natural anti-histamines and help to protect against DNA-damage.The typical dosage of quercetin is 250-500mg and 500-1000mg for rutin.
Vitamin A. Vitamin A is needed for healthy skin and is present in high concentrations in sweet potatoes, beef liver, spinach, fish, milk, eggs, and carrots. Most people, however, have a difficult time getting enough vitamin A just from their diet, so you may want to consider a pill supplement as well.Vitamin B. The B vitamins are also necessary for healthy skin. It is easiest to take a B-complex vitamin containing all the B vitamins, but you can also get vitamin B from chickpeas, fish, and poultry.Omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important in maintaining moist skin and also help to reduce inflammation. Omega-3 supplements and vitamins can be purchased at any health food store or drug store. Leafy greens, nuts and fatty fish (like salmon and mackerel) are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids., Because of its effect on our hormones, stress can worsen itching so it may be useful to consider different stress management techniques, such as meditation, yoga, and exercise."

Use calamine lotion.,
Make an oatmeal poultice.,
Make a baking soda poultice.",How to Get Rid of Itchy Skin with Home Remedies4," Calamine lotion contains zinc oxide, a form of iron oxide, ferric oxide and/or zinc carbonate. It has been used for decades as relief for itching due to various causes, including poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, sunburn, insect bites, insect stings. It can also be used to prevent skin infections resulting from excessive scratching.Calamine lotion can be purchased inexpensively at drugstores and pharmacies.

, A poultice is a soft, moist mass of material, generally of mashed up herbs and other plant material or flour. The poultice is applied to the body directly and usually kept in place with a cloth.Measure out 1 cup of colloidal oatmeal and use a coffee grinder or blender to grind it into a slightly coarse powder. Add just enough warm water to make a thick paste and apply it to the poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac rash, the sunburn or any insect bites or stings.

After all the spikes are up, blow dry your hair even more.",How to Liberty Spike Your Hair," It is recommended to have hair at least to your eyes in the front, possibly longer in the back, so that your spikes will be as durable and in-your-face as possible. Longer hair in the back is recommended because the spikes in the sides and back of your head stick out horizontally and won't be as noticeable. Since the intense styling required to keep that fierce hairdo up may stunt its growth, grow your mane out before you do any other steps.;
, While you are spiking it, use the pictures as a reference. Look at these closely, they are your best guide as to how it should look. Jorge, from the band The Casualties, has had a great head of liberty spikes at least once. So has Benji Madden from Good Charlotte, though. You may want to do a Google image search on one of them or on ""liberty spikes"", ""liberty spiked hair"", etc.

, Most commercially available hair styling products don't have enough strength to hold your hair in liberty spikes for any reasonable amount of time. Other ""products"", namely things like Knox brand gelatin, school glue (preferably the clear kind) and supposedly egg whites are much better for keeping hair up. The thing with Knox gelatin is that you have to mix it perfectly or chunks of it will be left behind.

, Free it from any tangles and crap. Make sure you have a clean head because oily hair doesn't seem to cooperate as well.

, You don't have to, but it sure makes it a lot easier if you do.

, Before there is any adhesive in your hair, you can rearrange or resize them all you want. Make them so they are all over your head, are of even size, and are thick enough to stay standing. Proportion is key.

Okay yeah well, get a comb and at the base of the about to be spike comb it downwards and then upwards (for those that don't know how to tease hair). Teasing helps it stay up. You'll know when you're done because when you let go of your hair, the teased section should stick up. The teasing creates a strong base. Do not tease anymore than an inch of your spike.

, Start at the bottom, closest to your scalp, and work your way up. Pay special attention to the base, as it is what keeps the spike standing, but make sure to get the whole spike very well.

, It will most likely not be anywhere near completely dry, but should stay up on its own now.

, Once again, they should be all over your head, long, and thick.

, If they aren't (they don't look like they could stab someone) put a little water on the top and apply more product, twisting just enough to make the hairs come together.

, Even though the instructions may say against it, the blow dryer should be within a few inches or almost touching your hair. If you use Knox gelatin as a product, use the ""cool"" setting so it will strengthen as quickly as possible.

, You’ll want your hair to be light and fluffy for the actual styling, and blow drying will help create some volume. Make sure that your hair is free from any knots and tangles by running a comb through it as you blow dry., If your hair is still flat without enough body to support a hawk, run a comb backwards against the grain of your hair to give it a little more texture.

, Hairspray will form the basis of the hold for you style, but gel is only for the tips of your liberty spikes or outside edge of your mohawk. While gel gives a lot of hold to shorter styles, it's too heavy to use as a main product, and will cause your mohawk or liberty spikes to fall over.

, If you haven't already shaved the sides of your hair, you're going to need to do this for a real mohawk. You'll need clippers, the right size guard, and some rubber bands or masking tape.

, Visualize the strip that will be left behind and what will be shaved. Make sure the strip is wide enough to support the finished style, usually about 2-3 inches in width, centered on your head.


If your hair is shorter use tape to mark off where you want the mohawk: put the tape anywhere that you want hair to be left.If your hair is long, try using rubber bands. Use a comb to section off the hair that will make up your mohawk, then rubber band all of it into small ponytails or buns where the clippers can’t reach it.

, Test the guard size to make sure it's the right length, then adjust if it's too long. Start shaving against the grain, starting with the front and moving to the back of your head. Shaving the front will be easy because you can see it as you shave, but for the back you’ll either need help, or a mirror positioned behind you., No one likes itchy hairs all over, and washing will give you a chance to get rid of any hairs that are still clinging to your scalp. Once you’re done, return to the mirror and check to see that your cuts are straight and everything looks good. Blow dry again, then get ready to style.

, Pick up a section in the middle of your head with your non-dominant hand. Keep holding the section and don’t move.

, Spray deep into the roots and throughout the top. Don’t be worried about using too much product: your hair will feel wet and sticky, but you're going to blow dry it soon. The bottom of your hair is going to hold the weight, so you want it to be extra stiff.

, You’re already holding the hair with your non-dominant hand, so set down the hair spray and pick up the blow dryer with your dominant hand. While keeping your hair held tight, blow dry until you feel the hair becoming stiff. Let go after 30-45 seconds., Move towards the back of your head and pick up the section of hair directly behind of the one standing up. Hold it with your non-dominant hand again, and make sure it lines up with the section in front of it. Hair spray it, again paying special attention to the roots of your hair.

, Using the same technique as the last section of hair, blow dry the section of hair again. As it firms up, use your free hand to adjust the two sections to meet: you don’t want any gaps in your mohawk.

, Use the same technique again for the final sections of your mohawk: lifting, spraying and then blow drying. But while you can see the front in the mirror, the back is a little trickier to manage. Position a mirror behind you, or take frequent breaks as you’re styling to check out the hawk from the side., Use the same technique for each section of hair: lift, spray and blow dry. Don’t change your technique for any of the sections, even if your hands get tired from so much lifting. Take a break if you feel your arms getting fatigued.

, When you’re finished, check the mohawk out from both sides and make any adjustments that you need to. If there are big gaps or open holes in your hair, carefully close the sections together, apply more hairspray, and blow dry again. Repeat for any remaining gaps. Use some gel to solidify and connect the outside edge of your mohawk if you want.

, Once the hair is dry, you’ll want to decide how big you want your spikes to be: 2-3 inches is the norm. It’s really up to personal preference, but you’ll also want to make sure that the base of the spike can support the weight of the hair.Using a comb and rubber bands, make a clean part to section off each spike and then rubber band it to keep it separated.

, Take your comb and run it against the grain of your hair, from the top of the spike to the bottom. If you tease too much and you end up with a ball of hair near your scalp, twist it back into a spiked shape., Undo the rubber band, then lift the section up in the direction that you want it to face. Some wearers of liberty spikes have the first spike pointing straight up from their forehead, while others prefer it to be angled downwards. Once you’ve decided which you prefer, hold the hair out with your non-dominant hand and apply hair spray with your dominant hand. Apply extra spray to the base, then spray up along the length of the spike.

, Set down the spray and pick up the blow dryer with your free hand. Blow dry along the length of the spike and straight into the base as well. When you feel the spray begin to set, after about 30 seconds, let go and continue drying for an extra few seconds., As with the first spike, comb your hair downwards to give it more texture and body, then sculpt it back up into the spiked shape you want. This will help it hold the spray better and have more structure on its own.

, Continue with the same steps all the way to the back of your hair. Unband the section, tease it, lift it, then spray and blow dry.

, Once you get to your final few spikes, it might be hard to see what you’re doing. Position a mirror behind your head so that it reflects the back of your head to your main mirror, or turn your head every once in a while to look as you spray.

, While it’s harder to adjust liberty spikes than a mohawk once you’re done, you’ll still be able to see which spikes are angled the wrong way. If they are, comb as much of the product out as you can, then lift it to the right angle. Re-apply the hair spray and blow dry again. Repeat your adjustments as necessary.

, If you want the tips of your liberty spikes to be extra pointy, apply a bit of hair gel to the ends. This will keep them from separating and give your style a little more of an edge."

Talk with a dermatologist about different types of treatment.,
Prepare your skin for treatment.,
Take note of potential side effects.,
Stay out of the sun after you've undergone the treatment.,
Examine your skin for more broken capillaries.",How to Get Rid of Broken Capillaries on Your Face1," Laser treatment uses a concentrated beam of energy to heat the capillaries under the skin, targeting each one individually to successfully remove them. Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy is similar, but targets a broader area. Your dermatologist will work with you to decide which treatment (or combination of both) will be most effective in your situation.


When you meet with the dermatologist, ask a lot of questions. Make sure the person has conducted the procedure before with satisfactory results.It's best to choose the dermatologist you go with on someone else's recommendation. Make sure you trust the person to use the procedure that's right for you.;
, You should not receive these treatments while you have a tan or if your skin is irritated; lasers and IPL target the pigment in capillaries and brown spots, and if your skin is dark in color, they won't be able to ""see"" the places they're supposed to target. In addition to making sure your skin is as pigment-free as possible, follow any other instructions from your dermatologist leading up to the day of the appointment.

, Both laser and IPL treatments can lead to minor redness and swelling of the skin for several days after treatment. You'll want to schedule your appointment several weeks in advance of important social events so your face has time to return to its normal state.


In rare cases, laser and IPL treatments can lead to skin damage and hyperpigmentation. This is more common in people with darker skin than those with fair skin. Be sure to discuss all the possible side effects with your dermatologist before proceeding with the treatments.

, Your skin needs time to heal after treatment, so you should stay out of the sun for several days. Closely follow the after-care instructions given to you by your dermatologist to ensure your skin heals properly.

, Sometimes it takes more than one treatment to get rid of all of the broken capillaries. The capillaries removed by your laser or IPL treatment will never return, but if your skin is especially prone to getting broken capillaries, you may have to get laser treatments every once in a while to clear things up.

Understand why skin itches.,
Determine the cause of itchy skin.,
Assess your symptoms.,
See a doctor.",How to Get Rid of Itchy Skin with Home Remedies5," There are specific nerves that carry information about different bodily sensations (like an itch) to the brain. When these nerves are stimulated, they release various chemical messengers called cytokines that activate nearby nerves. Histamine is an example of a cytokine that is responsible for itching in allergic reactions. Once more and more nerves get stimulated, the messages bombard the brain, and the brain responds with directions to scratch.Itchiness, also known as pruritus, can be accompanied by and result in redness, bumps, and other kinds of rashes on the skin. In other cases, there are no changes in the skin.

, Itchiness can have a variety of causes that range from mild and temporary insect bites to specific skin conditions (e.g. eczema or psoriasis) to more serious medical conditions, such as liver and kidney disease.The main causes of itchy skin include:Dry Skin - One of the most common causes of itchy skin is dry skin, which can be due to environmental factors (e.g., indoor heating or cooling, low humidity or too many baths or showers with drying cleaning agents) or inadequate amounts of water.

Skin Conditions - Eczema (atopic dermatitis) and psoriasis are common skin conditions typically accompanied by itching, reddened and irritated skin, bumps and blisters. Sunburns can be itchy as well.

Viral and Fungal Infections - Infections like chicken pox, measles, shingles, and genital and anal herpes can cause the body to feel very itchy.

Parasites - Pubic and head lice are itchy infestations by tiny wingless insects called lice.

Diseases - Liver disease is often accompanied by moderate to intense pruritus. Other conditions where itchy skin appears include certain blood disorders (e.g., iron deficiency anemia, polycythemia vera, etc.), cancer (such as leukemia and lymphoma), and thyroid disease.

Allergic reactions - Allergic reactions to insect bites, pollen, toxins from plants, cosmetics, personal products, and foods can cause mild to severe itching. Rashes caused by a contact dermatitis (a rash that results from skin contact with a substance or allergen) can be very itchy.

Adverse reactions to drugs - Skin reactions ranging from mild to severe itching are relatively common side effects of certain medications, including antibiotics, anti-fungal agents and some pain medications.

Nervous disorders - Conditions such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis affect the nerves and can result in an itchy sensation.

Pregnancy - Itchiness is often a “side effect” of pregnancy. The itchy areas are usually on the abdomen, breasts, thighs and arms.

, It's important to determine whether you are simply suffering from dry skin or are experiencing another skin condition, like hives or a rash, that may be related to an allergic reaction or other medical condition. Dry skin is most common on your lower legs, stomach, arms, and thighs, and is characterized by scaling, itching and cracking of the skin.It is recommended that you consult your physician if you see any markings on the skin that may be indicative of something more serious than regular dry skin, including unexplainable or persistent rashes or hives.


Rashes are characterized by bumps on the skin, skin discoloration, scaling and blisters. Common rashes include poison ivy, heat rash, hives, and eczema. Non-infectious rashes can generally be treated with over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams, while oral antihistamines can help you relieve the itching. However, if you have a new and unexplainable rash, a fever or the rash lasts for more than a few days, you should seek your doctor.Hives are characterized by slightly raised, pink or red swellings or dots on the skin that may be singular or connected in a group.Hives usually indicate an allergic reaction to certain foods, medicines, insect bites, pollen, and allergy shots. Other potential causes of hives include fungal and bacterial infections, stress, contact with chemicals, and exposure to sun, heat, cold, or water, among others. For most people, hives are not serious. If you suspect an allergic reaction is at work, your doctor can perform an allergy test and prescribe treatment (usually an antihistamine).
If you have hives and cannot breath, get emergency help right away as this suggests the allergic reaction is severe., If the itchiness is widespread, has no known cause and/or is not relieved within 2-3 days of trying the different remedies available above, make an appointment to see a physician to determine the cause of the itching and the best course of treatment for you.If you have prolonged hives and/or rashes, talk to your doctor.Medical diagnosis always depends on the underlying cause which can usually be determined by physical examination, a careful and complete medical history, and a variety of lab tests and imaging. In some cases, a small sample of skin may be taken in a biopsy so that the skin can be examined under a microscope. Most cases of skin itchiness are due at least in part to skin dryness and can be relieved even as the underlying cause takes time to be determined.

If you’re planning to use clippers to achieve this cut, ensure that your hair is dry, as wet hair can clog your clippers.


You can get your hair wet by washing it or simply by spraying it down with some water. If you spray it down with water, ensure that it’s fully saturated and that there are no dry patches.;
, Your hair needs to be well-combed so that you can properly section it off and part it.

, Skip this step if you’ll be cutting your hair with scissors. If you’re cutting your hair with scissors, you’ll want it to be wet. If you’re cutting it with clippers, you’ll need to dry it first otherwise you’ll risk clogging the blade.

, How wide the center section (hawk) will be depends on your face shape and personal taste. Use the eyes as a gauge. Generally the center section of a faux hawk cut (i.e. the hawk/raised bit) spreads from outer eye to outer eye, or from center eye to center eye.Experiment with different widths to see what looks best on your face.
If you have long hair, tie it back in a ponytail so that your sides look clipped, then hold the center part over your head or twist and clip it on top of your head. This should give you an idea of what you might look like.

, To separate the sections, use a comb and, moving from your front hairline (forehead) to the bottom-back of your head (the nape of your neck), carve out a C-shape. The C starts at your front hairline and ends at the nape of your neck.


The exact size and shape of the side sections will depend on the width of your center section, which will run vertically from your front hairline to the nape of your neck.
Work on keeping the center section the same width all the way down as you draw your C curve on each side of the head. The curve should come quite naturally as your comb inclines up towards your crown and then down towards the nape of your neck.
Do this on both sides of your head to make 2 equal side sections and the 1 section on top, which will be the peak of your hawk.

, You should now have 2 C-shaped parts: 1 on either side of your head. Make sure that the lines are clean and not jagged.

, To ensure that you don’t accidentally cut the center section of hair as you trim your sides, clip it down. If you don’t have hair clips, you can use elastics if your hair is long enough, or you can use hair pins.

, You can use scissors or clippers to cut the sides of your hair, and then you’ll want to move to scissors for the top. Clippers will generally give you a closer, less textured-looking cut than scissors.If you’re cutting a faux hawk yourself, you may be best off using the clippers method as it will be difficult to see the back of your head well enough to cut your hair with scissors— not to mention you’ll risk cutting your fingers.
If you do use clippers and you don't want the sides of your to just be one length, you can use a mixture of clippers and scissors to do a blended fade. This involves using 3 levels of clipper guards and then blending the lines with scissors.

, Unless you’re accustomed to cutting your own hair, and you have good mirrors that allow you to see the back of your head as you work on it, you may want to use clippers for this.


Even if you don’t accidentally cut your fingers, you might end up with an uneven cut if you can’t properly see what you’re doing.
If you would prefer to use scissors to cut the side sections of your hair, consider asking a friend to help you out.

, As you cut the side sections, you’ll move from the front of your hairline to the back (face to neck) in vertical strips. To get a sense of what this means, hold a comb vertically against your head — it should be parallel to your face, not perpendicular to it.


You’ll move from one vertical strip to another until you’ve completed the entire side section, and then you’ll move to the other side.

, For each vertical section that you cut, you’ll hold the hair between the pointer and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand, at a 90-degree angle from your head. Pretend your two fingers are a pair of scissors, and hold the hair between them.


Some stylists recommend positioning your non-dominant hand so that your thumb is pointing outward in the direction that you are moving (in this case, towards the back of your head).

For a right-handed stylist, this means your left hand’s fingers should be pointing upward on the left side of your head as you cut with your right.



, There are two ways to cut those vertical sections of hair as you move along the C curve towards the back of your head:


For thin or normal hair, you can get away with cutting all of the hair at the same distance from the head. To get a sense of what this means, hold the flat side of a comb against the head and then move it outward between 1 and 2 inches, keeping the comb completely vertical — not tilting in or out. This is how you will move down a vertical section of normal hair when cutting it.
If hair is quite thick, you may want to cut it shorter to longer moving from top to bottom. To get a sense of the direction in which you'd cut, hold the flat side of a comb next the head, pull it out from the head between 1 and 2 inches, and tilt the top of the comb slightly inward. This is how you will move down the vertical section of thick hair when cutting it.

, Do the same for both sides, cutting in vertical sections moving front to back.

, Before moving to the back of your head, you’ll want to clean up the hair around your ears. If you don’t have sideburns, this will just involve trimming any hair that hangs over your ears so that you’ve got a clean line.


If you have sideburns, use a comb to brush the hair in one direction and then trim it so there’s a clean line; then, brush the hair in the other direction and trim it again.
If your sideburns are quite thick, you can brush them up with a comb and slightly trim the tops of them. Just make sure that there are no bald patches in your sideburns before doing this, otherwise you might make them more obvious.

, Once the sides are done, you can trim up the lower back section that starts at the crown of your head and goes down to the nape of your neck.


You may need to give it a quick comb-through if it’s tangled.

, Hold strips of hair between the pointer and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand, pull them away from your head at 90 degrees, and then tilt them in slightly toward the center line of your head, then cut into them.


Once again, you’ll move down the strip from top to bottom, going either shorter to longer if you have thick hair, or all one length if you have fine to normal hair.
This time you needn’t worry as much about the strips of hair being perfectly vertical, as you’ll be texturing your hair.

, Once your back and sides are done, you’re ready to cut the top center section of your hair, aka the hawk!

, For a faux hawk you’ll likely want the sides of your hair to gradually go from shorter to longer until they read the top center of your head. To achieve this, you’ll want to do a graded cut using 3 guard sizes.Unless you already know what sizes you want, consider starting with a #2 (1/4-inch) guard for the bottom, a #3 (3/8-inch) guard for the middle, and a #4 (1/2-inch) guard for the top of the side sections of your hair.

, As you approach the top center section of your hair (the part of your hair that will become the faux hawk), rock your hand outward and lift the clippers away from your scalp.


Do this as slowly and smoothly as possible to avoid making any mistakes.

, Use the #3 guard to cut from the bottom of your hair up, but this time stop and rock the clippers away from your scalp at roughly 1/4 of the distance from your bottom hairline to the outer edge of your hawk.

, Again working from the bottom up, run the razor along your scalp and then rock it away as your reach the lower tier of where you want to be — this just depends on your own tastes.

, With a #1 guard on your razor, clean up around the edges of your hairline.

, Right now you should see clearly defined sections where you’ve clipped your hair using different guards. To blend the sections, gently comb the hair upward at the border where one section moves into another, then gently glide either scissors or clippers along the comb to remove the hair that sticks out.


Do this around your entire head until everything looks blended.

, Comb it vertically down the center of your head, towards your face. This is the direction in which you’ll cut it.


Again you’ll be cutting in vertical strips, but this time the up-down direction will be from your crown to your forehead.

, Beginning with one side of your head, comb down the outermost strip of hair that runs from your crown to your forehead. Line it up with the the hair on the side of your head and cut along it, from the back to the front of your head.

, When working on layers of the center strip of your hair, don’t try to cut each layer the same length. You want them to go from shorter on the outside to longest at the center-top of your head, which will be the peak of your hawk.


To ensure you’re cutting correctly, comb each layer of hair over so that it lies flat on your head, and then cut it even with the first layer you cut.
Make sure that you’re cutting each layer as it lies flat on your head. This is different from your previous cuts, in which you held the hair out from the head.
The hair must lie flat on your head, otherwise you’ll risk cutting all layers the same length, which you don’t want for the center part of your head.

, Once you’ve cut from the outside to the center part, move to the other side of your head and do the same there — moving from the outermost strip of hair in towards the part.

, Once you’ve finished cutting both sides of your center piece, work through the top part of your hair. You can now cut into your hair randomly to suit your own tastes.


Grab small sections of your hair between your pointer and middle fingers, and cut into them with scissors. Cut down at an angle instead of straight across; this will give you more of a textured, fun look., If your hair is looking chunky and thick, consider taking some sections between your fingers and cutting very lightly into them while holding the scissors vertically pointing down towards your scalp.


When doing this, don’t cut the entire chunk of hair — just a few snips into the section of hair that you hold between your fingers will be fine.
If the back is still quite full, you can do what is called “channel cutting”, which involves running the scissors through the hair at a diagonal angle as you cut. This can be particularly helpful at the back of your hair, particularly if you have trouble reaching back there, as you only need one hand for channel cutting (the one holding the scissors).

, Once you’re happy with the top, move around the sides and back and make little adjustments as you see fit.


One way to easily add some texture is to gently twist a chunk of hair and then, holding the scissors at a diagonal angle, gently running them against the hair twist to add some texture.
Don’t close the scissors completely over the twist, otherwise you’ll just cut the chunk of hair off instead of giving it a pointy, razored look.

, To get the faux hawk look, move your hands through the center top part of your hair swiftly and in an upward motion.


If the sides of your hair are still a bit long, you can use the styling product to tame them down a bit by pushing them forwards or backwards.
A common tip from stylists when applying product is to start at the back of your hair. That way if you use too much product, your hair won’t look overly greasy.

When your skin is weak, capillaries are more likely to become dilated and visible on the surface of your skin. Be sure to wear sunscreen each time you go out in the sun. In strong sun, wear a hat and sunglasses for extra protection.The sun's UV rays can cause damage in the winter, not just the summer. Wear sunscreen all year round.
Avoid windburn as well. Wear a scarf around your face if you know you'll be exposed to high winds.

, Many have reported that consuming alcohol increases the number of broken capillaries on the skin. The alcohol causes the skin to become red and to swell slightly, leading to a higher instance of damage. Be sure not to overindulge in alcohol, and switch drinks if you notice one in particular causing unflattering results. Red wine, in particular, is said to cause inflammation.

, The circulatory system is quite responsive to temperature changes. Your capillaries constrict and expand depending on the temperature, and extreme temperatures can cause more broken capillaries to occur. When you must be exposed to extreme heat or cold, be sure to protect your face so it doesn't come into direct contact with freezing cold or very hot air.


At home, keep the thermostat steady so the temperature in your house doesn't rise or fall too much.
Use lukewarm water when you wash your face, rather than using very hot or very cold water.

The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a broad spectrum sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection, and that is at least SPF 30 or higher. The sunscreen should also be water resistant., Some exposure to the sun allows the skin to manufacture an important vitamin, vitamin D. To get the right amount, you should get moderate exposure of the face, arms, legs, or back from the summer sun for about five to 30 minutes. This can be done between the hours of 10 AM and 3 PM at least twice a week without sunscreen if you have darker or already tanned skin.If you are lighter skinned, avoid getting into the sun during peak hours and instead allow some moderate exposure to the sun outside of the peak sun hours to supply the needed Vitamin D without significantly increasing the risk of skin damage or skin cancer.


The New Zealand dermatology association suggests that lighter skinned individuals can spend five minutes in the sun before 11AM and after 4 PM, which are the peak sun hours. Because of the light tone of their skin, lighter skinned individuals achieve healthy levels of Vitamin D during this time period. Darker skinned individuals can spend 20 minutes outside the peak hours and achieve healthy levels of Vitamin D.The American Academy of Dermatology does not recommend any sun exposure other than the incidental exposure you might get by getting your mail, walking your dog, going between your parked car and your office, or any other normal, everyday activity.Sunscreen does decrease the amount of Vitamin D production, but the benefits of protecting the skin are important to understand.

, There are also food sources of Vitamin D, including fish and fish oil, yogurt, cheese, liver, and eggs.

#*You can also try other foods and drinks that are fortified with Vitamin D, such as breakfast cereals, milk, and juice., When dealing with your skin and the sun, it is important to understand the risks of skin cancer so you can avoid them as much as possible.

, Sun damage not only heightens your risk of skin cancer but also makes your skin more susceptible to lines, wrinkles, and unevenness. To keep your skin healthy and beautiful, use an SPF 30 sunscreen daily, wear hats and protective clothing, wear sunglasses, and stick to the shade.The sun causes the most skin damage between 10am and 2pm, so you should be especially careful at that time of day.

, Smokers develop more lines and wrinkles than nonsmokers.Smoking slows the ability of the body to repair wounds, which can lead to scarring.Nicotine constricts blood vessels as well, which doesn't allow your skin to renew itself properly. Plus the expressions smokers make (such as pursing their lips) lead to extra wrinkles around the lips.Stop smoking as soon as you can to allow your skin to recover its youthful, healthy appearance.


There are many other reasons to quit smoking too: smoking increases the likelihood of cancer--including skin cancers.This isn't just a beauty issue; it is also a health issue.

, Your diet affects the appearance of your skin.Foods that raise blood sugar can lead to acne, wrinkles, and irritation.Sugary foods can even reduce skin elasticity, leading to sagging.Stay away from processed foods that are full of white flour and added sugars.


Staying away from junk foods is easier if you keep lots of delicious, healthy options in your home. For example, ripe berries can satisfy your craving for sweets, and roasted almonds can satisfy your craving for crunch. Consider incorporating fruits and vegetables into your daily life by adding them to your favorite foods such as oatmeal, pizza, or sandwiches. The more you fill up on healthy foods, the less you will crave unhealthy junk., Foods that are rich in anti-oxidants are an important part of a healthy diet. These foods include whole fruits and vegetables, and they are often brightly colored. For example, blueberries, dark leafy greens, nuts, and carrots are all excellent foods to preserve your skin.Not only are these foods generally healthy but they may also help reduce the free radicals in your system, minimizing skin damage., There are links between stress and skin appearance. Stress can make you more susceptible to acne breakouts, wrinkles, and bags under the eyes.Staying relaxed will also help keep you from frowning, which can cause unsightly wrinkles.If you have trouble handling the stress in your life, consider:


Meditation. Meditation can help you minimize stress and regain balance in your life.
Taking a walk outside. Moving around in nature for 20-30 minutes--especially on sunny days--can help make you feel more relaxed and happy.But because you want to avoid sun damage at all costs, be sure that you wear sunscreen, wear a hat and UV protective clothing, and stay in the shade as much as possible. If you walk outside before 10a.m. and after 2p.m. you are also less likely to experience sun damage.Breathing deeply. Find a quiet spot in your home where you can sit comfortably and with good posture. Practice breathing slowly through your nose, holding your breath for a few seconds, and then breathing slowly out through your mouth. Do this for 10 minutes every morning to regain your focus and shed stress., A toned body will make your skin appear more youthful and less saggy.Some studies also show that people who exercise have healthier, more youthful skin.It is unclear how much you need to exercise to get more youthful skin. In general, however, it is recommended that you get at least 75 minutes of strenuous aerobic activity per week and do strength training twice a week.Strenuous aerobic activities include running, swimming, and biking. You can get similar benefits from spending twice as much time doing lower-impact aerobic activities such as 150 minutes of walking per week.
Be sure that you shower and wash your face after exercise: sweat can irritate the skin and lead to clogged pores.

, Drinking 8 glasses of water each day can help make your skin feel less tight, dry, and flaky. While the precise links between hydration and skin appearance are unclear, staying hydrated is good for overall health and certainly cannot hurt your skin., The idea of ""beauty sleep"" is not a total myth. Not getting enough sleep can lead to skin sagging, bags under the eyes, discoloration, and signs of aging.The skin repairs itself overnight, which means you need to give your body time to heal and recover as you rest. Try to sleep at least 7-8 hours per night to give your skin a youthful glow.If you are having trouble sleeping at night, be sure that you:


Have a set bedtime routine that you go through each night.
Avoid bright screens--such as phones, televisions, and computers--before bed.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the evening hours.
Have a cool, quiet, dark place where you sleep.

, There are ways that you can reduce the size and redness of pimples without resorting to makeup. In fact, makeup can sometimes worsen acne. If you have an unwanted zit, you can try:


Applying a cold compress or ice cube. The cold might help reduce the redness and inflammation of a breakout.
Applying a green tea bag. Green tea extract may be able to help reduce the size of a pimple.Using a tea tree oil ointment. Tea tree oil has naturally antibiotic properties and can help prevent the spread of acne.Using preventive measures. The most effective way to minimize a pimple is not to get one in the first place. Keep your skin cleansed, moisturized, and free of irritants in order to look good without makeup.

, Eczema (aka atopic dermatitis) causes dry, flaky, itchy skin. There are many ways you can reduced eczema flareups and soothe your dry, red skin without resorting to makeup. For example you can:


Take an oatmeal bath. Soaking in a bath along with baking soda and uncooked oatmeal can soothe irritated skin and reduce the redness caused by eczema.Keep your skin moisturized. Use moisturizer twice a day, use a humidifier at home, and apply wet compresses to affected areas.All of these techniques will keep your skin moisturized and will prevent you from scratching your skin, which worsens the condition. Make sure that your moisturizer does not have any fragrance or salicylic acid--these chemicals can exacerbate your condition.Talk to your doctor about corticosteroids. Cortisone cream and oral corticosteroids can help stop the itching and reduce flare-ups of eczema.There can be side effects, however, and many of these medications are not sold over-the-counter. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist about whether a prescription-strength corticosteroid is the right choice for your condition.

, Rosacea is a condition that leads to unwanted redness and bumps on the skin. It has no permanent cure, but it can be medically managed.The most important thing to do is to avoid the triggers that make rosacea worse, such as sun damage, alcohol, fragrance, and exfoliating scrubs.It is also helpful to take lukewarm showers instead of hot showers so that your skin is protected.Topical antibiotics such as metronidazole might also be helpful in clearing up mild rosacea.Talk to your doctor about possible medications.

Protect your skin against the sun.,
Avoid the sunlight altogether.",How to Get Porcelain Skin1," Even when it's overcast, ultraviolet A and B (UVA and UVB) rays pass directly through the clouds. Harmful UV rays from the sun can damage your porcelain complexion and cause dark marks and freckles and early signs of aging, and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Wear sun screen. Look for one that says ""broad-spectrum,"" meaning it protects against both UVA and UVB rays, and make sure it has a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Reapply every few hours if you plan to be continuously in the sun long stretches of time.
If you go swimming, try applying sunscreen at least half an hour before you get in, so it has time to soak into your skin before you swim and doesn't just dissolve into the water. When you get out, make sure to reapply.;
, Sun screen prevents most damage, but the surest way to keep your skin from wilting in the sun is to stay out of it completely. This may be impossible sometimes if you're outside, but there are many ways to cover up.


Seek shade where you can find it. Look for an awning or umbrella or a bench under a tree, or retreat indoors until the sun lets up. The sun is strongest between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Shade may be scarce on sunny days, in which case you should either wear a hat or carry an umbrella.

Put a fresh bandage on every day.",How to Get Rid of a Scab1," Before you can properly dress a wound or scab, it should be dry. If your wound is oozing blood, place some sterile gauze on it. If it soaks through the gauze, don’t remove it. Just place another layer of gauze on top.Keep the gauze in place until the wound stops oozing.;
, Even if your wound has already started to scab over, it’s important to keep it clean. This helps it heal faster. Wash the site with soap and warm water, then rinse. Lightly pat it dry., While old ways assumed that keeping a scab dry helped it heal faster, modern research says keeping it moist is best. Slather a layer of petroleum jelly all over and around the scab after you have cleaned it.You can also use antibacterial ointment instead of petroleum jelly, but this isn’t necessary for most wounds.

, Immediately after moistening the scab, cover it in a sterile adhesive bandage (band-aid or plaster). You can also use silicone gel sheets (look for these at a pharmacy), or gauze wrap, especially if you’re dealing with a big scab., While you’re waiting for the scab to heal, take time to remove the bandage each day and clean the site. Moisten the scab again and cover it with a new bandage.The scab still won’t disappear instantly, but this will definitely speed up the healing process.

However, you want to wash your skin gently to avoid irritating it. Simply use your fingers to gently rub in a non-irritating cleanser and then rinse it off with cool or warm water.








With skin cleanliness in mind, try to avoid touching your face throughout the day. Touching your face transfers dirt and grime onto your face. This can cause breakouts.;
, Once you have cleaned your face, apply a moisturizer to replenish it. Pick a moisturizer that is right for your skin type. If you have oily skin, you will want a moisturizer that is really light as well as non-comedogenic. If you have super dry skin, you will want a moisturizer that is a bit thicker.








Apply moisturizer right after you wash your face, while your face is still a bit moist. This will help to trap in the water, hydrating your skin even more.Use a moisturizer on your face that contains sunscreen, so that you get double protection. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a sunscreen with an SPF of 30., Toners, exfoliants, and astringents can be too harsh on many people's skin, causing more damage than help. For example, exfoliating your face can remove dead skin cells and brighten your complexion, but it can also irritate your skin. Instead, a regular practice of gentle cleansing should keep your skin in tip top shape without having to strip your skin.








If a product immediately burns or irritates your face, take it off immediately. This is a sign that it is too harsh.
If you feel like you really need to exfoliate, try a gentle one. For example, use an exfoliant with a soft silicone exfoliator pad, as opposed to the rough seeds, husks, or pits used in many exfoliants. This will be more gentle on the skin. However, gently rubbing a gentle cleanser onto your skin with a washcloth is probably all you actually need., If you have a breakout in a specific area, cleaning the area with a gentle cleanser and then treating it with an over-the-counter medication is often the best course of action. Choose an acne medication that is gentle on the skin and is formulated for your specific type of skin, whether it is oily, dry, or sensitive.









For example, medications with salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or alpha hydroxy acids are often useful for people with moderate acne breakouts.Use “non-comedogenic,” “non-acnegenic” and oil-free cosmetics, toiletries and sunscreens., There are a whole range of specialized creams that you'll also want to add to your inventory if you want perfect skin. For example, serums are perfect if you have that one small spot on your face that's always a little dry and flaky. They're basically a heavily concentrated moisturizing spot treatment.









Under-eye gels may work wonders for dark circles and bags.

, If you have skin problems that you are unable to clear up on your own with over-the-counter products, go to a professional for help. A dermatologist should have a variety of treatments that they can suggest for your particular issue. They can prescribe you a prescription medication that is made specifically to address your skin problems.There are some skin issues that can be treated but may never be totally cleared up, such as the chronic skin condition psoriasis. While conditions such as this cannot be totally eliminated, dermatological care is very important to keep symptoms at bay.See your doctor if your blemishes, or acne, do not clear within 4-6 weeks or if it becomes painful or infected., You don't need to go on an extreme diet just for the sake of your skin, however, simple changes can make a lot of difference. Try to include more fruits and vegetables in your diet. Drink lots of water every day. These things can really help to keep your skin in good shape.


If you're eating a lot of greasy, fatty, and unhealthy food, this can affect your skin tremendously.
Foods like white grains (bread, rice, pasta) and sweets have been linked to acne.Foods with lots of antioxidants, vitamin C, or omega-3 fatty acids can help improve the health of your skin. These include, but are not limited to: dark chocolate, pomegranates, strawberries, blueberries, olive oil, avocado, and fish. , Taking care of your overall health can have a really positive effect on your skin's health. Take the time to get enough sleep, as this helps your body to rejuvenate itself, helps to put more moisture in your skin, and creates new healthy cells. Exercise is important because it releases endorphins and elevates the amount of energy your body has to complete essential processes.








Remember, if you get all sweaty from exercise, take a shower or bath afterwards and gently wash your face. This will help to keep your skin in great shape by removing any bacteria that has built up in your pores., One of the most important things you can do to keep your skin in perfect shape is to limit sun exposure. Wear sunglasses, a hat, long sleeves, and long pants in the sun if you can. Try to cover up as much skin as you can. Even better, if you have the choice between staying in the shade and going into the sun, choose the shade.Not only will the sun age your skin, sun exposure is the biggest preventable risk factor for skin cancer.

, If you need to be out in the sun, use sunscreen. It is advised that you use a sunscreen that is at least 30 SPF in order to keep the ultra-violet rays of the sun at bay. Remember, sunscreen needs to be reapplied every so often, so look at the directions for reapplication on your particular sunscreen and follow them.








Some people worry that they will not get enough Vitamin D if they keep out of the sun, as sun exposure does give you Vitamin D. If you are worried about this, consult with your doctor about supplements or eat more foods high in Vitamin D, such as fish, milk products with added Vitamin D, and fortified cereals., If you do accidentally get too much sun, you should care for your skin afterwards. Take a bath or shower to cool down your skin and then take the time to heavily moisturize.Drink lots of water following a sunburn. This will help to moisturize your damaged skin.
Keep a sunburn out of the sun. It's important to allow this skin to heal completely without damaging it further.

, Using less makeup decreases the chances of blocking your pores and causing breakouts. This does not mean that you can't wear any makeup. It just means that you should balance your need for makeup with your skin type.


For example, try not to use thick, all over foundation. It can clog your pores. Instead, try a lighter coverage, such as mineral-based powder.
There are makeups that are formulated to help skin breakouts. If you choose to use one of these, make sure that the one you use is created for your skin type, whether it be oily, sensitive, or dry.Going to bed with makeup on is especially bad for your skin. Nightly removal clears makeup build up.

While model skin can be achieved regardless of the skin type that you have, your skin care routine should vary based on your type. Tailoring your skin care routine to your skin will ensure that your skin looks as good as possible. Once you determine your skin type, you can choose the products that are best for your skin.


Normal skin is neither particularly oily nor particularly dry. It is characterized by small pores, few imperfections, and no severe sensitivity.People with normal skin can use a wide range of skincare products.
Oily skin is characterized by shiny skin and overly dilated pores. This skin type is more prone to acne.If you have oily skin, you will want to use water-based or oil-free cosmetics, and you may want to consult a dermatologist about creams that can limit the production of oil.Dry skin is characterized by lack of moisture and often exhibits red patches, dull and/or rough complexion, less elasticity, and more visible lines.If you have dry skin, you will need to use mild and gentle cleansers, apply a rich moisturizer, and avoid washing you face with very hot water.Combination skin is skin that is dry in some areas, but oily in others. A common place to be oily is in the “T-zone”, which consists of the nose, forehead, and chin. In contrast, skin is often dry on the cheeks.Combination skin exhibits large pores, blackheads, and shiny skin.If you have combination skin, you will want to look at treating the dry and oily regions separately.Sensitive skin is skin that reacts to ingredients commonly included in commercial skincare products. This hyper-reactive skin often appears red.It is not necessarily considered a skin type, but instead is a common symptom.People with sensitive skin should use fragrance-free and hypo-allergenic skincare products.;
, For the best results, use a mild, non-detergent cleanser.Many models choose to wash their faces with products that include gentle, plant-derived surfactants, including coconut and fruit sugars, as these have been shown to produce good results.For the best chance of getting model skin, wash your skin thoroughly in the morning when you wake up as well as at night before you go to sleep.


Look for cleansers with natural, earth-based ingredients. These will be kinder to your skin than many products with strong chemicals.
If you have acne-prone skin, chose a cleanser that is specially designed to reduce the occurrence and appearance of acne.In particular, look for products that contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide; these ingredients can help clear acne., Moisturizing is an important part of getting model skin. You should use a moisturizer on a daily basis. Choose one that has plant-based moisturizers: these include natural oils, butters, and essential fatty acids.Also, make sure that there is a nonirritating sunscreen in your moisturizer (most commonly zinc oxide or titanium dioxide).By using moisturizer daily, you are trapping moisture in your skin which can help your skin look brighter and younger by reducing the appearance of fine lines.If you have oily or acne-prone skin, make sure your moisturizer is oil-free. Any oil-based ingredients can make skin look overly shiny, block pores, and worsen acne.Moisturizing is especially essential if you have dry skin! Because your skin lacks normal levels of moisture, you must be sure to apply a moisturizer at least once a day to maintain healthy skin.

, Sun exposure can result in many skin issues that will take you farther away from your goal of getting model skin. Not only does exposure to ultraviolet rays increase your risk of skin cancers, but it can also result in smaller issues, including broken blood vessels and brown spots.In order to get model skin, wear sunscreen religiously, even if you’re not planning on spending time in the sun.


As much as 80% of the sun’s rays can pass through clouds. This means that it is essential to wear sunscreen even if it is cloudy.Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 every day.An easy way to implement sunscreen into your normal skin care routine is to use a moisturizer that contains SPF.For a tan look, use a tinted foundation, moisturizer or bronzer to give your skin a healthy glow while avoiding exposure to dangerous UV rays.

, For model skin, try using a facemask that will infuse essential nutrients into your skin while also cleansing and clarifying your pores.The best part of using facemasks for model skin is that they are easy to make at home with the right ingredients. Examine your skin for any issues you may be having and make the appropriate facemask. For example, if you have particularly dry or particularly acne-prone skin, you will want to use different ingredients in your mask to make sure that your skin comes out as beautiful as possible.


Realize what facemasks will do for each skin condition. A hydrating facemask will restore moisture balance to your skin, a clarifying facemask will have anti-acne effects, a revitalizing or whitening facemask will have a lightening effect, and an exfoliating facemask will clear away oil and impurities., Easy lifestyle changes can make a big difference in the state of your skin later in life. For model beautiful skin, limit your exposure to the sun, maintain adequate hydration, and don’t smoke. These simple changes will benefit your body and your skin.

, For an easy way to reduce wrinkles, try sleeping on your back. Lines on your face caused by your pillow can become permanent over time, so try sleeping on your back to lessen the effect.If you can’t get a good night of sleep on your back, try to use pillows made of silk or satin, which lessens the lasting impressions of fabrics on your skin., Oils rich in antioxidants (such as coconut oil) will improve the quality of your skin by reducing the production of free radicals that lead to the visual signs of early aging.Apply oils to your skin each night after cleansing and before bed in order to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles., Laser skin resurfacing will help to reduce severe facial wrinkles, scars, and blemishes.A surgeon can use laser skin resurfacing to remove unwanted and damaged skin while simultaneously stimulating the growth of new collagen fibers, leading to skin that is smoother and firmer.For more information about laser skin resurfacing, consult your skin care professional or dermatologist.

, These are substances used by a physician that will aid in replacing lost volume in certain areas of your face.The benefit of these injections is that you will have substantial and long-lasting results.


Ensure that any injectable filler that you use is FDA approved. Commonly used FDA approved fillers include hyaluronic acids, hydroxylapatite microspheres, poly-l-lactic acid, and polymethylmethacrylate microspheres/collagen.A trusted doctor, dermatologist, or skincare professional can provide advice regarding which filler may be best for you.

, A good foundation is one that contains silicone, which will help “fill in” your skin. Avoid any foundations that are identified as luminous or matte- these have been known to make skin look unnatural.Instead, choose foundations identified by words such as “lightweight” or “sheer.” Lightweight foundations will make your skin appear smooth and glowing without feeling like you’re wearing a mask.


Know your skin tone. A foundation that is too light or too dark will make you look like you are wearing makeup (and the secret to model skin is to look like you are makeup free). To determine the optimal foundation skin for your skin, test various foundation shades on the inside of your wrist or on your neck- this will help you to figure out the tone of your complexion.If you have a red tint to your skin, get rid of it with a yellow-based foundation., Models never look like they have makeup caked on their faces. To avoid a cakey look, dab on six dime-sized dots of foundation on your face.For optimal results, place two dots on your forehead, one on the tip of your nose, one on each side of your nose, and one on your chin.Make sure you blend in this foundation thoroughly with your fingers for a natural look.

, If, after you apply foundations, you still see discolorations or acne spots on your skin, you will want to focus specifically on these areas. Look for a solid concealer and concealer brush that you can use to apply makeup directly to dark spots or blemishes., Do you want that sun-kissed model look without having to face the dangers of ultraviolet rays from the sun? Makeup can help with this. Choose a bronzer that works with your skin tone and is no more than two shades darker than your skin color.Apply the bronzer to areas of your face (such as your nose, forehead, and cheeks) that would tan in the sunlight, and make sure it is blended in evenly to the surrounding skin.

, Because your body is anywhere from 55-75% water, hydrating your body by drinking water helps hydrate your skin cells and erase wrinkles on your skin, making your skin runway worthy.Dehydration will result in your skin appearing dry, tight, and flaky.For optimal results, aim to drink at least 8 glasses (approximately 64oz) of water each day.This will help your skin stay hydrated and glowing.


Give your skin a steady flow of water. You need to consume at least 64oz of water each day, but this consumption should be spread throughout the day so that your body has a better chance of absorbing the water that you ingest., While the link between diet and skin health isn’t precisely clear yet, some research suggests that diets rich in vitamin C and low in processed or refined carbohydrates may result in healthier looking skin.Having model skin requires you to take care of your whole body to keep your skin looking its best.


In order to consume more vitamin C, include foods such as citrus fruits, strawberries, papaya, pineapple, Brussel sprouts, red or green bell peppers, kale, and broccoli in your diet.Alternatively, consider taking a daily multi-vitamin that contains your daily requirement of vitamin C.
To lessen your consumption of processed or refined carbohydrates, substitute whole grains into your diet instead. Whole grains, including brown rice, millet, quinoa, and whole wheat, contain glycosaminoglycans, substances that help your skin to build collagen and elastin fibers essential for keeping firm and taut skin., If you have particularly blotchy or red skin, green tea can be soothing due to its anti-inflammatory properties.Evening out your skin tone and texture will help keep your skin looking model beautiful.


Drink your green tea iced. Hot beverages can worsen the symptoms of rosacea, including redness., Having a high level of stress can take its toll on your skin.Stress is especially shown in the form of acne breakouts. This is because stress increases the level of hormones (such as cortisol) in your body, making your skin oilier and reducing its ability to fight acne-causing bacteria.Keep your stress level low for model skin.


To reduce stress, try some proven relaxation techniques: take a long walk, meditate, practice yoga, color in a coloring book.

, Smoking (and even being in smoke-laden environments) increases the level of free radicals that damage skin and speed up the appearance of aging.Smoking contributes to wrinkles and depletes the oxygen and nutrients that are necessary for healthy skin by narrowing skin’s blood vessels.For model skin, don’t smoke and avoid smoky environments as much as possible.


It is never too late to quit smoking. Consult your doctor for tips and treatments to quit smoking. This will not only improve the health of your skin, but your overall health as well.

, While it may not seem like exercise will benefit your skin, you will be pleasantly surprised to find out that there are many positive skin effects associated with exercise. For example, exercise helps balance the aging effects of cortisol, keeping your skin looking younger.Additionally, the increase in circulation that results from working out helps to deliver essential nutrients to your skin.

, For model beautiful skin, get a full night of sleep in order to allow your skin’s repair mechanisms to work.Not only will you wake up looking more rested, but you will keep your release of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisone in balance, reducing the occurrence of breakouts and other skin issues."

Find the right cleanser for your face.,
Maintain your cleaning routine.,
Change and wash your pillowcases frequently.

",How to Get Porcelain Skin2," Everybody's skin comes with its own special set of problems. Some is oily, some dry, some prone to blackheads, some to white. Your cleaning routine depends on your skin's particular symptoms.


Cleansers can be purchased at any drug or beauty supply store. Store bought cleansers typically combat specific symptoms. Find a cleanser that addresses your skin's needs, or find a few that work effectively together. Cleansers may come in the form of scrubs, toners, astringents or wipes.
Sensitive skin requires gentle cleansers, and should not be scrubbed. Scrubbing irritated skin will aggravate it even more and prevent healing.
If your skin is sensitive to certain cleansers or your acne is especially severe, you may want to see a dermatologist. They may prescribe you something, or suggest a couple cleansers that work well against your symptoms.
You can also clean your face with baking soda, by dissolving it in water and massaging it into your skin, then rinsing. This helps deep clean your pores, and is considerably cheaper than most facial cleansers.

, You should wash your face twice daily, in the morning and at night. Neglecting your cleaning routine will lead to build up in your pores.


Washing your face too frequently may dry it out. Make sure you implement moisturizing into your routine.
Be consistent with your cleanser. If you alternate between too many cleansers, all of which are trying to accomplish different things, your symptoms may in fact intensify.
Try implementing an electronic cleansing brush in your routine for intensive exfoliation. These are best suited for more resistant skin. If your skin is sensitive, try using a gentle setting so as not to irritate it even more.

Apply facial masks to keep your skin youthful and smooth.,
You can also make your face masks at home using the following ingredients.",How to Get Porcelain Skin3," These can be purchased at any beauty or cosmetics store, or spa.


Typically you leave your facial mask on for fifteen minutes, unless otherwise specified.
To remove it, just rinse with a washcloth (not your fingers!) and warm water, and finish with a splash of cold water.

, Homemade face masks are not only more affordable, but also more effective. They contain natural and fresh ingredients that are less likely to conflict with facial cleansers, including:


Tomatoes: Remove the seeds and mash into puree. Apply to face and let it sit for fifteen minutes as your skin absorbs its antioxidants, vitamins and nutrients. Great for hydrating dry skin and fighting acne. Add lemon and sugar to exfoliate and abolish blackheads.
Avocado: Can be used alone or combined with honey and lemon. Avocado is rich in Vitamins A and E, and antioxidants and oils that help your skin retain its elasticity and smoothness.
Papaya: Similar consistency to avocado; try blending with cream or yogurt.
Pumpkin: Much like papaya, pumpkin makes a mighty moisturizer. Try blending it with cream and honey.
Pineapple: Brighten and soften skin by blending pineapple with honey until smooth and applying to your face.
Strawberry: Combine strawberry pulp with either honey, cream or yogurt to achieve the right consistency. Strawberries not only hydrate skin but also help prevent and alleviate sunburn.
Banana: Smooths and softens skin. Contains potassium which helps combat dark circles. Best combined with honey and lemon. I suggest you use a very ripe banana; they're much easier to mash.
Lemon: Lemon is often added for its cleansing properties. It functions as a toner or astringent.
Chocolate: Cocoa powder can be mixed with any number of things--yogurt, honey, milk or even clay. Its nutrients and antioxidants help combat effects of aging.
Egg Whites: Egg white masks, mixed with a little milk and honey, are extremely effective against acne. Best you leave some extra room around the eyes and mouth, because the egg white mask gets tight as it dries out.
Milk: Milk can be used in combination with other ingredients to make a mask, or by itself, simply to cleanse the face. Just dip a cotton ball in milk and gently massage against your face. This will hydrate and nourish your skin as well as clean it. Milk will also help to even out your skin tone and achieve that porcelain finish that you're looking for. Queen Elizabeth of England and Cleopatra used to take milk baths to achieve that fair and radiant complexion. Milk contains vitamins A and D which work to soften skin.Honey, yogurt and oatmeal are commonly used in combination with other ingredients.

Drink lots of water.,
Drink white tea.,
Eat healthy.,
Avoid touching your face with your fingers at all costs.",How to Get Porcelain Skin4," We need water circulating through our bodies at all times. The skin, like any organ, relies on water to flush out harmful toxins.Drinking water also helps prevent dry skin.

, White tea is rich in antioxidants and can be added to any other type of tea without affecting the flavor. Try to integrate white tea into your daily routine.

, Make sure your diet meets all your skin's needs and that you're getting all the necessary vitamins and nutrients. Stay away from greasy foods, especially if you have oily skin already.

,


If you have bangs or hair that falls into your eyes you may be tempted to push it out of the way. Be careful not to let your fingers touch your face. Touching your forehead will cause it to get oily and break out.
If you wear glasses, places where the glasses rub against your skin are likely to break out. Sweat that rubs against your skin builds in your pores, and every time you touch your face to adjust your glasses, you're adding oil. You may need to wash your face more frequently if you wear glasses.
Avoid scratching or picking at scabs. This will cause them to scar or leave dark spots in their wake.

Coat the scab in a homemade paste.,
Dab at the scab with natural remedies.",How to Get Rid of a Scab2," Picking at your scab is a no-no, since this can cause scarring and make it take even longer for the wound to heal. If you want some relief from the itching that will also help get rid of the scab, try gently massaging it with a bit of petroleum jelly or moisturizing lotion. You can do this each time you put a new bandage on., For some instant relief, soak a clean cloth in plain warm water. Let it sit on the scab for fifteen minutes, but don’t rub or scrub. This will provide relief from the irritation that makes you want to pick the scab.

Do a straight pin-back.,
Go with a pompadour.,
Braid your bangs.,
Try an ultra-high updo.,
Hide your bangs with the rest of your hair.",How to Style Bangs1," The most basic way to style your bangs it to let them loose, and simply making sure they’re in order and presentable. After washing your hair, use a round brush and a blow-dryer to dry your bangs to perfection. Roll the brush under the bangs and pull them away from your face (on the heavy side of your part) to ensure that they are dried in the right direction.









If necessary, use a flat iron or straight iron to get your bangs just right.;
, For those days when you’re running late and don’t have time to wash or style your bangs, a twist-and-pin is the perfect go-to style. Gather your bangs in one hand, and twist them away from your face along your hairline. Pin them on top of your hair using bobby pins. To keep fine fly-aways at bay, use a misting of hairspray over your twisted bangs. You’re done!









For an up-do, you can continue twisting hair beyond your bangs before pulling it all up into an elastic or pinning it at the back of your head.

, Like the older, more sophisticated version of the twist-and-pin, a straight pin-back may be the easiest of the bang styles. Style your entire head of hair as you normally would, and then brush your bangs straight to the side or top of your head. Use bobby pins to secure them at their ends, and tuck the pieces that stick out under the rest of your hair.








, A classic look that can add interest to any style, the pompadour is accomplished by teasing and pinning your bangs. Separate your bangs out and pull them straight forward. Use a brush to back-comb the bangs to create a poufy-base. Pull your bangs back over the teased section, and brush it out a bit to deflate the poof. Twist the ends a single time, and then pin the bangs down with bobby pins on the top of your head.









You can choose to style the pompadour slightly off to the side if you want, but this may require longer bangs and thicker hair.
You can leave your hair down, or pull it up with this style depending on the look you’re going for.

, Although this style requires a little more time, it offers up beautiful results. Separate your bangs out from the front section of your hair, and pull the rest of your hair up with an elastic band. Begin french-braiding your hair from the roots of your bangs, and continue braiding until you run out of hair. You can either use a small clear elastic band to secure the style, or you can let the rest of your hair down and pin it in place with the use of bobby pins.








You can do different types of braids in order to create a different look. French and Dutch braids are the easiest to accomplish with bangs, although you could attempt a Rope or Fishtail braid as well.

, If you’re not afraid of heights, try flipping your head over and pulling all of your hair (including your bangs) into a ponytail on the top of your head. As is currently popular, you can wrap the ponytail up into a topknot or tease it a bit to add volume and a playful edge. If you place the ponytail high enough on your head, you should be able to pull your bangs straight back with no loose pieces or bobby pins required.








, If you’re just tired of having bangs and are in the process of growing them out, give the illusion of bang-less hair by covering them up. Part your hair deep to one side just above your ear, and brush it over the top of your bangs. You can pin your hair back if too much of it is hanging in your face, but leaving it down should allow you to maintain the illusion as well.








This still may only work for very long hair, as shorter hair doesn’t have the necessary weight to hold down the bangs and cover them up.

Keep it classy with a blow-out.,
Add a braided headband.,
Make a mini side-pompadour.,
Brush your bangs straight back under a headband.,
Add a knit hat or beanie.",How to Style Bangs2," As with side-swept bangs, the simplest way to style blunt bangs is to use a blow dryer and get them styled as naturally as possible. Use a round brush rolled underneath your bangs and your blow dryer set to a low setting to get your bangs styled without unwanted curls or waves. Use a light misting of hairspray to set your bangs after blow-drying them.







, Blunt bangs have the advantage of an obvious part at their roots, giving the perfect placement for a braided headband. Section out a thin section of hair running from ear to ear along the part of your bangs, and pull the rest of your hair up in a ponytail. French braid this section of hair all the way across, essentially hiding the roots of the bangs. Use an elastic band or a few bobby pins to pin the ends in place behind the opposite ear.








, Although your bangs don’t have the length required for a full-on pouf, you can tease them slightly and pull them to the side for a sweet look. Use a fine tooth comb to rat out the roots of your bangs, and twist them to the side of your face. Pin them in place with two bobby pins in the shape of an ‘X’.








, This look is best accompanied with an updo, or with the top half of your hair pinned back. Use a brush or comb to tease the roots of the entire front section of your hair, including your bangs and the pieces further down that frame your face. Push the front section of your hair back, creating a big pouf all the way around your face. Slide on a headband about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the poof, so that the hair nearest your hairline lays flat while the hair beyond the headband is bumped up.









Use hairspray or pomade to blend your bangs into the rest of your hair, and keep them from sticking straight up past your headband.

, Once again, blunt bangs are the perfect haircut for wearing with a beanie because they allow a bit of hair to appear, while the rest of your head is wrapped up and warm for the winter. Style your bangs out in the front as you normally would (the blow-out style is nice for this), and then slip on a beanie or knit hat of choice. Place the hat so that the front edge just barely covers the roots of your bangs.If your hair is very slippery or the hat is a bit loose, use a few bobby pins to pin it in place.

, Grasp your bangs at the root with the straightening iron.

Release your bangs from the iron when you reach the tips.

Heat damage can ruin your natural curl pattern. If you want to transition to curly bangs, the first thing you need to do is stop straightening them with heat. Let your bangs grow out for a few months., Before you style your bangs, they need to be cut properly. Cutting curly hair in general requires more thought than cutting straight hair. This is especially true with bangs, which are highly-visible and leave no room for mistakes.


Remember that curls make bangs appear shorter and that your hair will shrink a little as it dries. Leave your bangs a little longer than your straight-haired counterparts'.
Each ringlet should be cut individually. Working with your natural curl pattern will help make sure your bangs don't look uneven.If you're cutting your own hair for the first time, hold off on the bangs for now. Practice on the rest of your hair, which is more forgiving. Once you've perfectly trimmed your hair a few times, you can get a little more adventurous and start working with your bangs.
If you're getting your hair professionally cut, find a stylist experienced with curly bangs. Some stylists are either inexperienced with curly hair in general or subscribe to the idea that bangs shouldn't be curly. Before booking an appointment, ask him or her about both., Either wash your hair or simply add a little water to your bangs. The water may be any temperature you feel comfortable using. If you're planning on washing your hair soon, be sure to do so before styling your bangs. Your hair will likely lose the style next time it gets wet.

, Curl definers are also marketed as curl enhancing creams and custards. These products work to separate out and define each individual curl. Curl definers help you to avoid the issues of crunchy or greasy hair that can occur with other styling products.If you've never used a curl definer before, you may need to try out a few different products to find the perfect one for your unique hair type.
Many curl definers also act as leave-in conditioners. If your hair is particularly dry, look for a definer will extra moisturizing properties.

, Select a small strand of hair from your bangs. It can be wide or thin, depending which best suits your curl pattern. Use a finger to scoop up a tiny portion of definer. You should have just enough to lightly coat the strand. Run your fingers up and down the strand to work the definer into your hair., As you work in the curl definer, use your fingers to make little twists with each small lock. Follow your hair's natural curl pattern; do not wrap your hair around your finger in the opposite direction. Work from right to left across your bangs, applying curl definer and twisting one lock at a time.

, Once you've finished styling your bangs, you will need to dry them first. To prevent damage, set your hairdryer to the lowest heat and speed possible. Push the diffuser directly into your hair. As you dry, use your fingers to untwist your bangs and fluff them out slightly.


A finger diffuser is a device that attaches to the end of a hairdryer and help to prevent damage to your hair by decreasing the strength of airflow. A finger diffuser will keep your curl pattern intact and help you to avoid frizziness."

, Make sure to wash any product off. Remnants of hair products in your hair can also cause your bangs to split.

, Extremely thin, wispy hair is also a reason behind the occurrence of clumping bangs. Apply some sort of volumizing or thickening product to your bangs.

, Clip the bangs to the side overnight. In the morning, remove the clip and comb the bangs the way you usually would. They shouldn't separate.

, If random strands of your hair tend to curl easily, it could also happen to strands of hair in your bangs, which can also cause them to split. Remember to apply heat protectant before every time you use any form of heat on your hair.

Know what a quiff is.,
Bring a photograph or two of the look you want to your hairdresser.,
Keep the sides and back of your hair shorter than the top.,
Know that it is hard to get a quiff with very curly or frizzy hair.,
Note how the barber styles your hair.",How to Do a Quiff1," A quiff is when the front of your hair is held up so that it curves back towards your head. There is a ""wall"" of hair above your forehead, and none of your hair reaches down past your scalp. The size and style of your quiff can make it unique.;
, Go online and search for the kind of quiff you want, then show the person who cuts your hair so that they have a good idea of what you want. There are a lot of different quiffs out there, so it helps to know what you want ahead of time:



Classic Quiff: Short on the sides and back, high in the front, this classic hairstyle has been famous since Elvis.

Short Quiff: This short, clean cut has become popular with businessmen and executive types. It is short on the sides and tops with 1-2 inches of coiffed hair at most.

The Pompadour: This is a big, wavy quiff, similar to James Dean or Johnny Cash's haircuts.

Undercut: This modern cut is when you buzz the sides of your head almost completely, fading into light hair on top and a small, short quiff, like Adam Levine.

, The one thing all quiffs have in common is that the sides are kept short. This allows you to create the dramatic quiff in the middle of your head without hair from the sides getting in the way.








, Pretty much anyone can carry off a quiff with the right products and tools, though it’s probably best to avoid this style if you have thin, very curly, or ferociously frizzy hair. Straighter hair is easier to manipulate into the quiff and requires less product to style.

, If you've never had a quiff before, watch the barber or hairdresser as they style your hair after the cut. More likely than not, they will:









Get your hair damp.
Comb your hair to the side.
Apply a small amount of gel/wax with their fingertips.
Gently sculpt the quiff with their fingers.
Use a blow dryer to blow the quiff up and over, into shape.

Use bobby pins and barrettes to pin back your bangs and incorporate them into your styled hair. With a little practice, no one will realize that you're dealing with the awkward grow-out stage.


Get bobby pins in color that matches your hair, so you'll be able to pin it back discreetly.
Get cut hair barrettes that are tight enough to pull back your bangs without them springing loose.;
, When you don't have time for fussy styling and pinning, headbands will become your best friend. Get a variety of headbands so you'll be able to throw one on whenever you need to quickly deal with your bangs. To wear a headband properly, place it several inches back from your forehead, then push it forward slightly to create a pretty quiff.You can use headbands with braids, ponytails and other updos as an alternative to bobby pins.
Cloth headbands as well as stiff headbands are convenient to have on hand.

, Braiding your bangs and pinning them to the side to blend with your hair is a pretty way to hide your growing-out stage. Sweep your bangs to one side and braid them until you reach the end. Pin the end of the braid under a lock of hair on the side of your head, so the hair hides the pin.








, These fun updos create the perfect way to hide bangs. Do a ponytail or bun on top of your head, then pin back your bangs right against the hairband so you don't see the bobby pin or the ends of your bangs.

, Sweep your bangs to one side of your forehead and use a bobby pin to pin them in place just above your ear. Layer some of your longer hair over the bobby pin to hide the ends of your bangs.

, The shaggy, slightly messy look of long bangs is a trend in its own right. When your bangs are down to your ears or below, you might want to stop pinning them back. At this stage they'll blend more easily with the rest of your hair, and you might actually like the look of having a few different layers to frame your face.

, If you're more interested in hiding your bangs than showcasing them, try parting your hair on one side or the other. Sweep your bangs in the opposite direction of the part and tuck them behind your ear. Use a little hairspray or gel to keep them sideswept if you'd like. Your bangs should be long enough to stay in place without too much trouble.

, Your bangs are long enough to slick back into a mid-height ponytail or bun, and this beautiful look is perfect for a night out. Comb mousse or gel through your bangs to hold them in place when you put up your hair. It might help to secure a bobby pin or two over the ends of your bangs near the base of your ponytail.To add some height to your look, comb your bangs straight above your head, and backcomb from the tips toward your scalp. Put your hair into a mid-height ponytail. Use a comb to neaten the top layer of hair before pinning back your bangs.

, On days when you want to wear your hair down, try embracing your bangs by doing the following: part your hair in the middle, an divide your bangs evenly on both sides. Use a curling iron to curl your bangs with strands of longer hair away from your face, Farrah Fawcett style. This pretty look will make your bangs look more tailored than simply having them hang loose.

, To shorten the distance between your bangs and the rest of your hair, you may want to consider a brand new haircut. Have the stylist create gradual layers between your bangs and the end of your hair, so the difference won't look so extreme.

, We've all looked in the mirror and made the hasty decision to use a pair of craft or kitchen scissors to take off some of that unruly length. When the urge hits, do your best to resist. Cutting your hair will just set you back, and chances are the cut won't look right so you'll have to fix it by going even shorter.While a home cut is usually not the best idea, it's fine to have a trim now and then while you're growing out your bangs. Just be sure to tell the stylist that you're trying to grow them out, and he or she will be sure to just take off a little bit.

, Any time you're focused on growing hair, it's a good idea to treat your hair with extra care. That means forgoing harsh treatments, tools and techniques you might usually use to create the looks you love. When your hair gets dried out, damaged and broken, it takes longer to grow back in. Avoid the following until your bangs are fully grown out:


Excessive hair drying (limit it to once every few weeks)
Excessive straightening or curling (limit it to once every few weeks)
Dyeing or bleaching
Exposure to chemicals (including chlorine and other pool chemicals)

, Healthy hair starts on the inside, so do your best to live a lifestyle that facilitates faster growth. Eating nourishing foods and staying hydrated are two great ways to help your bangs grow out. Focus on the following:


Eat plenty of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and b vitamins. These are found in fish, nuts, olive oil, eggs, and leafy greens.
Drink plenty of water so your hair doesn't dry out. Dry hair tends to break more easily than hair that is hydrated.
Stop smoking, since smoking is tough on hair.

, A hat that brings symmetry and balance to your face and head stands a good chance of being flattering.If you have prominent features, these can be offset by the right hat.


Long faces should consider flared brim hats that sit low on the forehead.
Round faces can achieve balance through angular head wear. The natural symmetry of round faces can be offset with asymmetrical caps.

,, Perhaps you have a wedding, prom, or another special event at which you wanted to look your best. Even so, remind yourself that your worth isn’t based solely on your appearance, to encourage a proactive mindset, which will help you take measures to improve your hair., Some salons offer touch-ups or corrections for a fraction of the normal price, and if your unfortunate fringe is the result of a stylist's error, you may get your money back.


Even if you don't get your money back or a special deal, ask if there are ways you can correct or improve the state of your bangs on your own.

, Though this will not correct the fringe injustice you have suffered, laughing at ‘’worse’’ haircuts can be therapeutic and put your situation into perspective, and perspective might be just what you need to correct a bad cut.


Have a friend join you so that you have an ally that understands how you feel. Laughing together can protect you from psychological pain., Planning can take a great deal of stress off your mind, and planning what you might say if someone comments on your bangs can be an advantage. Some things you might say:


“I decided to hack off my bangs to see if my face could make up for it. How am I looking?”
“I said ‘I forgot my wallet.’ My stylist heard, ‘I want a mullet.’”
“I decided on trying something different. So did my stylist. I think her version of ‘different’ is the same as my version of ‘bad.’”

, You probably feel pretty strongly about your terrible haircut. These strong feelings can make you interpret even compliments as an attack.Don’t let bad bangs sour your relationships or get in the way of you taking measures to fix your fringe.

Purchase a thin styling iron.,
Pre-heat your iron.,
Clamp the flat iron near your roots.,
Twist your hair around the style iron to create a curl.,
Repeat the curl for each strand of hair in your bangs.,
Tousle and set your bangs.",How to Style Curly Bangs2," Find one that looks like a miniature version of the larger flat irons typically used to straighten hair. If you already have straight hair, you can use flat irons to actually add wavy, natural-looking curls. An iron with rounded edges is ideal for curling.


It's important that the styling iron you choose is very thin. It will be difficult to wrap the short hair of your bangs around a standard thick hair straightener., Applying even heat throughout the curling process will give you the most consistent results. Make sure your iron is heated to the right temperature before you begin. The temperature you set it to will depend on your hair type:


Fine, fragile, or damaged hair should be styled between 250 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
A temperature of 300 to 350 degrees is best suited for hair of medium or average thickness. If you aren't sure where your hair falls, try this setting first.
Very thick hair is best curled with a typical flat iron's ""high"" setting, which is usually between 350 and 400 degrees., Start by selecting a roughly half-inch strand of hair from your bangs. Bring your flat iron up and clamp the strand between the two plates.Start with a strand on either the far left or far right. Working in a single horizontal direction will make missing a stray lock less likely.

, Rotate your wrist outward and away from your face by one half turn so that your hair becomes wrapped around it. Hold the strand's tip with your free hand and gently pull the iron down towards it. Release the iron once you reach the bottom of your bangs. The entire process, from clamping the release, should take about 5 seconds. Avoid holding the iron in one place for long to avoid burning your hair., For a natural look, don't pick the same point to clamp down for each strand. Start each curl either slightly higher or lower than its neighbor. Try to make your curls all the same thickness by separating out similarly-sized strands. If you find doing this on the fly difficult, you can always portion out the strands before you start curling and hold them together with bobby pins.

, Once all of your bangs are in curls, run your fingers through your bangs while twisting your wrist a few times. Finish with a little texturizing spray instead of normal hairspray. If you have naturally straight hair, you probably know that it can be difficult to hold style and volume. Texturizing sprays are great for giving body to fine hair. These sprays are lighter than traditional hairsprays, which can actually weigh curls down.


If you're having extra difficulty getting a curl to hold, try ironing again, this time applying some heat-activated mousse to your bangs first."

Keep working the quiff into your desired shape until the hair feels completely dry.,
Smooth out any imperfections with some hair wax.",How to Do a Quiff2," Before you attempt to do a quiff hairstyle, it's important to wash your hair to remove any oils and add some volume.








, Your hair should still be a little damp to the touch, but it should not still be dripping any water.








, You want roughly a quarter-sized dollop of gel in your fingers. Many people use too much, which weighs down your hair and makes it difficult to style. The best product for you will depend on your hair type:









Sea salt spray gives a dry, matte hold which is good for soft, thick hair types.
Wax gives a very firm, strong hold for difficult, unruly hair.
Gel gives a lightweight yet firm hold which is good for fine hair., Focus on the last 1-2 inches of hair, starting with your bangs. As you work, use your fingers to comb your hair to the front of your head.








, Set your dryer to the highest temperature setting and the lowest speed – you can always increase the speed when you feel more confident. Using a vented brush, sweep the hair on the top part of your head (roughly 2cm above your temples) across to one side. At the same time follow the brush with your dryer. Direct the airflow through the vents in the brush and onto the hair, keeping the dryer approximately 3cm from the brush to avoid over-baking your hair. When your hair is 50% dry repeat the method on the other side, working in the opposite direction.









As you dry, use your fingers to work the hair upwards and backwards, from the roots to the tips, in the direction you want the quiff to go (right or left). You can also use a brush.

, Lower the heat and use your brush to perfect your look to your liking. Don't continue using the hairdryer once your hair is dry, as your hair will become crisp and dried out.







, Run your hands over the outside of the quiff (not through the hair) to give it some structure and smooth any flyaway hairs. If you have wax, you can use it to give you quiff a classic shine reminiscent of the movie O Brother, Where art Thou?









Take some strong-hold hairspray and give the quiff a good spritz all over — this will help to maintain the volume and structure.
Depending on the look you're going for, you can take a small amount of gel or wax and use it to either pull out or slick back the shorter hair at the sides of your head."

Wash your hair with volumizing shampoo.,
Section off the front part of your hair.,
Make your ponytail.,
Backcomb the hair for the quiff.,
Smooth and secure the quiff.,
Hide the bobby pins or hair ties and finish with hairspray.",How to Do a Quiff3," It's a good idea to wash your hair before attempting a quiff hairstyle. This gets rid of any oiliness and makes your hair easier to backcomb.


Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner in the shower — this will help to give your hair more texture and volume once dry.
Blot your hair dry with a towel. Work a little volumizing mousse through the lengths, and blow dry your hair as straight as possible.

, Use a comb or your fingers to section off the front part of your hair for the quiff.


Think of this section of hair like an upside-down triangle, with the two bottom points at your forehead and the top point at the top of your head.
If you plan on leaving the rest of your hair down, you can continue to Step 4. If you plan on putting the rest of your hair in a ponytail, twist the front section of hair around itself and temporarily secure with a bobby pin.

, Once the front section of your hair is separated and secured, use a soft brush to smooth the rest of your hair back into a low ponytail (around the occipital bone) and tie tightly with an elastic.


At this point your can decide whether you want the ponytail to look sleek or wispy. If you want the wispy look, pull out some feathery pieces of hair from around your ears and temples.
If you want a sleeker effect, use some firm-hold hairspray to slick back the hair at the sides of your head and beneath the ponytail. Don't spray the top of your head just yet.

, Unpin the front section of hair and comb it out to remove any tangles. Spritz the entire section of hair with a light layer of firm-hold hairspray.


Working from the back to the front, take small sections of hair and start backcombing, using a fine-toothed comb. This is the most important step in achieving a perfect quiff.
To backcomb the hair, hold a section of hair at the ends and lift it straight into the air, above your head. Place the comb at the halfway point between your head and your hand and tease the hair downwards, towards the scalp.Once you have finished with one section of hair, move onto the next and repeat the backcombing process. Keep going until you reach the hair at your forehead.

, Once you have backcombed the entire front section of hair, you are ready to form your quiff. Don't worry if your hair looks like a bird's nest at this point — this is how it's supposed to look!


Take a soft-bristled brush and lightly brush the hair back towards the ponytail. Try to get the hair on the outside of the quiff nice and smooth, but leave the backcombed hair underneath as undisturbed as possible — you don't want to undo all of your hard work!
Gather the ends of the backcombed hair at the crown of your head and twist them once. To get more height in your quiff, push this twisted piece of hair forwards. Use your hands to ensure that the quiff looks even at the front.
If you left the rest of your hair down, secure the twisted end of the quiff with a couple of bobby pins. If you put your hair in a ponytail, secure the twisted end to the existing ponytail using a second hair tie.

, Exposed bobby pins or hair ties can look untidy, so finish the look by hiding them beneath your hair.


If your hair is down, take a small section of hair from the right of the bobby pins and cross it over the pins towards the left. Secure this section of hair with a small pin on the underside of the hair. Now take another section of hair from the left of the bobby pins and cross it over to the right.If your hair is in a ponytail, take a small section of hair from the underside of the ponytail and wrap it around the hair ties until they are no longer visible. Secure the end of the hair with a bobby pin, underneath the ponytail.
Take your strong-hold hairspray and give the quiff a good spritz. Use your hand to smooth back any flyaway hairs from around the hairline. Finish with a little shine spray, and your quiff is good to go!

,, Dip your brush into the water and brush your to-be bangs down so they are hanging over your face. The wet brush will dampen your bangs to ensure an even cut.

, Grab the hair that falls between the outer ends of your eyes. Hold it placing your middle and index finger at the length you want the shortest part of your bangs to be.

, Use your fingers as a barrier so that you don't cut too short. For a less straight edge cut, cut the bangs while the scissors are pointed vertically. You can also use this method after making the initial horizontal cut.



Beginner's tip: Cut your bangs a little longer than is ideal at first and see how you like it—you can always cut more later if it's too long, but once it's too short you'll just have to wait for it to grow back.







, Use the same technique outlined in the previous step, but make sure that this portion is slightly longer than the middle one. Repeat for the same amount of hair on the left side.

, Make sure that they are even.

, These two strands should start right above your ears. To feather, make sure that your scissors are very sharp. Open them and beginning at the length of the last section you cut, run the blade in short up and down strokes while ultimately traveling down the strand. Be sure never to close the scissors, they should be sharp enough to cut the hair in this way.

Showering washes this layer away.Clean skin is important for good hygiene, but washing too frequently is unnecessary, and can make it more difficult for your skin to protect your body from contaminants and infections.


Generally, people don’t need to shower more than every other day or every three days.You may want to consider showering more often if you work with the public or the infirm, take public transit daily, or have a physical job that requires exertion.;
, Bathing in hot water and for too long strips helpful and necessary oils from your skin,and it can aggravate certain skin conditions like rosacea and eczema., Just like hot water, strong soaps will remove oil from your skin and leave you feeling tight and dry.When you do bathe, choose mild soaps or cleansers that don’t contain artificial fragrances. Look for soaps that:


Contain soothing and moisturizing ingredients like aloe, witch hazel, and vegetable oils, and herbs or botanicals such as chamomile, lavender, rosemary, and peppermint.Don't contain sodium lauryl sulfate or alcohol, which can both dry out your skin.Match your skin type. For instance, if you have dry skin, look for moisturizing soaps. For sensitive skin, look for fragrance-free and hypoallergenic soap.
Clean your skin without stripping away skin and oil., Instead of rubbing dry with a towel when you’ve finished bathing, gently pat your skin with a towel and let the remaining moisture air dry.This will ensure you leave a layer of oil on your skin that will help keep in moisture and prevent dryness.

, This will remove the top layer of dead skin, and reveal the fresh, new, radiant skin below, giving your skin a healthy, glowing appearance. Avoid using acids, such as lemon or tomato juice, on your skin and especially your face. They can strip away your skin’s natural oils, and make you more sensitive to the sun.


Regular cleansing, exfoliation, and moisturizing can help prevent breakouts and blemishes, and keep your skin looking young and healthy.
For dry skin, look for an exfoliating product that has no additional cleansing agents (or very mild ones) and a moisturizer. For oily skin, choose a balancing exfoliating product that also offers deep scrubbing., Along with keeping moisture against the skin, which keeps it from drying out, moisturizers also protect the skin and improve its tone and texture.Consider using a moisturizer that has an SPF rating for some additional sun-protection.


As an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, olive oil can also be applied topically to the skin as a natural moisturizer. Sweet almond, coconut, and jojoba also work as moisturizers, as do Shea and cocoa butter. You can use these products on their own, or look for moisturizers that contain them.
Look for lotions or gels instead of creams if you have oily skin, but opt for creams if you have dry skin.
For acne-prone skin, look for moisturizers that contain salicylic acid. But if you have sensitive skin, look for calming ingredients like green tea, vitamin C, and aloe., Eating foods that come in all the colors of the rainbow ensures that you’ll get the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that are vital for good health. Fruits and vegetables will help promote healthy skin because they promote a healthy body. Eating a diet that’s rich in these foods can lead to a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure, can regulate blood sugar and weight, and aid with digestion.Eat dark, leafy green vegetables.
Eat brightly colored foods that are orange, blue, yellow, red, and purple.
Tomatoes, for instance, are great for the skin because eating them can help protect it from sun damage, make your skin smoother, and boost collagen.

, Foods rich in antioxidants, selenium, coenzyme Q10, and flavonoids all promote healthy bodies and radiant skin. Antioxidants and selenium prevent damage done by free radicals, which are thought to contribute to wrinkles, tissue damage, and dry skin.Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant produced by your body. Flavonoids are the by-product of plant growth, and have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.


Foods that are high in antioxidants include whole grains,berries, apricots, beets, squash and sweet potatoes, tangerines, beans,and olive oil.
Foods that contain selenium include whole-wheat pasta, Brazil nuts, button mushrooms, beef and turkey, oysters, shrimp and crab, snapper and cod, and some other fish.Coenzyme Q10 can be found in whole grains, fish, organ meats, and soybean, canola, and sesame oils.Flavonoids can be found in things like dark chocolate and green tea., Vitamin C can boost the collagen and elastin in your skin, and these proteins prevent wrinkles, lines, and sagging.Vitamin A helps keep your skin fresh and glowing by preventing dryness, reducing dark spots, and smoothing wrinkles. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that fights the damage done by free radicals.Foods rich in vitamin C include peppers, citrus fruits, dark green vegetables, papaya, and kiwi.You can also try strawberries, pumpkin, and pomegranate for high doses of this wrinkle-fighting vitamin.Foods packed with vitamin A include dark leafy greens, oranges, carrots, cantaloupe, and eggs.
Vitamin E can be found in nuts and seeds, olives, dark leafy greens, and vegetable oils., Fats are necessary for healthy skin, especially omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. These fatty acids keep skin bright and moisturized, and prevent dryness and blemishes.Good sources of these essential fatty acids include:


WalnutsOlive and canola oil
Flaxseeds
Sardines, mackerel, and salmon

, The skin, like every part of the body, needs proper hydration to function optimally. Sufficient hydration can prevent dryness and flakiness, which will prevent wrinklingand make lines less noticeable.


The traditional guideline for water consumption is eight cups (one cup is equal to eight ounces, or 235 ml) per day. However, fruits and vegetables contain water, so eating them counts toward your daily hydration.The best rule of thumb is to listen to your body about water consumption, so if you’re thirsty, drink up!

, Sugar in your diet can lead to wrinkles and sagging skin. Sugar molecules attach themselves to protein molecules, and when this happens it can damage collagen and elastin.While there are many foods that are good for you—such as fruit—that contain sugar, watch for added sugar in processed and pre-made foods.

, This is essential for healthy lungs, your cardiovascular system, and your body as a whole, including your skin. Exercise helps your skin because it improves circulation, increases the flow of nutrients to the skin, and removes dirt from the skin’s surface. Furthermore, it may also slow the skin’s aging process.Be sure to rehydrate your body after a good workout.

, Stress can wreak havoc on your skin and body as well as your mind, and the hormones your body releases in response to stress can exacerbate things like acne, psoriasis, rosacea, and eczema.Furthermore, stress can increase healing time in your body, so breakouts will take longer to go away.Yoga and meditation can be beneficial for your skin because they are both stress-relieving activities.

, Smoking, like stress, has a negative impact on your health, skin, and appearance. Smoking decreases blood flow, which is necessary for healthy skin. It also damages collagen and elastin, while the physical motions associated with smoking lead to wrinkles around the mouth and eyes., Sleep is important for many reasons, and healthy skin is just one of them. For one, when we sleep, our bodies secrete certain growth hormones, and this leads to collagen production., While a minimal amount of UV exposure is necessary for vitamin D production (20 minutes is enough for most people ), too much sun can damage your skin and lead to skin cancer. Furthermore, sun damage also causes the signs of premature aging, including freckles, age spots, and wrinkles, and it destroys collagen and elastin.Avoid the sun when it’s strongest, which is generally between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.Seek shade any time you find yourself out in the sun.
Wear a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF between 30 and 50 all year round. Choose cosmetics and moisturizers with an SPF as well.
Wear protective clothing that has a UPF (ultra-violet protection factor) rating. Wear long-sleeved shirts with high collars, pants, and wide-brimmed hats.

, Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells caused by DNA mutations, and the primary cause of these mutations is UV exposure. If you notice irregular changes in your skin or notice moles that weren't there before, talk to you doctor immediately. The most common signs to look for that indicate cancer or precancerous cells are:Moles that have irregular borders or asymmetrical features, have more than one color, or change over time.
Sores and lumps that are not caused by bites, scrapes, scratches, or bumps.
Blemishes, markings, or changes in the appearance or texture of your skin.

, It's important to be aware of things that irritate your skin, allergens, and other sensitivities so that you can distinguish between a regular reaction to something versus a skin change or condition that requires the attention of a doctor or dermatologist. There are many issues that can plague the skin, and you should seek medical attention if you notice symptoms including:Unexplained hives, blisters, rashes, or scaling
Weeping or oozing sores or pustules
Chronic inflammation, redness, itching, or discoloration
Moles, bumps, or scaly tumors (warts) that won't go away

, Using too many anti-aging products can actually over-stress your skin, making it look even older. No one product can fight wrinkles, dark spots, and tightness all by itself, so don't try and tackle them all at once. Pick the issue you most want to handle and focus your time and money on that -- you'll get the best results.If a product irritates your skin, stop using it.
Skin ages naturally, and you cannot stop this process with every cream and technique in the world. Instead, focus on keeping your skin healthy -- it will look young as a result.

, Daily moisturizing is one of the keys to healthy skin at any age, but it becomes even more important as you age. Your skin will naturally dry out over time, but you can keep it healthy by using a well-formulated moisturizer each day to keep your skin young and supple. No one product works for everyone, so get one that sounds appropriate for you.


Get a moisturizer with SPF 15-30 to help protect your skin against UV light for the best results.There are specially formulated moisturizers for dry, oily, sensitive, wrinkled, and many more types of skin. Getting one that feels right for your skin will help get the best results the fastest., The more vitamins and minerals you can get from your diet, the better. This only becomes more important as you age. However, you should consider taking a supplement as well if you are worried that you aren't getting enough skin-healthy nutrients. Good foods to aim for include:


Leafy greens, like spinach and lettuce.
Fish, especially those high in Omega-3's (salmon, freshwater white fish, etc.)
Berries, which are generally high in anti-oxidants., Anti-oxidants help prevent ""free radicals"" from damaging your skin's DNA. Luckily, anti-oxidants are made up of natural vitamins and minerals and are found abundantly in nature. While a diet high in antioxidants is important, you can also apply some it topically, right to your skin, for great skin health:


Acai oil
Green tea extract
Retinol, These products are considered great, safe ways to exfoliate your skin, remove unsightly dark spots dead skin, and help your skin stay young. Look for creams with a 5-10% concentration of one of the three following products, using once a day and gradually upping the frequency if it is comfortable:


Alpha-hydroxy acid
Salicylic acid
Hyaluronic acid, Many skin-care products claim they can ""completely erase wrinkles"" or turn back the clock twenty years on your skin. If these products really delivered on those promises, however, you would never see another wrinkle again. Keep your expectations low -- your goal should be healthy, happy skin, not the same skin you had when you were thirty.Even claims like ""clinically proven"" are actually baseless -- ""clinically proven"" just means that consumers were allowed to try the product before it was sold., As you age, taking care of your skin becomes just as important. Your skin care habits don't need to change radically as you get older. Remain vigilant about sunscreen, drink plenty of water each day, eat a healthy diet, and get plenty of sleep. If you keep these habits throughout your life your skin will remain vibrant and youthful."

Do not use soap. Soap has an alkaline pH and will strip your skin of its natural acidity leaving your skin dehydrated and vulnerable to bacteria. Most foaming cleansers will do this, especially Cetaphil because of its sodium lauryl sulfate content.
Don't use anything that makes your skin feel tight after rinsing. Use warm water that is not too hot. Sudden temperature changes in the skin can permanently dilate capillaries.

, Toners prevent any infections or re-absorption of bacteria. Take a cotton pad to wipe toner over your skin to remove any cleanser residue. Use an alcohol free, hydrating toner and let it air dry on your face.








After a wash, your skin is deprived of important properties that give it is natural elasticity, glow, and smoothness. Applying a toner is an extra boost to get these levels back to normal.
Always go for water-based toners. These are loaded with antioxidants without any other interfering chemical properties to hurt your skin or dry it out.
Avoid alcohol-based toners. They usually contain an astringent, which can irritate your skin and hurts the skin’s ability to repair itself.
Avoid fragrant toners. These do little more than make your face smell good. Also, just like cologne or perfume, people can run the risks of having an allergic reaction. If this happens to you, it can cause irritation or damage to your skin.

, Only if you are very oily or acne-prone is it necessary for you to use oil free moisturizers. Use an SPF of at least 15 or 30 in your daytime moisturizer. Do not use an SPF at night. Night moisturizers are a good time to use something very nourishing or targeted to a specific skin issue.









Try to moisturize at least twice a day: once in the morning after washing your face, and at night before going to bed.
Go for oil-free moisturizers. Your body already produces enough oil on its own to keep your skin healthy. Any excess oil could run the risk of only worsening your skin problems.
Try moisturizing with Jojoba oil, which is close to your skin's natural sebum in consistency. It will also help to fade marks/scars.

, Do not be afraid of oil! It is lubrication for your skin and protects against wrinkles. There is no use in drying it up as it naturally carries debris out of pores. When you dry up oil from your skin, you dry up the water too. Your skin will produce more oil and it won't be able to get out because of cellular build up of dehydrated sticky cells on the surface.









If your skin is very oily and breaking out, you may need to have further tests done, so consult a dermatologist or esthetician for advice.
If your skin is still very dry, look into using a serum after toners and before moisturizing, and consult a dermatologist for advice
To counter extremely bothersome oil that creates an annoying shine, you can buy oil blotting paper to gently dab around your most noticeable area. Do not wipe with these; only blot.

, You can do this in several ways, so choose methods that feel most comfortable on your skin. Some people may find the feeling too rough, while others may need a harsher exfoliating method. On days when you exfoliate, do it after cleansing.









Use a scrub. Choose a gentle scrub (often creamy with rounded sloughing beads instead of jagged particles like nut shells) that does not leave your face feeling tight.
Exfoliate after you wash and use toners.
Be careful not to over-exfoliate as it can worsen skin problems. Rubbing skin with micro-cleansers or natural materials can be abrasive and damage pores if done too much.

, Items like broccoli, spinach or drumstick leaves can begin naturally cleansing your skin from the inside out. Keep in the mind that the more colorful a vegetable is, the better it is for your skin.


Most vegetables that are rich and vibrant in color have antioxidants, which naturally counter the aging process. Consuming regular amounts of antioxidants can help fight wrinkles and inflammation while protecting skin from the harmful effects of UV rays.Eating healthy looking vegetables results in healthy looking skin. The vibrant coloring found in vegetables is due to a special antioxidant (carotenoid). Eat vegetables such as peppers, tomatoes and carrots so your body can naturally absorb carotenoid to give your skin a natural radiant glow., Many fruits are loaded with antioxidants and necessary vitamins to maintain healthy looking skin. You can also make fruit smoothies, mixing different kinds to get multiple benefits in one easy snack. There are many fruits to choose from. Here are a few that are especially known for their skin care properties:Berries
Papayas
Avocados
Bananas
Aim for five portions of colorful fruits a day. This ensures you are getting a regular intake of antioxidants, but also that you are maintaining it.
Make sure to get your Vitamin C. This not only combats cold, but the vitamin is crucial in synthesizing collagen, which is vital in healthy looking skin.

, Too much sugar in your diet increases the amount of insulin, which leads to the growth of cells that can clog your pores. Fight unclear skin from the inside out with a less sugary diet.Tweak your diet to be more balanced. A little bit of something from all food groups cannot only benefit your skin, but your overall lifestyle.
Eat small meals more often. Instead of sitting down three times a day to have large meals, spacing smaller portions every two and a half or three hours will keep your blood-sugar level manageable.
Test yourself for dairy tolerance. Some claim that the testosterone in milk stimulates oil glands to overproduce oil, thus clogging pores. This may not be true for everyone, but you can try cutting out dairy products for a week or two to see if there are any results. Take caution and consult a doctor before removing dairy from your diet to see where else you can get your vitamin D and calcium.

, Dehydration causes skin problems. Without it, your skin loses its elasticity, becomes dry, and reduces your body’s ability to function to the best of its ability.Water clears toxins from your body. By removing these toxins in a natural way, there is little risk. Plus, your skin isn’t the only thing that is benefiting.
It boosts blood-flow. A good circulatory system means that nutrients, and waste, are moving smoothly and properly throughout and out of your body. Strong blood-flow in your skin also gives it a healthier look.
The addition of more water contributes to the natural synthesis of critical chemicals and other biological compounds your body needs. It is a natural bonder found in nature, and having more of it inside you only gives your body that extra helping hand to create compounds such as vitamin D.

, The main reason for going to a dermatologist is that they can tailor products and skincare routines specifically to you and your concerns.


Research in to potential dermatologists you want to see. Read reviews and articles on the company and actual doctors to see if they are legitimate, and suited for your needs.
Professional help on stubborn skin is help you may not be equipped to provide on your own.
Consider seeing a dermatologist as a last resort. Try using home remedies and changing your diet for at least two months to see if your skin clears or improves in ways you want it to. If this fails, then find help.

, Scar removal can be a priority for those who want healthier looking skin. These procedures can be expensive so make sure to look in to local professionals who can administer them at a price reasonable for you.This is a quick fix for visibly different looking skin. It can be done on your own with at-home with bleaching creams, or scrubbing brushes.
Look for microdermabrasion or dermabrasion procedures to remove top layers of damaged skin.
Removing scars can also even out the pigmentation of your skin.

, If you suffer from stubborn acne or other issues, a dermatologist can either recommend the perfect product(s) or procedures to get your skin back to its healthy looking self.A dermatologist can help you understand your own skin, why it is the way it is, and how you are perpetuating the problem or starting new ones.
Even if you don’t have a chronic skin issue and you notice something isn’t quite right about your skin, it doesn’t hurt to go in for a consultation with a dermatologist just to see what’s happening.

Understand the cause.,
Determine if you might have the right genes.,
Spend a little time in the sun.,
Set a limit on your tanning.",How to Get Freckles1," Freckles are a hereditary trait caused by an uneven distribution of skin pigmentation. A freckle occurs when there is a large concentration of the melanin pigment underneath one spot on your skin.Most natural freckles are small and essentially harmless. They tend to show up on areas exposed to sunlight, like your face, and these are probably the type you're longing for. They also range in color and may be tan, brown, black, yellow, or red.
Sometimes freckles form as the result of sunburn. These are larger and often have irregular borders. While regular freckles usually fade after sunlight exposure decreases, sunburn freckles stay put.;
, If there are no freckles in your genetic line, you will not be able to develop natural freckles. The people most likely to develop freckles are those with red hair and pale skin, but freckles are not exclusive to this set of characteristics. People with dark hair are less likely to have freckles, though it is still possible for them to have them. People with light hair and light colored eyes are also more likely to have freckles.


To determine if freckles are in your family line, look at your family. Siblings, parents, grandparents, and others who you are directly descended from are your best sources to consider, but extended family whom you are not directly descended from still share some genetic traits with you.

, Freckles are drawn out with exposure to UV light. If you have natural freckles, spending a little time in bright sunlight might bring them out of hiding. Be careful, though - you should never stay out long enough to get a burn. Wearing sunscreen that's 20 to 30 SPF will still allow your skin to tan while protecting you from getting burned.


When UV rays hit the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin), it thickens slightly, causing the cells in your body to produce more pigment. As a result, the pigmentation of your freckles darkens, making them visible.
If you would rather skip the sunbathing, consider exposing yourself to UV rays at a tanning salon. Follow the salon's recommendations concerning the amount of time to spend tanning, since tanning too much in a salon can lead to cancer.

, Too much exposure to UV rays can be a major risk factor for skin cancer. Even though UV rays can seem like your best friend if you want freckles to form, they can have some very nasty side effects. As such, it is strongly recommended that you limit the amount of time you spend in the sun without sunblock or protective clothing.

Choose brown eyeliner tones.,
Draw small freckles on your skin with the lighter color.,
Fill in a few gaps with the darker tone.Use the darker shade to draw a few more freckles here and there.,
Soften the freckles with cotton.,
Apply a setting spray or powder.",How to Get Freckles2," Start with a brown shade with the same underlying hue of your skin. For instance, if you are cool skinned and have undertones of yellow, a tan would work better. If you are warm toned and have undertones of red, a richer hue of brown with burgundy undertones might be a better choice.You will need a light ash tone and another tone that is one shade or so darker.


An ash brown is a safe bet for most skin tones.
If you are not sure about what looks natural, compare the shades to the color of your eyebrows. The light shade should be two shades darker, and the darker shade should be another shade darker than that.

, Use the pencil to sprinkle small, uneven dots across the bridge of your nose and tops of your cheeks. Stop before you go overboard, since the freckles won't look as natural if you have too many.


Make the dots uneven in size as placement. They should all be around the size of the head of a pin, but some should be a little smaller than others, and they should be evenly scattered by asymmetrical.
Do not attempt to create a mirror image from one side to the other.

, People with natural freckles usually have them in more than one tone, since freckles darken with age.


Look in the mirror to make sure that none of the dots overlap.
This second layer of freckles should be fewer in number than the first.

, If you need to soften the freckles a bit in order to maintain a natural look, carefully and gently pat the area with your fingertips or a small piece of cotton. You could also use a clean eyeshadow blending brush to lightly buff over each spot.

, This is completely optional, but a quick sweep of either option will help hold your makeup in place for more time. A setting spray or powder will also make your skin appear glossier and healthier.

Lightly apply bronzer to your nose and cheeks.,
Choose an eyebrow pencil for drawing freckles.,
Draw a few small, scattered dots.,
Fill in the blanks.,
Apply a light sweep of foundation, if desired.",How to Get Freckles3," Use a large makeup brush to sweep a little bronzer along the bridge of your nose and across the top of your cheeks, along the cheekbone.Bronzer provides your skin with a slightly darker base for applying the fake freckles. Since real freckles are brought about by sun exposure, it makes sense to have slightly tanned skin beneath those freckles.


You do not need to sweep bronzer across your entire face. Doing so can make your overall skin tone look unnaturally dark.
Use a matte bronzer instead of a shimmery one for a more natural appearance.

, As a general rule, go for an eyebrow pencil that is two shades lighter than one you might use for your actual eyebrows. An eyebrow pencil is drier than most liners and do not turn out as dark, which is what you actually want for this look.

, Make sure that the pencil point is sharp before you start. Use the pencil to create small, light dots across the bridge of your nose and the tops of your cheeks, where you applied the bronzer.


Keep the freckles tight around the tops of the nose and directly under your eyes. Spread them out a little more as they go further down.
Make the freckles small, but not completely equal in size. They should vary slightly, with some being a little bigger than others, and they should not be obviously patterned or symmetrical.

, Stand back and check the way your freckles look in the mirror. Take the opportunity to add more dots, where necessary, to fill in any unnatural gaps. If necessary, pat the freckles with your fingertips or a small piece of cotton to soften them slightly.

, For dramatic freckles, do not use foundation. If the pencil you used was too dark, however, or you want to make your freckles look more subtle, lightly brush a powder foundation on top.


Do not use a liquid foundation since it will cause your faux freckles to smear and rub away.

Understand how cosmetic tattooing works.,
Consult a few professionals equipped for cosmetic tattooing.,
Discuss the look you want.,
Get the tattoo.,
Take care of your tattoo afterward.",How to Get Freckles4," Cosmetic tattooing is done with an electric needle that rapidly deposits ink pigments into the dermis layer of skin.Cosmetic tattooing is also known as permanent makeup. These procedures are often used to create the appearance of fuller eyebrows, permanent eyeliner, or permanent lipstick, but using it to create freckles has become more popular in recent years.


A hollow, vibrating needle will pierce through the top layer of skin and release a droplet of pigment.
While cosmetic tattooing is possible to remove, it is very difficult to do so, and your skin may never look the same again.

, To reduce the risk of negative side effects, like infection, make sure that the professional you hire knows what he or she is really doing.


Check each tattoo artist's credentials. Make sure that he or she is a properly trained and licensed aesthetician.
Get a recommendation from a plastic surgeon or former client. Speak with former clients, and ask to see before-and-after photos of freckle tattoos.

, The professional may have suggestions, but in order to get the look you really want, you need to have an active voice in the matter. If possible, go over a few photographs to determine which freckled look is right for you.


The tattoo artist will help you determine the best hue and shade of color for your freckles.
You should also discuss the placement of your freckles.

, When the time comes, schedule an appointment and get your freckles tattooed on. Before the procedure, the technician will sketch out the area that will be tattooed using a sterile surgical pen. Anesthetic gel will then be placed on the area to numb it. During the procedure, you can expect to feel a little stinging sensation.


Make sure that the aesthetician uses sterile gloves and sterilized equipment during the procedure.

, You will need to reduce the swelling with a cold compress and apply an antibiotic ointment to minimize the risk of infection.Follow the tattoo artist's instructions about how to take proper care of the area while it heals.


Note that immediately after the freckle tattoo is applied, the color will look dark. This should not be a cause for concern, though. The color will fade to its final shade after about three weeks.
If the area seems unusually swollen, painful, or red after the first few days, however, there is some chance that an infection or allergic reaction may have been triggered.

Choose a face pack recipe with ingredients that are easy to find in a local store.,
Know your skin type.,
Set aside a time to prepare and apply your face pack.",How to Get Fairer Skin With a Facial1," There are many types of natural, cheap, and easy-to-find ingredients that will help to lighten your skin while also enabling you to avoid harsh chemicals or expensive treatments.


Purchase ingredients such as plain yogurt, lemon juice, gram flower, turmeric, and saffron to naturally lighten skin.
Include ingredients such as milk, oatmeal, and honey to help exfoliate your skin and give you a healthy glow.;
, Different types of skin will have different reactions to the natural ingredients you will use in your face pack. Recognizing what type of skin you have will lessen your chances of having any skin irritation from your facial.


Avoid lemon juice if you have particularly sensitive skin. If you aren’t sure if lemon will irritate your skin, try diluting the lemon juice with water the first time you apply the face pack.
Include honey or olive oil in your face pack if you have dry skin. These ingredients will help provide essential nutrients and moisture to your face.
Seek out tomato-based face packs if you have oily skin. The naturally acidic composition of tomatoes helps balance skin pH to prevent excessive oil production. Use yogurt with any skin type. It contains lactic acid, which will be gentler than acid from citrus fruits, and contains many nutrients that are good for the skin.

, Making sure that your face pack is prepared and applied properly will guarantee the best possible results.


Ensure you have the necessary appliances on hand to make your face pack before you begin.
Prepare to dedicate at least 1 hour from start to finish. This time includes preparing your face pack, applying it to your skin, letting it dry, and washing it off.
Be prepared to maintain this routine at least 1-2 times a week to see results.

Check the label.,
Beware of false advertising!,
Purchase a moisturizer and cleanser designed specifically for your face.,
Select a fragrance-free body lotion and soap.,
Consider homemade remedies for sensitive skin.,
Avoid common irritants in hygiene and household products.,
Use oil-free, chemical-free makeup.",How to Get Healthier Skin1," Skincare products face much less governmental regulation than food products, so an item's availability on the market doesn’t necessarily mean it's safe. Because of this, it’s important to check the ingredient list on the labels of your current skincare products as well as any news ones you’re interested in. Look for organic, herbal ingredients such as green tea extract, Vitamin C, acai oil, olive oil, and aloe vera.Be sure to avoid chemicals such as parabens, propylene glycol, fragrances, and formaldehyde.There are multiple nonprofit watchdog groups that maintain useful websites to help consumers decipher long and complicated ingredient lists. Take a look at safercosmetics.org, ewg.org, and breastcancerfund.org to learn about which products and ingredients are best and which are most harmful.;
, Phrases like “all natural” and “hypoallergenic” emblazoned across the label may seem promising, but they’re essentially meaningless.Opt for products with “organic” on the label instead of “natural,” as the term ‘organic’ actually denotes that the product meets stringent federal guidelines. You can also look for the European Union Compliance Seal, which means that the product contains no chemicals suspected to cause cancer or birth defects.

, The skin on your face is different from the skin on your body and thus requires separate, specialized products. For example, since it's thinner than the skin on your body, your facial skin needs retinol in order to preserve elasticity. The skin on your face is also more exposed to the elements and prone to oiliness, so make sure your face products contain SPF, oil-fighting ingredients, and blemish-fighting ingredients.Use your facial lotion on your neck and upper chest as well, as this skin is thin and exposed to the elements just like your face is.Opt for organic, gentle lotions and cleansers designed specifically for sensitive skin if you find that your skin gets irritated easily. They’ll be more expensive than your run-of-the-mill drugstore brands, but the vastly reduced chemical components will make your skin a lot less prone to rashes and flare-ups.

, Unlike your facial lotion, your body lotion only has one purpose: to moisturize dry skin. Since the skin on your body is thicker and less sensitive, these lotions can use more heavy-duty moisturizers like petrolatum which, if used on your face, would clog pores and cause pimples. Similarly, body washes and soap bars can use harsher cleansers and have a higher pH, which would parch and strip the delicate skin on your face.Just make sure that your body lotion is fragrance-free, as artificial fragrances are one of the most common allergens included in skin products.


While your body can tolerate these higher pH levels and harsh cleansers better than your face does, you might still want to go with a body soap that has a neutral pH in order to avoid drying out your skin.
If you have a history of eczema, use a body lotion containing tea tree oil or colloidal oatmeal in order to soothe existing rashes and prevent more from developing., If your skin seems to react poorly to even the mildest store-bought remedies, you could consider pursuing a nontraditional approach such as the oil cleansing method. In this method, you apply a mixture of botanical oils to your face and rinse it off afterward. The cleansing oils blend with the naturally produced oils on your face and flush them out when you rinse. Using as little as two ingredients and preserving the pH balance of your skin, this method is a great and cost-efficient way to remove natural oils without irritating your skin.One of the most popular mixtures includes two parts castor oil and one part sunflower seed or grape seed oil, among many others. Browse recipes on holistic beauty blogs such as crunchybetty.com or wellnessmama.com and experiment in order to find out what blend works best for you.

, Many hygienic products like deodorants and hair conditioner contain parabens, sodium laureth sulfate, and ethanolamines which can irritate your skin. Even household solutions that you don’t apply directly to skin can cause allergic reactions and contact dermatitis. Check your laundry detergent and dryer sheets to make sure they are “free and clear” of all dyes and perfumes.Consider switching to all-natural household cleaners, or be sure to wear gloves when handling all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants., Many of the cheapest foundations with the heaviest coverage contain oil and clog pores, ultimately putting you at risk for increased acne. Lipsticks also frequently contain mineral oil—a known carcinogen—and petrolatum, so check that your cosmetics are oil-free and contain minimal chemical additives.Purchase your products from a manufacturer that eschews animal testing if you also want to support ethical production."

Every skin type is treated differently, so learning how to treat yours will give you the most radiant glow.;
, In order to test your skin to determine what type of skin you have, it's important to cleanse it with a mild cleanser to remove any excess dirt, makeup, and oils. Then, pat dry with a towel, but do not rub as you don't want to irritate your skin.

, After you have cleansed and dried your skin, wait about 30 minutes, and then test the skin on your T zone. Taking tissue paper or a napkin, gently press down on your T zone, making sure the entire area makes contact with the paper.


The T zone includes your forehead and your nose. Picture making a T, with the top of the T above your eyebrows and the length of the T along your nose.

, Remove the paper from your face and look at the dirt and oil left on it from your skin to determine your skin type. Here are some different things you might see:


Dry: Skin feels stretchy and taut, there are signs of flaky and dead skin after you've cleansed your face, and pores are small. With this skin type you'll need to take extra care in moisturizing it.
Oily: Shiny face and oil on the tissue, with large open pores. In order to achieve a glow with this face you'll need to keep the oil production down by using lighter products. You don't want your face to have a glow just from the oil!
Combination: The tissue will be oily because of the T zone, but your cheeks and other parts of your face may be normal or dry. This is a very common skin type and can be treated easily.
Normal: The tissue will have little oil and there will be no flakes of skin. This really just means that your face is healthy and produces the adequate amount of oil -- not too much, not too little. You'll still want to treat your face daily, though, to maintain its normalcy.
Sensitive: This won't necessarily show on your tissue, but it may show on your face after you've removed the tissue. Does your face look red or irritated? Do you often feel a burning sensation on your face after using facial care products? If this is the case, you likely have sensitive skin and will just need to take extra care when cleansing your face to make sure you don't use products that are too harsh on your skin.

, It's important that you follow this routine every day, because it provides your skin with the moisture and cleanliness it needs. Doing this in the morning will help kick start your day by giving you a fresh, clean face and then repeat the routine at night. 








People who have more sensitive skin or dry skin should only do this once per day, as cleansing your skin too much can dry it out even more and cause it to be more irritated. If you have dry skin, try following CTM in the morning and then removing your makeup and moisturizing your face at night before you go to bed.
Remember that exfoliating is also important. Exfoliate using a face scrub or an enzyme exfoliant two to three times a week for normal or oil skin, and one to two times a week for dry or sensitive skin.

, Buy a soft, gentle cleanser to wash your face with each day. Start by rinsing your face with warm water to help lift dirt out of your skin, and then using a cleanser to remove oil and cleanse your face. Put the cleanser on your fingertips and gently rub onto your face and neck using circular motions and working out from the center of your face. Then, rinse with warm water and pat dry with a towel.Make sure you get a cleanser suited for your skin type. When buying a cleanser there will often be information on the bottle explaining what type of skin type the cleanser is good for. You can also use natural facial cleansers that will probably be less irritating on your face.
A cream cleanser is more hydrating so it may feel more refreshing on your face and can be better if you have dry skin. However, you can also use a gel cleanser if you have more oily skin or want to remove makeup.
Always remove makeup before going to bed, even if you usually cleanse your face in the morning. Leaving any makeup on your face while you sleep will leave your face feeling more oily in the morning and can clog pores. You can use makeup remover or cleansing wipes to quickly remove any eye or face makeup.

, Take a cotton ball and pour toner over it, or dip the cotton ball into the toner and then swipe on your T zone and other affected areas. If you have oily skin, toner is great for targeting those problem areas. 








If your skin is dry or sensitive, be careful when using toner so it doesn't dry out your skin even more and always test toner out on a small area to see how it affects your skin. Some toners may be stronger than others so you'll want to read the bottles and do some research on what toner is best for dry or sensitive skin.

, Once you have cleansed your face, you can apply moisturizer to keep your face hydrated and healthy. Moisturizers come in all different types so you should be able to find one suited for your skin. Even if you have oily skin you'll want to moisturize it-- just buy one that is lighter and specifically for oily skin. Buying a moisturizer with SPF is a great idea to prevent sun damage during the day.








, Because the area under your eye is the thinnest part of your skin, it lacks a lot of moisture. Pat a pea-sized amount of eye cream under your eye around the orbital bone and let the cream soak into your skin. This can also help if you have dark circles under your eyes, wrinkles, or eye puffiness. 







, Are you feeling overwhelmed, overworked, or stressed out over something? Stress can cause an increase in acne, so monitor those things that are making you feel overwhelmed and try to find a way to cut them out of your life or reduce their impact to better your health.


When you are stressed your body releases stress hormones including cortisol, which triggers an increase in skin's oil production, leading to increased acne. Getting adequate sleep can also lower stress levels. When you lose an hour of sleep your risk of psychological stress increases by 14%. Imagine losing four hours of sleep in one night--- that increases your chances by over 50%! Try to aim for seven hours of sleep so that you don't run the risk of developing acne from stress related to inadequate rest. , Your diet is one of the most important parts to keeping clean skin. If you are eating a lot of fatty, greasy foods, or junk food, your skin is going to react to that food and be prone to more breakouts. Pay attention to the type of food you have been eating and see if it correlates to your breakouts on your face.


A diet that is high in refined sugars, also known as a high glycemic index diet, can also cause breakouts, so read nutritional labels and try to avoid foods that are high in these sugars., Although there are a lot of foods that worsen your skin, there are also a lot of foods that can benefit your skin, giving it the proper nutrients that it needs to maintain hydration and stay healthy. Some great things to focus on when choosing foods for your diet are:Selenium -- It's a mineral that helps protect your skin from gaining free radicals that can cause wrinkling, dryness, and some diseases. You can find these minerals in foods like Brazilian nuts, shrimp, lamb, tuna, salmon, whole wheat pasta, light turkey and cooked beef.
Antioxidants--These also prevent free radicals from entering your body. Colorful fruits and vegetables like berries, tomatoes, spinach, beets, squash, and sweet potatoes all have antioxidants.
CoQ10 -- This is a key antioxidant that decreases in your body as you get older. You can find this in salmon, tuna, poultry, liver, and whole grains. Some skin care products also contain this to prevent wrinkles.
Vitamin A -- This prevents dry, flaky skin and can be found in carrots, cantaloupes, and oranges along with leafy greens, eggs, and low-fat dairy foods. You can also purchase prescription acne products that contain Vitamin A called retinoids that will help treat wrinkles and brown spots.
Vitamin C -- This helps protect you from the sun and prevent sun damage. Find this vitamin in citrus fruits, red bell peppers, papayas, kiwis, broccoli, and brussels sprouts.
Vitamin E -- This is another antioxidant that can help save your skin from sun damage and prevent inflammation. Eat foods like nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, olives, spinach, asparagus, and leafy greens to obtain this vitamin.
Healthy fats -- Yes, some fats are good for you! Look for Omega-3s and Omega-6s to help create your skin's natural oil barrier, which keeps away dryness and blemishes while also making your skin look younger and smoother. You can find these fatty acids in olive and canola oils, flaxseeds, walnuts, and cold water fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel.
Green tea -- This is considered a ""magic potion"" for your skin because it can help stop inflammation, slow DNA damage, and prevent sun damage.

, Water is so important for your health for so many reasons, and drinking enough water during the day will give your skin that hydrated glow. Increase you water intake to eight glasses a day to help rid your body and skin of toxins.Just like any organ in your body, skin is made up of cells that, without water, will not function properly. Skin is one of the last organs to be reached by water you have drunk, so make sure you drink an adequate amount so that it hydrates your skin. , Exercising on a regular basis not only helps decrease stress levels, but it also increases your blood circulation which sends more oxygen to your skin cells and carries cell waste away. Keep in mind that sweat can cause breakouts, so make sure you practice proper hygiene after your workout., This cannot be stressed enough. One of the greatest ways to damage your skin is through overexposure to the sun. You may think you're getting that ""natural glow"" by tanning, but exposure to the sun without protecting your skin increases your risk of skin cancer and can create sun spots on your skin as well as make your acne worse through the inflammation of a sunburn. Anytime you go outside, put sunscreen on. Sunscreens are made for different skin types as well, so if you have oily skin, find a lighter sun screen with ingredients like avobenzone, oxybenzone, methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, and zinc oxide. You can also search for a label that says noncomedogenic, which means it won't clog your pores., This may seem silly, but acne can be triggered from the oils on your hands. Throughout the day, pay attention to where you place your hands. Are you resting your chin or cheek in your palm? Are you constantly picking at blemishes on your skin or swiping your hair out of your face? All of these things contribute to the oil on your face, which in excess can lead to more acne.


Your cell phone also carries a lot of germs and oils that can easily attach to your face. The heat produced by your cell phone can multiply bacteria and when you put it to your face to talk on the phone you are being exposed to much of that bacteria. Get into the practice of cleaning your phone with a wipe or hand sanitizer once a day. , Many people have skin that's discolored or splotchy, so evening out your skin tone to remove redness is an important step to achieve a healthy glow. Apply a tinted moisturizer, blending it in evenly over your skin. Make sure you use one that is similar to your skin tone (you don't want to use one that is bronze if you have ivory skin) and don't cake it on. Look for a tone correcting moisturizer that is relatively sheer.








If your skin tone is between two shades, choose the shade slightly lighter than your skin.

, Use a concealer slightly lighter than your skin. This will help cover blemishes, redness, and dark circles. Dab small amounts on your problem areas and blend in lightly with your finger. Applying this under your eyes to lighten them up and cover any puffiness or dark circles or anywhere you have redness or uneven skin tone is also a good use of the concealer.








Make sure to use just the right amount. If you use too much concealer and don't rub it in well, you will only draw attention to your blemishes. On the other hand, if you use too little, you won't be able to cover up your blemishes or problem areas adequately.

, Choose a bronzer that is a shade or two darker than your skin tone, and using a kabuki brush, dust your face with the bronzer and then your neck and chest to blend. Dip the brush in the bronzer, tap off excess bronzer, and use circular motions to apply. 








A kabuki brush can be found at most drug stores in the cosmetic section. It has a domed-shaped head for wide, even coverage with short, dense bristles. , To create a glow on your cheeks, choose a light pink or peachy blush and brush along your cheekbones. Smile in the mirror and applying to the apples of your cheeks, blend the blush towards your temples, only using enough that it creates a small glow. Blush helps prevent your face from looking too flat.







, This step is optional, but it can help highlight the contour of your face and creates a pearly radiance. Swipe the cream highlighter on the cheek bones, the tip of your nose, the cupid's bow (the center of your upper lip where it creates a concave), and along the arch of your brow. Then blend with your fingertips to make the highlights look natural. 







, Once you have finished your makeup, look at yourself in the mirror and admire your natural glow! This makeup style is supposed to look very natural, as if you aren't wearing any makeup, so if your makeup is visibly noticeable you might consider going a little lighter.

Don’t pop pimples.,
Avoid using steroid creams on your face.,
Stop touching your face.",How to Get Healthier Skin2," Many people think that they only need to wear sunscreen when they’ll be outside for extended periods of time or when the sun looks particularly fierce. However, you should wear sunscreen any day you’ll be outside even briefly, whether it’s sunny or cloudy. The sun emits UV rays at all times, so even a dark day or a quick trip to the supermarket can do damage to your skin and contribute to your risk of developing melanoma. Pick a waterproof variety with broad-spectrum protection that has an SPF of 30 or higher.While you should always wear sunscreen, be particularly vigilant between the hours of 10:00 am and 2:00 pm, as this is the time of day when sun rays are strongest.

Quit smoking.,

Stay active.,
Visit the dermatologist at least once a year.",How to Get Healthier Skin3," Your skin gets moisture from topical moisturizers, but most of its water supply comes from internal consumption. Unfortunately, it only gets the water you ingest after all of your other internal organs do. Because of this, you should make sure you drink at least the recommended minimum of water each day. This is particularly essential when it comes to retaining epidermal moisture.While there are minimal formal studies supporting this assertion, most dermatologists argue that they’ve observed the positive effects of plentiful water consumption in their patients.Drinking plenty of water has numerous other health benefits, such as boosting vital organ function, flushing toxins, and inducing regular bowel movements.

So, if healthier skin is your objective, you should aim to eventually get off nicotine entirely.

, Many people know that insufficient sleep can lead to dark circles and bags under their eyes, but few people know how important a good sleep pattern is to overall skin health. During sleep, your body regenerates cells throughout the body, including the epidermal cells. By skipping this regenerative process, your complexion can become dehydrated and its pH level suppressed.Also be sure to use sheets with a high thread count. Low thread counts are rougher and produce more friction when rubbed against your skin, causing a higher likelihood of breakouts and wrinkles over time.

, Your skin naturally produces its own oils, and these natural oils can keep your skin looking moist, fresh, and healthy. Cheeks with skin that have a healthy glow naturally look chubbier. If your body does not get the oil it needs, however, your skin will suffer, and your cheeks will look narrower.


Get oil into your diet. Cook with a healthy, beneficial oil, like olive oil. You could also eat healthy nuts on a regular basis.If you decide to apply oil topically, you can do so by gently massaging a healthy oil into the skin of your cheeks after washing and exfoliating your face. Use an oil like coconut oil, olive oil, almond oil, or avocado oil.

, Namely, you should avoid smoking and drinking since both activities cause your skin to lose elasticity. As skin loses elasticity, it becomes less flexible and takes on a sharper appearance, which will only make your cheeks look more narrow.

Put sunscreen on your face to protect the skin from harmful ultraviolet rays. Sun-related damage can dry out the skin, making your cheeks look gaunt and leathery.

, Use a clean, high-quality makeup brush to apply a shimmery powder blush over your cheekbones and brow bones. Brush it on lightly and use it with your usual makeup. The shimmer will catch the light and deceive the onlooking eye into seeing a plumper, more youthful cheek.


Avoid using cotton balls, tissues, or mini brushes to apply this blush. These utensils can create an uneven look, and as a result, the blush may not catch the light correctly.

, Make sure that any makeup you apply during the day is removed at night with a cleansing cloth or other makeup remover. Products specifically labeled for facial use or for the removal of makeup work best.


When you can get away without wearing makeup, do so. Keeping makeup off your face for a day or two gives the skin more of a chance to ""breathe,"" and as a result, the skin of your cheeks will ultimately be healthier.
Similarly, you should also avoid wearing heavy liquid foundations and creams, since these can smother your skin more than powders or mineral blushes and foundations do.

, Depending on how much fat you have elsewhere in your body and what the structure of your face is like, you might be able to quickly get chubby cheeks by moving fatty tissue directly to your face.


The procedure is long-lasting. Usually, about 60 percent of fat transferred to the cheeks will survive. Fat cells that survive the transfer continue to survive like any other fat cells in the body will, and it will behave as it did when located in its original donor area of the body.

, Fat grafting or Sculptra injections take a little longer, but the procedure is less invasive and might last longer. Small amounts of real or synthetic fat are gradually injected into layers of the cheek using a fine needle. You will need several procedures before you get the chubby cheeks you desire.

Make a homemade mask.",How to Get Clear Skin Using Home Remedies," If your reason for wanting clear skin is because of acne, learn about the condition. Your skin has a large number of glands and ducts (pores) surrounding hair follicles. Hair follicles or pores can get clogged with dried sebum (a natural skin oil), skin debris, bacteria, or dead skin cells. This causes acne, which can appear on your face, back, neck, shoulders, and chest.Acne includes blackheads (open comedones), whiteheads (closed comedones), pimples (pus-filled pores), pustules (large pimples), cysts, and abscesses. Cysts and abscesses are the deepest and most severe form of acne.Acne usually begins during puberty because hormones, especially testosterone, increase and stimulate sebum production.Acne can worsen from many kinds of makeup, especially those that are oil-based.
Mild acne constitutes fewer than twenty non-inflamed blackheads or whiteheads or less than twenty mildly inflamed, irritated pimples. You can treat mild acne at home with good cleansing techniques. See Clean Oily Skin.
A trained physician or dermatologist should treat moderate and severe acne. Moderate acne means you have more than twenty to one hundred comedones or pimples, with fifteen to fifty being inflamed or infected. Severe acne sufferers have more than one hundred comedones, pimples, pustules, nodules, and at least five cysts.;
, Dark spots can occur on your face from acne, excessive sun exposure, or hormonal imbalances. These brown spots result from inflammation, which increases melanin production and leads to hyperpigmentation.Increased estrogen from pregnancy or birth control pills can cause melasma (muddy-looking splotches) after sun exposure.Wear sunscreen with titanium oxide or zinc oxide.Avoid direct sun exposure to prevent dark spots.
Avoid dark spots from acne by treating pimples with 1% hydrocortisone cream to reduce inflammation., If your skin condition, whether acne or dark spots, is moderate to severe or affects your self-esteem, see a dermatologist. Your dermatologist can recommend treatment options to supplement in-home practices. He or she might recommend hormonal therapy or over-the-counter treatments such as topical benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.

¼ cup jojoba oil
15 drops tea tree oil

Don't pop pimples.,
Reduce pressure on your skin.,
Keep your hands off your face.,
Wash acne-covered areas twice a day.,
Choose water-based products.,
Choose salicylic acid for clogged pores.,
Remove dead skin with benzoyl peroxide.,
Use alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) for inflammation.,
Consider natural treatments.","How to Get Clear, Smooth Skin2"," It's definitely tempting to pop pimples. You may have even heard someone say you should. However, it's best to just leave your pimples alone. If you pop them, you could end up with scars instead. Also, if you pop a pimple, you are introducing bacteria to your face, which can cause more pimples. What comes out of the pimple can cause more pimples, too., Any kind of pressure on your skin, especially on your face, can lead to an outbreak of pimples. Headphones and cellphones can cause outbreaks, as can hats. If your shirt is too tight at the neck, you may develop acne there. Similarly, a backpack can put pressure on your back, causing an acne outbreak.Try to reduce the amount of contact objects have with your skin. For instance, try using the speakerphone on your smartphone when you can, and wear looser collars. Try a rolling bag instead of a backpack.

, Touching your face introduces bacteria. In turn, that bacteria can lead to more breakouts. Therefore, to keep your skin as clear as possible, try not to touch your face throughout the day., You're already washing your face twice a day, but it can also help to wash any area that has acne twice a day. Just use your hands, water, and a gentle cleanser.

When choosing products, look for ones that say ""noncomedogenic"" or water-based, as these products are less likely to clog your pores. Also, make sure your makeup also says ""noncomedogenic,"" so that it will be less likely to clog pores., Salicylic acid is an over-the-counter treatment that you can get as a wash or a leave-on treatment. Look for a concentration of 0.5 percent to begin with. If you're using a leave-on treatment, apply to the areas where you have acne, and rub it in. If you're using a rinse or soap, create a lather, and rub it into the affected area.Make sure you wash the cream off any areas that aren't affected by acne, such as your hands.

, Dead skin can clog up your pores, so some over-the-counter acne treatments work by removing that dead skin. Benzoyl peroxide is one of these treatments. It also takes off extra oil. Start with concentration of 2.5 percent. Like salicylic acid, treatments come in rinses and leave-on creams.Sulfur works similarly to benzoyl peroxide, though it can have a smell. It's often combined with other ingredients.

, Like benzoyl peroxide, AHAs remove dead skin. However, they also decrease inflammation and promote new skin growth. The combination can help give you smoother skin. Some common AHAs to look for are lactic acid and glycolic acid., Some natural treatments may be as effective as more traditional medications. It's still a good idea to ask your doctor before trying one of these treatments, though, as they can interfere with other medications you're on.Apply a gel with 5% tea tree oil. Some people find this beneficial in reducing acne, though it can cause a reaction in some people.
Azelaic acid, a naturally occurring acid, may also be beneficial. Try a cream containing 20 percent of this acid.
Try a cream with 2 percent green tea extract, which may help reduce acne.

, For more severe acne, your doctor may recommend an oral medication. These are medications that you take by mouth, so they work systematically rather than directly on your skin.Oral contraceptives (a combined type) are used for women, which can help balance hormones.
Anti-adrogen agents also work on hormones, but they block a hormone's effects on certain glands. This treatment is also for women.

This is especially applicable to hand creams that protect you from UV Rays. You will want to reapply these several times a day to protect your skin.







, Getting into the habit of daily care is important. Typically, a nighttime ritual is particularly favorable. You won’t be rushing off to work and moisturizers should have plenty of time to soak in.







, This will protect your skin and your nails. Your nails absorb water, causing them to expand. This process of contraction and expansion can weaken the nail.







, A moisturizing soap like Dove Beauty Bar will protect your hands from becoming overly dry. It also will not strip your skin of natural, protective oils, as many soaps do.








It is also better for your skin if you wash with warm, rather than hot, water.

, The key to good skin care is frequent moisturizing. Any moisturizer that you use for you face will work equally well for your hands. There are a great variety of creams available and little consensus as to which is best.

Examples include Regenskin, SyCream, Neocutis Bio-restorative Skin Cream, SkinMedica TNS Recovery Complex.The efficacy of these products has not been scientifically established, and the scientific community is split as to the likelihood that they work.For a natural solution, try mixing equal parts olive oil and sugar.

, Home paraffin wax units can be used to coat and moisturize your hands. Dip your hands in warm – not hot – wax to create a thick coat of wax around your hands. Place your hands in gloves and allow the wax to harden. After the wax has cooled completely, break off the coating to reveal a fresh set of hands.








Companies that market such products include HoMedics, Therabath, and Artemis Woman., Cuticles are the pieces of skin that surround your nail. Purchase a cuticle oil at the store and rub it around your nails. The oil should come with stick. Use this stick to push gently against the cuticles, allowing the oil to reach underneath them.








Other moisturizers should work, but might be hard to get underneath the nails.

, Moisturizers that contain urea, phospholipids or lactic acid can help prevent cracking.







, Massaging fingertips one a day will increase circulation and prevent cracking or peeling. Eating foods rich in calcium, like dairy products, will also keep you nails in good condition.









Some experts now also recommend taking supplements of the vitamin biotin, but the science is still out as to whether or not this will make you nails stronger., Experts now recommend using toenail nippers rather than traditional clippers, because they make it easier to see where you cut. Beginning at the corner, cut in an oval shape using multiple cuts. Use a file to even out the nail afterward.







, Begin by applying 2 coats. Then apply a nail polish of choice. Apply the top coat and then nail enamel.








, This will be bad for your nails and possibly even your teeth. If you find it hard to quit, talk to a psychologist to determine if there are underlying anxiety issues that they can help you with.

Shake your hair around, part it, and you're done!",How to Cut Fringe Bangs," Wash your hair thoroughly with shampoo in a shower or sink – for best results, try a high-quality one designed for your hair type. Make sure your hair is thoroughly rinsed of shampoo before proceeding.


Cutting your hair while it's dirty is not what stylists consider ideal. Unwashed hair has a good chance of containing patches of grease or product build-up, which can lead shears to slip and cut unevenly.;
, Most people don’t need to condition the bang area. But for those who do, conditioner will help relax your hair and make it much easier to deal with in cutting. Conditioner leaves a bit of moisture in the hair, allowing it to fall agreeably and become easier to manage.


Be sure to keep the conditioner at least 1 inch away from your scalp to avoid flat, greasy bangs.

, Dry your hair by taking sections and squeezing them gently with a towel, working from the roots to the ends before moving to a new section. A microfiber towel works best for this.


You can also use a blow-dryer for faster results, but be aware that heat causes changes in the hydrogen bonds that hold hair together. Too much heat can result in permanent damage.Don’t fret if your hair’s not completely dry. Actually, this might be better. Cutting completely dry hair gives you an immediate sense of the results but is hard to do and needs sharp tools. You may find it uneven when washed and restyled.
Cutting your hair while damp is easier – not dripping wet, just towel dried to even dampness. It’s more likely to give an even result. Your hair shouldn’t clump together or drip.

, Combing your hair will allow you to find an ideal length and measurement. The combing process will also detangle any hairs that have bunched up in the drying process.


To get rid of tangles and knots with the least amount of hair damage, use a wide-tooth comb, start at the ends of your hair, and work your way up toward your roots. , There are un-parted as well as parted bang styles. If you’re going for a long-side swept bang or a parted bang, you can part your hair where you normally wear it before cutting. Otherwise, let it hang down un-parted.


Bangs are essentially a shorter version of your current hairstyle, but help frame your face. Wearing it as normal will help you get a better idea of how you would like it cut.

, Section off the triangle of hair from the top-center of your head to the outsides of your eyebrows. It shouldn’t extend past the outer corners of your brows or the top of your head.Use a uniform triangular shape when you section the hair. For thicker bangs, start further back on your head. For less thickness, start closer to your forehead.
If your hair is layered, grab the strands of hair that are used to blend the front portion of your hair to the back portion. These hairs are often shorter and easier to transform into bangs due to their short length.

, Having hair out of the way can give you a better sense of how the bangs will look.


Working without hair potentially getting in the way can help you avoid mistakes and cutting unintended hair. A ponytail is also another look you may want to incorporate with your new style.

, Combing the hair out in front of your face will help you see when you are cutting as well as how short you will have to cut in order to see.


Don't be afraid to pull hair from further back and near the center of your head. This can often help avoid issues of thinness when your bangs are ready to be styled.

, Styling scissors can be bought at any beauty supply store. The scissors have a sharpness meant for hair. Common household scissors are meant to cut more coarse things like paper and plastic.


Beauty supply stores often sell scissors meant for hair at various sizes. Smaller scissors will allow for more control and may come in handy when shaping your fringe.

, Divide your hair into horizontal rows of no more than 1” thick. Then, begin at the bottom. Hold the scissors upright and line them up along your hair before cutting. Make minimal, vertical snips at your bangs that go along the hair rather than across. This will help avoid cutting your hair into a flat line.


For classic bangs, the shortest point should fall at the bridge of the nose between your eyes. Remember to cut less and leave more. You can always come back and cut more if your new bangs are too long.
You can keep your hair in position with a comb with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand.

, Move as little to one side as possible to ensure you're cutting all of your intended bangs. Continue making vertical snips along your hairs' ends. Cut as flat as possible - without cutting across - near the middle of your head and allow for longer strands as you work your way outward. After you've finished one side, repeat the process on the other.


Cut at a diagonal angle - about 45 degrees - to achieve an edgier, less blunt look.
Some bangs are straight across the forehead and longer as you get to one side. Other styles can be curved, with length that slightly increases toward the outside corners

, Keep working your way up toward the crown of your head, cutting as sparingly as possible and never directly across. When your bangs are there, you'll know it!


Cutting less and leaving more hair is a great way to avoid common mistakes like a crooked line or missing chunks.
Remember to be patient. Think of your hair as an art piece - nothing is perfect when rushed.

, Congratulations, you've achieved one of the most popular and fashionable hairstyles out there, all from the comfort of your own home!


Remember, if your bangs are still too long, you can always re-comb and re-cut. The same cannot be said about them being too short!
If your new bangs are too thin, pull hair from closer to the top of your head and cut accordingly. If they’re too thick, hold them up straight and cut into the ends deeply with vertical or diagonal snips.

If your face is about equally as long as it is wide, you most likely fall into the round, square, or heart shaped category. You will not, however, fit the oval shape category. If your face is a bit longer than it is wide, you may fall into the oval, square, or heart shaped faces. Your face is not round. ;
, Your jawline falls at the bottom of your face. It starts at the level of your lower ears and ends at your chin. Look carefully at the shape of this area, paying close attention to the perimeter.A pointed jawline will make a V-shape.
A round jawline is mostly circular. Look for more rounded edges.
A square jawline looks angular. It forms very clear lines that define the bottom of the face.

, Determine if this area is wide or narrow. Use the other areas of your face for comparison. If your forehead is larger or more prominent than the other parts of your face, you have a wide forehead. On the other hand, your hairline may come inward and make your forehead look narrow in comparison to the other areas on your face.

, The length of your face, your jawline, and your forehead dictate whether your face is round, oval, square, or heart shaped. Not all faces are perfectly square or oval. Use your judgment to determine which shape most accurately describes your face.


A round face looks circular. The jawline is round and the forehead may be wide or narrow. The face is equally long and wide.
A heart shaped face looks like a heart. The forehead is wide and the jawline is a pointed V-shape.
An oval face is long and round. The length of the face is longer than the width. The jawline is round.
A square face has even width from top to bottom. The forehead is wide and the jawline is square.
A diamond shaped face is widest in the center at the cheekbones. The jawline is V-shaped and the forehead is narrow.

, Ideally, your hairstyle will accentuate your eyes and make your face appear more oval. Since your hair frames your face, bangs will add an extra dimension to how you look. You can ask for any type of bangs, but it is best to choose a style that will flatter your natural features.


Round faces do best with thick and choppy bangs that create hard angles on the face. These might lay on the forehead or swoop across to the side. Most stylists do not suggest bangs that cut straight across the forehead for round faces. Heart shaped faces do well with several styles. Both side-swept and straight across bangs look nice as long as they are textured. Also consider curtain bangs that hit right at the jawline. Oval shaped faces are easiest to work with. Stylists agree that oval faces can pull off most cuts. Go for bangs that hit between the eyebrows and the eyelashes and are longer on the edges. That way you can wear them in front or swept to the side.Square faces need bangs that soften the angles of face, especially at the forehead. Consider shorter side-swept bangs or even frontal bangs with a center part. Avoid evenly cut bangs that make a line across the forehead. Remember that adding texture is key. Diamond shaped faces require mostly side-swept styles. These may vary from short and thick to a long swoop across the face. Avoid any bangs that are cut straight across the forehead. , Remember to think about what your hair does and does not do naturally. Your hair may be too flat or too curly to create the exact look that you want. Try side bangs or wispy bangs for thin hair. Remember that bangs will take away from any volume that you do have. If your hair is limp and gets greasy quickly, the same will occur on your forehead.Decide if that is something you are willing to work with!
Find a stylist that knows how to work with curly hair if you have curls. Have your stylist cut your hair dry so you know exactly where the hair will fall after shrinkage.

Tie your hair in a ponytail or half ponytail. Lift the ends of your hair to your forehead. Adjust the length and the part to test out different looks.

This also works with a fishtail braid. Just make sure to start high on your head and finish at the nape of your neck.
If you want to do a lower braid, try using a banana-shaped barrette instead of a clip. A barrette will be smaller.

, Open the clip and place it against your head so that the jaws of the clip are on either side of your braid and the end of your braid falls just over the hinge. The tail of your braid will be sticking out over the clip.

, Close it tight against your head so that the teeth of the clip lift your braid slightly. If your braid is too tight to insert the clip, use your fingers to loosen it a bit so you can insert the sides of the clip under it and fasten it toward the top of your braid.








, Now that the clip is in place, check for areas where it's showing. You want the braid to completely hide the clip from view. If you see a place where the clip is poking out, gently loosen that section of your braid just a little to cover it. Use bobby pins if necessary.

, All that's left is to tuck the unbraided tail of hair under and pin it in place. It might help to twist the tail before tucking it under. Hold the look in place with hairspray.









If your hair is too heave to pin up, just leave the tail loose.
Alternately, you could finish braiding the tail and secure it with a rubber band.

Dull scissors will produce jagged ends, damaging your hair. Test them on a piece of string to make sure sharpness is adequate., If you want your bangs to fall to the left, you should hold and cut them on the right, and vice versa. Gauge your target length more accurately by holding the bangs in front of the face. Imagine your cut beginning at the tip of the nose and falling to eye level, reaching the cheekbone.








, Start by separating a roughly one inch wide section of the hair closest to your nose and hold it flat. You will create a diagonal edge where this section will be where your hair is at its shortest. Once you finish one section, move on to the one next to it. Keep each section lined up with the others at the same angle.









While cutting, position your shears perpendicular to your hair and then point the tip of the shears down at an angle.Working with smaller segments will take longer but produce better results., Return your bangs to the position you want to keep it. Make sure your bangs are how you want them. Check how the angle and length looks on your face. Look for any uneven sections.

Just ensure that your razor is very sharp and has a single blade. Using dull tools or ones with multiple blades can cause split ends.Professional hair shaping razors come with ergonomic handles especially designed for cutting hair.
Using a razor for extremely coarse or curly hair might not be your best bet, as this sometimes also causes split ends.

, Start with the section closest to your nose. Just as you would with scissors, hold one section of hair at a time while cutting for the best look. Remember to keep your sections to about an inch long or shorter to prevent over cutting.

, Use your middle and index finger to pull your hair up to form a 90 degree angle with your face. Slide your fingers down towards the tips of your hair.

After the section is thoroughly teased, comb through the top layer of your tresses to mask the teased section with smooth hair.







, When creating a twist braid, you will need to divide your hair into two sub-sections instead of three. Like a french braid, you will continue to add more hair to each sub-section as you progress towards the end of the shafts.









Use your comb to create a ¼ inch section of hair along the inner edge of your side part.
Divide this thin sub-section in half so that there is a front strand and a back strand.

Style your bangs.",How to Cut a Fringe," If you have a long oval face with a wider forehead, try a blunt front fringe. If you have a smaller forehead and rounder face, try a side-swept fringe. The width of your fringe should be the length from one arch of an eyebrow to the other. You can make it slightly wider, but don't make it too narrow.


It is a good idea to google the type of fringe that will suit your face shape. Search for ""oval face fringe"" or ""round face fringe"".
Read up on the upkeep of that fringe so you don't cut yourself a fringe that needs straightening everyday if you do nod have a straightening iron;
, Put your hair in a ponytail to get it out of the way, then comb your bangs so they lay flat. This makes it easier to focus on your fringe, and it helps you see where they need trimming. Brush your bangs forward so your hair is covering your face.


Use a spray bottle to lightly mist your bangs with water. Comb through your hair to make sure there are still no knots, and to verify that your part is even. Never cut your bangs when your hair is completely wet, as wet hair is longer than dry hair and could result in you accidentally cutting off more than you intended. If you do cut your bangs when they're wet, be careful and cut less than you think you need to.

, Take a fine-tooth comb and brush your hair until it is smooth and tangle-free. For side bangs, you will need to create a side-part. Part your hair to the side on which it naturally falls. Make a parting as far back on your head as you want the fringe to start. Compare the section of hair left down at the front of your your head to your face to see how far down you want your fringe to come.


Then, take your index finger of your non-brushing hand and place it against your hairline so that your second knuckle is aligned with your hairline. Place the tip of the comb where the end of your finger lies; that will be your starting point.
Look for the arch in your eyebrow on the brow furthest from your comb. Line up the point of your finger with the arch of your eyebrow, and create a smooth line between the two.
Pin back all your hair that was not included in your bang sectioning. You will be left with the portion of hair that should be cut
If you have really thick hair, thin it down a little. Hold your scissors with the two blades opened very slightly. Hold your fringe out together and run your scissors vertically through it very fast.

, Insert the comb underneath your bangs and pull it down to where you want them to hit your forehead. Next, holding your scissors vertically, make tiny cuts into your bangs (directly below the comb), starting at the middle of your fringe and working your way toward the outer left corner. Then, start back at the middle of your bangs and trim toward the right side.


Trim the left side of your bangs. Again, using the comb as your guide, insert it underneath your bangs and pull it down so that you can cut the outer left-hand side of your fringe more easily. This time, hold your scissors at a 45 degree angle and gently cut into your bangs. You want them to be straight across your forehead, and then gradually get longer toward the outer edges.
To trim the right side of your bangs, repeat what you did on the left side. However, if you're right handed, the left side can be harder to trim, so cross your right arm over your body (keeping it close, not up in the air) to help steady your hand. It's also a good idea to cut more slowly when you're trimming the left side of your fringe, and check your work more often to make sure you didn't cut too much.
Cut your hair in as few of snips as possible, making sure that you don’t miss any pieces. The fewer cuts, the straighter it will be. Cutting at the tip of your nose will give you long, side-swept bangs, from which you can cut more off to create shorter bangs.
When cutting any bangs, do not use too much tension. Pulling the hair down too tightly can result in cutting your bangs way too short. They will spring up once they've been cut.

, By twisting the hair that you have in front of your face, you may find it easier to get a straighter and cleaner cut. Cut through your hair horizontally in a straight line. Once you untwist your hair, you should have a perfectly straight fringe.

, To lighten the fringe, cut directly up into the hair, about half an inch from the bottom of the fringe, towards the top of the forehead. This will make the fringe look less blunt. If you want the fringe slightly longer on the sides and shorter in the middle, instead of cutting the hair in sections, gather all the hair that should be in the fringe very tightly in the middle, and make a single cut at the height you want the middle of the fringe to be. This will create a naturally curved fringe.


If you want an asymmetrical fringe: either cut your hair in little lots, so that they are of different lengths, or hold your comb diagonally down and pull your hair towards the side you want longer, then cut along the edge of the comb.
If you want a side fringe, hold your hair at the angle you want your side fringe to fall at, and cut like you would have cut for the straight fringe.

, Using your fingertips to move your fringe around a bit, check to make sure that your bangs fall where you want them to—and that they're even. If not, repeat the process and then check them again. When you are satisfied, brush it out and take the rest of your hair out of the ponytail. Use a fluffy makeup brush to sweep away any tiny hairs on your face. You can also roll a travel-sized lint remover over your skin, which picks hairs off of your face in a flash.

, Hold a round brush at the roots of your bangs, and use a blow dryer to blow them from underneath over the top of the brush. Take a few minutes to make sure they are completely dry, and then swoop your new bangs to the side.

, You should only need a tiny bit, less than a dime-size drop. This little drop should be enough product to run through all your hair, and you should only use a tiny fraction of it on your bangs. Too much product in your bangs--whether it's a volumizing serum or styling spray--can weigh your bangs down and make your hair look greasy.


If you have curly hair, you may want to apply an anti-frizz serum so the heat from the blow dryer doesn't make your hair frizzy.

, Your hair is at its most fragile when it's wet, and you risk damaging and breaking the strands if you're trying to yank through knots and tangles as you dry.

Take a comb and place the tip of it an inch or two above your hairline, in the center of your head. You may need to go a bit further back, such as one inch or even to the high, flat part of your head where a comb will balance. Then, draw a downward diagonal line from the center of your head to the end of your eyebrow. Make sure that this is before the recession area where your hair drops down along the side of your head. Then, repeat on the other side. Pull your bangs section towards the middle to separate it from the rest of your hair.After you've done this, you should have a triangle-like shape with the point a few inches above your hair line and the sides of the triangle coming down along the sides of your forehead.

, If this is your first time cutting your bangs, it might be a good idea to keep your hair dry so you can cut it the exact length that you want it, but if you are just trimming your bangs, it could be good to spritz some water onto them so your hair is going in the right direction and lying flat on your forehead.








You can also try using a flat iron on your bangs to make them straight. It's important that your bangs don't have any wave to them, because you want to be able to get them as even as possible on your forehead.
Keep in mind that doing this with dry hair will be more accurate, but it may also be more difficult. Mist your hair all over with water to get the best results.

, Straight bangs can come in all different styles, so you'll want to figure out exactly how you want them to look before you cut them. Some people like their bangs to go straight across their forehead above their eyebrows for an edgier look, and others like longer bangs that angle down as they meet with the rest of their hair.

, Taking the hair you've gathered between your pointer finger and middle finger, create a straight line that is even with the tip of your nose. Your bangs will not end up this long, as they would cover your eyes, but this will be a good starting point so you don't have to make a perfect cut right away. Cut the hair below your fingers, but make sure you only cut the hair that is pinched between the front part of your fingers.









You can also use tape to create a straight cut. Place a piece of tape along your bangs, and cut a straight line below the tape at the desired length for your bangs.This is an excellent technique to ensure a straight line. Getting a straight line free hand requires very precise cutting and very sharp shears, so you may end up with a crooked line by doing a free hand cut.
Continue to cut your bangs in 1/4 inch increments until they are your desired length. If your bangs are wet make sure you leave 1/2 inch extra length on them, because when they dry they will shrink up.
If you want to angle your bangs downward at the ends, cut straight across from the middle of one eye to the middle of the opposite eye. Then, once you've reached that point, begin to cut at a downward angle. Then repeat on the other eye, cutting at a downward angle until you've reached the rest of your hair. You can cut a very steep angle, or you can cut a slight angle in your hair -- it all depends on how dramatic you want the diagonal of your bangs to be.Sometimes it helps to take your bangs and twist them once in your fingers, and then cut the straight line. This just pushes the hair tighter together, so you can just make one or two cuts. It also creates a small arch in your bangs, making them shorter in the front and longer on the sides.Make sure to cross check the length before you finish cutting. Check in the mirror and by placing strands of hair side by side to see if they are even.

, Once you have your bangs at the desired length, you'll want to make them look more natural (unless you are going for blunt bangs, in which case you may want a very straight line across your bangs). Take your scissors and make small snips at the tips of your bangs, making sure the scissors are parallel to the strands in your hair.








, Straight bangs usually need more attention, so you may have to straighten them or blow dry them every time you style your hair. If using a blow dryer, grab a round brush and pull bangs from underneath, up at the roots toward the ceiling. Then, once or twice pull your round brush underneath your bangs, from the roots of your bangs to the tips, in an arching motion to create volume. You can also do this same motion with a flat iron.

If you have bothersome skin tags or one that appears abnormal, make an appointment with your doctor for a consultation and removal. Let the doctor’s receptionist know the reason for your appointment so that your doctor can adequately prepare for your procedure.Show your doctor the skin tag or tags you want removed. Explain your reason for wanting the tag removed. For example, you could say, “This skin tag on my neck keeps getting caught on my necklace and I’d like to prevent this from happening again.”
Ask your doctor any questions about skin tags or the removal procedure that you may have.
Discuss your removal options with your doctor to figure out the best choice for your skin tags. Your doctor may use one of the following methods to remove your skin tag(s): cryotherapy, surgical excision, electrotherapy, or ligation.;
, Before your doctor can remove your skin tag, he or she will need to sterilize the skin surrounding it. This can prevent any bacteria from entering the removal site and causing infection.Allow your doctor to wipe the area with an alcohol swab or another disinfectant. It may feel cool on your skin, but will not cause you any pain.

, In order to minimize or prevent any pain at the removal site, your doctor will inject or apply a local anesthetic such as lidocaine. The injection may cause slight discomfort, similar to a bee sting. However, any burning sensation will quickly go away and you should be ready to undergo the removal procedure.Be aware that a small bubble may develop around the injection site. This is completely normal and will disappear.
Allow your doctor to probe the injection site to ensure that your skin is numb and ready for the procedure. Your doctor may use the tip of the injection needle to check for numbness at the injection site and surrounding skin. You should feel no pain or sharp sensations. You may feel a bit of pressure, which is normal, but there should be no pain. Make sure to let your doctor know if you feel any pain or discomfort when he or she probes for numbness.

, There are four general outpatient, in-office procedures your doctor may use to remove your skin tag(s). Talk to your doctor about the best option for your specific case and then undergo the procedure. Your doctor may use:Cryotherapy, which involves freezing the skin tag with a chemical agent such as liquid nitrogen. When your doctor applies the agent to your skin, it may sting and be painful. You may also have immediate swelling and redness. A few hours after treatment, see if a blister develops at the site. If it does, leave it alone and allow the blister to form a scab, which causes the blister to dry up. At this point, you will notice that your skin tag is gone.
Excision, which involves cutting out your skin tag. Your doctor may choose this option if the skin tag appears abnormal, if it is larger than normal, or is in a fold of skin. Let your doctor mark the incision site with a surgical marker that won’t stain your skin. Your doctor will cut around and under the skin tag with a scalpel and/ or sharp scissors. You may experience slight discomfort, but the anesthetic should control any pain. Your doctor may take care of any bleeding with cautery, which may hiss and smell like burning, but will not hurt you. If necessary, your doctor will suture the incision site with stitches.
Electrosurgery, which uses a high-frequency, alternating electric current to generate heat that will cauterize and remove your skin tag. Let your doctor use the electrosurgical probe to dehydrate or cut off the skin tag unless you have a pacemaker or cardiac-implanted device. Electrosurgery can cause these devices to malfunction. You shouldn’t feel any pain with this procedure, though you may have some mild discomfort. Be aware that you may see sparks if you have electrosurgery. There is also a risk of electric shock if your doctor doesn’t use the electrosurgical device properly.
Ligation, which involves tying string around the skin tag to cut off its blood supply. Allow your doctor to tie a piece of sterile string or even dental floss around the neck, or base, of your skin tag. Leave on the ligature for as long as your doctor specifies or until the skin tag falls off., In most cases, your doctor will bandage the site on which your skin tag was removed. This protects the area from debris or bacteria and can soak up any bleeding. Leave on the bandage for the time specified by your doctor to ensure optimal healing results., Following your skin tag removal procedure, your doctor will give you instructions about caring for the removal site. It’s important to follow these instructions to prevent infection and promote optimal healing of the site.


Make sure you understand your doctor’s instructions. Ask any questions you may have and don’t hesitate to call the doctor if you are unsure of something.
If you have excess bleeding or an infection of the removal site, then make sure that you contact a doctor. Your doctor maybe able to give you an antibiotic for infection.

, Your doctor may instruct you to cover your removal site with a bandage for a day or more after your procedure. Covering the site with a bandage protects it from infection and can absorb any fluid leakage or bleeding.Apply a new bandage with some light pressure if the site bleeds. If you have excessive or prolonged bleeding, contact your doctor.
Leave on the bandage for at least one day after your doctor removes the skin tag.
Keep the site as dry as possible to promote healing and inhibit bacteria from entering the wound. This includes not showering for at least a day after the procedure, A day after your removal procedure, change the bandages protecting the site. This keeps the area clean and dry and can help prevent infection or serious scarring.Choose a bandage that allows the removal site to breathe. Sufficient air flow can help heal the wound. You can get breathable bandages at most drug stores and at many grocery stores. Your doctor may also provide you with dressings for the wound.
Continue changing the dressing for as long as your doctor instructs or until you see no open wounds. Depending on your removal procedure, your doctor may tell you to discontinue covering the site with a bandage after the first day.

, It’s important to wash your hands with soap and water any time your hands come in contact with the removal site or change the bandages. This can help minimize the risk of infection at the removal site.Use warm water and any soap you have to disinfect your hands. Rub your hands with the soap and water for at least twenty seconds., Keep the removal site clean promotes healing and prevents infection. Washing the site every day with a mild cleanser or soap can kill any lingering bacteria.Use soap and water to clean the site, just as you would to wash your hands. Most soaps or cleansers can disinfect the site, though you may want to avoid scented products to avoid irritation. Rinse the site thoroughly with warm water to remove soap residue.
Apply hydrogen peroxide to the site if your doctor instructs you to do so or if you notice any redness that might indicate an infection. If the site seems fine, you may find that changing the bandages and washing it every day is enough to keep it clean.You may want to use an antimicrobial ointment to help with the healing process.
Pat the site gently dry before you cover it with a bandage., You may have mild pain or tenderness at the removal site after the procedure. Taking an over-the-counter pain reliever can alleviate pain and may reduce any swelling. Options such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or acetaminophen can effectively reduce any pain or discomfort you may have. In addition, ibuprofen can reduce swelling at the removal site.Ask your doctor give you a prescription for a pain reliever if you are experiencing severe pain.
Pain is generally mild and does not require narcotics, but you can take an over-the-counter NSAID for pain, such as ibuprofen or naproxen.

, Depending on what type of removal procedure you have, the site may have a blister or form a scab. In either case, don’t pick the site. Not only can this prevent infection, but also helps the site heal properly.Be aware that picking at the site can cause an infection or even make your skin form a larger scar than it otherwise would have., Give yourself and your skin a chance to rest after a skin tag removal. Avoid strenuous activities such as heavy lifting or that promote heavy sweating. Vigorous activities can cause bleeding and irritate your skin as well as enlarging the scar that may develop.Avoid bumping the removal site or doing any activity, such as yoga, that may stretch your skin. These can cause bleeding and stretching of your skin and may cause your skin to scar more profusely.

, If you have excessive bleeding, pus, or other signs of an infection at the removal site, seek medical attention immediately. A doctor can diagnose and treat an infection quickly, which in turn may prevent more serious complications.Remember that some bleeding or draining pink fluid is normal for a couple of days after the procedure. If the site is soaking bandages with blood, then you should seek medical attention. Other signs of infection that require immediate medical attention include: redness, heat around the site, swelling, discoloration of the skin around the site, abnormal smell coming from the site, or a red line originating from the wound towards your lymph glands.If you are concerned about a possible infection after following these guidelines, then talk with your doctor. He/she may be able to give you an antibiotic to help alleviate any redness, swelling, and pus.

Use your regular brush or comb to gently tug out any tangles so your hair is smooth going into the process.If you use any products, like a leave-in conditioner, apply them while brushing out your hair.;
, Curling wands usually provide several different settings, ranging from high to low. For the most part, start with the lowest heat setting possible as this provides the least amount of damage to your hair. If you find your hair is not curling at the lowest setting, increase the heat gradually as you curl.It can take some trial and error to find the right heat setting for your hair, so be patient. As you get used to using your wand, you should find a heat setting that works for you.

, Never apply any type of heat treatment to your hair without using a heat protectant first. You can purchase a heat protectant spray or gel at a salon or department store. Apply it to your hair according to instructions, working it in from your roots to your tips to ensure full protection.








If you also tend to use hairsprays or styling gels when styling your hair, apply these as well.

Do you work in a professional setting where you’re expected to keep your hair neat and precise? Do you imagine yourself with an edgier, more ruffled aesthetic? Formulating a plan will allow you determine the best length, shape and style for your bangs.Consider your hair’s specific texture, thickness, natural part and wave pattern when deciding on a cut.;
, Invest in a pair of scissors that have small, sharp blades and a smooth cutting action. This will make it easier to fine-tune your cut, since smaller blades won’t take off quite so much hair at one time. You’ll also be less likely to damage the hair than you would be by making do with a pair of clippers that aren’t designed for cosmetic use.Cuticle or mustache scissors are both well-suited for this purpose.
The sharper the scissors, the better. Sharp scissor blades will shear off hair effortlessly, resulting in a cleaner cut and preventing damage to the shaft of the hair.

, Start with a head of clean, detangled hair. Shampoo with warm water, rinse thoroughly and run a comb through your locks to tame the strands and remove any knots or kinks. That way, you can ensure that the cuts you make will be straight and precise.Treating frizzy hair with conditioner can impose some much-needed smoothness, making it look and feel better.Comb your hair down over your forehead. This will make it easier to section off and grab hold of.

, Don’t wait for your hair to dry completely before giving your bangs a shape-up. Hair is most easily cut and styled while it still has a little moisture in it, since it will be more malleable and have a little added weight. Your best bet is to wash your hair, wring it out or pat it gently with a towel and then proceed to take off unwanted length.Keep in mind that your hair will draw up as it dries, making it look shorter. You’ll want to be careful about clipping too much.
Rewet hair with a spray bottle so that it doesn’t dry out while you’re touching it up.

, For basic utilitarian bangs, you can clip evenly from one side to the other, beginning with the hair just in front of the temples. If you're cutting around a side part or going for more of a tapered style, plan to adjust the length of your hair accordingly around the forehead and ears. Having a specific style goal will allow you to decide where the most hair needs to be trimmed.Shoot for an appropriate length and shape that frames your face and highlights your strongest features.Keep in mind that your hair will have a tendency to drape where it's longest.

, Stop the comb just short of the ends, so that only about half an inch of strands are exposed. The comb will act similarly to the guard on an electric razor, preventing scissor-related accidents and giving you greater control over the outcome of the cut.Lift the hair up and away from the scalp as you snip.
Use a fine-toothed comb to grab and hold more hair.

, Cutting a section of hair straight across can result in an awkward blunted look. This is the last thing you want to do to the hair that highlights your face. Instead, hold the scissors perpendicularly to the comb and chop at the ends of the hair using the tip.Cutting at an angle decreases weight and produces lighter, more textured layers which make the hair appear fuller.
Make sure to get the ends of each section of hair down to the same length.

, Unlike cutting a piece of paper, where you use the entire length of the scissor blades as the cutting surface, when cutting hair you want to keep your movements conservative. Aim to take off just a little bit of hair with each pass. You’re much less likely to make mistakes than you would be by hacking off huge chunks with long, sawing strokes.Try not to remove more than about a quarter inch of hair at a time.

, Don’t get in too big of a rush while trimming your bangs. Start with the front and top of the crown, then work your way around to the sides, making sure everything is even and symmetrical. Cut a little bit at a time, then review your progress in the mirror. It’s important to remember that once the hair is gone, you can’t put it back.Err on the side of caution. You may be shocked by how big a difference a couple centimeters can make.
Be patient. It’s better to trim slowly and carefully than to try to go too quickly.

, Whether you work in an office, hate the feeling of your hair touching your forehead or just want to look a little more put together, a sleek fringe conveys order and maturity in a way that bedhead can’t. Wear your bangs on the short side and emphasize symmetry and angular cuts.For tidy cuts, your bangs should be the same length in the front as it is on top, or just slightly longer.
Trim your hair regularly to keep it from getting bushy over your ears and neck.

, Many men enjoy the cavalier character of strategically messy bangs. These styles are modern, low-maintenance and just wild enough to provide some allure without making you look sloppy. Tousled hairstyles are usually suitable for both casual and professional environments, as long as they’re not too shaggy.Tousled bangs can quickly go from cool to unkempt. Keep cowlicks and flyaways under control using a dime-sized glob of low-hold hair gel or pomade.Give these styles focus by making the transition in length gradual and bringing them to a point near the center of the forehead. That way, you won't run the risk of looking unkempt all over.

, Men who keep a distinctive part can trim the hair to slightly different lengths on opposite sides of the part. For instance, if you have a deep part on the left side of your face, leaving the hair longer on the right side will allow it to lay flat and drape more elegantly than hair that’s been cut to a uniform length. Leave hair the same length from the ears to the back of the crown so that the portion between the outer edges of the eyebrows draws all the attention.Let the longer side of the part lay over your forehead, or slick it back when you need to cut a dressier image.
Find your natural part by combing your hair straight up or down and seeing which way it separates., Hair that’s especially curly can start to assume a puffy mushroom shape as it grows out. To combat this, trim the hair behind the ears and around the temples nice and short and save the length for the front and uppermost portions of the crown. Staggered-length cuts will create much more flattering silhouette and keep men with mid length hair from looking like they lost a fight with a blowdryer.Shape the back and sides of your head with an electric razor on a low number setting.Use a dab of pomade and a comb or your fingers to pull your bangs down and forward to a subtle point.

, Taking the tip of a comb, draw a part an inch or two behind your hairline, perpendicular to your side part. (In other words, from side-to-side, rather than front-to-back.) If you are looking for thicker bangs, you can draw a part farther back. This will help separate your bangs from the rest of your hair.







, This is generally towards the center of your eyebrow, or the highlight of the brow, and it will help you gauge the width of your bangs. If you are starting off with bangs from scratch, measure a line upwards from the highest tip of your eyebrow to your hairline. Make a part where that line ends. Move the hair on one side of the part towards the middle of your forehead and pin the hair on the side of your head back to keep it out of the way.


After you have done this step, you should now have a section of hair in the front center of your face that is separated from the rest of your hair.
If you already have bangs, you should have a width already determined, so take your preexisting longer bangs and part them towards the middle, also separating them from the hair line.

, They should be about one to two inches thick. If you want thicker bangs, pull more hair forward from the horizontal part behind your hairline, and if you want thinner bangs, do the opposite by pulling less hair forward from your hairline part.








, Pull back the rest of your hair with a clip or bobby pins to separate it from your bangs. This will make it easier to cut your bangs without worrying about cutting the rest of your hair.








, This may require you to dampen your hair with a spray bottle if your hair is naturally curly and your bangs have some bounce. Lightly mist your hair with a spray bottle and comb through so that your bangs are flat. If your hair is naturally wavy or straight, cutting bangs in dry hair is best so that you won't cut them too short.Never soak your bangs or make them completely wet. Your hair is longer when it is wet, so anytime you cut wet hair, when it dries it will be shorter. To avoid cutting bangs that are too short, try to cut your bangs with slightly wet or dry hair.
If your hair is very wet before you cut your bangs, blow dry them until they are 80% dry. When blow drying, make sure you are brushing bangs straight down, or in the opposite direction of your part. Don't blow dry bangs downward in the direction they normally would lie. This will create a ""rainbow effect"" in which your bangs have a high arch to them. It's difficult to cut bangs when they are like this, so it's better to create some volume in the opposite direction.

, Before you cut your bangs you'll want to decide how long you want your bangs. You may want bangs that cover your eye, or you might want bangs that start above your eyebrow. If you're not sure, you can always start with longer bangs and cut them shorter.

, Section your hair along a diagonal line and pull it perpendicular to that line. In other words, you hair should be pulled out to the side of your head at a 45 degree angle. Then, bring any other hair you will be cutting out to this angle before cutting. Hold your bangs between your pointer and middle finger and cut the hair below your fingers.








If you aren't sure how long you want your bangs, start by cutting at the tip of your nose and ending in a diagonal at the bottom of your ear. This will create long, side swept bangs.
Make sure you are using scissors specifically designed for hair, as this will give you the best cut.
If you want shorter bangs, start near the top of the nose, in line with the eye, and cut at a downward diagonal towards the middle of your ear.
Always cut bangs longer when you start off -- you can always cut them shorter as you go, but you don't want your first cut to be too short, because there's no way to rewind from there. You can try cutting in 1/2 inch increments to make sure you don't cut too much of your bang off.

, After you have cut your bangs you may notice that there is a very straight line in your bangs. This tends to look awkward and unnatural, so you may want to give your bangs a little definition. Lift the hair back up to a 45 degree angle and cut parallel to the strands of hair in your bangs, making small snips at the tips of your bangs.









If your hair is really thick or you want your bangs to have an even more natural look, you can use a razor made for hair or a hair thinning tool to thin out the ends of your bangs.

, Use a blow dryer and a round brush, brushing your bangs up from the roots towards the ceiling or towards the back of your head. You never want to blow dry your bangs by brushing them straight down as this will leave your bangs with little volume. You can also run a flat iron through your bangs by pulling the flat iron upwards at your roots to create volume.


You can also blow dry your bangs in the opposite direction of where they naturally fall to make them lay flat and give them a bit of curl at the bottom. As they are close to being dry, flip them back over and blow dry as usual.

Make sure the sections are roughly equal.

, Un-clip your hair from one of the sections. It does not matter which section you start with. Take a strand of hair about an inch wide and hold your curling wand vertically at the side of your head. Starting with the tips, wrap your hair around the wand. Hold the hair for three to four seconds before releasing your hair from the wand. You should be left with a long, wavy curl.








If the curl is tighter than you want, run your fingers through it to loosen it.

, Keep curling your the section you started with strand by strand until it's fully curled. Repeat this with each section of hair until you have a full head of curls.







, Take the hairspray you regularly use. Give your hair a gentle misting. This should help your look stay in place throughout the day.

, Start towards the front of your head. For messy beach waves, work strand by strand. Using strands of about an inch wide, wrap your hair around the curling wand starting at the roots and moving down to the ends. In the front, curl your hair away from your face.







, As you wrap your hair around the wand, stop about two inches from the tips of your hair. Leave these last two inches uncurled for a loose, beach-like wave.







, As you finish curling the hair in front of your face, shake things up a little when you reach the back of your head. To create a messy appearance, curl your hair towards your face. Other than the direction you're curling, curl using the same process as earlier. Remember to leave the last two inches of your hair uncurled.

As you apply your gel, scrunch up the ends of your hair using your hands. This should result in your hair taking on a curly appearance.







, Take a blow dryer and gently blow dry the tips of your hair, messing them slightly with your fingers as you go. This will encourage further curling, creating the appearance of small, tight curls.







, Take a round brush and wrap it around the roots of your bangs. Then, pull the brush through your hair. As you pull the brush through, place your blow dryer just below your bangs. This will create a slight curved shape. Brush your bangs to either side, creating a part in the middle of your bangs.








Keep in mind, if you have smaller bangs, this particular look may not work for you. Longer side bangs tend to work better here.

, Wrap your bangs around the curling wand, starting at the root. Hold your bangs for a few seconds and then release them. You should notice a slight curl forming.







, Examine the tips of your hair. If you notice any of your ends lack the nice, tight curl you want, wrap the ends around the curling wand. Hold for a few seconds and then release your hair. This should create tighter, firmer curls. Add curls throughout the tips of your hair to create a nice, tight look.







, Take some hairspray and mist it gently over your hair. This will set your look for the day, keeping your tightly wound curls intact.

Cut your own bangs.",How to Add Bangs," If you're not certain whether bangs are the right look for you, try wearing a wig with a hairstyle that features bangs. This allows you to see how you look without making a commitment. Clip-in hairpieces that attach directly to your natural hair and cover only your forehead are also available.;
, Natural or synthetic hair can be added to your existing hairstyle to give you bangs, usually using glue or sewing the new hair onto your own. Weaves (also called hair extensions) can last for several months.

, While you can try cutting your hair yourself, most people will find that they achieve better results by leaving the job to a trained barber or hairstylist.

,


Wet your hair so that it is thoroughly soaked, but not dripping.






Decide how thick you want your bangs to be. For thin bangs, comb your hair forward an inch or so back from your hairline. For thick bangs, part your hair further back from your hairline. For best results, don't go further back than the point at which your ears begin.






Hold the hair you intend to cut with your non-dominant hand. Pull it forward into 1 narrow spot in the middle of your forehead. It should fit in the spot between your eyebrows.






Use a very sharp pair of hair-cutting shears to cut the gathered hair straight across.






Push the newly cut bangs across your forehead so that they fall the way you intend to wear them. Make sure that the bangs are level; if not, cut more off the longer pieces of hair until the bangs are even.






Hold your hair-cutting shears at about a 45-degree angle from the ends. Carefully cut several small notches into your bangs. This will ensure that your bangs hang naturally, not as a solid block. The notches should be 1/4 to 3/8 inches (6 to 10 mm) long.






Let your bangs dry, then check to see whether they look the way you want them to. If not, use your hair-cutting shears to make small adjustments as needed.

Gather your ponytail higher up on your head. You can leave your curls in ringlets or, once in a ponytail, brush them up to try to get a flip.;
, Follow steps 1-3 for a polished ponytail. When you get to step four (teasing your hair), tease the top quarter of your hair. Go for lots of volume. Flip the teased section of your hair back and gather it into a ponytail near the back of your head (gently smooth the front of this teased section). The bottom half of your hair will be hanging down. Gather the rest of your hair and pull it into a ponytail as well, directly underneath the top ponytail. Divide the lower ponytail in half and pull the ends in opposite directions to move the ponytail up and tighten it. Tighten the elastic another loop if needed. Take a thin piece of hair, wrap it around both ponytails and secure with a bobby-pin.

, Separate the top quarter of your hair and tease the underside. Flip it over and gently smooth the top; gather this into a ponytail at the back of your head and secure with a hair elastic. Next, create a french braid on both sides of your head, braiding towards the back of your head toward where you secured your top ponytail. Once you've completed both side braids, gather all the hair together into one ponytail.

, Start with a loose ponytail; this style works best with a fairly low ponytail. From the underside of the ponytail, reach up through the opening you've created, grab the entire ponytail, and pull it up and through the opening.


You can also wear this style in a half-ponytail. Gather only the top portion of your hair into a ponytail and flip it through, leaving the bottom half of your hair hanging down.

, Divide your hair into two sections by parting your hair down the middle of your head, and create a ponytail on each side. The position and placement of your pigtails can be optional: experiment with low, loose pigtails (situated low behind your ears), or high, tight pigtails (situated above your ears).


Classic pigtails are symmetrical (the same amount of hair gathered on each side).
This playful style works well for shorter hair that can't be pulled all the way back.

These products will help make it easier to style., Make sure you don't have any tangles or knots in your hair. Styling tangled hair can cause severe knots when you take down your hairdo. It's important to brush in the direction of the ponytail. That is, brush as if you are trying to sweep your hair into a ponytail, brushing towards the crown of your head. That means also flipping your head over to brush upwards toward the crown.







, Lift a small section of your hair about midway to the crown. Backcomb towards the roots gently with a teasing comb. This teasing helps round your hair and give it volume at the top.







, Hold the hair in place at the back of your crown with one hand. Smooth out with a brush or comb, but only do so lightly on the top of your head where you teased it.







, Pull the band around your ponytail onto the crown of your head. Twist the band into a figure 8 and pull the new loop back through your hair. Repeat this movement until the hair tie is tight enough that it stays put.








Do not use a rubber band, as that will tangle your hair. Always use a hair tie made for hair. You may need an extra thick one for a high ponytail.To look extra nice, take a small section of hair from the bottom of your ponytail and carefully wrap it around the elastic.

Use your eyebrows to gauge how much hair you should pull back. The section shouldn't be wider than your eyebrows.

, You can also try adding a poof by teasing the top section more than normal. Section away the top of your hair. Pull the bottom half of your hair into a ponytail. Hold the top section up, and brush the bottom few inches back towards your head, creating volume. Brush it more than you would in a normal ponytail You can also use a volumizing spray to help the poof along.

, Visually separate the length of your ponytail into four sections. Use three different ponytail holders to separate your hair into those sections, starting with the top one.








Move a couple inches down from your main ponytail holder, and add in a another holder, winding it back and forth until it's tight.Pull the hair a little bit in that section to poof it out.

Begin with unwashed hair.,
Use thickening spray or dry shampoo before you begin.,
Curl your hair.,
Tease the crown of your hair.,
You can flip your hair upside down and brush so then you get a nice style.,
Secure the ponytail with an elastic that matches your hair-color.",How to Make a Ponytail2," While you can wear a ponytail with freshly-washed locks, this style is great for second or third-day hair—even if you're aiming to create a dressy, polished look. You'll have fewer fly-aways, and the natural grease that comes from not shampooing will help hold your style and give you a bit of shine.Don't fear if you decide you want to wear your hair in a ponytail and have just shampooed: you can still style your hair into a polished ponytail, but may you need to use additional product to get the volume and texture you want.

, Spray on a bit of thickening spray or a little dry shampoo, focusing upon the roots of your hair. This will give you more volume and hold.


If you don't have either of these products on hand, baby-powder can work in a pinch. Sprinkle a small amount into your palm and massage into the roots of your hair. The baby-powder will help absorb excess oil and will add texture and lift to your roots.
Be sure to thoroughly brush the powder out, though, so that you won't have white or grey streaks throughout your ponytail.
You can even make your own dry shampoo at home. If you have darker hair, add a bit of cocoa powder to darken the final product—be prepared to develop a sudden craving for brownies, though!

, Use a curling iron to create soft curls or waves (curl your hair in 2-inch sections). Your curls will last longer if you lightly spritz the sections with hair spray before curling, or if you run a small amount of gel or mousse throughout your hair before you curl.


Alternatively, you can set all of your hair in hot rollers. Leave them in until they are fully cooled.
If you have longer hair, you can pile your hair high on the crown of your head, place into a ponytail, and then add rollers. This won't be your final ponytail, but is a way for you to curl your hair more quickly and efficiently.
Once your curls (or rollers) have cooled completely, loosely comb through your hair with your fingers. Don't use a comb or brush, or the curls will relax too much.
You can speed up the cooling process by quickly blasting your hair with cool air from your blowdryer (if yours has that setting) to help your curls set.

, Lift up a three-inch section at the front/top of your head and gently backcomb the underside with a fine-toothed comb. Gently smooth the front of the hair with a brush.

, Then gather your hair into a ponytail using either your hands or a brush. Do this carefully, so as not to brush out your curls and volume. For a classic ponytail look, center the ponytail midway between your crown and the nape of your neck (it should be level with the tops of your ears)., In order to make sure that your style will last and that no fly-aways will escape, give your hair a light misting with hairspray.

, It's up to you on which side of your face you want to make your part. Most people's hair falls naturally to one side over the other. For a natural look, go with your natural part. If you'd like a bit more volume at the top of your head, part your hair on the opposite side.


A good guide is to begin your part at the highest point of the arch in your eyebrow., For example, if you've parted your hair on the left side, gather your hair to the right side

, Choose an elastic that matches your hair, and consider wrapping the elastic with a thin piece of hair (secure the end with a hidden bobby-pin).


Alternatively, you can choose a fun ribbon, or tuck a flower step into your elastic

, Straighten your ponytail with a flat-iron if you have straight (or mostly straight) hair; this will make your strands even more sleek and shiny. For wavy or curly hair, use a cream to define and add separate your curls.

, Use your hands or a brush to do this; make sure that you don't have any major knots in your hair, but don't over brush it. You want to keep that slight bed-head look.

, Next, tie the two sections together as though you were beginning to tie your shoelaces.

, Once you've completed your knots, loosely wrap an elastic around the ponytail.

, If you're worried about the style staying in place, you can leave the elastic, but removing it will make your ponytail look even more casual and undone.

, Instead of securing and tying your hair at the nape of your neck, make a side part, and gather your hair below your ear. Divide the hair into sections and knot twice. Using a thin elastic, secure the hair directly under the knots.

",How to Do a Professional Ponytail," Slightly wet hair will be easier to shape to the desired style. Don't style your hair straight after the shower, since soaking wet hair breaks easily.


A squirt bottle works well for light dampening.
If your hair is dirty or oily, wash it, then wait until it is about 80% dry.;
, Two or three drops of hair serum will make your hair shiny and smooth. Massage it into the full length of your hair, from the roots to the ends.


A hair mask, hair shine product, or conditioner will work as well. Try a different product if you don't like the end result.
You can even use a natural oil such as coconut oil or olive oil. To avoid greasiness, use only a couple drops, and keep it away from your scalp.

, Use a thin-toothed comb if you have straight hair. Use a wide-toothed comb or brush if you have curly or afro-textured hair. Slowly run this downward through your ends until there are no more tangles. Repeat with the rest of your hair, starting from a higher point each time.

, Make a part starting right above the center or edge of one eyebrow, and part it over to the equivalent location on the other eyebrow. This will separate the hair on the crown of your head from the rest of your hair. Keep this hair in place with a hair clip.

, Brush the remaining hair to a central location at the back of your head, just underneath the part. Use your other hand to hold this hair in place as your brush. Brush until all of this hair is smooth, then secure with an elastic hair tie.

, Remove the clip, then slip the hair tie over the ponytail and push it as close to the scalp as possible. Hold the end of the ponytail firmly with your non-dominant hand. Brush as follows to make your ponytail smooth and tall:


Brush straight upward until the hair is smooth and bump-free. You may need to briefly relax the hand holding the ponytail so excess hair can slip through. Clamp down again immediately.
Place the brush midway up the ponytail. Brush a few strands at a time, first rolling them back slightly, then sweeping them down to the back of your head. Repeat until all the hair in the ponytail has been brushed back.

, Slip another hair tie over the two sections of hair. Adjust your ponytail and the hair around it until you're satisfied with the appearance, brushing down any loose strands or bumps.


Optionally, take a small portion of the first ponytail and wrap it around the hair ties. You can even braid it first for a fancier appearance.

, Press down on your head with one hand, and hair spray the hair around the ponytail. Once your hair is dry, you will have no fly-away strands, and your hair will exude a shiny, sleek, professional style.

A classic bun works with clean hair and hair that hasn't been washed in a day or two, but if you are looking for a more profession style, work with clean hair. If you are looking for create a messier bun style, you can work with either clean or unwashed hair.
You can also skip this step if you are trying to create an even messier bun.;
, Collect all of your hair using one hand, with an elastic hair tie around the wrist of the hand collecting your hair. Hold the hair at the location where you want to have your bun.

, With the hand not holding your hair, pull the elastic band from your wrist (from the hand that is holding your hair), and pull your gathered hair through the elastic ponytail holder. Wrap the elastic ponytail holder around your hair about 3 times, as if you are tying your hair back for a normal ponytail. On the third wrap of the ponytail, don’t pull your hair all the way through the elastic band. Instead, leave ½-⅓ of your hair hanging out the bottom as a tail, while the remaining portion of your hair will create a loop in the upper part of the ponytail.









Buns looks great on virtually all types of hair, but work better on medium length hair and longer. This is because longer hair ensures that all of the hair can fit in the bun and be pulled back evenly.

, Pull out little pieces of your hair to let them hang loose (for a messier look), or comb back areas that have flyaways. Consider using a small amount of hairspray to keep the flyaways flat to your head.









You can add different headbands, barrettes, or other hair accessories to give your bun a bit more of a personalized look.

Ballet buns look best with clean, slightly damp hair.

, Tie up your hair with an elastic hair tie that matches your hair color, if possible. Try to use a smaller elastic hair tie, as this will have a tighter, more secure hold on your hair.


You can create the ponytail anywhere on your head, although ballerina buns tend to be at the crown of the head either right on top, or slightly tilted toward the back of the head.
Ballerina buns look best with hair lengths that are medium to long. That’s because ballerina buns require wrapping your hair around itself, and with longer hair, the wrapping can be more uniform.

, Twist your hair, mimicking the movement of a tornado, until you are unable to twist your hair any tighter. Keep twisting, following the natural movement of the twist, and begin to wrap the twisted hair around the base of your ponytail. Once you get to the ends of your hair, bobby pin your ends under the rest of the bun, or use another elastic hair tie to hold all of your hair together.









If you have very thick hair, you can try braiding your hair after you make the ponytail, to make the twisting of your hair more manageable.

, If you want a sleek bun, you can spray hairspray onto your hair and use a comb to smooth out any flyaway hairs.









You can also use a hair or bun net to keep any shorter bits from falling out of the twisted bun.

Choose your bun maker.,
Ponytail your hair.,
Put the bun maker around your ponytail.,
Spread your hair.,
Secure the ends of your hair.",How to Make Hair Buns3," Bun makers are virtually all the same, so there’s not much decision making when it comes to picking a bun maker; it basically boils down to the size of bun you want. Choose a bun maker that matches your hair color. Bun makers generally come in blonde, brown and black colors. Since bun makers vary in size, choose a bun maker size that seems practical for your head size and how large you want your bun to be.


If your hair moves slightly, and the bun maker shows through, you'll want the color of the bun maker to blend into your natural hair color as much as possible.

, Gather your hair and tie it in a ponytail using an elastic hair tie. The ponytail can be at any height and location on your head.


If you want the bun to be sleek, make sure the ponytail is tight and without flyaways. You could use hairspray, mousse, or gel to smooth out your hair and prevent flyaways.
If you want a softer look, loosen the ponytail and possibly pull out the shorter, wispy bits at the side of your face. This will be a much more casual looking bun.

, With the bun maker around one of your wrists, grab the base of your ponytail with the hand that has the bun maker around your wrist. Then pull the bun maker off your wrist while still holding the ponytail, and feed your ponytail through the bun maker so the bun maker is sitting at the base of your ponytail and your hair falls down normally.








, Spread the hair from your ponytail around the entire bun maker so your hair looks like a fountain. You can smooth the hair over the bun maker by using a brush or a comb. Once the hair is evenly covering the bun maker on all sides, place a hair elastic over the bun maker and your hair. The elastic will pull the hair inwards, toward the base of the bun, underneath the bun maker.









Now you should have the perfect shape of your bun, with the ends of your hair sticking out the sides.

, Wrap these leftover pieces of hair around the bun, and use bobby pins or other hairpins to tuck them away out of sight. The bobby pins will also secure the bun to your head.









A good bun security test is to shake your head, quite hard. If you feel the bun wobble at all, try adding a few more pins to the base of the bun.
Your bun should be secure if you can shake your head and you can't feel much movement.

Use hair pieces.",How to Make a Gibson Girl Bun," The best natural hair type for this style is long, wavy, and thick. If you have wavy hair, don't straighten it. Likewise, if your hair is naturally stick-straight, you may want to put a bit of mousse or texturizing spray in it and blow dry it with a diffuser to try to give it more body and texture.

As with any up-do, day-old hair is best (that is, hair that you washed the day before, but not today). That's because the natural oils in your hair give it more grip so it won't slip out of your hairclips.
Unfortunately, this hairdo will not work if you do not have very long hair (at least halfway down your back). You can modify it a bit for slightly shorter hair.;
, Using a comb, make a neat part separating the back of your hair from the front just behind the ears, as if you were going to put it half up, half down.









Smooth your hair with a brush on the top and bottom.

, You want to hold this front section up with your arm extended above your head so that the hair goes straight up in the air. You are creating the volume for your hair style, and bigger is better for this style.

Smooth it by pulling gently on the hair from mid shaft to the ends, but don't smooth the hair right around your scalp or you will lose some of the volume., While still holding the front hair section above your head, use an elastic hair tie to secure it several inches from your scalp.The farther away from the scalp you secure it, the higher your poof will be, so choose where you'd like to place it based on how much size and volume you'd like in the final look.

, Now that the front section is secured, continue holding it up above your head and gather the rest of your hair behind it. Smooth the back section, now, the same way that you did the front section, holding it mid-shaft.You can use a hairbrush to ensure that the back section is smooth, and add volumizing spray, hair spray, or texturizing spray to this section for added volume.

, Holding the front and back sections with one hand securely, press them down toward the scalp so that you create a nice poof all around, front, back, and sides. Your hair should sort of sit on your head like a hat with a brim all around. Now, use your other hand to twist the top part with the other hand to create a bun.

It is important to hold the rest of your hair in place while twisting the bun, to maintain the poofiness of the hair style. Otherwise your bun will pull all the poof out of the surrounding hair.
Twist the length of your hair into a small, tight bun, and press the whole thing down onto your scalp., Using bobby pins in the color of your hair, secure the bun close to the scalp all the way around.You may need lots of pins, depending on the thickness of your hair. It is always better to use more pins than you need than not enough, or your hair style will fall out.

, You can use a rattail comb to lightly smooth the poof of your hair all the way around, using the end of the comb to tug lightly on the hair if it looks flat or doesn't poof out as much as you want.

If you like, you can carefully pull out a few small tendrils or curls around your face or ears. For added Victorian elegance, take a small-barreled curling iron and give these pieces extra curl.
Spray generously with your favorite hairspray to hold the style all day.

, Depending on your hair type, you can use certain hair products to give your hair more body and ensure that it stays poofy and doesn't fall flat halfway through the day.

A volumizing shampoo and conditioner is a great option for fine hair, but you can also try a clarifying shampoo (which removes all the product buildup on your hair) and no conditioner. That will help ensure your hair is less slippery from product while giving it more natural volume.
If you have naturally straight hair, add a texturizing spray or mousse to your hair while it is damp, distributing it evenly.
For naturally wavy or curly hair, apply a volumizing mousse or spray to damp hair, then blow dry using a diffuser with your head upside down until it is completely dry.

, Curls will give your hair a lot more volume and also are a more forgiving texture for up-dos, since you won't be able to see bumps or unevenness as well.

After applying a volumizing mousse, let your hair dry naturally or put it into curlers and let it dry overnight. If you didn't put it in curlers, once it is dry curl it using a medium barrel curling iron, and a small amount of medium hold hair spray after each curl.
After your hair is curled all over, brush it out all over using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb. You should have very poofy hair at this point, perfect for starting your Gibson Girl style.
If you do have curly hair, brush your curls to make them fluffy and frizzy, giving more volume all over.

, A hairpiece like a wig or extensions can be laid on your head when you part it down the middle. This will give extra body and volume.

You can purchase hair pieces at most beauty supply stores, or get a cheap wig from a big box store in your hair color. Roll it up and stick it on the top of your head when you part your hair down the middle., If you want authentic curls in your Gibson Girl bun, you have to forego the use of modern conveniences like curling irons!


Curl your hair using rag curlers for an authentic experience! You don't need any special equipment except for an old t-shirt or other cotton material.

, Authentic Victorian-era women didn't use rubber bands or clips in their hair. Their elaborate styles were obtained using hairpins.

Hair pins are not the same as bobby pins, and while you may have trouble finding vintage hair pins, you can purchase similar items at most beauty supply stores. They are often very ornate on one end and very sharp on the other.

, Because big, poofy hair was a status symbol among women in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, almost everyone added hair pieces to give more volume to their natural hair.

If you want to be truly authentic, save the hair from your hairbrush and tangle it together to create a ""rat"" of hair. This natural hair is placed inside your hair poof or bun to give it more volume, in a shade and texture that exactly matches your hair. The more you save, the more volume you will build! Victorian and Edwardian-era women saved their hair rats for years to create their iconic voluminous styles."

Choose the perfect styling products.,
Create a more sophisticated look.,
Add some originality, glamour or sophistication to your messy bun design.",How to Make a Messy Bun1," The following is a quick list of things you may already have around your home. Even if you don't have these things, don't worry, the messy bun can be easily created with just your fingers and a rubber-band. It is also easy enough to find all of the following items at your local 24-hour drug store. If you are thinking of creating a messy bun for a more important event like a wedding or prom you can plan ahead and find a store that specializes in carrying hair care products and accessories.


For the quick and simple messy bun up-do, you will need about 5 minutes, your fingers, and a rubber-band.
If you have more time, gather a soft brush, wide-tooth comb and an elastic ponytail holder. Preferably an elastic holder without a metal clasp to reduce the chance of hair damage.
Hair works best for a messy bun if it is two days after initial washing.;
, Select a light-weight mousse that will allow your hair to be easily pliable yet still appear soft and natural. For extra body, select a mousse that says it includes a volumizing agent. This will be displayed on the mousse bottle. If you have very soft and fine hair or want your messy bun up-do to last for a long time, pick out a hairspray that you like to ensure your messy bun stays intact.


For the most natural look, choose a hair spray with a micro-fine mist for minimal build up that you can apply and reapply without washing your hair.
For a more extreme edgy look, choose a hair spray that offers massive volume without stiffness.
If you have extremely soft or freshly washed hair, you can also experiment with dry shampoo or hair salt spray to add texture. (optional)

, Purchase some plain bobby pins, decorative flowers, bling gem-studded hair pins, small decorative hair clips, or similar hair items. When searching for such items remember to keep them delicate and classy. (optional)

Bring the bun up.,
Put the bun at different levels.",How to Make a Messy Bun2," Use your fingers to comb through your hair and bring it to the back or side of your head into a ponytail. Have your rubber-band within reach, or have your elastic holder placed on the wrist you're gathering your hair with. As you bring your hair all together, wrap the rubber-band around the whole of the hair until it feels secure but not too tight.








, Next, you can either spin your ponytail into a single strip and then wrap it around the rubber-band and stick the end back under the rubber-band; or when you are forming the initial ponytail, with the last wrap of the rubber-band, intentionally don't pull the hair all the way through - leaving a large bouncy loop of hair.









Pull the loop of hair further through the elastic ponytail holder to make the bun bigger and/or allow some of the strands to fall through for the ultimate messy look.
Grasp the sides of the bun and widen the bun's radius by gently pulling the edges out to the sides. Selectively tug on the center of the loop to give it more of a U shape.
Pull the ends sticking through the underside of the elastic to the left and right so that they’re more flared out against your head. Tuck any unwanted fallen strands back into the elastic. If desired, wrap a few loose strands around the elastic and pin them with a bobby pin.

, For a higher bun, flip your hair upside-down and gather it in your hands. This will increase your hair’s volume and help eliminate bumps. For a lower bun, gather your hair in the middle of your head or closer to the nape of your neck. The ponytail can be as high or low as you want it to be. Note that your bun will sit where you secure your ponytail (ex: high ponytail means a high bun).

Run the tip of a comb along your part to make sure it looks nice and neat., Gather hair from near your temples on either side and drape it over your shoulders. Comb out the back so the sections are separate. The larger your side sections, the bigger your braids will be.

You might want to use some bobby pins or hair spray to keep your hair in place at the top of your head.This works well for hair that is long enough to be secured at the top of your head. If your hair is too short, choose a low bun or a side bun instead.;
, This will add some volume and texture to your bun. Take a section of your ponytail and hold it out straight. Place a comb near the tips and backcomb toward your head, gently teasing your hair. Repeat with a new section until your whole ponytail has been teased.


Use a fine-toothed comb instead of a brush, since it's less damaging to hair.
You can skip this step if you prefer a sleek, glossy bun; however, it will be smaller with less volume.

, Simply gather it into two equal sections, so that your ponytail resembles a fishtail. You want each one to have the same amount of hair.

, Twist it downward and tuck it under the ponytail, so that it curves around like a crescent moon. Pin the ends under using several bobby pins. This creates the first half of the bun shape.


Don't twist your hair too tightly, or it might spring out of the bobby pins. Just do one or two gentle twists to give the appearance of a ballerina-style bun.
Make sure the ends are tightly secured and tucked up under the ponytail, so they won't show.

, Take the remaining section and twist it up and over the ponytail, then tuck in the ends and secure them in place with several bobby pins. Now the other half of your bun has been created.

Don't pull it too tight against your head, because you need enough room to weave your hair over it.







, Near the base of your elastic, poke a finger up from the bottom side of your ponytail through the hair in the middle of your ponytail. Don't make this hole too big, since that can cause the ponytail to fall apart, Take a section hair from the loose hair on the left side of your head. Lay it over the top of your ponytail and pull it down through the hole in your hair you made on the right side. Pull the section of hair down so that it lays flat.







, Poke another hole up from the bottom on the left side near your ponytail. Then pull a section of loose hair from the right side of your head and lay it over your ponytail. Pull it through the hole you made with your finger on the left side until it lays flat over your ponytail.







, Once you've pulled hair through on both sides of your ponytail, the woven ponytail is finished. But you can use bobby pins to secure it if you want to feel like it has a little more structure. Start with the bobby pin underneath your ponytail, facing the back of your head. Slide it over the end of the piece of hair you've woven over the top of your ponytail up and into the hair behind your ponytail. Repeat this for the other side of your head.

, The base of the ponytail should rest near the middle of the back of your head. You shouldn’t pull it totally tight against your head, but it should be close so that it’s easy to twist your hair over it. Secure the ponytail with a clear elastic.







, Starting on the right side, separate a small section of your loose hair near the front of your face. Twist it back toward your ponytail. Lay it over your ponytail toward the left side. Then wrap it under the existing ponytail and tuck the end into the elastic.







, Repeat the same process on the left side, twisting a piece of hair, laying it over your existing ponytail toward the right side, and securing the end under the existing ponytail elastic. Repeat this process until you’ve twisted back both sections of loose hair.







, As you twist more and more of your hair, you’ll need to secure the ends of the twists with another elastic. Keep the new elastic close to the original elastic so that your hair will look loose in the ponytail once you’re done.

, This keeps that side of your hair out of the way while you work on the other side. It’s up to you which side you’d like to start with, just make sure one side is secured and out of your way.







, Start near the front of your face and near the part. Take a 3 inch (7 cm) section of hair and divide it into three equal, smaller sections.







, A plait is just the first section of a braid. To make one, cross the front and back strands over the middle strand. Start with the back strand – the one closest to the back of your head – and cross it over the middle strand. Then cross the front strand over the middle.







, After you’ve made the first plait, add another, small section of hair from behind the back strand to it. Then cross the thicker back strand over the middle strand. This allows you to incorporate more hair into the braid and keeping moving toward the back of your head.







, Instead, grab a section of hair from immediately underneath the front strand. Use this as your new front stand and incorporate into the braid by crossing it over the middle section. This creates a waterfall effect.







, Keep repeating the process until you reach your part. Then braid the loose hair at the end into a regular braid and tie it off with an elastic. You may need to pin it to get it out of the way as you work on the second braid.







, On the same side of your head where you created the waterfall braid, create a French braid. You should do this underneath, but close to, the first waterfall braid.








Divide a section of hair near the front of your face into three sections, using one waterfall piece as one of the sections. Cross the back strand over the middle, then the front. Once the first plait is complete, add the next waterfall section to the back strand, moving toward the back of your head.

, Once the French braid reaches your part, braid the loose hair into a regular braid. You should now have two regular braids from the first side of your hair.







, Take the hair on the opposite side of your head out of the elastic and repeat the whole process on that side of your head. Make sure you keep the braids close together to maintain the woven effect.







, Once you’ve finished braiding your hair, gather all four regular braids (the ends of the waterfall and french braids on each side of your head) into one ponytail near the middle of the back of your head. Then take the smaller elastics out of each braid so that the hair in the ponytail is loose.








You might need to gently brush or run your fingers through the loose hair in the ponytail so the hair looks evenly distributed.

, Don’t pull too hard, since you can pull the braids out. But pulling lightly on the edges makes the woven effect look thicker and more incorporated.

Bobby pin the strand in place.",How to Create a Knotted Ponytail1," For this variation of the knotted ponytail, you will only be adding one “knot.” This version can be created with any length hair, as long as it’s long enough to be put into a ponytail! Feel free to keep a part in your hair or brush all of your hair back. You can put your hair into a high ponytail, a low ponytail, or a side ponytail – place your ponytail wherever you prefer it. Hold the ponytail firmly in one hand.





;
, While you hold your ponytail firmly with one hand, use your other hand to grab a strand of hair out from the ponytail. Grab a small section, and begin wrapping it around the base of a ponytail very tightly. This strand of hair will actually act as your hair tie, or the “knot” that holds your ponytail in place. Continue wrapping the hair around the base of the ponytail until you’ve wrapped the entire strand.







, After you’ve wrapped the strand tightly around the base of your ponytail, you’ll need to pin it in place with a bobby pin. Choose a bobby pin that is the same color, or close to the same color, as your hair. You want it to be as invisible as possible. Then, open the bobby pin slightly and position it underneath your ponytail, so that it will be sliding upwards. Slide it up, so that it is securely holding the strand that is wrapped round the base of the ponytail.








You may need to use multiple bobby pins, especially if you have thick hair. Add as many bobby pins as you need until your ponytail feels secure.

Grab two pieces of hair from either side of your head.,
Tie these two strands into a knot.,
Add sections of hair from either side into your knot.,
Create another knot.,
Work more hair into the strands.,
Create one last knot to complete your ponytail.,
Secure your ponytail with a hair tie.",How to Create a Knotted Ponytail2," This hairstyle is similar to the simplest knotted ponytail, but it’s a bit more intricate and requires medium to long hair. Pick up a section of hair on either side of your head, right above your ears. Bring your hair to the back of your head.







, After you’ve grabbed your sections of hair and brought them to the center of the back of your head, tie them into a knot. Think about your hair like your shoelaces, and loop them around each other the same way you do when you tie your hair. Once you’ve created the knot, pull both sections of hair so that you tighten it against your head. Then, put both of these pieces of hair into one hand.







, While one hand holds the knotted hair in place, use your other hand to collect two more sections of hair, one on either side of your head. If you are familiar with French braiding, this will make sense. You are simply grabbing hair from either side of your head to work into your knotted style. Add a section of hair from the right side of your head into the right strand, and then do the same for the left.








, Once you’ve added more hair to the two strands, create another knot just like you did previously. Loop one strand over the other, and pull tightly to secure the knot. This knot will be right underneath the first one you created.







, Just like you did before, you need to pick up hair from either side of your head and add it to the strands. Hold your knotting strands in one hand, and use the other hand to pick up more hair. Add a section to the right strand and a section to the left strand.







, After you’ve added more hair to each section, you will create one last knot. Just like you did twice before, loop one strand over the other to form a knot, and pull tightly. This will create a third and final knot under the other two.







, After you’ve created your final knot, bring the two strands together. Hold it tightly with one hand. Using the other hand, grab an elastic band and tie your hair. From the hair tie down, it looks like a traditional ponytail. However, the three knots create a beautiful, glamorous looking base.

Pick up two strands of hair from either side of your head.,
Gather two more sections of hair from the side of your head.,
Grab two more pieces of hair.,
Continue tying knots until you reach the end of your hair.",How to Create a Knotted Ponytail3," This intricate knotted ponytail works best on people with long hair. Unlike the previous two ponytails, the knots continue all the way down the length of the ponytail, so it requires a fair amount of hair. After you’ve picked up two sections on either side of your head right above your ears, tie them into a simple knot. Pull the ends of each section to tighten the knot against your head, and then use two bobby pins to secure that knot in place.








Use a comb to gently tease the hair below the knot. This will create a lot of volume to your knotted ponytail, and also add texture that will help the next knots stay in place. This ponytail looks excellent when it’s messy and tousled, so don’t be shy about teasing.

, Add those two strands to the first two, so that you’ve created two bigger strands to work with. Once again, tie these two strands into a knot. Pull it tight, and secure it in place with bobby pins. Tease your hair below the knot again.







, Add them to the previous strands. Tie another knot. As you can probably tell this hairstyle is repetitive, so once you master tying a hair knot, you can create the look. Remember to tease your hair between each knot to add texture and volume, and help the hair hold the knots.







, The amount of knots you’ll need to create depends on how long your hair is. Once you don’t have enough hair to create any more knots, secure the end of your hair with an elastic band.Spritz your knotted ponytail with a bit of hairspray, and you’re all set!









If you don’t like the look of a hair tie, wrap a strand of hair around the hair tie and pin it in place with a bobby pin. Then, it will look like your beautiful knotted ponytail is held in place with yet another knot!

Let down your hair.,
Gently brush your hair to blend everything in.,
Pull your hair up into a mid-height ponytail.,
Touch it up.",How to Color Streak a Ponytail2," Most clip-in hair extensions are straight, although some are curled. You want your hair texture to match what you are putting in. This will help it appear more natural.


Alternatively, you can straighten or curl the extensions to match your hair.
If you have thick or frizzy hair, straighten it first to get it nice and smooth. If your extensions are curled, add some gentle curls to your hair with a flat iron.

, Gather all of your hair from ear-level and above, and twist it into a bun. Secure it at the top of your head with a hair clip. Your hair will now be divided into two sections: an upper section and a lower section.Use a rattail comb to section off your hair. You want the dividing line between the two sections to be clear and unbroken. This will ultimately make the extensions more comfortable.

, Hold the extension behind your head, with the comb part facing your hair. Turn it upside down, so that the comb part facing the ground. You will be inserting the extensions upside down into the upper section of your hair. This will make them lay smoother against your head and make them more comfortable to wear.Funky-colored extensions usually come in single wefts and combs. Plan on inserting 4 to 5 in this section.
Natural-colored extensions usually come in longer wefts. Choose one that has 4 to 5 combs., Hold the extension just below the dividing line between the two sections. Bring it close to your hair, and slide it towards your head and up. You should feel the little combs or teeth get caught in your hair.


If you are using single-comb extensions, insert them one at a time.

, You will feel or hear a soft click when you do. Let go of the extension once you close the combs. It will fall down the back of your head like a waterfall. It will look a little silly now, but it will look great once you put it up.


If you are using single-comb extensions, insert the rest now. Again, work one at a time.

, Undo the clip at the top of your head, and let your natural hair fall down. At this point, you can choose to move onto the next step, or add more extensions for a more-streaked look. If you decide to add more extensions:Section off your hair again, this time 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above your ears.
Add a 4 individual extensions or a 4-comb extension into the upper section of your hair, also upside down.
Let down your hair, and section it off one last time, 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) above your ear.
Add 3 individual extensions or a 3-comb extension. Insert this one as normal, comb facing up, into the lower hair section.

, You only want to brush the outer layer of hair. Do not go through the combs. If you do, you may accidentally pull them out, which will hurt., The ponytail should be right above where you inserted the extension wefts. Choose a hair tie that matches your hair color, and wrap it around the ponytail 2 to 3 times so that it is secure.


If you inserted multiple wefts, make a high ponytail. Position it between the top and middle wefts., Use your fingers to gently spread your ponytail apart in the back. This gives it some volume and reveals those streaks. You can also let down your bangs for a messy, natural look.

",How to Do a Sock Bun with Short Hair," You’ll need a clean sock that you don’t mind ruining. With short hair, it’s especially important to choose a sock that isn’t too long, such as an ankle or quarter length style. Go with one that’s a similar color to your hair too, so it won’t stand out if any of it peeks through.A sock with very firm elastic at the top works best because it will help keep the bun securely on your head.;
, With a pair of scissors, snip off the toe of the sock. Your goal is to create a tube of fabric that you can easily slip your hair through. After you’ve removed the toe, turn the sock inside out.








You only have to cut off enough of the sock to open it up. However, if you only have a long sock, you may want to cut off a little more so it fits your short hair better.

, Once the sock is inside out, begin rolling it up from the toe to the elastic. Continue rolling it until the sock forms a thick donut that you can slip your hair through.







, With short hair, you want the pieces to be as smooth as possible so they lay well in the bun. Use your favorite brush or comb to smooth out your hair and get rid of any tangles.








If you’re going for a messier, more textured bun, you can skip the brushing.

, The bits and pieces of short hair will lay more smoothly in the bun if you apply some product before you style it. Work a small bit of gel or serum through your hair with your fingers to keep the short pieces up and secure when you create the bun.







, Gather your hair together as you would for a traditional ponytail. Don’t pull the hair up too tight, but secure it with an elastic at the back or top of your head.








The spot that you place the ponytail is where the bun will wind up. While a traditional top knot it usually positioned at the top of the head, you can go for a low or side bun if you prefer.
If some stray hairs fall loose from the ponytail, don’t worry. You can take care of those after you’ve created the bun.

, After you’ve secured your ponytail, grab your sock donut and slide your hair through the center. Move the donut all the way to the base of the pony and then pull it back down so there are only a few inches of hair on the other side of the sock.








If you hair is extremely short, you may be better off pushing the sock donut all the way to the base of the ponytail. Instead of rolling your hair into the bun, simply divide the end of the pony into several pieces and wrap them around the sock to hide it. Pin the hair in place to secure it.

, While holding the sock donut in place at the end of your ponytail with one hand, use your other hand to divide your hair into three or four sections. Wrap each one around the sock and tuck the ends under of the donut to secure them.







, With the ends of the ponytail tucked under the sock, slowly begin to roll the sock to the base of your pony. Use both hands to roll so you can keep the hair in place as you go.








As you roll up the sock, your hair will be wrapped around it to hide it. If there are any gaps, you can move the hair around to cover the fabric once you’ve secured the bun.

, When you’ve rolled up your hair, use the elastic in the sock to secure it over the base of your pony tail. If the elastic is tight enough, the bun may stay all by itself. If the bun feels loose, though, use some bobby pins to secure it.







, With the bun secured, look for any stray, short pieces of hair that have come loose. Smooth them into place with your fingers, and use bobby pins to keep them in place.







, Short pieces of hair may need a little help staying in place in your bed. Use a flexible hold hairspray to lightly mist the bun, as well as the top, sides, and back of your hair, to lock it in place all day.

If you don’t have a sock the same color as your hair and are trying to make this hairstyle in a pinch, choose a sock that is a similar tone to your hair. For instance, if you have blond hair, pick a tan or light-colored sock. If you have dark brown hair, pick a black or navy sock.
Make sure that you use a sock you don’t care about, since you will be cutting it and won’t be able to wear it again.
If you don’t want to use a sock, you can also purchase a hair donut, which fulfills the same function as the sock. If you have a hair donut, you can skip to the next section.;
, Use a ruler to measure the sock, and make a mark across the sock one inch from the toe. This is the line you will cut at to begin the process of rolling the sock.







, Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut across the sock one inch (2.54 cm) from the toe. It’s ok if it isn’t a clean cut, since it won’t be visible. Discard the small piece of sock that you cut off.







, Starting at the ankle end of the sock and moving toward the toe end, roll the sock in the same way that you would cuff a pair of jeans, cuffing the shaft of the sock until you are left with a donut shape.








Put the fingers of both hands inside the shaft of the sock, with your thumbs on the outside, cuffing over your thumbs repeatedly as you work down the tube of the sock, until you are left with a donut shape that is approximately one inch (2.54 cm) thick.

, A sock bun is all about elegance, so it’s important that your hair is smooth and free of tangles. Brush your hair with a comb or hairbrush, starting at the ends and working your way up using downward strokes that go higher and higher on your head.









If you encounter any knots, don’t drag the brush through them. Instead, use your fingers to gently untangle the knot. When the knot is mostly untangled, use the brush to brush the hair directly under the knot, then gently brush over the knot until it is completely untangled.

, A sock bun has the best staying power when made using second-day hair, meaning that your hair is not freshly-washed. Because freshly-washed hair can be slippery, if you recently showered you may want to use a texturizing spray to give it more staying power.If you didn’t wash your hair on the day you are doing the bun, you can skip this step.

, Use your hands to gather your hair together into a ponytail and decide where you want the bun to be on your head. Most people choose to make a high bun, which adds to the elegance of the look. Hold your hair in a ponytail using your non-dominant hand.You may want to flip your head upside-down to make the ponytail, if that’s how you usually make a high ponytail.
The place where you form the ponytail will be exactly at the center of where your sock bun will be positioned. Keep this in mind as you decide how low or high your ponytail should be.

, Keep holding your hair in a ponytail, and use a brush to brush the top of your hair into the ponytail. This removes any bumps from the top of your hair and will make the whole look sleeker.







, Still holding onto your ponytail with your non-dominant hand, use your other hand to secure an elastic hair band around your ponytail. Make sure that the hair elastic is tight enough, as this will be the main element keeping your hair up.







, You may wish to tweak the top of your hair leading into your ponytail if it’s not to your liking. Add gel or mousse and gently comb the hair leading into the ponytail if you want to eliminate flyaways. If you want to add volume, use a comb to gently tug at the hair right above the hair tie to loosen it and create volume., Take the end of your ponytail with your non-dominant hand. With your other hand, take the sock donut you made. Poke your hair through until your ponytail is about two inches (5.8 cm) through the sock donut.








Do the process of rolling your hair in front of a mirror.

, Take the ends of your hair, which are through the sock donut, and bend the hair over the edges of the sock donut, splaying them over the donut to obscure it. Tuck the ends of your hair inside the other side of the donut, through the bottom of the loop.







, Grasp the sides of the sock donut with each hand, with your fingers on the top side of the donut and your thumbs at the back side of the donut, where the donut meets the hair in the ponytail.








Roll the ponytail into the donut by pressing with your fingers at the top of the donut, forcing your hair through and rolling the donut along your ponytail.
Essentially you are pulling the donut up through your hair, with your hair rolling along with it, since it is tucked into the base of the donut. As more hair gets inside and around the donut, the closer the donut gets to the base of the ponytail.
If you feel your hair coming out of the ponytail, stop rolling the sock and try to tuck the strands back into the ponytail. If you can't tuck them back into the ponytail, tuck them into the sock as you are rolling so that the hair gets incorporated.

, Your sock bun is almost finished! Look in the mirror for any stray or short hairs that may have escaped, and tuck them in to the bottom of the bun.








, For extra hold, pin the underside of the bun with bobby pins or hair clips. You also may want to lightly mist your bun with medium hairspray, since long hair is heavier and is more difficult to hold up than short hair.








Consider wrapping another hair tie around your hair as extra reinforcement when you're done. This will secure your long hair and ensure the bun doesn't sag or come undone!

Before you begin styling, brush your hair thoroughly to eliminate knots or tangles. If you wish, also use leave-in conditioner or other products that are designed to smooth hair and calm frizz.





;
, Once you have brushed your hair, pull it back behind your ears and onto your back. Hold your hair in one hand and use the other to brush or comb the top of your hair back to smooth down any bumps that may have formed when you pulled it back.







, Still holding your hair behind your head, split your hair down the middle into 2 equal sections. Try to make the sections of hair approximately the same size, but don’t worry about making them perfect, as your part won’t be visible in this hairstyle.







, Hold the left section of hair with both hands. With one hand, separate about ¼ of the left section of hair from the rest of the section. Take this portion of the left section of hair that you separated and cross it over both the rest of the left and the right sections.








Don’t let go of the section of hair after crossing. You will use this section of hair throughout the entire process of this hairstyle to make the figure 8 twists.

, Take the section of hair you are holding and loop it under the right section of hair. Keep the section of hair held in your hand.







, Still holding the same hair, loop the same strand of hair back over the hair that you just looped under on the right section.







, After you loop over the right section of hair, pull the strand of hair you are holding back over to the left and weave it under the hair on the left hand side.








This creates a single figure 8 twist, since you have returned the hair you were weaving back to its original side.

, Once you create this figure 8, give the section of hair you are weaving a pull. Pulling tightens the figure 9 weave in your hair so that the pattern is tighter and more distinct once you finish weaving your hair.








If you want a loose, casual-chic series of figure 8 twists that aren’t as defined, skip this step of pulling on your hair.

, Using the same strand of hair, repeat the steps of Part 2 to create more twists. Remember to tighten after each twist of the figure 8 to make the pattern more defined







, If you have shorter hair, you may come to the end of the strand of hair before you complete your desired number of twists. If this happens, take the strand and combine it with a new piece of hair from the left section, then use this section to continue making your twists.









Combining the hair will make a seamless transition that you shouldn’t be able to notice in your twists.

, Keep repeating the figure 8 pattern in your hair until you are happy with the number of twists in your hair. Three to six twists are generally a good range to fall into when you are making a figure 8 ponytail.







, Once you are finished making the figure 8 twists in your hair, use a hair elastic, preferably clear, to tie your hair in a ponytail right where your twists end.







, Some prefer to hide their hair tie to give the style a more polished look. To do this, take a strand of your hair about the same thickness as a finger and wrap it several times around the hair elastic until the tip of the hair. Then wrap the tip under the ponytail and tuck it into the hair tie to secure your hair.









If you wish, give your hair a spritz of hairspray. A figure 8 ponytail is a relatively secure hairstyle, but hairspray can help to tame flyaways.

This style can work anywhere on your head. For a high, messy bun, use your fingers to brush your hair into a high ponytail on the top of your head. For a low bun, gather your hair at the base of your neck.
If you need some texture in your hair, add some sea salt spray or dry shampoo.;
, After you have pulled your hair into a ponytail, twist the hair clockwise. As the hair is twisted, it will wrap around itself until you have one long twisted strand.









You can also twist the hair counter-clockwise. The direction does not matter to the overall look of the bun; it is purely up to your preference.
If you have unruly or thick hair, putting your hair in a ponytail before making a bun may help keep hair secure and in place.
For an extra bit of style, leave one thick strand loose. After securing the hair into a bun, braid this strand of hair and wrap around the base of the bun for added flare and sophistication. Secure the braid by tucking the end under the bun and using a bobby pin to keep in place.

Wrap the hair band around the bun until tight.









Don't worry about not getting the hair secured perfectly. A quick, easy bun has the ends of the hair sticking out. You can tuck the ends under the hair band if you don't want them sticking out.
An alternative is to use bobby pins to secure the bun instead of a hair tie. You will probably need between 4-8 pins.
You can also add ribbons, barrettes, or clips for decoration. Pull down a few strands for a flyaway, bohemian look.

If you have short hair, you don’t have to pull it into a bun. It will remain hidden under the scarf when you create the bun.;
, For a back of the head scarf bun, you’ll need a large square-shaped scarf. Create a triangle with the fabric by folding the scarf from one corner to the opposite corner.Depending on how large your scarf is, you may want to fold it smaller before creating the triangle. It should be just large enough to cover your entire head when you place the straight edge against your hairline.

, Once you’ve folded the scarf into a triangle, set it on your head so the long straight edge matches up with your hairline. The pointed edge of the scarf should fall over your head and cover your neck.








If the scarf is so big that the point of the triangle falls down your back, you should refold it, creating a smaller square from the material before the triangle.

, When the scarf is resting on your head, take the two ends and tie it in a knot at the nape of your neck. The knot should fall under the point of the scarf.








While you want the knot to be secure, don’t tie it too tightly. The scarf is more prone to slipping if you tie it too tightly.

, After you’ve created a loose bun, take the right end of the knot and twist it. Wind the end around the loose bun, and tuck the end under the bun so it won’t come loose.








As you’re wrapping the right end around the bun, pull it as tightly and smoothly as you can manage.
Instead of the loose bun that you started with, the bun should become more round and protrude further from your head when you wrap the end around it.

, After you’ve created the single strand, hold the end of it with one hand and the knot with the other. Slowly begin to wind the twist around itself and the knot in a circular motion to create a swirled shape that’s similar to a cinnamon roll.








Continue to twist the scarf into the bun shape until you have no fabric left.

, Once you’ve wound up all of the scarf into the bun, take the end and push it under the knot. You can tuck the excess fabric anywhere under the knot where it fits and will stay secure.

Slide the sock doughnut over the tip of the ponytail.,
Fan your hair out and tuck it into the sock.,
Roll the sock down, gathering the hair into a doughnut.,
Secure the bun in place.",How to Do a Doughnut Bun Without a Doughnut2," If you have an elastic sock (or even a stocking) that you don't mind cutting up, it's not hard to make your own bun doughnut. Follow these steps:


Find a (clean!) sock that has a good amount of elastic in the ankle. Ideally, it should be close to your hair color so it's hard to see.
Cut the toe off of the sock.
Roll from the new toe hole towards the ankle. You should get a small, bunched-up, doughnut-like piece of elastic.

, This is exactly how you'd normally make a ponytail, with no special changes. Gather your hair behind or on top of your head and smooth it into a single dense rope, pulling the rest of your hair tight. Secure it with an elastic.


If you just washed your hair or it's naturally a little slippery, it can be hard to get this bun to stay in place. Try using a texturizing spray to give it some hold., Now, hold your ponytail so it's pointing straight up. Use your free hand to spread the doughnut open and pop it onto the ponytail an inch or two from the tip. Don't roll it to the base yet.


If the sock doesn't quite stay on your ponytail, don't worry. It will get tighter as you roll it down.

, This part is a little tough. You want to take the hair at the end of your ponytail and spread it out equally in all directions. Roll the hair around the top of the sock and tuck them in underneath the roll. Move the doughnut down slightly to catch the hair.


If you have hair that isn't naturally very stiff, you can hold your ponytail up and let the hair fall around the doughnut. Then, just run your hand downward over the doughnut to gather the hair and tuck it in.

, As you roll the doughnut down, it should catch the hair and start rolling it up, making a doughnut-shaped bun that gets thicker as it gets nearer to the bottom.It can take a little practice to get this right, so don't get discouraged if you have to start over.


It should get easier to roll near the bottom of the ponytail.

, Once the doughnut has been rolled up to the bottom of your hair, you can hold it in place with an elastic band or scrunchie. You can also use bobby pins to hold particularly troublesome sections of hair down.


It can also help to use a little hairspray to give the bun a stiffer, stronger form.You can even make your own, if necessary.

Examine your lifestyle.,
Check in with your doctor or a dermatologist.,
Check your wardrobe.",How to Treat Chin Acne1," A variety of factors can contribute to the development of acne around the chin. Examine your own lifestyle to look for the culprit of your breakouts. If certain habits can be identified as the cause, they can altered or eliminated to lessen the severity of breakouts.


Are you a heavy make-up user? Greasy or heavily applied make-up can clog pores and have been known to cause breakouts. Applying less make-up or switching to a more natural brand or one that is labeled ""oil-free"" or ""noncomedogenic,"" can lessen chin acne.When you work out, do you shower immediately afterwards? Delaying showering after a work out allows any oils, dirt, and make-up on your skin to mix with sweat. These debris settle in your pores, causing a break out. Always at least wash your face after a work-out and, if you shower, pay special attention to rinsing the sweat from your face. If possible, remove your make-up before you exercise.Are you a smoker? Some studies indicate a correlation between smoking and acne. As smoking increases the risk for a wide array of health problems in addition to acne, it might be best to ditch the nicotine altogether.What is your diet like? A diet that's high in empty carbs, processed sugar, and dairy products is correlated with increased risk for acne. Eating healthier can have a variety of positive benefits, including reducing your acne.;
, Your acne might not be a simple matter of your lifestyle. Acne can be caused by underlying medical problems. If you can't identify a habit of yours that could be causing your acne, see a doctor to check for medical problems.


Hormones are often to blame for excessive chin acne. A doctor or dermatologist can do blood work to detect any hormonal imbalances that may be to blame for your acne and prescribe medications such as antibiotics or medications that restore hormone balance.In women, excessive facial acne is sometimes the result of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. This increases testosterone in the ovaries, causing acne. A gynecologist can help diagnose POS and offer treatment options to lessen the severity of symptoms., Oftentimes, the clothing we wear can affect our skin. Go through your wardrobe and look for any offending items.


If you have any known skin allergens, you may be unknowingly coming into contact with them in the fabrics of scarves, hats, and other items that have contact with your face. Read the ingredients list on any fabrics you use and look out for potential allergens.
Try switching laundry detergents. Oftentimes, the chemicals in some detergents are hard on skin and cause contact dermatitis, which is noted by red, acne-like bumps on the skin. If you're experiencing dermatitis, you might be mistaking it for an acne outbreak. Opt for a more eco-friendly brand of detergent and see if it helps.If you're a cyclist, bike helmets can contribute to the problem if chin strips are strapped on tight. While you shouldn't lessen the pressure, as you should put your own safety first, washing your chin after taking off your helmet could help with breakouts."
"
Alter your diet.,
Treat your skin better.,
Learn to cope with stress.",How to Treat Chin Acne2," What you eat can have an effect on breakouts. Certain foods, when consumed in high volume, can affect hormone levels and lead to breakouts. Switching to a healthier diet can help eliminate chin acne.


High glycemic are foods that tend to raise insulin levels in the body quickly. This affects our hormones, which can cause breakouts. Empty carbs, like white bread and white rice, sugary snacks, and starchy vegetables like potatoes are considered to be high glycemic foods and may have an affect on your skin.You might not be getting enough fat. While fat gets a bad rap from dieters, not all fats are bad for us. Essential fats, like those found in olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fish, can reduce the likelihood of breakouts.Dairy products have also been linked to the development of skin acne, particularly the over consumption of milk. Try soy milk, almond milk, and other milk alternatives., You might be causing your skin undue stress without realizing it. In fact, we sometimes worsen skin problems in attempt to eliminate skin acne.


Do not scrub too hard when washing your face or when applying moisturizers and skin creams. While you might be tempted to scrub extra when experiencing outbreaks, this is actually counterproductive. The bacteria that caused the acne gets spread around when you put too much pressure on your face. Be gentle when washing and moisturizing.Clean your face regularly. Many people neglect washing their face, causing bacteria to build up and encourage outbreaks. In the morning, as your face has had a chance to sweat and absorb debris, give your face a quick wash before hopping in the shower. Wash your face before bed as well, regardless of whether you wear make-up. Your skin is exposed to a lot throughout the day.Be careful of oil-heavy lotions, moisturizers, and shampoos. Such products can clog pores, causing breakouts and increasing the duration of existing acne. Look for products labeled ""noncomedogenic"" or ""nonacnegenic""to used instead.Wear sunscreen if you're outdoors a lot. The sun can cause skin to dry out, triggering acne. Make sure to shave your face carefully. Shave gently and only when you need to. It helps to soften your beard with soap and water before applying shaving cream. Try both electric and safety razors to see which works best for you.If your hair is oily, wash it every day and try to keep it off of your face when you can.

, Stress's effect on acne is twofold. First, the major stress hormone in our body is cortisol which can manipulate testosterone levels and lead to break-outs. Second, when we are stressed we tend not to eat and sleep right and don't always engage in as rigorous personal hygiene routines, resulting in breakouts.Exercise can have a dramatic effect on stress levels. It releases endorphins, which are neurotransmitters in the brain responsible for positive feelings. Regular exercise also increases self confidence and has been known to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years as a means to find balance and eliminate stressful thoughts. There are a variety of types of meditations, such as guided meditation, mindfulness meditation, and mantra meditation. Research meditation techniques online or ask friends and family members who meditate for advice. Find a type that's right for you. Even 20 minutes a day can greatly reduce stress levels.If your stress is related to pre-existing mental health issues, seek psychiatric care. You can find a psychiatrist through your doctor, your insurance provider, or if you're a student, through your university. Sometimes, psychiatric medications are prescribed to combat stress-inducing emotions and thoughts.

Discuss medications with your doctor.,
Invest in facial cleansers.,
Use tea tree oil.",How to Treat Chin Acne3," If your acne is severe, you might need prescription medication. Your physician can talk to you about your concerns and prescribe a medication that works for you. Your doctor may also discuss options such as laser, light treatments, chemical peels or microdermabrasion if your acne is stubborn.


If you're female, your doctor might prescribe hormonal birth control to combat acne. As birth control regulates hormones, it can reduce breakouts. However, talk to your doctor about your personal medical history as well as your family's medical history to make sure you do not have any preexisting conditions that would make hormonal birth control dangerous. Other common options for treating hormonal acne include an oral medicine called spironolactone, and a gel called dapsone gel.A variety of prescription antibiotics and creams are specifically used to eliminate or reduce acne. Most oral antibiotics are not recommended for long-term use and should only be taken for a 6 month period. Topical retinoids are commonly prescribed and can be helpful in treating acne and in preventing future breakouts. Your doctor, after discussing your medical history and any allergies or other concerns, will find a medication that suits your needs.
Take the medication only as the doctor instructs and be aware of any troubling side effects. If you have any issues with the medication, contact your doctor to see if you should cease taking the medication.

, Over-the-counter facial cleansers and benzoyl peroxide creams that promise to eliminate acne are worth a try if your breakouts are persistent.


Acne around the mouth and chin is particularly difficult to eliminate due to the skin's susceptibility to bacteria. Be sure to apply cleansers regularly, following the instructions carefully for the best results.Combining cleansers can be a great idea when it comes to stubborn chin acne. Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide can be used in conjunction. Together they not only kill acne causing bacteria but also clean out pores. This reduces and eliminating existing acne while also preventing future breakouts., Tea tree oil, which can be purchased at health stores and some department stores, can potentially reduce or eliminate breakouts.


Tea tree oil has a variety of antibacterial properties. As acne is often related to a bacterial buildup applying it to the skin can help curb breakouts. It also has a soothing effect on the skin, so it can reduce overall irritation.Dilute tea tree oil before use. Adding a drop of tea tree oil to a few dabs of aloe vera is a great home recipe to fight acne.While tea tree oil can improve acne for some, if you have sensitive skin it's best to avoid it altogether. People with eczema should be especially wary of tea tree oil as an acne cure."

Twist the ponytail around 180 degrees.,
Create the opening for the bun.,
Flip the bun over and tuck it down into the opening.,
Set your tucked bun style with your favorite hairspray.",How to Create a Tucked Bun1," Start with dry hair. Begin by brushing your hair thoroughly with a paddle brush to remove any tangles you may have. Using a comb or pick, lightly tease your hair at the crown of your head. This will add some volume on top.








If you want additional volume, apply a volumizing powder or dry shampoo to the roots on the top of your head. Then fluff your hair gently with your fingers.;
, Brush all of your hair to the back of your head using the paddle brush. Grasp the hair where you would normally place a regular ponytail. Wrap a hair elastic around it once. Then, when you wrap the elastic around the second time, don’t pull your hair all the way through it. Stop about halfway through and let go of the elastic.








This will create a messy half-bun, with the remaining ponytail hanging loose right beneath it.

, Grasp the ponytail section and twist the hair around so that it is now directly above the bun rather than below it. Use both of your hands to gently pull on either side of the bun, which will flatten it out and loosen it up a bit.







, Place your index fingers on the hair directly above the bun. Pull your fingers in opposite directions, pulling your hair along with them. Pulling the hair apart will create an opening, which is where you will tuck the bun and the ponytail.







, Use your fingers to push the bun all the way into the opening you created. Then tuck the rest of the ponytail inside the opening. All of your hair and the hair elastic should now be tucked neatly into the opening and no longer visible.







, Secure the style with bobby pins if you need extra hold or plan to be out in humid weather. If you’d like to soften the look a bit, pull out a few strands of your hair around your face to frame it. You can use pomade to define these strands.

Use a volumizing powder or dry shampoo to create additional volume, if desired.

, Start on the left side. Use your fingers to separate one chunk of your hair at the crown of your head. Then separate another chunk, approximately the same size as the first, right above your ear. Loosely braid both pieces and secure the ends together with a clear hair elastic.







, Then secure both sides of double-braids together with a single elastic at the back of your head. Make sure you secure them loosely. The braids should drape rather than pull.








, Hold the low ponytail in place with your hand, but do not secure it with an elastic. Use your other hand to gather the ends together and pull them up. Loop all of your hair around and tuck the ends down between the braids to create a loose bun. Pull the ends through and secure them in place with bobby pins.








For a slightly different look, create a very loose angled braid with your remaining hair, then loop it around to create the bun.

, If any areas feel loose, use a few more bobby pins underneath the bun to hold everything in place. Pull out a few face-framing pieces to soften up the overall look. Mist your entire head with hairspray.

Make sure you begin with dry hair.

, Gather a healthy chunk of hair on each side of your head, right above your ears. These separated pieces will create the twists in this look. Pin the pieces out of the way for now.







, Gather all of your remaining hair at the nape of your neck. Secure the hair with an elastic to create a basic low ponytail. Make sure you don’t secure the hair too tightly, since the end result should look slightly messy and softly frame your face.







, Unpin the sectioned-off hair and twist it all the way to the ends. Pull the twisted section back toward your low ponytail. Pull the end over the ponytail, covering the elastic, and secure everything with bobby pins underneath the ponytail.







, Repeat the exact same actions with the right section of hair. Make sure both twists are secure. If not, use a few more bobby pins to hold everything in place.You can twist the hair tightly for a polished look or twist it loosely to get an “undone” style.








, Take the end of the ponytail and roll it under to create a loop. Then bring the end of the ponytail up, right beneath the area where the twists meet. Pin the ends in place, underneath the twists, to create a loose bun.







, If your bun has any loose pieces falling out, secure them with bobby pins. If you prefer a softer look, feel free to leave the strands out. Pull out a few strands of your hair around your face to frame it. Don’t pull any of your hair too tightly or pin it too precisely, since the style should look slightly messy.

Pick a recipe or create your own.,
Gather ingredients.,
Make the mask.,
Apply the mask.,
Wash off the mask.",How to Treat Acne with Turmeric1," There are a variety of turmeric mask recipes that can be used on your face. These combine turmeric with ingredients that will both help your skin and help the turmeric stick to your skin. Common ingredients for a turmeric face mask include: honey, yogurt, milk, avocado, oat or chickpea flour, and lemon.


One recipe you can use is to combine two tablespoons of chickpea flour, a quarter teaspoon of turmeric powder, two teaspoons of honey, and enough yogurt, milk, or water to make the mixture into a paste.For a really simple mask, simply combine a quarter teaspoon turmeric with two tablespoons of honey. This mixture is easily applied to the face due to the stickiness of the honey.
Make your own special combination if you like! If you have any of the ingredients normally used in face masks on hand, simply combine what you have and use it.;
, You can find dried turmeric in most natural food stores in the dietary supplement section. You can also easily find it and buy it online. If you are interested in using fresh turmeric, look at your local natural food store.


Fresh turmeric is usually stored near fresh ginger in your store's produce section. It is not always available, so if you can't find it be sure to ask the produce worker at your store if it is available., Combine the ingredients of your mask in a bowl, being sure to mix ingredients completely. Whatever recipe you chose, make sure that the resulting mixture is liquid enough to apply to the face but not so runny that it will run off your face. This means that it should be the consistency of a thick mud.

, Apply the turmeric mask so it comes in direct contact with your acne. Use your fingers, or a spoon or small spatula, to smooth the mixture all over your face. Like with all beauty masks, be sure to avoid getting it in your eyes, nose, or mouth, as this would be uncomfortable.


Put a thin layer of the mask on your face. Some people worry that the turmeric will stain their face yellow. While there is little chance of this, you can remove any residual yellowness by lightly scrubbing the skin with a paste made of chickpea flour., Leave your turmeric mask on for at least ten minutes. You can leave it on for longer but most masks should be washed off after they have dried on your face completely, which usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes.This will allow the turmeric to come into contact with your acne. If you like, you can keep it one until it dries, which could be a long time depending on the ingredients of your specific mask.Wash off the mask with clean, warm water. This will make sure that all ingredients are removed and that they don't clog your pores, which would add to your acne problems instead of helping them."

Take turmeric in pill form.,
Add turmeric to your food.,
Drink a turmeric beverage.",How to Treat Acne with Turmeric2," While the anti-inflammatory properties of turmeric need more scientific investigation, many people take it regularly in hopes of reducing inflammation in general. If you want to treat your acne with turmeric, one way you can do that is by ingesting it and one easy way to take it daily is in pill form.


Consult with your doctor before taking turmeric to make sure that it will not interact with any medicines that you are taking and that it is safe for you to take.
Dried turmeric in pill form is usually available in all natural food stores but it is also available online.
In order to figure out dosing, follow the directions on the packaging of your specific turmeric pills.

, Turmeric is probably best known as a food additive and spice. It is used to turn foods yellow, including curries and mustard, and has a bitter taste.Try adding it to your favorite recipes to incorporate it into your diet.


One food that turmeric can easily be added to is rice. If using one cup of uncooked rice, add between one half and one tablespoon of turmeric powder to the rice before cooking, depending on the level of flavor and color you desire. The turmeric will turn the rice a bright yellow and will give it a wonderful flavor., Another way to take turmeric it to mix it into a tea or a milk and drink it.This will allow you to enjoy the flavor of the turmeric in a warm or cold beverage.


Turmeric milk can be bought at many natural food stores or can be made at home. If you want to make it, simply add a small amount of turmeric powder or fresh turmeric, between a quarter and a half teaspoon dry or one inch fresh, to a pot. Combine with one cup of your favorite milk, one cup of water, and additional spices, such as nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice, and then bring to a simmer. You can use traditional cow's milk or a non-dairy substitute, like soy milk. There are also turmeric products sold that are made to be mixed into milk that contain spices and sweeteners in addition to the turmeric.Turmeric tea is available from commercial tea companies in tea bags. You can also make your own turmeric tea with dried or fresh turmeric. Combine a small amount of turmeric, one teaspoon dried or one inch of fresh, with one cup of hot water. You can add a variety of ingredients as well, including cinnamon, ginger, honey, and lemon."

","How to Do a ""Ribbon"" Bun With Your Hair"," Run a brush or comb through your hair until it is smooth. It will be easier to make the bow if you have smooth hair so get rid of all those tangles!






;
, Your hair should be recently washed but completely dry. Though it may seem like it would be easier to work with wet hair, only dry hair will work to make the bow. Your hair needs to be able to fluff out--wet hair doesn’t fluff well.








, Making the bow on top of your head is the easiest way to do it, but you can also make the bow on the side or on the back of your head.









You can also make more than one bow. Make your hair into two bows on both sides of your head for a super cute look.

, Have hairspray, hair gel and bobby pins close by so you can secure your bow as soon as you make it. Running around the house looking for things to secure your hair with will pretty much guarantee that you’ll need to make your bow again.








, However, instead of pulling your hair all the way through your hair tie like you normally would, create a loop using half or three quarters of your hair. You should have a looped half ponytail and a long loose end of hair.








If you want to make a smaller bow using only half of your hair, follow the same steps but gather the top half of your hair up into a loop, rather than all of your hair. When you are done making the bow, you will have a bow that rests on top of the rest of your loose hair. You can make “ribbons” for the bow by curling specific strands of your loose hair.To create two bow, one on each side of your head, create two loops. One loop should be on the right side of your head, and the other on the left.

, Tuck the end into your hair tie. The loose end of your hair will eventually become the centerpiece of the bow. Tucking the loose end of your hair should leave you with what looks like a loose bun with the hair ends fastened underneath the hair tie.









You don’t want your loop to be too loose. If it’s too loose, the sides of the bow will be harder to control and may droop.

, You should put a dime-sized drop on your hand. Rub your hands together so that they are coated in the gel. Gel will help you sculpt your bow but be careful to only use a small amount or else your hair could be weighed down by the gel, making for a very droopy bow.








, These two sections will form the sides of the bow. Work with one section at a time. If you can, make this division in front of a mirror so that you can make sure both sections are even.







, You will come back to it after you finish the other side. Try to clip it gently so that strands of hair don’t get pulled out of the loop.








, Push the section against your head so that is lies flat. Place a bobby pin so that it runs from top to bottom at the base of the loop. The bobby pin should be under your hair so that it doesn’t show. Position another bobby pin so that it secures the loop from bottom to top. Then repeat this process with the other loop.







, Take your loose end of hair in front of the bow and pull it back and over so that it runs through the middle of your side sections. Make sure to tuck in all of the loose strands.








Another option is to create a braided centerpiece. Braid the loose end of your hair and then pull it back and tuck it into the middle of your bow. This will give your bow an even more intricate touch.

, Make sure that all of the strands are tucked in thoroughly. You may need to use a bit of hairspray to keep the hair in place.








, Connect the hair tie to the middle strand of hair with bobby pins. Use at least three or four pins to make sure that the centerpiece of the bow is secure.








Try to make the bobby pins as invisible as possible. Tuck them under your hair.
Use hairspray to control any loose strands trying to escape the bow bun.

, Use a teasing comb or your fingers to fluff out the bow and make it look fuller. If your hair is having a hard time keeping the shape of the bow on its own, try spraying some extra-hold hairspray onto each of the sections.

Wash your skin.,
Select your banana.,
Prepare the peel.,
Rub the banana peel over your skin.,
Let your skin rest.,
Continue to treat your skin with banana peels.",How to Treat Acne With Banana Peels1," Before you use the banana peel, you want to make sure that your skin is free from dirt and oils. Use a mild cleanser to clean the affected area, then rinse with cool water. Pat the skin dry with a soft clean towel.


Don't scrub or rub your skin too harshly. This will inflame your skin and could make acne worse.;
, You'll want to pick out a banana that is ripe. It should be yellow with black spots. Avoid bananas that are under-ripe (bright yellow with green tips) or over-ripe (greasy and black).


Using a ripe banana will also make it easier to wipe over the acne-affected area.

, Remove the banana from its peel. You won't need to use it to treat acne, so eat it or save it for treating another skin issue. Cut the peel so that it's easy to hold a chunk in your hand.


Banana peels contain vitamins A, B, C, E, and contain potassium, zinc, iron, and manganese. These nutrients can calm inflamed skin and and reduce acne outbreaks., Use the interior part of the peel that appears white. Take the chunk of banana peel and gently rub or massage your skin with it for about 10 minutes.


Every few minutes, you should check to see if the peel is still white inside. Once it's turned black, replace it with another piece and continue massaging your skin.

, Don't immediately wash your face once you've finished massaging it with the banana peel. If you can, wait until the end of the day to rinse your skin off with cool water. This will allow your skin to absorb the banana peel's nutrients.


If you can't wait until the end of the day to wash your face, try rubbing the peel on your face before you go to bed. In the morning, rinse your face with clean water.

, While you only need to rub your face with the banana peel once during the day, you should do this for several days in a row.After a few days, you may notice your acne begin to clear up or at least appear less red.


If you notice your skin becomes extremely irritated after using the banana peel, stop using it and give your skin a chance to rest.Consider seeing a dermatologist if your acne continues or gets worse.

Treat wrinkles or cracked heels.,
Create an exfoliating scrub.,
Try a moisturizing facial mask.,
Use banana in your hair.",How to Treat Acne With Banana Peels2," If you have wrinkles you'd like to treat or have very dry cracked heels, use a banana. Apply a mashed banana directly to the wrinkles or heels of your feet and let the puree sit. The bananas will moisturize your skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.


Specifically, the vitamin E in bananas can make your skin appear less wrinkled., Mash one ripe banana in a bowl until it's almost liquid. Stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of sugar or 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of oats. These will make it easier to apply to your skin and will slough off any dead skin cells. Rinse the scrub off with warm water and follow up with a moisturizer.


Be gentle with exfoliating your skin. Never scrub your skin with rough movements, since this can damage your skin. Instead, carefully use your fingertips and apply the scrub in a circular motion.

, For a quick moisturizing facial mask, take a ripe banana and mash it with a fork until it's somewhat liquidy. Smear this on your face and let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes. If you want to add other benefits to the mask, try mixing in one of these ingredients:Turmeric powder: has antibacterial properties that can fight infection
Baking powder: can open pores and remove excess oil
Lemon juice: can lighten and tone the skin
Honey: may kill acne-causing bacteria

, Don't forget that banana is also good for treating hair problems. Mash a banana or two and mix in a tablespoon of honey or a few drops of almond oil. Apply this to your wet hair and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Then, rinse off it with water.


The banana and honey or oil can moisturize dry and damaged hair.

Use a good facewash/cleanser and a moisturizer.,
Look into topical prescriptions, which are applied directly to the skin.,
Combine your cleanser and moisturizer with oral antibiotics.,
Inquire about a prescription called Isotretinoin.",How to Treat Acne with Prescription Medication," This step doesn't include prescriptions, because before taking prescriptions you should give over-the-counter products a try first.


Mandelic acid and salicylic acid are known to be two of the most effective cleansers available.Mandelic acid is unique because it's the key ingredient in all sorts of products, including moisturizers and eye-lift creams, however salicylic acid is present for the most part in cleansers only. Using a mandelic acid cleanser and moisturizer is recommended in this article due to its outstanding results, and fast treatment of all skin types affected with acne.Mandelic Acid products treat acne effectively, because it's antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and lipid permeable, and as a bonus, it has anti-aging and wrinkle healing properties too.
Salicylic acid on the other hand, works by loosening the plug which forms in the pore, by softening the keratin. Keratin and sebum are both responsible for clogging the pore, which causes a pimple.
Mandelic acid is often purchased online through reputable suppliers, whereas salicylic acid can be purchased over-the-counter in most department stores.
Contrary to popular beliefs, you do not need to wash your face anymore than once per day with a cleanser. Many people feel the need to scrub hard as if they're trying to clean ""dirt"" off their skin; dirt does not cause acne. Give the cleanser and moisturizer a go for 2-3 weeks, if there is no improvement in your skin and it continually gets worse, then take a trip to the doctor's office and start with prescriptions.;
, Topical prescriptions are generally prescribed before oral medications for mild-moderate acne. However, depending on the severity of your acne, or the time frame, it may be wise to skip this step and go straight to oral prescriptions. Topical prescriptions include benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, retinoids, topical antibiotics.


Benzoyl peroxide works by killing the bacteria in the pores which are responsible for acne. Benzoyl peroxide is also available without a prescription at lower percentages.
Azelaic acid works by halting the growth of bacteria which will slow the growth of acne.
Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives which help expel plugged material in the hair follicle.
Topical antibiotics work by killing Propionibacterium acnes bacteria.

, The more common oral antibiotics include tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, and bactrim. Remember don't stop using the cleanser and moisturizer at this point, even if you're not getting the results you want. Bactrim tends to be the most effective oral antibiotic, so it would be wise to give that a try.Bactrim is a great antibiotic and clears up most people's acne in a couple of weeks. Most bactrim doses last for 1-2 months. If bactrim combined with cleansing and moisturizing does not work for you, then go back to your doctor and it's up to his wonderful judgment to do some more trial and error. If after failed attempts by your doctor to solve your acne he may already recommend the next step, or you will have to take the initiative.

, It's recommended to do a bit of research before actually starting this step, because there is a lot of controversy surrounding Isotretinoin; some is true, some is not. You will still be using your cleanser and moisturizer of course for this step too. Isotretinoin will clear your acne; it is one of the few acne treatments that is virtually guaranteed to work.Your doctor may not be willing to prescribe you Isotretinoin and may refer you to a specialist called a dermatologist. A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in the treatment of skin. Again you are going to suggest Isotretinoin to him. If all goes well then you will be prescribed a dosage based on your body weight, and for a period of 5 months. Your acne should be cleared after 3-4 months into using Isotretinoin. Isotretinoin will dry out your skin because it works by supplying your body with high amounts of Vitamin A, and that causes your Sebaceous Glands to shrink, which therefore solves the problem of acne.

",How to Make a Military Bun," Spend a good few minutes running a brush through your hair until it feels smooth and completely free of tangles. Make sure that this is the first thing you do -- if you brush your hair after you wash it, you'll be more likely to break your strands and damage your hair.






;
, You can use shampoo and conditioner if you need it, but the main purpose of washing your hair is to get it wet, though cleaning it is an added bonus.








, Dry your hair with a towel and wring it out until it's nice and damp. If it's soaking wet, it will be hard to make a bun, but you won't be able to do it if your hair is completely dry, so don't blow dry it or wait to long before you make your bun.








, Put a dime-sized amount of hair gel onto the comb and run it through your hair.








, Secure it with a thick ponytail holder that you wrap at least 3-4 times around your hair. The ponytail should be very tight and close to your scalp.








, In case the first one breaks or loses its elasticity, you'll be prepared.








, Hold it up as you twist the ponytail tightly.








, Starting at the base of the ponytail, take the twisted ponytail and wrap it around itself as much as you need to until it is completely wrapped. Make sure there are no loose strands and that your hair is neatly wrapped without bumps.








, Start securing the hair at the top of the bun, pushing the pins down to secure the bun to the rest of your hair. Try moving your head around -- if the bun doesn't feel completely secure and in place, try using a few more bobby pins until you can move your head in all directions without the bun going out of place.








, For an additional touch, you can place a hairnet over the bun, doubling it two or three times depending on the size of the bun.








, Use at least 2-3 small pins to secure the hairnet in place.








, Smooth any flyaways with a little gel. Keep the hairspray with you throughout the day just in case you need to secure your look later.

",How to Do a Sock Bun," It's best to use the odd sock that isn't useful anymore; avoid using a sock that's still in regular use. The sock should be ankle or mid-shin length; anything longer risks bunching up. Shorter socks tend to cradle your bun and hold it in place.


Select a sock that won’t “shed” or create too many loose threads. You'll be cutting this sock, so if it tends to unravel with loose threads, find another or be prepared to darn the edges.
Socks close in color to your hair color work best, as it will blend in more should it peek through your strands.;
, Remove the toe-end of the sock using sharp, fabric scissors. Your goal is to create a tube out of the sock, so only cut off as much as is needed to do this. Follow the seam if possible when cutting. That way you will have a cleaner, straighter cut.







, Roll up the sock so that it is donut or ring shaped, and slip it over the ponytail. Pull it to the base of the ponytail so that all of the hair is gathered inside of it.








, Once all the hair is gathered inside the sock, pull it as close to the ends as you can. Tuck the hair around the side and into the center of the bun.








, Hold the ends of your hair at the center of the sock and roll the fabric down towards the base of the ponytail. The hair will gather in a ring around the sock. Rotate the sock as you roll it down so that it is completely covered by your hair.








, When the sock has reached the base of the ponytail, tug on the edges and adjust them so that none of the sock can be seen through your hair. Use bobby pins to secure the bun to your scalp if it feels loose or moves around at all. Add a light misting of hairspray, and you're finished.

Only your doctor will be able to decide what sort of light is best for your skin.There are three primary versions of light therapy treatment for acne: red light, blue light, or a combination.
Blue light is adequate for treating small areas of rough or raised skin.
Red light penetrates farther into the skin than blue light and is the preferred option when treating deep-skin targets like the sebaceous gland.
To get the best of both worlds, doctors will often utilize both red and blue light.
You will probably require multiple visits to the doctor to get your acne treated properly.Light therapy is an acceptable form of treatment for individuals with any type of acne, including severe acne.But if you have only mild or moderate acne with occasional flare-ups, try over-the-counter or prescription treatment options first to save money and time.;
, Before getting light therapy, you’ll need to have your skin primed with a photosensitizer, a medication that will make your skin more sensitive to light. This enhances the efficacy of the light therapy for treating acne. Your doctor will choose which photosensitizer you need based on your situation.There are two main photosensitizers: methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) and aminolevulinic acid (ALA).
MAL may more effectively prepare deep-tissue structures like sebaceous glands and their sebum (skin oil). MAL may have a higher tendency to cause hyperpigmentation, the harmless darkening of certain patches of the skin.
ALA might have a shorter incubation time, meaning that the time spent between application of the photosensitizer and the time you begin the actual light therapy treatment is shorter than the time you’d need to do so with MAL.
You might have to wait up to three hours for the photosensitizer to be fully absorbed. Don’t let your doctor cut your incubation time short, or the efficacy of the light therapy could decline. If your incubation time is less than 180 minutes, ask your doctor why.
In some rare cases, your doctor will recommend that you not use a photosensitizer, but blue, red, or mixed red-and-blue light alone will not treat cysts, nodules, blackheads, or whiteheads., Once you’ve had the photosensitizer fully absorbed into your skin, you’re ready to begin the light therapy treatment proper. Fortunately, it’s much easier and quicker than waiting around for the photosensitizer to work its magic. Your doctor or a trained light therapy technician will come in and shine the light on affected skin for about 15-20 minutes. All you have to do is lie back and enjoy the ride.When light is shone on the skin, it kills acne bacteria and shrinks oil glands, thereby preventing acne.

Prep your hair.,
Pull your hair back.,
Wrap a ponytail around the handful.,
Create the messy bun.,
Finish the bun.",How to Make a Bun1," Brush your hair to remove any knots and tangles that may be present. To create a messy bun, you can choose to have a part in your hair present or to pull all your hair back from the front.;
, Without brushing your hair, grab it all starting at the front near your face and collecting all your hair into one hand. Hold the hair at the location where you want to have your bun.


To create a sophisticated mod look, pull your hair up very high near the top of your head. For a more professional look, your hair should be drawn to the center of the back of your head. To create an easy carefree messy bun, pull your hair to the nape of your neck.
You can choose to make your bun off-center for a more playful look if you would like.
Because you are going for a messy bun look, don’t brush your hair or run your hands through it too much as you draw it back. Simply pick your hair up, resisting the temptation to finger brush it.
Be sure to pick up any loose strands, and make sure that all of your hair has been included in your handful.

, Take an elastic and wrap it around your hair. It should take you about 3 wraps of the band total to get a tight fit. On the third wrap of the ponytail though, don’t pull your hair all the way through the band. Instead, leave ½-⅓ of your hair hanging out the bottom as a tail, while the remaining portion of your hair will create a loop in the upper part of the ponytail.








, You should now be left with your hair in a large loop, with a tail of hair sticking out below it. Take the tail and wrap it around the base of the ponytail, covering the band. Use 2-3 bobby pins to secure the tail around the base. Then, part the loop down the center and pull the two sides to your scalp, and pin.









You don’t need to create a direct part through the loop, you are only trying to pin the body of it to your head so that it doesn’t retain its ring-like shape.
Feel free to pull out little pieces of your hair to let hang loose or to pin in other directions to enhance the messy look.

, Spritz your hair with a bit of hairspray to keep your bun long lasting, and add any decorative hair accessories you might have. A cute headband or small pin near the base of the bun is a great way to add a bit of extra interest to your bun.

Prepare for side effects.,
Be patient.,
Use supplemental treatments.",How to Treat Acne with Light Therapy2," Light therapy treatment for acne might be followed by side effects like mild stinging or pain, crusty or peeling skin, changes in skin tone, or redness and irritation.Your doctor will be able to provide advice and medication for how to best guard against or limit these unpleasant side effects.More serious – but rarer – side effects include blisters, burns, and enduring pain.
You can limit side effects by using special medications provided by your doctor. They might recommend lotions containing vitamin C or hydrating formulas to deal with flaking or dry skin. You might also get prednisone, a corticosteroid, to reduce any inflammation or swelling.Commerically available products like Aquaphor or Cetaphil moisturizers, both of which are readily available from your local pharmacy, could also reduce likelihood or severity of your side effects.
Commerically available pain relief medicine like Tylenol or Advil can help you cope with any lingering pain.
Light therapy treatment might cause temporary acne flare-ups in the short term.
After getting light therapy, stay out of the sun for a few days while the effects of the photosensitizer wears off. Additionally, do not use tanning beds.

, People who get light therapy for their acne tend to need multiple treatments and may not see immediate results. For instance, after four weeks, you might see a 50% reduction in your acne. But after 12 weeks, you might see a 75% reduction in your acne., Research shows that light therapy alone is often not enough to clear acne. When receiving light therapy for acne, it is important to continue treating your skin gently. Use nontoxic soaps and facial products, rinse with lukewarm water, do not use makeup, and avoid touching your face. Talk to your doctor about what else you can do to supplement your light therapy and rid yourself of acne.If you absolutely must use makeup, use a nontoxic mineral-based formulation like Jane Iredale Mineral Make-Up. Makeup of this sort is less likely to irritate the skin and cause acne flareups.
The one supplemental treatment you cannot use in conjunction with light therapy is Accutane (isotretinoin).

"
"
Try an at-home treatment.,
Try photopneumatic therapy.,
Consult your doctor about developing a backup plan.",How to Treat Acne with Light Therapy3," There are several light therapy devices you can use at home to treat acne. For instance, talk to your doctor about getting Tanda Clear Acne Light Therapy Treatment, a blue light therapy that has a successful track record and has no side effects. At-home light therapy devices can prevent acne outbreaks from occurring and reduce the number of blackheads, whiteheads, pustules, and nodules on your face.Light therapy devices you can use at home are less powerful than the ones used by your doctor.Typically, at-home light therapy devices require you to use them for about 45 minutes every other day.
Devices typically cost between $150-$350.
Ask your doctor for advice about choosing an at-home light therapy device.
Use directions vary with manufacturer. Consult your light therapy device’s instructions for more information.

, Photopneumatic therapy combines intense pulsed light (IPL) with a vacuum. This process can remove excess oil and dead skin cells from your pores. However, it will not treat acne cysts or nodules. Your doctor will decide if photopneumatic therapy is right for you.As is the case with regular light therapy, you'll need multiple photopneumatic therapy treatments in order to see any improvement in your condition.
If you receive an IPL treatment, you might experience side effects similar to those you would if you received a regular light treatment. Additionally, you might have a temporary sensitivity to sunlight.
Photopneumatic therapy is FDA-approved.

, Light therapy treatment for acne does not work for all people. In fact, for some people, light therapy is no more effective than common over-the-counter acne treatments.Everyone has a slightly different body and your experience with light therapy might not be the same as someone else’s. Additionally, you might only see an improvement in your acne, not a complete elimination.If you do not experience a reduction in acne severity, talk to your doctor about alternative treatments in follow-up appointments. Your doctor may suggest Accutane or a similar treatment.

, Gather all of your hair starting at the front and then working your way towards the back, into a handful on the top of your head. Make sure that there are no loose strands and that all your hair has been gathered into your handful.

, Take the entire handful of hair and twist it in the same direction, creating a rope-like piece. Then, wrap it onto itself to create a knot-like spiral.








, Wrap a ponytail around the topknot you have created, making sure that the elastic doesn’t get caught on strands in the middle or top of the bun, but lays flat against you head at the base of the bun.


Pull out strands of hair to give it a messy appearance, or leave it as-is.
If you have very long hair, your knot might be a little too ‘vertical’ for you. In this case, you can lean it to one side and pin it. Otherwise, allow the knot to stand upright.

, Because this style sits on the top of your head, you may have hairs at the nape of your neck that didn’t manage to be include in the look. Pin these into your hair with a clip, and then give your entire head a quick misting of hairspray. Add any hair accessories you may want."

Prep your hair.,
Brush your hair into a ponytail.,
Create the bun.,
Finish the look.",How to Make a Bun3," Remove all tangles and make sure your hair is completely smooth by giving it a thorough brushing. The ballerina bun is created using hair that is totally slicked-back, so if your hair is frizzy or prone to fly-aways, mist your hair with water to dampen it slightly.

, For this look it is necessary to use a brush to create the necessary smoothness. Comb your hair back into a ponytail at any location on your head. A classic ballerina bun is formed near the top of your head, but you can certainly place it at any location along your scalp.









Make sure your hair is totally smooth before you add the elastic. This may require a few minutes of brushing, to verify that the hair from every part of your head is smooth and included.
Once you are sure your hair has been smoothed, use a ponytail to wrap around your handful of hair to secure it tightly. Make sure that the ponytail is not too loose to allow for slippage over time.

, Without twisting your hair into a rope-like strand, wrap it in a spiral around the base of your ponytail. When you get to the ends, tuck them beneath the spiral and secure with bobby pins.









Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, you will need to use anywhere from 3-7 bobby pins to keep your bun in place. Avoid using more than necessary though, as you will be able to see if there are many being used.
Slide the bobby pins in under the bun, so that you can only partially see the very ends. They should slide under (not over or around) the elastic at the center of your bun.
If you have layers in your hair, you may need to use additional pins to secure the layers to your scalp.

, This style definitely needs hairspray in order to be set completely. Give your enter head of hair a go-over with a strong hairspray, and use your fingers to smooth out all of your strands. You’re finished!"

, A braided bun can be placed at any location on your head. It can be created using a brush for a very professional and sophisticated look, or finger-pulled back for a more relaxed appearance. Use a ponytail to secure the location on your head.

, Start at the base, and form a normal braid by splitting your hair into three sections and crossing them over each other. You should start by moving the section on the right over the center piece, and then taking the section on the left and moving it over the center piece. Continue this pattern until you reach the end of your ponytail.









When you get to the end, simply hold onto it. You will pin it to your head, so there is no need to use an elastic.
If you feel that you absolutely must use an elastic with this style, try to use a small clear one to minimize its appearance. Otherwise, you will be able to see it inside your bun.

, When you get to the ends, tuck them beneath the base of the bun. Secure your hair with a few bobby pins, making sure that your hair will not fall out.








, If you want, you can pull a few strands of hair outside of your bun to create a messy look. Coat your hair with hairspray, and add any cute accessories you might like. A headband goes especially well with a braided bun for a more bohemian feel."

, Take an old (clean) sock, and cut the closed end near the toes off. It is best if you use a sock similar in color to your hair, but any color will do. You should be left with an empty sock-tube. Roll it up (similar to how you would with nylons) so that your sock is no longer a tube, but a donut shape.








, Take your sock and slide it onto your ponytail all the way to the base. This is to make sure that all of the strands are included. Then, hold your ponytail up and slide the sock all the way to the end of the ponytail.

, Wrap the ends of your hair around the sock donut, so that they form a loop and the ends are placed in the center hole of the sock.

A little water can help smooth things out and make your hair more manageable, if need be., If necessary, spray the hair with a quick-drying hairspray. The best height is right on the crown of your head, so that you could just see the top of the ponytail poking up if you look in the mirror.








The tighter you can make this ponytail, the better. It may hurt at first, but it ensures you have fewer wisps of hair coming free and keeps you from having to re-do your bun later.

, It is important to have a strong foundation for your bun so it doesn't fall down. A small elastic will hold the hair in place while you craft your bun. You can then spray a little hairspray onto the ponytail to give it a little extra hold.








, The tighter the better, even though it may hurt a bit to get it prepared.









Some ballerinas like to create their bun in two parts -- splitting their hair in half to make twisting easier. If you do this, simply repeat the following steps for both halves., Follow the direction you twisted in for the best result -- if you twisted clockwise, wrap clockwise. You want to keep the rope of hair close to the ponytail holder. Use bobby pins to start securing everything down.








, Place pins at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock, if your bun was a clock face. If the first half of your bun feels a little shaky, put more bobby pins in where desired.









Many ballerinas prefer the U-shaped pins, as they capture more hair and hold longer.Repeat these same steps for the second half of your ponytail, if necessary. If you do, make sure your twist and turn the second half the opposite way as the first., l This also helps secure the bun, though it is not strictly necessary.

Wrap your braid around your bun.",How to Do a Curly Bun1," If you're happy with your curls the way they are, be careful whenever you put your hair up. Don't stretch out your hair by putting it into a too-tight bun. If you have curly hair, you won't be able to get it into a ""sleek"" bun without damaging it.The easiest way to prevent damaging your beautifully curly locks is to simply not pull back your hair too hard when putting it up.Low buns not only look especially great with curly hair,but they are also worn much looser than a high topknot or ballerina bun.;
, Place the base of the ponytail where you want your bun to sit. This can be at the center of the nape of your neck for a low bun or a little higher for an average bun. Hold it in place with one hand and secure it using a hair tie with your other., Gently twist the ponytail into a loose coil. Next, gently wrap the entire coil around the ponytail base. Secure it in place with a bobby pin. Remember to keep it loose to avoid damaging your curls. Don't twist it tightly., Slide in a few bobby pins through the braid, the bun, and the bun's base to keep it firmly in place. How many you'll need will depend on how much hair you have to secure and how well your hair holds a style. If your hair is prone to frizzing, consider using an anti-frizz hairspray., If you want to include a braid in your curly bun, you will need to section your hair before putting it up into a ponytail. Using both hands, gather your hair into two separate sections with one strand to your left and one to your right. Put the right section up into a bun as normal. Make sure your left section is thick enough to braid., Take the free remaining hair and make it into a simple braid. Don't braid too tightly, as this may damage your curls and create a braid that is too stiff to use as a wrap. To create a simple braid:


Separate the left section further into three equal strands.
Cross the left section over the middle section.
Cross the right over what was originally the left section.
What was originally the middle section will now be on the left. Cross that over the current middle section (originally the one at the right). Do the same with what is now the right strand.
Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the hair section. Secure the tip with a hair elastic., Take your braid to the right and drape it over the main bun. Loop the bottom of the braid around the bun in a clockwise manner until the entire braid is wrapped around the bun. If your braid is long enough to completely encircle the bun, finish off by tucking the tail end of the braid underneath."

Use water and a comb to really straighten out your hair, combing out any bumps or fly-away hairs causing problems. If you have thicker or unruly hair, a little gel may be helpful, too.







, If you've recently washed your hair, and everything is silky smooth, you might try a texturizing spray to give the strands some hold. Like most up-dos, this look is a bit easier to pull off with ""day old"" hair. But, if you're fresh and clean, some texturizer should do the trick.







, With one hand around your tight coil of hair, use the other hand to keep to press and hold the bun around your ponytail as you wrap it. The curl between your thumb and first finger, for example, is a great tool to help mold a perfectly rounded bun.







, For girl's with thinner hair, or for a more ""classic"" look, you just twist the entire ponytail. But for girls with thick or uneven length hair, or for a slightly more secure hold, you can go with the ""two-part"" method. Simply pull the ponytail in half, then twist and wrap both halves around the base of the ponytail for a ""figure eight"" bun.








If you're doing the bun in two parts, simply repeat the exact same steps above for both parts. However, when you get to the wrapping and pinning, just make sure the two strands are wrapped in opposite directions (one clockwise, one counter-clockwise)., If you have blonde hair, don't use the gray hair net because then your bun looks purple. If you're a brunette, don't use the blonde hair net because then you have a lighter bun than the rest of your hair.

Twist the side sections around the bun.",How to Do a Curly Bun2," Before you curl, make sure your hair is free of tangles. Preheat your curling iron. Wrap each section of hair around the curling iron for 10 to 15 seconds.


Each hair section should be small enough so that you can wrap it around the wand without much hair overlapping.
Try spraying the ends with a light-hold hairspray before curling for added lift., Divide your hair up into four sections: right, left, top middle, and bottom middle. Put a hairclip in each of your side sections and the top section to hold them out of the way temporarily. Leave the bottom section undone.

, Separate a strand about two inches wide from the bottom section. Hold two fingers close to its roots at the nape of your neck and wrap the strand around the two fingers. Hold this new curl in place with two bobby pins. Repeat this with a second strand of hair, but make the new curl sit slightly askew in relation to the first. Keep adding curls until all of the bottom section is pinned up., Unclip your top section. Take a handful of hair at the back of your crown and gently back comb or ""tease"" it. Hold the hair vertically and run a comb through it from near the tips towards the roots. Do this a few times. Make sure there is a layer of unteased hair in front of it.Teasing this section will add volume to naturally straight hair, which can often end up too flat when put into an updo.

, Using the hair from your top section, continue making curls just as you did with the bottom section. However, instead of having these curls sit at the roots of each strand, pin them on and around the bottom section's curls. Wrap only the bottom portion of these strands around your fingers. As you layer, a clear bun should begin to form., Unpin your right and left hair sections. Take your right section and twist it to the left, bringing it over and around your bun.

Make sure your hair is completely tangle-free before putting it into a bun. Styling tangled hair can make the knots even worse.While it's generally better to work with clean hair, a bun can disguise hair that's a little greasy., Position the base of your ponytail so that it is at your back, sitting either at the top of your head (a high ponytail) or a little further down towards the nape of your neck (a medium ponytail). To get the perfect ponytail:


If you have bangs, pin them to the side for now. You don't want to accidentally put them up into the ponytail.
Gather the rest of your hair with both hands, sweeping it backwards.
Hold the gathered hair with one hand and use the other to collect any hair strands that you missed and add them to the main ponytail.
Secure the ponytail in place with a hair tie.

, Select a strand of any size from your ponytail. Keep in mind that the amount of hair you choose will determine how many individual curls you'll have at the end. For example, if you select roughly one eighth of your hair, you will end up with eight total twists. Doing a twisty curl with all of your hair at once is one way to create a chignon hairstyle. To make each twisty curl:


While gripping its tip, gently twist the strand of hair until its full length is tightly wound. Use both hands if necessary. Do not use too much force and stop if you feel any pain. You don't want to accidentally pull out your hair or damage its roots.
After your hair is fully coiled, keep on twisting it. The strand will eventually begin to bunch up in a spiral towards the base of your ponytail.
If your hair doesn't bunch up when completely spiraled, wrap the strand around itself at the base instead.

, Hide the small uncoiled tip strand by tucking it underneath the curl. With one hand, hold the curl and the bottom strand in place near the base of the ponytail. With your other hand, slide a bobby pin in to secure the curl.

, Take another strand of hair and twist it into a second curl. Pin it in place next to the first. Keep adding twists until you run out of free hair to work with. Try to keep the strand sizes as consistent as possible. You will eventually end up with a bun that looks like a bouquet of twisty curls.

, To avoid stray strands of hair coming out of the bun, spritz in a small amount of hairspray. This will work to both help hold your hair in place and maintain a smooth, sleek look. If your hair is prone to frizzing or flyaways, don't skip this step., At this point, if you have your bangs pinned to the side, feel free to take them down. If you decide the look isn't right for you, consider leaving your hair styled this way for a few hours. When allowed to set, a curly bun comes with the added bonus of creating temporary soft curls in straight hair.

, The styling agent will help to hold your hair in place once you style and blow dry it.Put a quarter-sized amount of styling agent in the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together to spread it onto both palms, and then run your fingers through your hair to massage it in.

, You will work through this style in layers, so have a hair clip or hair tie to hold sections of your hair out of the way while you work.


Part your hair horizontally just above your ears. Lay your thumbs on either side of your head just above your ears, and run them back along your scalp to create the part. Lift all of the hair above your thumbs and clip or tie it up out of the way. Leave the rest of your hair hanging straight down.

, Take about a 2-inch section of the loose hair and set it on top of your round brush.


Feel free to run the brush down the length of your hair, turning slightly as you go, to work out any tangles.

, The blow dryer should always point down the length of your hair, because pointing it at or up the length of your hair will result in frizz.

, Because you have a bob hair cut, you likely do not have a lot of length to your hair. You may not need to move the round brush at all if it is short enough, but in most cases, you will have to pull the brush down through your hair a bit.


Continuously turn the round brush gently to help train your hair into the inward curl. This involves a quick wrist movement to flick the round brush back up to your roots, once you get to the ends.
Completely blow dry one section of hair before moving onto the next. Moving on before a section is completely dry will cause it to lose its shape.

, Working in 2-inch sections, you will probably have 3-4 sections of hair to work through with the round brush and blow dryer.

, Just as you did for the bottom layer, you will now style the middle layer of hair over the round brush.


Remember to place the round brush and the blow dryer at your roots. Aim the blow dryer down the length of your hair.
Also remember to continuously turn the round brush gently as you blow dry. This layer of hair will be longer than the bottom layer, so you will have to repeatedly pull the brush down the length of your hair and then start back over at the roots.

, The inward curl at your ends should fall right over top of the gentle curl in the bottom layer.


Now that you are styling hair at the sides of your head, more hair should curl inward slightly toward your chin.

, You can part your hair in the center or off to one side. Create your part where you would like it to be, using a comb. Allow your loose hair to fall freely.

, Gently lift 2-inch sections of hair and place them over the round brush, getting a good handle on it, to blow dry.


Aim the blow dryer down the length of your hair, from your roots, so that you do not make your hair frizzy.
Continuously turn the round brush in your hand, under the section of hair, so that a slight curl is created at the ends of your hair. This will be the longest layer of hair, so you will have to pull the brush down through your hair and then start back up at the roots repeatedly until the section is dry.

, Move from section to section, drying each section over the round brush. Again, this layer should sit on top of the middle layer, with the curl inward at the ends matching that of the layers beneath.

, If you are concerned that the mousse or styling gel applied to your hair at the start of this process will not hold it in place, you can gently spray your hair with hairspray to ensure that it will hold the style.

Gently run your fingers through your hair to remove any tangles and to help your hair lie flat.

, Continuing to use the same method, curl 1-inch sections of your hair all around the top layer of your head.


Check for any missed chunks of hair to be sure to get all of your hair curled. Again, be extra vigilant in looking. It helps to have another person help you look for missed strands in the back of your head.

, Extra holding power from hairspray helps your curls to last longer, so you can spritz your hair with hairspray to assist in maintaining those curls.

Wash or dampen your hair.,
Select a styling product intended for holding curls.,
Bend at the waist and flip your head and hair upside-down.,
Put a quarter-sized dollop of styling product in your palm and prepare to apply it to your hair.,
Run your hands through your hair and scrunch it.,
Stand up and flip your hair back over.,
Allow your hair to dry.",How to Style a Bob4," Setting natural curls in a bob is easiest when your hair is already wet. Plan to style your hair this way when you are fresh out of the shower or have dampened your hair.


To dampen your hair, you can put water in a spray bottle and mist your hair, or you can put your head under a faucet in a sink or bathtub.

, There are many products available on the market that are specifically designed for use on curly hair. Choose one that fits your type of hair (e.g. thick, thin, fine, damaged, et cetera).


A mousse or a gel would work best. You can also select a hairspray to finish.

, Styling your your hair upside-down will help to add volume.


You can skip this step if you feel that your hair already has enough volume naturally.

, Rub your palms together so that the product spreads over both hands.


Start with this amount for now; you can add more later if you feel that you need it.

, It often works best to focus your hands on smaller sections of hair and gently push upward, toward your scalp, gently closing your hand over the hair to scrunch it as you do so.


Make sure to apply product and scrunch all over your head. Some people forget about the bottom layer, but that can still be seen if it is left untouched. Scrunch your hair all the way to the back of your neck.

, You can apply more product to your hair, if you need to, and scrunch missed areas now that you are standing up. Use a mirror to help you spot missed sections of hair.

, Oftentimes, this is enough for naturally curly hair to set well. However, there are a couple of additional steps that you can take, if you desire.


Consider using a diffuser on your blow dryer and drying your hair with that. This both adds volume and curls your hair.
Spritz hairspray onto your hair to really secure the curls. This could results in your hair looking “crunchy” and hard instead of smooth; it is up to your preference of how you want your hair to look.

"
"
Get a texturizing hair product.,
Start with hair that is air-dryed or still slightly damp.,
Spritz your hair with the texturizing spray.,
Scrunch your hair with your hands.,
Add waves to your hair with a curling wand.,
Finish with more texturizing spray.",How to Style a Bob5," There are many products today that are specially created to achieve this look. Sea salt sprays are popular, as are other similar products.


If you do not currently own a product, then be sure to go to your local drugstore and buy one.

, There are mixed reviews about which works best: adding beachy waves to completely dry hair or to hair that is still a little damp.You will have to determine what works best for your hair.


It would be helpful to read the instructions on the texturizing product you own, as well.

, Be sure to spray all over your head. You can flip your head upside-down, as well, to reach the hair at the back of your neck.

, For some people, the scrunching method works well to help them achieve the “beachy waves.”


Gather small sections of hair in the palms of your hands and gently push upward toward your scalp. Slowly and gently close your hand around the hair as you push to scrunch it.
This might work better and add more volume to your hair if you flip your head upside-down to scrunch.

, If the scrunching method does not work for you, you can consider adding slight waves to your hair with a curling wand after spritzing the texturizing product.Wrap 2-inch sections of hair loosely around the wand, no more than 2-3 times, so that it creates waves rather than curls. Work all the way around your head in 2-inch chunks of hair. Check for any straight strands that linger and wrap them around the wand.
Be sure to hold your fingers away from the curling wand when holding the ends of the hair so that you do not burn your fingers.

, After you scrunch or curl, gently run your fingers through your hair to loosen the waves. Then, add more texturizing spray to finish and hold the waves.


You could spritz your hair with hairspray, instead of more texturizing product, if you would like a better hold.

Develop a good face cleansing routine.,
Open your skin pores.,
Disinfect your hands or wear gloves.,
Sterilize your acne.Prior to using an acne tool, you will want to disinfect the pimples themselves so that bacteria does not inadvertently get pushed further into your pores.,
Select the right extracting tool for your acne.Blackheads should be removed with comedone extractors, whereas whiteheads will need to be pierced with a sharp lancet first before removing them with an extractor.,
Remove your blackheads with the comedone extractor.You can remove blackheads by centering the loop of the comedone extractor over the pimple you want to remove, and rocking the tool gently from side to side while applying slight pressure.,

Treat any bleeding.In some cases, your skin may bleed slightly after using the comedone extractor.,
Finish by disinfecting the treated area.To be extra cautious about preventing infection, use additional rubbing alcohol pads to clean your now acne-free skin.",How to Use an Acne Tool," Washing your face twice daily is the most important thing you can do to get clean, clear skin. If you plan to use an acne removing tool, then wash your face right before you use it to ensure that your skin is clean.

Make sure that you wash your face in the morning, before you go to bed at night, and any time your face gets sweaty.
Use a gentle cleanser and lukewarm water to wash your face. Avoid harsh, exfoliating cleanser. Using exfoliating cleansers and scrubbing your face can irritate your skin and cause redness and inflammation.Do not scrub your face. Just use your fingertips or a gentle cotton washcloth to gently massage the cleanser into your skin. Then, splash water on your face to wash the cleanser away.
Pat your face dry with a towel after you finish washing it.;
, Softening your acne and pimples will make them easier to remove when the pores are opened before using an acne tool. Pores can be opened by placing a hot, wet towel over your face for 2 to 3 minutes or by taking a hot shower.You can also use a steam treatment on your face to open the pores. However, be careful when using this method because you can burn your skin if the water is too hot.




, To prevent bacteria on your hands from coming into contact with your face, disinfect your hands by washing them with antibacterial soap and water. Alternatively, you can wear disposable gloves when using the acne tool.





Disinfecting your hands will help to prevent infection. This is key especially with acne because the presence of bacteria worsens pimples over time.
Therefore, you level of success in clearing up acne will relate to your level of cleanliness and hygiene.

, Use rubbing alcohol pads over the areas you want to treat to sterilize on your face before using the acne tool.





Also sterilize the acne tool (comedone extractor).If your tool is not sterilized, then you may end up introducing more bacteria to your face.
Use rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab to sterilize your tool prior to using it.

, The most common acne tool used is a comedone extractor with two ends, each of a different size. You can then pick the size that is most appropriate to the size of the blackhead you are extracting from your face.





While another option is an acne tool where one side is a blackhead remover, and the other side is a sharp lancet to pop open whiteheads prior to removing them, this takes more skill to use. Keep in mind that it is best to avoid popping whiteheads due to the risk of infection. If you have many whiteheads, then see a dermatologist.
If you are inexperienced at popping whiteheads with a sharp lancet, your best bet may be to get this done by a professional dermatologist (skin specialist) or aesthetician.
If you use the lancet improperly, it may result in scarring or other damage to your face. On the other hand, the side of the tool used for blackheads is much safer and can be used at home.

, The blackhead in its entirety will be pulled from the follicle and you will see oil ooze from the pore.





If the blackhead does not come out with gentle pressure, then do not try to force it. This can lead to an infection and scarring. See a dermatologist if you have a severe blackhead that you cannot remove easily.

, Once the whitehead is broken open, you will want to centre it within the loop of the comedone extractor and rock the tool gently from side to side, again applying slight pressure until it is pulled from the follicle.

If you have any reservations about using the lancet, it is worthwhile investing in seeing either a dermatologist or an aesthetician who is experienced in this area. That way, you will avoid errors that could lead to scarring.

, Lightly pat your skin with gauze to absorb any blood. If done correctly, the bleeding should not last more than a few moments. However, you might have to apply firm pressure for a few seconds or until the bleeding stops.




, You should also clean and disinfect your acne tool before putting it away. Remember that an extra effort toward good hygiene and cleanliness will optimize your success at treating your acne.

Try a benzoyl peroxide treatment.,
Consider exfoliating your skin.,
Use some tea tree oil.,
Consider a topical antibacterial product.,
Investigate vitamin A derivatives (retinoids).",How to Use Household Pantry and Bathroom Items to Remove Acne1," Benzoyl peroxide is the active ingredient in many of the most effective acne treatments you can buy in stores, or which are prescribed by doctors. If you have a benzoyl peroxide product in your bathroom, this should be your first choice to treat your acne.


Benzoyl peroxide is only likely to be found in face cleaning products, such as face scrubs and washes.
Check the ingredients on a face cleaning product you find in your bathroom to see if it contains benzoyl peroxide.
These products have an antibacterial and drying effect, and as such they may cause irritation to dry or sensitive skin..;
, Using a gentle, exfoliating face wash or scrub can help to cleanse and purify your skin. Find one that is designed to work for your skin type and apply as per instructions on the bottle. After washing your hands and wetting your face, gently message the exfoliating scrub into your face before rinsing it off with warm water.


Exfoliating can be quite harsh on your skin. Exfoliation should be done once a week at most.Doing it more often could irritate your skin and make your acne worse.
To ensure you do not damage your skin, talk to your dermatologist and allow them to exfoliate your skin. It may not be wise to do so on your own.
Moisturise after exfoliating to re-hydrate your skin.

, Tea tree oil is anti-inflammatory and antibacterial and has been shown to help reduce the effects of acne. One study found that use of 5% tea-tree oil gel was just as effective in treating acne as 5% benzoyl peroxide lotion in improving acne.Tea tree oil may take longer to work on acne than benzoyl peroxide.Apply a few drops of the oil to a cotton ball or swab, and gently rub it against your acne.
Don't take tea tree oil orally., Topical antibiotics can work effectively to tackle the amount of bacteria that builds up on the surface of your skin. Such treatments will typically be prescribed by your doctor or dermatologist. Get medical advice before you apply an antibiotic cream or gel to your face.Don't use a simple antibacterial hand soap that you have in the bathroom on your face. This type of soap contains chemicals that are not designed for your face and it can dry out and irritate your skin., These treatments are prescribed by your doctor. They work by unplugging your comedones so other topical medicines can enter the follicles and be more effective. You shouldn't try to replicate it by taking a lot of vitamin A orally — it does not have the same effect and can lead to other health problems including potential liver damage."

Apply a lotion or moisturizer to your face after washing it.,
Dab eye cream under your eyes.,
Use sunscreen when going outside.,
Do not forget about your lips.",How to Use Clearasil Blackhead Removers4," Most of the Clearasil products for blackheads contain a medicinal ingredient called salicylic acid. As the name implies, it is an acid, which means it has the tendency to dry your skin. While this is beneficial within the pore that contains a blackhead, it is not beneficial to the rest of your skin. Therefore, in order to replace any moisture in your skin that was removed with the acid, apply a lotion or moisturizer to your face after you’re finished washing., You are never too young to start using an eye cream. Eye creams are designed specifically for the delicate skin around your eyes, where you should not use regular facial moisturizer. Clearasil doesn’t make an eye cream, so you’ll have to select one from a different brand. Choose an eye cream that helps address a specific issue you have, for example: dryness, puffiness, dark circles, etc.Eye cream is meant to be dabbed onto the skin under your eyes and then gently rubbed in.
You can use eye cream on your eye lids, but it’s not as necessary as under your eyes.

, You lips are also skin, but are often overlooked when thinking about sun protection. In addition to sunscreen on your face and neck (and any other area that’s exposed to the sun) you should also use a lip balm with SPF every day. Various lip balms, lip sticks, lip glosses, etc., come with SPF. Look for a product with at least SPF 15.Keep in mind that really shiny lip glosses can actually absorb more sun and UV rays causing more damage to your lips than a non-shiny gloss. But wearing a matte gloss isn’t enough, you should also wear a lip balm with SPF under your lip gloss (or instead of your lip gloss).

Don’t peel the scales away if they don’t come off. You don’t want to break the skin and risk an infection.

, Unlike treatments where you soften the scales with oil and then wipe them away, when skin oils build up they stay on your skin for hours. This causes dead skin cells to stick to the surface of the healthy skin instead of sloughing off. This can be minimized in several ways:Tie back long hair to prevent transferring oils from your hair to your face.

Use calendula.,
Look into green tea.,
Investigate willow bark.,
Consider aloe vera.,
Rub on a turmeric powder paste.,
Use other natural alternatives.",How to Treat Cystic Acne with Herbs1," Calendula is a plant whose flower is used to treat physical symptoms. It is useful on the skin to treat swelling and inflammation.It’s also an antiseptic, which treats the bacteria that make blemishes grow. Ultimately calendula reduces redness.Use a tea brewed with calendula flower the same way you would use any face wash: let the tea cool so that it doesn’t burn your face, then splash it gently on your skin.
Prepare calendula flower tea by placing one tea bag of dried calendula flowers into a mug. Cover it with boiling water. Allow to steep for three to five minutes. For use as a face wash, allow to cool to room temperature.;
, Green tea is rich in antioxidants that prevent the skin from producing oil. It also eliminates inflammation. The result is in an herbal treatment that reduces oil production and calms breakouts.Simply dunk a clean, dry washcloth in a mug of cold green tea. Press this cloth onto the problem areas for one to two minutes, repeating this four or five times.

, Bark from the willow tree contains the chemical salicin,a source of salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is contained in most over-the-counter acne medications. This herbal source of the anti-acne acid eliminates dead skin cells, which allows pores to stay clear.


Brew one tablespoon of chopped up bark in 2.5 oz (70g) of boiling water. Mix this with 1.7 oz (50g) of witch hazel, one teaspoon (5 ml) of vegetable glycerin, 10 drops essential oils of choice, an equal amount of castor oil, and a preservative like gluconolactone and sodium benzoate to make a toner.Willow bark also brings down redness and acts as an astringent/toner.The FDA warns against internal consumption of willow bark extract because it can cause toxicity in various organs.
It is often used as an ingredient in commercial products.

, You use aloe vera to soothe sunburns—why not use it to soothe the inflamed skin of a cystic acne breakout? Aloe vera plants, when cut open, reveal a gooey interior rather like a naturally-occurring gel that can be rubbed onto the skin. Aloe vera gel has aloesin and aloin, both of which are anti-inflammatory.Try to use the plant itself rather than a commercial gel because they usually have additives.

, Turmeric comes in a bright orange powder and contains the ingredient curcumin. Curcumin has a variety of benefits for cystic acne: it is antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and astringent.

Cover your cysts with this paste, wrap it in gauze, and leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight.
Be aware that the bright orange color tends to stain, so keep it away from clothing.

, Keep in mind that you aren’t limited to only herbs. You can treat cystic acne with a myriad of other natural remedies, such as lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, even honey. Liquid remedies you can simply rub onto your face and wash away, while powdered remedies are best mixed into a paste.Also try blue tansy oil, neem oil, or an essential oil like tea tree oil.
Make sure you dilute an essential oil in a carrier oil like coconut or olive oil first.

Do a brief detox.,
Eat herbs to reduce intestinal inflammation.,
Treat hormonal imbalances with herbs.,
Consume dandelion root for skin health.",How to Treat Cystic Acne with Herbs2," When you decide to treat cystic acne with herbs internally, it is good to purify your body of toxins first. Over time, toxins from unhealthy foods can build up in your large intestine. This reduces your intestine's ability to flush toxins. When this happens, your skin can attempt to rid your body of them instead. This results in clogged pores, inflammation, and so on. Do a quick all-day fast with just water for one day. You can also do a restricted diet detox for two to three weeks.A body flooded with toxins can also cause hormonal imbalances, a possible culprit of cystic acne.
Lead up to a detox by adding lots of fresh vegetables to your diet and increase your water intake for a few days before you begin.
A juice fast is also an option. Make fresh juice in a juicer or blender and only drink this and water for two to three days.
A water fast can be done for 24 hours. Only drink water all day, resting frequently.
You can try simply cutting out diary, sugar, refined carbs, alcohol, and caffeine for two to three weeks.
Always consult a doctor before beginning a cleanse of any kind. Your body may not be able to handle reduced calories or a sudden change in diet.

, Consume herbs with the highest anti-inflammatory properties to reduce intestinal irritation. If your gut is upset, it can’t process toxins very well. This means the toxins can end up in your skin. Turmeric, ginger, and boswellia are three very strong anti-inflammatory herbs.These herbs are most commonly swallowed in capsule or pill form.

, Since some cystic acne occurs because of a hormone imbalance, you can focus on herbs that treat this. Maca root, chasteberry, black cohosh, and saw palmetto all have been used traditionally to treat hormone problems. Some also treat inflammation. Consult a doctor before taking any of these.Maca root enhances hormones and can be taken in tablets, capsules, or as a powder.
Chasteberry relieves menstrual pain, increases production of breastmilk, and relieves other menstrual cycle symptoms.
Black cohosh treats menopause and PMS symptoms as well as reduces inflammation for arthritis sufferers. It also mimics estrogen in the body.
Saw palmetto has been used to treat non-cancerous prostate growths. Researchers speculate that saw palmetto influences testosterone levels.

, Dandelion root treats many conditions in the body, including blood disorders, but also clears the skin. It has been known to treat boils, psoriasis, eczema, and of course acne. It does this by renewing the liver.


Make an herbal tea by placing two or three teaspoons (2-8 grams) of dried root into a cup of hot water for ten minutes.

Choose to lower stress.,
Relax with aromatherapy.,
Take herbal supplements for stress.",How to Treat Cystic Acne with Herbs3," Cystic acne (and non-cystic acne) is also sometimes triggered by stress. Stress triggers a change in hormones, which can increase the amount of oil the skin produces. The result is an increase in pimples.


To keep stress from making your cystic acne worse, take measures to reduce it in your daily life.Find ways to relax, get more rest, etc.
Exercise is a good way to release the emotions associated with stress.

, Smelling pleasant, soothing scents can relax you, sometimes instantly. Scents trigger your olfactory system, which sends signals to the part of your brain that controls emotions. In this portion of the brain, chemicals that make the body feel good are released.Aromatherapy can reduce stress to prevent a cystic acne outbreak.


Use fresh lavender sprigs in a bath to release the scent. Soak for 20 minutes.Drink a cup of chamomile tea, lemon balm tea, hawthorn tea, or passionflower tea.
Keep a sachet of dried passionflower leaves, roots, and petals near your pillow to help you sleep. You can also place the sachet in a warm bath.

, Use herbal supplements in pill or capsule form to reduce stress. Taking these supplements at bedtime will also help you sleep. Just don’t take more than one kind of herb at the same time. An herb like valerian root relaxes your body for sleep. #*Consume valerian root capsules at bedtime or during times of high stress during the day."

Spray on some hair spray.",How to Make a Katniss Inspired Braid," Creating a Katniss inspired braid is easier than you might think. It is like a French braid, but it starts lower, wraps around the side and back of your head, and looks messier. To create the look, you will need:shampoo and conditioner
comb and/or brush
anti-frizz or leave in conditioning spray (optional)
a crimper or texturizing spray
extensions (optional)
bobby pins
a rubber band
curling iron (optional);
, Wash and dry your hair first and then brush and/or comb through it until it is completely tangle-free. You can use an anti-frizz serum or a leave in conditioner if you like.


Some people find braiding easier with damp hair, but it depends on the texture of your hair. If you have fine, thin hair, then starting with damp hair is a good idea. However, if you have thick hair that is also curly or wavy, then you should start with dry hair.

, If your hair is textured, then it will have more volume and look more impressive. You can texturize your hair with a crimper or using some texturizing spray, which is what the Hunger Games hair stylist used when she created Katniss' braid for the films.








To crimp your hair, start near your roots and then crimp across your hair down to the ends. Hold the crimper for a few seconds on each section.To use a texturizing spray, pour a small amount onto the palm of your hand or spray it directly onto your hair. Then use your hands and fingers to work the texturizing spray through your hair so that the strands are evenly coated. If you prefer, you can use mousse or gel instead of texturizing spray., If your hair is thin or too short to complete the braid, then you may want to add some extensions to your hair. Choose extensions that are about the same color as your hair so that they will blend in.To put in the extensions, lift up a section of your hair on the back of your head.
Then, place the extensions on back of your head and secure the extensions with bobby pins. Tug on the extensions to ensure that they are tight and will not fall out.
Then, unclip the section of hair above the extensions and let it fall over the extensions.

, Katniss’ braid starts just behind and slightly above her left ear. Take the hair from this area and divide it into three equal-sized strands. Then, begin braiding your hair by crossing the sections over each other, but do not go too far. Just cross over the first three strands.If your hair tangles easily, then you may want to brush it again before you start braiding.

, Katniss’ braid wraps around the side and back of her head. To achieve this effect, you will need to add hair to the braid as you braid. After you cross the first three strands, take a piece from behind your left ear and pull it into one of the strands. Then, cross the strands again.








Continue to pull a piece of hair into the braid every time you cross the three strands.

, You will need to continue braiding towards the back of your head so that the braid will be able to wrap around the back of your head. Use the same braiding technique as you used for the side of your head. Keep adding in hair as you go.Make sure that the braid stays above the hairline on your neck.
Keep the ends taut as you braid to ensure that there will not be any bumps weak spots in the braid.

, When you get to the right side of your head, just behind your right ear, you can begin to braid downwards. Do a normal three strand braid for the rest of your hair. Then, secure the end of the braid with a rubber band.








Make sure that you grab any remaining long strands of hair before you start braiding and add them to the braid.

, If you notice any spots around the back of your braid that look loose or in danger of falling out of the braid, then you might want to reinforce them with a couple of bobby pins.


To use a bobby pin, open up the bobby pin and then slide it over the loose piece and connect it to some of the hair on your scalp. You will probably need a couple of bobby pins for each loose strand.
It is okay if the braid looks messy with a few loose strands near the front, but you don’t want it coming undone completely.

, If your braid looks a little thin, then you can gently tug on the sides of your braid to widen it. Start near the top the braid and grab a couple of pieces on opposite side of the braid and pull them apart slightly.Do not pull too hard or you may undo part of the braid. Just pull enough to make the braid look a little wider and looser.

, If your hair is naturally wavy or curly, then you do not have to worry about doing anything with the loose pieces in front. But if you have really straight hair, then curling these pieces is a nice finishing touch.








Make sure that the curling iron is hot before you use it. Turn it on about 15 minutes before you want to use it.
Starting at the end, clamp a piece of hair and wrap it around the curling iron barrel until you are an inch or two away from your scalp. Do not allow the curling iron to ouch your scalp or it will burn you.
Then, unravel the curling iron and release the hair.
Repeat the same process for the other pieces.

, If you want your Katniss braid to last all day, then finish it with an all over mist of strong hairspray. Spray the braid, back of your head, sides, and loose pieces.


Make sure that you close your eyes and hold the can about 12 to 18 inches from your head.

Apply aloe vera gel to the acne.,
Drink fresh ginger tea.,
Drink three liters of water a day.,
Do regular exercise.,
Eat healthily.,
If symptoms persist, see a dermatologist.",How to Treat Nodular Acne1," This is one of the best natural treatments for acne; aloe vera contains many nutrients that nourish the skin and help to speed up the healing process.


Break a leaf from an aloe vera plant and squeeze out the gel-like sap. Apply the gel all over your face (or wherever skin is affected by acne) and leave it there for 30 minutes before rinsing off.
If you don't have an aloe vera plant, you can buy aloe vera juice at a local organic market, or buy aloe vera based skincare products at a pharmacy.;
, Ginger juice is anti-inflammatory and works very well to reduce acne inflammation, redness and pain.


Put three or four slices of fresh ginger in one cup of boiling water and allow it to steep for 3 to 5 minutes.
Drink the tea once it has cooled slightly. Do this at least twice per day.

, Drinking water will eliminate toxins from your body and skin, which helps to diminish the severity of the acne.


Aim to drink three liters of water a day. You can make water more interesting by infusing it with things like mint leaves, berries, ginger and lemon. Try this recipe for sassy water.
You can also increase your water intake by drinking herbal teas and eating fruits and veg with a high water content like watermelon, celery, beets, strawberries and peaches.

, Stress can provoke nodular acne, therefore it is a good idea to minimize your stress through exercise.


Try to find a form of exercise that you enjoy - whether that's running, swimming, dancing or kickboxing. You will find it easier to motivate yourself to exercise regularly if you enjoy what you're doing.
You should also give yoga classes a try, as this helps to de-stress both the body and mind. Experiment with doing 30 minutes of yoga four times a week.

, Be careful with your diet - try to avoid all greasy and sugary food, as these can make acne worse. Instead, try to eat more fruit and steamed vegetables. #*Cooking vegetables through steaming helps to retain the nutrients better, and these nutrients are exactly what your skin needs.


Especially try to eat green leafy vegetables that are rich in vitamin A, citrus fruits like orange, grapefruit and tomato, and also carrots and red bell peppers.

, Nodular acne very often leaves scars that does not away with time, so is a good decision to see a dermatologist if the acne persists.


The home remedies above may help to lessen the severity of nodular acne, but they probably won't be able to cure it.
Medications are usually required to treat severe forms of acne and lessen the chance of scarring.

Do a course of isotretinoin.,
Get a prescription for oral antibiotics.,
Apply a topical form of benzoyl peroxide.,
Use a topical retinoid cream.,
Talk to your doctor about hormonal therapy.",How to Treat Nodular Acne2," This drug has been approved for the treatment of severe forms of acne, such as nodular acne.Following a course of isotretinoin, the success rate for curing severe acne is around 70 to 90%.


This medication works by diminishing the production of sebum from the sebaceous glands, which reduces the number of comedones (blackheads). It will also reduce the level of P.acnes - the acne-causing bacteria.
The recommended dosage is usually 0.5mg/Kg/day twice a day for 15 to 30 weeks. I this low dosage is well-tolerated, then the doctor may raise the dosage to 1mg/kg/day.
This medication has various side effects negative side effects (dry, cracked lips, extremely dry, flaking skin, nosebleeds, delayed healing, etc.) that can prevent a patient from continuing with treatment.

, Oral antibiotics are commonly prescribed by dermatologists to treat nodular and other forms of acne. The most common antibiotics used to treat nodular acne are:


Tetracycline and its congeners. The dosage is usually 250 to 500 mg twice a day for 4 to 6 months.
Doxycycline. The dosage is usually 50 to 100 mg twice a day for 4 to 6 months. .
Erythromycin is another antibiotic used to treat nodular acne; the dosage is 500mg twice a day for 4 to 6 months.
Clindamycin is the latest antibiotic used in the treatment of nodular acne. It is very effective at killing the acne bacteria. The dosage is 300 mg, taken every 8 hours for 15 days to one month, depending on the results.

, Your doctor will prescribe you benzoyl peroxide in lotion form to use in conjunction with antibiotics.


Benzoyl peroxide is a bactericidal agent. It is absorbed into the skin through the pores, where it kills the P.acnes bacteria causing the acne.
Topical benzoyl peroxide is used in concentrations of 2.5% to 10%. It should be applied to the affected skin twice daily.

, Retinoids inhibit the formation of blackheads and reduce inflammation. Tretinoin seems to be the best of all retinoid compounds, and is used twice a day over the nodular acne.


For nodular acne, it is recommended that you use a retinoid cream that contains a mixture of tretinoin and clindamycin (a form of antibiotic).
This cream is usually applied twice a day over the nodular acne.

, When the nodular acne is hormone-related (in women), your doctor may prescribe contraceptive pills to help get the hormones causing the acne under control.


When there is high level of androgen (a male hormone) in the blood, the skin produces more sebum, leading to whiteheads and blackheads, acne cysts and nodules.
Contraceptive pills help to lower the level of androgen in the blood, therefore reducing acne.

Start with dry hair.,
Separate hair into three sections.,
Spray each section with heat protectant.,
Wrap 1- to 2-inch sections of hair around a 19mm (3/4-inch) curling wand.,
Spray your hair with hairspray.,
Tame the curls.",How to Get Taylor Swift Hair1," It is not necessary for your hair to be freshly washed, but if you do wash your hair before styling it, you may find it useful to add some volumizing spray to it before you blow it dry.


You can apply some products after blowdrying your hair, so just be sure to follow the instructions of whichever product you choose.;
, With your hands, use your thumbs along the sides of your head to help you separate the top third of your hair from the bottom. Use a clip to hold this section in place. To create the other two sections, simply separate the remaining hair into two halves with your left and right hands. Lay the left section over your left shoulder, and the right section over your right shoulder.


It is not necessary to clip these two bottom sections.

, Starting with one of the two bottom sections, brush the hair with a paddle brush and then spritz the entire length of hair with a heat protectant.

, Starting at the back of your head and moving toward the front, alternate between curling towards and away from your face. For the pieces of hair that frame your face, you’ll want to curl away from your face. Each curl should look like a little spiral.


Hold each strand on the wand for roughly 20 seconds. It could be slightly less time depending on the quality of your wand and the thickness of your hair. If your hair is fine or damaged, you may want to start at 10 to 15 seconds to see if that works for you.
Curling away from your face means pulling your hair away from your face to wrap it around the wand. Curling towards your face means pulling your hair towards your face to wrap it around the wand.
If your hair doesn’t hold curls well, as you let the curl slide off the wand, let it fall into the palm of your hand and hold it there until it cools off., Ensure that you cover all of your hair with hairspray. Fold your body over so that your head is upside down and your hair is hanging towards the floor, and then shake your head in a “no” motion as you spray your hair.

, Run your fingers through your hair gently to mould the curls together and shape them into a look that you’re happy with.


For a slightly softer look, lightly run a paddle brush (a large, flat brush) over the top layer of your hair while also working it with your fingers until you get a look that you are happy with. This will make the curls look more natural.

Wash your face.,
Use a plant-oil based product.,
Apply products with your fingertips.,
Skip the exfoliation.",How to Treat Cystic Acne Naturally1," To help fight off acne, wash your face at least twice a day. This is especially true after you have sweat heavily.Also make sure you take a bath once a day. If you have sweated a lot, take a shower afterwards.;
, When choosing a face wash, choose one that is gentle and is plant-oil based. Look for a cleanser labeled as “non-comedogenic,” which means it doesn’t encourage new acne.Try glycerin, grapeseed oil, hempseed oil, and sunflower oil, as well as others. Oils are the best to use to absorb and dissolve other oils.You can also use castor oil , calendula oil, or argan oil.Also try heating shea butter until it has a smooth, oil-like consistency.Try products from Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Olay. There are also many store brand products that are non-comedogenic. Check the label.

, When washing your face, use your fingertips instead of a cloth. Using a washcloth or sponge can irritate the skin. Also avoid scrubbing while washing or drying your face. It can cause damage to your skin.

, Exfoliation can do more harm than good by causing micro-scarring and scarring. It can also make acne worse.The American Academy of Dermatology also recommends staying away from astringents and toners. Dry, red skin makes acne appear worse.”Salicylic acid (beta hydroxy acid) and Alpha hydroxy acid can dry out and irritate your skin. Alcohol also dries and damages your skin as well."

Purchase a pair of high-quality hair scissors with short blades.,
Ensure that your hair is clean, dry, and straight.,
Section off hair to be made into bangs.,
Separate your bangs from the rest of your hair.,
Separate your bangs into three sections.,
Lightly pull your hair straight down before cutting.,
Cut into your bangs with small, upward motions.,
Cut straight across.,
Style the rest of your hair as you wish.",How to Get Taylor Swift Hair2," The longer the blades, the less control you have, so aim for something on the shorter end.If the actual cutting part of the scissors is around 2.5 inches (roughly 6.5cm), that should work well.


Some stylists even recommend using cuticle scissors, but you will likely have more luck achieving this particular style of fringe (i.e. the blunt style) with a pair of scissors that are specifically designed for cutting hair.
If you do use cuticle scissors, ensure that they are not curved, as this will likely make it more difficult for you to cut where you want to cut.

, Make sure it has no product in it. If it is naturally wavy, use a straightening iron on your bangs before you begin to cut them.

, If you already have bangs and are just looking to reshape them into Taylor Swift’s blunt look, ignore this step. Depending on the shape of your head and face, if you pull your bangs into a ponytail that drops down over your face, the part around your bangs (where you can see your scalp) will resemble a rounded triangle, with the wide base of the triangle being where your hairline meets your forehead.


Exactly how long (i.e. how far back on your head) and wide (i.e. how far it spans across your forehead) that triangle is depends on your facial shape. Look in a mirror and experiment with different lengths and widths until you find the section of hair that best works for you.

Be very careful not to go too wide. If you’re unsure, start narrow and move outward. A good rule of thumb is to stick to the hairline on top of your head, and leave the hairline along the sides of your face alone.


Once you find a shape that you're happy with, tie it with an elastic to make a ponytail that hangs down the middle of your face. Pull down on the ponytail very gently (if you pull down hard, your hair will come out shorter than desired), and cut it so that your hair, when out of the ponytail, lands between your eyes and eyebrows (aim for somewhere in the middle).

Ultimately you’ll want your bangs to be just at eyebrow level, but you don't want to cut to that level right away. Give yourself some room to work with!



, Comb your bangs straight over your forehead, and then clip them together so that they don’t get pulled back with the rest of your hair. Pull the rest of your hair back into a tight ponytail. You can also use clips to hold that hair back if you prefer (or if you have shorter hair that can’t all be pulled back into a ponytail).

, You don’t need to clip these into separate sections, but you’ll want to work on the sections moving from one side to the next. This makes your hair easier to work with, and will give you nicer results than if you simply try to cut the whole chunk of hair at once.

, Do not pull your hair outward. Pull it downward. If you pull it outward or pull down too hard on your hair, your bangs will be too short. Remember this as you move to each section of your bangs.

, Hold your bangs between your pointer and middle fingers on one hand as you cut with the other. In small, one-centimeter increments, cut upward into your bangs, with high-quality short-bladed scissors, until you’ve reached the ideal length — so that the bangs hit your eyebrows.

, Once you’ve reached the ideal length, cut straight across your bangs. This is basically just trimming the jagged edges from the upward cutting. This should be a very small trim to the edges — think millimeters, not centimeters, at this point!

, To replicate Taylor Swift’s hair with these bangs, you would either straighten all of your hair with a flat iron for the purely straight look, or straighten just your bangs and then add light wave to the bottom of your hair for the wavy look.


To make the bottom of your hair wavy with a flat iron, start at the top of your hair, pull the iron about 40% of the way down your hair, then, holding the bottom of your hair lightly, twist the iron so that your hair is wrapped around it, with the bottom strand still coming out the bottom of the iron, then drag the iron down the rest of your hair until it reaches the end. Go more slowly for more defined curls.

To make curls with a flat iron that cover more of your head, start higher up on the hair strand — for instance, right away instead of 40% of the way down).

If you wash your hair before doing this style, add volumizer or a similar hair product as part of your styling process/while drying. If you do this, there is no need to add an additional volumizer to your hair later in the process.

, If possible, make sure that this has heat protectant properties. If not, you may want to add a few spritzes of heat protectant to your hair as well.

, Using a comb, mark out a straight side part and comb your hair so that it falls neatly on either side of the part.


You may find it useful to fasten your bangs (or the front piece of your hair that will be styled to look a bit like bangs) on the larger side of your part to the side while you work on the rest of your hair.

, Starting at the side of your part that has less hair, wrap different-sized chunks of hair around the barrel of a 1.5-inch (38mm) curling wand. Pull the chunks of hair towards your face as you wrap them around the wand, and hold them there for 10 to 20 seconds.How long you should hold your hair on the wand will depend on the power of your wand and the type of hair you have. For example, if you have fine hair, it will take less time than if it’s thick.
The chunks of hair should be more vertically thick (going from the top of your head to the bottom of it) than horizontally thick (going from one side of your head to the other), as you want long, soft, waves more than tight curls.
If you are unsure of what size each chunk of hair should be, aim for between 2 and 3 inches thick.

, If you already have bangs, you needn’t do much beyond brushing them to the side and tucking them in so that they blend with your hair depending on their length. If they’re longer or if you don’t have bangs, pull the chunk of hair at the front of the large side of your part (i.e. where your bangs would be) up above your head and wrap it backwards, away from your face, around the curling wand. Wait for 10 to 20 seconds, then let it go.

, Move on to the rest of the hair on the large side of your part, continuing to pull the chunks of hair away from your face as you wrap them around the wand.

, Gently run your fingers through your hair in order to break the curls up and blend them into waves. You can also do this with a large-tooth comb.

, Spray your hair with texturizing spray and style it with your hands to get it into the shape you desire.

As you need it to hold curls and pins, you might even find that it helps if it’s a day or two after being washed. Keep in mind that you’ll want your hair to have volume, so if it’s oily and flat, you may want to either dry it out with a spray shampoo, or, if you do end up washing and drying it, use a volumizing spray.

, Using a comb, mark out a straight side part and comb your hair so that it falls neatly on either side of the part.

, This will really depend upon how much hair you have. Maintaining the side part, use a comb and hair clips to section off your hair in a way that facilitates the most curls. The more curls, the better!

, Starting with the back, bottom sections of your hair, go around your head with a 1- or 1.5-inch curling iron or wand and curl roughly 1- to 2-inch sections of hair, alternating between curling your hair towards and away from your face.

, If you have shorter bangs, you’ll simply brush them sideways towards the larger side of your parted hair. What you do will depend on the length of your hair/bangs, but ultimately you want to try to incorporate them into the rest of your hair on the larger side part.

, This will help to break up the curls and make them look a bit more like soft curls/a natural wave.


If you find that your hair looks frizzy, add a small amount of shine serum to your hands before running your fingers through your hair.

, To make a more voluminous-looking bob, tease your hair lightly. This will also help bring it up a bit more if it’s quite long. To tease your hair, gently hold a chunk of your hair above your head (being careful not to ruin the curl) and back-comb it (brush it downwards, from the end towards your scalp) with a teasing brush.


You can also tease your hair with a fine-toothed comb, but some stylists say that this is more damaging than using a proper teasing brush.

, Once all of your hair is curled, spray it with a hairspray that boasts a strong and flexible hold. If your bangs are shorter, you may find it helpful to give them an extra spritz of hairspray to hold them in place once you’ve brushed them to the side.


Spray waxes are also great for maintaining hold and flexibility, and are less likely to become flakey and white if you overdo it. (Although if you put too much spray wax on, you’re like to have oily-looking, heavy hair.)

, Take a triangular section of hair at the nape of your neck, with the tip of the triangle pointing up away from your neck (the larger base at the nape of your neck). Tease your hair before wrapping it into a messy bun, securing it with bobby pins., Section the top part of your hair away, and begin with the lower part, tucking your curls in loosely to the bun at the nape of your neck. Repeat until that section is done, then start on the top section, leaving shorter layers out and pinning longer ones into the bottom of the bun.

, Finish off the look by leaving out your shorter layers as well as the hair at the very front of your head, which frames your face. You will achieve the best results if you have layered hair, but if you don’t, it just means you’ll have a longer (but still lovely) looking bob! Once you're happy with how it looks, you can either leave it as-is, or plump it up a bit more with a teasing comb and give it one final spritz with hairspray.

Wash your face.,
Pick the right essential oil.,
Add essential oils.,
Place your face over the steam.,
Rinse and pat dry when finished.,
Repeat twice a day.",How to Treat Cystic Acne Naturally2," When you wash your face, start by wetting your face with lukewarm water. With your fingertips, apply your cleanser to your face in gentle, circular motions. Do this for about a minute. After, rinse your face with lukewarm water thoroughly. Pat dry using a clean, cotton towel.

, There are a few oils that are good for acne. Tea tree oil is an antiseptic and anti-inflammatory oil that is also antifungal and antibacterial. It is believed to be just as effective as benzoyl peroxide in treating acne. You can apply tea tree oil directly onto the cysts. Use a cotton ball or swab to gently apply 100% tea tree oil directly onto the cysts twice a day.


Be careful not to get any tea tree oil near your eyes.You can also use boswellia oil, also called frankincense, in the steam treatments. Boswellia oil is an anti-inflammatory.Always test for sensitivity to essential oils. Put a single drop of the oil on your wrist and wait for 10 to 15 minutes. If there is no irritation, you should be able to use the oil.

, Start steam-cleaning your face by boiling water. Fill a pot with one quart of water and heat until it boils. At this point, add one to two drops of the essential oil of your choice. After adding the oil, let the water boil for another minute. Then, turn off the heat and move the pot to a sturdy table or counter. Place a potholder under the pot to protect the surface you place it on.


Adding an essential oil, such as tea tree oil or boswellia/frankincense oil, adds antibacterial or antiseptic properties to the steam. This means the oils can kill bacteria that can cause pimples. Using these oils can help prevent the formation of pimples.
If you don’t have the essential oils, substitute ½ teaspoon of dried herb per quart of water.

, To perform the treatment, cover your head with a large towel. Place your face over the steaming pot, but stay at least 12 inches above it.


Close your eyes and breathe normally. Remain over the steam for 10 minutes. This helps open your pores and dilate your blood vessels.

, When 10 minutes has passed, rinse your face with lukewarm water. Gently pat your face dry without rubbing your skin.


At this point, apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer.

, When first starting a steam treatment, do it twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. After a few weeks, you should start to see an improvement in your skin. When you see an improvement, reduce the frequency to once a day.

Let the mixture dry for 15 minutes, then rinse off completely with lukewarm water. Pat dry, then follow with a non-comedogenic moisturizer.

, Processed sugars and dairy products can cause acne in some people by increasing inflammation and producing an environment for bacteria to grow. Studies have shown low-glycemic index, or low sugar, foods can reduce acne. Consider eliminating sugary soft drinks from your diet.Another change that might help decrease acne is switching dairy products and fatty foods for more vegetables in your diet.


Low GI foods include rolled oats and bran cereals; whole wheat and whole grain breads; vegetables, except beets, pumpkin, and parsnips; nuts; fruits aside from watermelon and dates; legumes; yogurt; and brown rice, barley, and whole grain pasta. , Vitamins A and D are believed to be the most important for skin health.Omega-3 fats can help with acne because they have anti-inflammatory properties.Vitamin A rich foods include sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash. Fruit, such as cantaloupe, mangoes, and apricots, also contains a lot of vitamin A. Legumes, meat, and fish, such as herring and salmon, also provide good amounts.Vitamin D rich foods include salmon and tuna, along with cod liver oil. Dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, also has vitamin D.The best way to get Vitamin D is to be out in the sun for 10 to 15 min in the morning or late afternoon three to four times a week.Omega-3 fatty acids are found in flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, chia seeds, butternuts, and walnuts. Fish, like salmon, sardines, mackerel, and whitefish, are excellent sources of omega-3s. Basil, oregano, cloves, and marjoram contain omega-3s, so do vegetables like spinach and Chinese broccoli., Oil is one of the best ways to wash an oily face because it removes oil and dirt without stripping your skin.Cleanse your face twice a day with the cleanser. Also use it after you sweat.


Choose a non-comedogenic oil, like argan oil, hemp seed oil, shea nut oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, or castor oil. Choose either tea tree or Boswellia essential oil to add to the cleanser.
Add three to five drops of essential oil for every fluid ounce of oil. Mix the two oils well. Store away from light.

, Pour a small amount of the oil mixture into your hand and massage onto your face for two minutes. Use small, circular motions. Place a washcloth you have soaked in warm water on your face. Leave it on your face for 20 seconds. Then, gently wipe off the oil. Rinse the washcloth in warm water and repeat until all the oil is removed from your skin.


Don't rub too hard or you will irritate your skin.
Pat your face dry with a cotton towel.

, Don’t be in the sun or use tanning beds. Sunlight and tanning beds can damage your skin cells because of damaging UVB radiation. Certain acne medications even make your skin more sensitive to the sun.

Consider your hair length.,
Create a base texture for your hairstyle.,
Think about color.",How to Get Serena Vander Woodsen's Hair1," A hallmark of Serena’s style is that her hair is long and flowing. You want your hair to fall at least to your mid-back.


If you have short hair, you can use extensions to achieve that added length.
Go to a salon to have your extensions put in, or put in clip-on extensions yourself.You can find these at most beauty supply stores, or order them online.
If you plan on going to a salon, feel free to buy glue-on or sew-in extensions. You can also ask your stylish to cut and color your hair while you have your extensions in to make them look more seamless.
You should buy extensions made from human hair because you can't use hot tools on synthetic extensions.You can style extensions like you should style your own hair, but brush delicately when you have clip-on extensions in, as these can come out.;
, You want your hair to be either slightly wavy or straight before you begin to style it.


If your hair is naturally straight or wavy, you won’t need to create a base style.
If your hair naturally forms tight ringlets, however, you’ll want to either straighten your hair with a flat iron or blow dry it straight.
If you straighten your hair either way, make sure you first apply a heat protectant serum, spray, or mousse.

, If you are really committed to maintaining Serena’s style, you might want to consider getting your blonde touched up.


If you have bright blonde hair, you could get some blonde low lights to add depth to your waves.
If your hair is a darker blonde, chunky and bright highlights would give you that sunny, textured glow.
If you decide to color your hair, go to a local salon, especially if you’re planning on highlights, rather than trying to add color yourself.

Use a finishing hair spray.,
Use a hair diffuser instead.,
Consider face shape.",How to Get Serena Vander Woodsen's Hair2," Before you start curling, you want to make sure your hair is prepped and ready.Always use a heat protectant before using styling tools to keep your hair healthy and easy to work with.
If you recently washed your hair, make sure it is completely dry before you start to curl.

, While you’re prepping your hair, you want to let your curling iron heat up.


A one-inch curling iron is a good, universal size for creating a wavy look.
Use the low or medium setting for thin and fine hair.
Only use a high setting on your curling iron if you have thick, coarse hair.
Anything over 340 degrees Fahrenheit runs the risk of damaging your hair., For Serena’s natural look, you’ll want to give your hair a slight side part before you begin curling.


This will help you curl your hair in a way that looks natural.

, Before you begin curling, clip up the top layer of your hair. This will make curling more manageable.


If you have really thin hair, you might not need to curl the top and bottom layers of your hair separately.

, You want to start in the back of your head and work forwards.


Since Serena has soft waves, you can curl relatively large sections of hair at a time.
Curl your hair in a clockwise direction away from your face for the most natural look.
Hold the curling iron with the end pointed down at the floor, and curl your hair around it. Instead of clipping the end of your hair in first, wind it around the barrel of the curling iron, and clip the end last.
Don’t hold your hair on the curling iron for too long. Two to three seconds for each curl should be plenty of time.
Once you release a curl, don’t touch it. This will give it time to set.
After you finish the bottom section of your hair, unclip the top of your hair, and begin curling it.

, Once you’ve curled all the sections of your hair, spritz them with a texturizing hairspray.


After you spray your hair, spray your hands with the same spray.
Run your fingers through your curls to break them up, and create a looser, more natural look.

, If you already have naturally wavy hair, you might only need a diffuser to create Serena’s effortless-but-chic waves.


A diffuser is simply an attachment for the end of your hair dryer.
Dampen your hair, or wash it, and let it partially air dry.
Apply a hair gel or mousse to enhance your natural hair texture. Don’t forget to also work in some heat protectant.
Turn your head over, and begin scrunching up the ends of your hair until it is completely dry.
Then, flip your head back over, and run your fingers through your waves.
Finish with a texturizing hair spray.

, Wavy hair is universally flattering, but if you have a long face, you should try to add a slightly more defined curl to the top layer of your hair for volume and roundness.

This will give your air-dry style more hold and definition. It will also combat frizz.

, It’s all right if you have some bumps in your hair, as Serena’s finished style is casual.

, To do this, grab the end of your pony, and twist it tightly. Once you have created a hair rope, twist this around the base of your ponytail.


Tuck the end of ponytail into the elastic.
Use bobby pins to secure the sides of the bun
If you don't want to use elastic, as this can cause breakage in fine hair, use spiral bobby pins or large plastic clips to secure your bun. It doesn't need to be extremely tight.

, If you have shorter hair framing your face, pin it back behind your ears with bobby pins. This will help it to dry to look natural and swept back.

, Your hair will set and dry as you sleep.

Apply a good amount of texturizing and volumizing product to your hair to create the shine and body that Beyoncé is known for. Pantene Pro-V’s Full & Strong Body Booster Spray is an affordable option that should available at your local convenience store.

, This method will give you the Beyoncé loose waves you're looking for. Use a 1.5 inch flat iron to create loose waves. Start by taking a small section of your hair (about 2 inches wide). Place the flat iron a few inches below your roots and clamp down. Proceed to twist the flat iron a turn and a half (in the direction towards you), so that your hair is wrapped around the flat iron. Slowly pull the flat iron down towards the ends of your hair. This will create loose, effortless looking waves.One small section at a time, use the flat iron to curl all of your hair. Twist your hair in the same direction for every curl so it develops a constant wave.

, Apply a dime sized amount of shine serum to your hands and run your fingers through your hair – Beyoncé's hair always has some shine. This will loosen the curls and create a shiny, glossy finish. Spray your hair with a flexible hold hairspray to keep your waves in place."

Wash your hair.,

Make the perimeter cut.,
Cut around the nape of your neck.,
Comb your hair forward.,
Cut the bangs.,
Cut the sides of your hair.,
Create the fringe area.,
Create a feathered look.,
Style your hair.",How to Get the Justin Bieber Haircut1," Before you begin to cut your hair, it should be washed so it's nice and clean and ready to transform. Your hair should also be reasonably long -- it should fall over your eyes, and when it hangs down, it should fall below your ears.;
, It should lie as straight as possible around your head. Run a comb through the strands until you've worked out all the kinks.








, To make the perimeter cut, brush your hair over to the right side by parting it a few inches above your left ear. Then, trim the hair below the left part to create curved lines that frame your face and just brush along the bottoms of your earlobes on the left side of your face. Then brush your hair over to the left and do the same with the hair that frames the right side of your face. You can worry about the hair in the middle of your hair later.








Start with half-inch sections of hair. You can cut them with scissors or by using a razor comb for a bit more texture.
It's best if you have an experienced hairdresser cut your hair for you, or at least a talented and trusted friend, instead of attempting to cut your own hair.

, Continue the cut line along the nape area in a smooth curve to keep up the outline of the hair and serve as an end-point for the interior layer. The nape of the hair should be long enough to lie along the neck. This will leave some room for the texturing stage which will be necessary later. You cannot cut your nap yourself.









Tilt your head down to make it easier to cut along the neckline., Comb the hair in the middle of your head forward, so it falls over your eyes. This will help you cut the hair and add texture to your layers.








, Comb your hair forward over your forehead -- this hair will create the bangs. Justin Bieber's bangs are exaggerated and take up more of his haircut than normal bangs. Pick up the left side of the hair -- just enough to fall comfortably between your index and middle finger, and trim half an inch off at a time with a razor comb, which both trims the hair and creates layers.









Hold the hair straight up the air move the comb up and down the hair quickly. Then pick up the middle of the hair, and then the right side, and repeat these steps.
Depending on the length of your hair, you can stop after 1/2 an inch (1.2 cm), or you can repeat the process until you have your desired length.
Remember to cut a bit longer than you want the cut to be because you'll go back over the layers to add texture, which will remove length.

, Now, go through the back of your hair, lifting up 1/2-inch (1.2 cm) chunks at a time, and cutting them to frame them around your face. Remember to leave the parts that you combed forward a bit longer, since the hair that falls over your forehead will be longer than the hair on the sides that frame your face. Just keep going through the strands of hair, and evening out anything that's too long.









The hair over your forehead should be 1/2 - 1 inch (1.2 cm - 2.5 cm) longer than the hair on your sides, depending on how dramatic you want the Bieber look to be.

, The fringe will be formed over the bangs. To create it, just brush the hair over the forehead again, and hold out the hair in half-inch bits, and then cut it with the razor comb so it falls over the frame created by the hair on the sides of the bangs. Don't pull the hair of the bangs too tightly, or you'll make them shorter than necessary. When you're done, you'll have a layered fringe area.








, If you'd like to create a more feathered look, you can use scissors to point cut the ends of the layers of the hair. To point cut your hair, hold a small chunk of hair between your fingers, and hold the scissors perpendicular to your fingers and parallel to your hair. Then, gently open and close the scissors over the hair -- you may not see a big change.








Take thin, vertical slices of the hair and point cut the ends of the layers. Make sure the point-cutting is evenly-spaced and gives the hair a fine texture instead of a choppy look.

, Once you've cut and textured your hair, work styling mousse evenly through your hair. Dry your hair using a round brush with medium-sized bristles and a blow dryer to create the curved direction of the strands of hair. Place a chunk of hair in the brush and angle it toward your face as you blow-dry it, so the hair is framed nicely around your face.









Your hair should look soft, feathery, and smooth.
Place a dab of pomade (styling wax) on your fingertips and rake them through your hair to give more definition to the layers.

Apply texturizing and volumizing product to your hair to create shine and body, rub in leave-in conditioner to keep your hair soft, and use a heat protectant to save your hair from any damage., Start by parting you hair however you'd like. Take the two front sections of each part, and blow-dry them upwards, using a round brush. You will twirl the brush backward, so that the hair is curling away from your face. This method will give you big, voluminous Beyoncé waves.Flip your head upside-down to blow-dry the rest of your hair. Use your fingers to move your hair around while you dry the remainder of your roots. Use a round brush as you dry the rest of your hair, and curl your hair around the round brush as you reach your ends.

, This will make it easier to curl all of your hair. Pull the top half of your hair up and secure it with a clip or hair tie so that you're able to curl the bottom half of your hair first. Then, divide the bottom portion of your hair into two sides. Focus on curling one side at a time.Once it's time to curl the top portion of your hair, divide it into two sides as well. Again, focus on curling one side at a time.
While you're doing this, plug in your curling iron so that it has time to heat up.

, Starting with the bottom portion of your hair, grab pieces of your hair one small section at a time. Starting close to your roots, wind your hair around the curling iron away from your face. Instead of clamping the iron down, hold the bottom 1/2 inch of your hair in place for 10 seconds. Then, let go of your hair and gently pull the iron away from your hair. Proceed to do this until the bottom half of your hair is curled.Unclip the top portion of your hair, and grab the first piece you'd like to curl. Instead of starting near the roots, start your waves about 1/4 of the way down your hair. Curl the top of your hair the same way you curled the bottom, by wrapping small pieces around your curling iron. Continue until you have curled all of your hair.

, Lightly comb through your waves with a brush or your fingers. Pour a dime sized amount of shine serum or oil into your palms, and spread evenly onto your hair. Hairspray your new Beyoncé hair to set it in place."

If you're starting with dry hair, use a spray bottle to dampen your hair. If you decide to wash your hair, let it dry a bit before putting your hair in buns., To get big, messy Beyoncé waves, you need to give your hair some body. Whether you use a cream, gel, or spray, be sure to apply a light coat to all of your hair.If your hair tends to get frizzy, apply a lightweight leave-in conditioner or oil as well.
If you plan on blowdrying your hair, apply heat protectant to your hair.

, How much hair you have will determine how many buns you'll need. If you have thicker hair, you will most likely need 2-3 buns. If you have finer hair, you can get away with 1-2 buns. Hold each section in place with a hair tie until it is time to put it in a bun.The way you divide your hair is completely up to you. For example, you can part your hair down the middle so that you have one bun on each side of your head, or you can place the top half of your hair in one bun, and the bottom half of your hair in another bun.
This method works best on longer hair styles. If you have shorter hair, you may need to add an extra bun or two to ensure that no pieces of hair are left out of a bun.

, Take the first section of your hair out of it's hair tie. Twirl your hair and twist it into a bun – think of tight Princess Leia buns, or the swirl of a cinnamon roll to give you an idea of what these buns should look like. Don't worry about the buns looking perfect, but make sure all of your hair is twisted tightly.Secure the bun with a hair tie, a hair clip, or bobby pins. Make sure the ends of your hair are tucked into your bun.
Repeat this process with each section of hair.

, Ideally, you should sleep in your buns overnight to set the waves into your hair. If you're able to sleep in your buns overnight, tie a scarf around your head to prevent your hair from frizzing.If you don't have all night to let your hair dry, it's time to blow dry those buns! To ensure your buns are thoroughly dried, blow dry each bun for at least 10 minutes. (Remember, if you plan on blowdrying your hair, use a heat protectant on your hair before you put it in buns).

, Unwrap each bun and gently loosen each twist with your fingers. Once you've taken all of your buns down, style your hair. If you like the messy waves, only use your fingers to comb through your hair. If you want a smoother look, brush your hair. Finish your Beyoncé look with hairspray."

Spray your hair (optional).",How to Get the Justin Bieber Haircut2," Your hair should be clean and wet so that you can cut it and style it to match Justin Bieber's new 2013 haircut.

, To get the new Justin Bieber haircut, you'll need to trim the hair on the right, left, and back of your head, leaving the hair thick along the center of your head. Brush your hair forward, and trim the hair on each side of your head, as well as in the back. The hair near the bottom of your hair should be just .4 inches (1 cm) long, and it should gradually be up to .8 inches (2 cm) long toward the top of the head.Use a trimmer to trim your hair. If you'd like it to be extra short, then give it a buzzcut.

, Trim the sideburns around your ear so they're nice and short, falling just an inch (2.5 cm) below the ear.

, Comb the remaining long strands of hair over your forehead, and trim your hair so it falls just over your eyes, with the longest strands of hair in the middle. Pick up the left side of the hair -- just enough to fall comfortably between your index and middle finger, and trim half an inch off at a time with a razor comb, which both trims the hair and creates layers. The bangs should be about 4 inches long at their longest (10 cm), but that depends on the size of your head.


Hold the hair straight up the air move the comb up and down the hair quickly. Then pick up the middle of the hair, and then the right side, and repeat these steps.
Note that these bangs are similar to the bangs of Justin Bieber's old hairstyle -- this hairstyle just doesn't have much hair on the sides of the head, which makes the bangs look more dramatic and mo-hawk like.

, Blow dry your hair from below, so the bangs in the center dry straight up. Use your hands to pull up or hold up the hair while you're drying it for extra security. You can even use a round brush to help hold up the hair, but that isn't necessary.

, Place a quarter-sized amount of hair wax in your hands and then rub it around to cover your palms. Then, raise your hands and run them both sideways through your hair, so that you clasp your hands together near the base of the bangs. Then, move your hands up to give your hair volume and texture and to style it up with the wax.


Repeat this gesture at least 5-6 times, moving your clasped hands up through the top, middle, and back of the bangs until they're sticking up.

, Rub a bit more hair wax onto your fingers and grab little bits of your bangs at a time, pushing them up.

, Use a comb to brush the hair straight up and then to curve it up and away from your forehead, so the top of the bangs are curved backwards. The hair behind the top can move toward the top and can lie more flat on the head, or it can be moving straight up as well -- it depends on which Bieber look you want to achieve.

, If you really want those bangs to stay up, you can spray hair spray over your locks.

Using your favorite brush or wide tooth comb, brush out your hair to make sure that it’s smooth and ready to work with. Once you’ve gotten rid of any knots, brush your hair backwards. Do not part your hair in this hairstyle., Half of your hair will be tied up in a ponytail, and the rest will be down, styled into soft curls. The first thing you need to do is split your hair into these two sections. Place your pointer fingers right above your ears. Run your hands backwards, so that they meet at the crown of your head.All of the hair above that line will go into your ponytail, and the rest will stay down.

, Use a clip or a hair tie to get this top section out of your way. You will be styling the bottom section first, so don’t worry about creating the perfect ponytail right away. Double check that you’re happy with the sectioning you created, and make sure it’s securely pinned or tied up., If there is one word to describe Ariana’s hair, it’s big. You want to create all the big, bouncy volume you can. Use a rattail comb or your hairbrush to tease the roots of all the hair in the bottom section.If you’re not familiar with teasing hair, learn all about it here.


Once you’ve teased the roots and smoothed the outside, spritz it with a bit of hairspray so it holds the volume.

, Ariana typically styles her hair into big, soft curls, which are luckily pretty easy to create. Heat up your curling iron or your curling wand, and grab a one-inch section of hair. Wrap the hair around the barrel, starting about half way down the strand.You only want to curl the ends of your hair, rather than the entire strand. Hold for about five seconds, and then release the hair.

If you do not have a curling iron or a curling wand, learn how to curl your hair with a straightener here.

, After you’ve created the curls with a hot tool, use your fingers to gently break up the curls and loosen them up. Ariana’s curls typically look loose and casual, so tousle yours a bit to achieve her style. Your curls will also fall a bit over the course of the day. Once you’re satisfied with your curls, clip or tie the bottom section into a low, loose ponytail to keep it out of the way while you work with the top section., Unclip the top section, and run a brush through it again. Use one hand to hold your hair into a ponytail, and use the other hand to smooth out the top section, making sure it’s sleek and smooth. Tie it with a hair tie, making sure it’s secure against the crown of your head., Grab a small piece from the back of the ponytail. Wrap it around the base of the ponytail so that it completely hides the hair tie. Ariana never has chunky hair ties showing, and this will make the entire hairstyle look more polished. Bobby pin the strand of hair into place., Once your ponytail is secured, you’ll need to add some curls to blend it with the rest of your hair. It’s easiest to do this after your ponytail is up because you can see exactly where you need to curl. Again, you’ll only want to curl the very ends of each strand, rather than the entire piece. Once you’ve created your curls, run your fingers through them to soften them up., Lift your ponytail straight up, and use a rattail comb or hairbrush to tease the base.

You can eliminate the build-up of these substances on the surface of the skin by washing twice daily, using a gentle, non-oily facial wash. Try not to wash too vigorously or use harsh skincare products, as this can dry out and irritate the skin.


Although it may seem like a good idea to wash more often, cleaning your face more than twice a day can dry out the the skin, causing it to produce more oil to compensate and leading to more whiteheads.
Not all oil is bad -- your face needs a certain amount of natural oils to stay healthy. Washing twice a day just helps to remove the excess.;
, Having greasy hair can contribute to more oil on the surface of the skin, increasing the chances of blocked pores. As well as washing your face, you need to ensure that your are washing your hair on a regular basis, thus preventing excess oil from building up on the face. Washing every two to three days should be enough for most people, unless you tend to have very oily hair.


Remember that over-washing your hair can actually cause your body to produce more oil to compensate. Washing everyday is overkill for most people.
If your hair is long, you tie it back in a ponytail if it needs a wash, especially when going to sleep at night. Wearing a hair band can also be a good idea if you're working out, to minimize sweat on your face.

, Oily make up and other skin care products are some of the worst culprits when it comes to clogging pores. As a result your should look for make-up, sunscreens and face lotions which have the word ""noncomedogenic"" on the label. This means that they are non-oily and will not clog your pores.


You should also be sure to wash out make-up brushes and sponges regularly, as these can harbor bacteria which causes whiteheads, blackheads and pimples.
Remember to always remove your make up with a gentle, yet effective cleanser at the end of each day. This will give your skin a chance to breathe overnight and reduce your chances of developing clogged pores.

, Benzoyl peroxide is an effective acne treatment which can be used to remove whiteheads, along with blackheads and cystic acne.

Try not to get benzoyl peroxide on any clothing, sheets or hair, as it can have a bleaching effect., Salicylic acid breaks down whiteheads and blackheads.It also helps to slow down the shedding of skin cells in the hair follicles, thus preventing pores from becoming blocked in the first place.


Salicylic acid is also available in various strengths over-the-counter, in both cream and ointment form.
This treatment can also be irritating on the skin, so make sure you apply it directly onto pimples and avoid the surrounding skin.

, Retinoid creams and gels are made from vitamin A derivatives and are pretty much a one-stop solution for an array of skin problems, from fine lines and wrinkles, to superficial scars and discolorations, to acne related issues. Retinoid creams can help to clear-up whiteheads by unclogging pores and promoting cell turnover.


Retinoid creams may cause your skin to become a little red and irritated when you first begin using them. These symptoms should subside as your skin adjusts to the new treatment.
Retinoids can also be taken in oral form and are very effective at reducing oil production and killing bacteria from the inside. These are usually only prescribed for severe acne, however., In some cases, you can make an appointment with a dermatologist to have your whiteheads extracted. The dermatologist will use a sterilized instrument, known as a comedone extractor, to lance the whitehead and remove the built-up sebum and dead skin cells inside.


Do not try this at home.

, If the whiteheads have not cleared after 8 weeks, see a dermatologist. If you follow the correct skincare guidelines and use one of the creams or treatments mentioned above, you should notice a distinct improvement in your skin within a couple of months.

, Tea tree oil is a natural essential oil which shows promising results in a few studies, and in traditional treatments. Use with caution and consider a patch test, as it can cause irritation or allergic reaction.To use the oil, dilute it to about 5% in a carrier oil (any vegetable oil), then apply directly onto the whiteheads using a q-tip.

, Oil, dirt and bacteria from your face can build-up on pillowcases over time, so even if you go to bed with a freshly washed face, you may be exposing yourself to unwanted oil and dirt overnight. To avoid this, replace your used pillowcase with a freshly washed one once a week.


This may not be important during a breakout, to prevent making the problem worse. In most cases, this is not the primary cause of acne.

, Honey has antimicrobial properties, but most studies have not focused on acne specifically.Dab a little honey directly on to the whiteheads or you can apply it all over as a face mask.


Many people consider manuka honey or raw honey the most effective options, although this is not guaranteed.

, Despite popular belief, there's no evidence that greasy food causes acne in most people. However, if you notice a possible connection between a particular food and acne, it won't hurt to stop eating it just in case. Just remember there is no universal ""acne diet,"" and that an extreme change in your diet is more likely to cause harm than help.


There is a slight, uncertain connection between dietary vitamin A and decreased acne.High doses of vitamin A can be dangerous, so do not take supplements without consulting a doctor.

, Dehydrated skin may produce excess oil to make up for the lack of moisture, and this may lead to worse acne. If your skin feels dry or your lips are cracked, drink plenty of water to make up for it. However, if you are already hydrated, drinking extra water will not have much effect.


Don't believe the factoid about ""eight glasses per day"". Just drink whenever you feel thirsty.

, It's a myth that you should pick at a whitehead or try to squeeze it out with your fingernails, as this can cause it to become irritated or infected and can lead to pimples and scarring.Even a ""comedone extractor"" from a beauty supply store can cause scarring when used by an inexperienced person.

, Many people hold their face over steam or apply a hot compress to open up pores, allowing trapped materials to escape. This can help in some mild cases. However, heat irritates some types of sensitive skin, which can make the acne worse.Gentle, lukewarm showers and facial washes are usually more effective.

, Acidic foods are not intended for use on skin. They can cause stinging, peeling, or even serious damage if left on for too long. Lemon juice and other citrus ingredients are extra dangerous, as they can react with sunlight to cause severe rashes."

Avoid high-dose or long-exposure treatments.,
Try topical glycolic acid.,
Consider topical azelaic acid.,
Request a prescription for topical antibacterials.,
Treat salicylic acid and BHAs with caution.,
Ask a doctor about benzoyl peroxide.,
Avoid high-risk treatments.",How to Treat Acne During Pregnancy1," The recommendations below are based on normal dosages only. No matter which product you choose, be aware of the following:


It's best to talk to a doctor or dermatologist before taking any medication while pregnant. This is especially true if you are already taking other medication.
Use only as recommended. Most products are intended for daily or twice-daily use only.
Don't use two or more products with the same active ingredients. Some ingredients used to treat acne are also in other skin care products.
Avoid face or body peels, which increase the amount of drug absorbed.;
, Glycolic acids and other alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are considered safe to use topically while pregnant. Very little of the drug is absorbed through the skin.Topical treatments are drugs that go directly onto your skin: lotions, gels, facial washes, etc. Oral treatments (pills) carry much higher risk. Do not take oral acne treatments during pregnancy unless directed by a doctor.

, The US FDA places azelaic acid in pregnancy category B. This means there is no known risk, but the drug has not been studied on pregnant women.It is considered safe when used as directed.This drug requires a prescription in some regions, including the US.
This drug is commonly sold as Finacea.

, Acne is often associated with excessive skin bacteria. Topical antibacterials (antibiotics) can help treat this condition. Clindamycin and erythromycin, two of the most common options, are both in pregnancy category B. They are considered safe to use during pregnancy.You'll need a prescription in most regions. If you do find an over-the-counter drug, confirm the other active ingredients are safe as well. These drugs are often combined with higher-risk ingredients., Salicylic acid and other beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) are in FDA pregnancy category C. This means the FDA has not ruled out risk to the fetus.That said, some doctors consider these drugs safe in topical form, at no more than 2% concentration.Salicylic acid is often confused with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which has complex effects on pregnancy.The two chemicals are closely related, but not identical. Ask your doctor about each one separately.

, This is another drug in pregnancy category C. Risk cannot be ruled out without more studies.However, the drug only passes through skin in small amounts, and the body metabolizes it quickly.Your doctor can help you judge the risk and choose a low-dosage product.

, The following acne treatments are not recommended during pregnancy:


Isotretinoin (Accutane) may cause birth defects or miscarriage.Tetracycline may affect bone and tooth development in the fetus.Tretinoin (Retin-A, Renova), adapalene (Differin), tazorac (tazarotene) and other retinoids may cause birth defects. The evidence is unclear, but it's still best to avoid these.This group includes most ingredients with ""retin"" in the name.
Hormonal therapy can cause major developmental changes to the fetus."

Apply hydrogen peroxide and direct pressure to encourage the blood to clot.Soak a clean tissue or washcloth in hydrogen peroxide, then apply gentle but firm pressure to the bleeding zit.,
Use an ice pack.,
Treat the bleeding with an astringent.,
Use a styptic pencil to stop stubborn bleeding.,
Press a potato slice against the bleeding source.,
Apply benzoyl peroxide to both clear up the zit and stop bleeding.,
Visit your doctor if the bleeding doesn't stop.,
Resist the urge to pop your pimples.It’s tempting to just get the offending pus out of your skin, but you should leave pimple popping to medical experts using professional tools.,
Continue using benzoyl peroxide.Most acne treatments on the market make use of it, so you can find it in a wide variety of styles.,
Try applying salicylic acid to your skin.The products on the market that contain salicylic acid come in a wide variety of strengths, so look at the packaging to determine which product will be best for you.,
Try Retin-A (tretinoin).,
Be gentle when washing your face.Many people mistakenly think that scrubbing at their skin will help clean and treat the skin more quickly.,
Use products as directed.If a product tells you to use it twice daily, don’t assume that using it four times a day will be twice as effective.",How to Stop a Zit from Bleeding," The pressure will encourage the blood to form a clot, while the hydrogen peroxide will kill any bacteria coming out of the zit. This will prevent your acne outbreak from spreading to the surrounding skin.


Note that hydrogen peroxide can dry out your skin, so make sure to moisturize once the bleeding has stopped.;
, Cold decreases blood flow to an area (whereas applying heat increases blood flow).If direct pressure alone does not stem the bleeding, try applying pressure with an ice pack. Place ice in a clean towel or washcloth and hold it to the bleeding source for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the bleeding stops.


Make sure the towel is clean to avoid the risk of introducing bacteria into your broken skin.

, Astringents like skin toner or witch hazel can be used both to tighten skin and to slow down bleeding.If you don’t have an astringent skin product around the house, you can use vinegar from your pantry. Soak a cotton swab or clean washcloth in the astringent and press it firmly against the blood source. With enough time, it should shrink the blood vessels and stop the flow of blood.

, Styptic pencils are antiseptic tools that are used to stop bleeding from small scrapes and cuts quickly and cleanly.They coat the area with alum or silver nitrate, stemming blood flow almost immediately.The waxy material also creates a thin barrier over the damaged skin, protecting it from bacteria and infection. You can buy a styptic pencil at the pharmacy or online.


Wet the styptic pencil, and apply it with gentle pressure to the zit until it stops bleeding.

, Research has shown that potatoes are a fast and effective way to stop bleeding from small cuts and scrapes.The starch soaks up water and blood plasma, and encourages the blood to clot quickly., Soak a cotton swab or tissue with benzoyl peroxide and apply direct pressure to the pimple. It will both encourage the bleeding to stop and attack the bacteria that causes zits in the first place. This will help prevent the spread of your outbreak to the rest of your skin.


Benzoyl peroxide can dry the skin out slightly, so be sure to apply moisturizer after washing it off.

, Bleeding from a minor source, such as a zit, should stop within one to nine minutes. If a minor wound bleeds more than that, it might indicate anemia or another blood clotting disease. Your doctor will be able to diagnose and address any underlying health problems that might contribute to your bleeding.

, When you pop a pimple, the bacteria that oozes out can get into the pores in the surrounding skin, actually spreading acne to otherwise healthy skin. You might also cause more bleeding, which is never a good thing!


A pimple should run its course within three to seven days, so just medicate it with topical treatments and wait it out.
Think about it this way: you probably want to get rid of the zit because you don't like the way it looks. But a zit is temporary. Popping it can cause scarring — and you probably won't like the way that looks, either, but the difference is the scarring is permanent. It's better to just wait out the pimple and allow it to clear up rather than risk permanently marring your skin.

, Depending on your preference, you can use benzoyl peroxide as a lotion, gel, cleanser, cream, or face wash. It kills off the bacteria that causes acne outbreaks and removes excess oil and dead skin cells from the surface of the skin.


Be careful not to get it on your clothing, as it can discolor dyed cloth.

, Like benzoyl peroxide, it comes in a variety of application styles: medicated wipes or pads, creams, gels, cleansers and face washes, and even shampoos.


Salicylic acid can cause skin irritation when you first start using it, so apply a small amount for a few days. You can gradually increase your usage as your skin adjusts to the product.
These products tend to dry out the skin. Make sure you moisturize regularly, and decrease your usage if the dryness gets out of hand.
Don’t use products with salicylic acid if you have any open or broken pimples on your face.

, This is a topical cream that must be prescribed by your doctor or dermatologist. Wash your hands before and after applying Retin-A, then wash your face with a gentle cleanser. Wait about 20 to 30 minutes, then apply the cream — if your skin is not try, the Retin-A may irritate it. Apply a thin layer to the acne lesions before bedtime or in the evening. Avoid the eyes, ears, and mouth.Retin-A can make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so make sure you limit exposure and wear sunscreen and protective clothing if you go outside. Never apply to sunburned skin.Consult your doctor if you are planning on getting pregnant.

, In fact, vigorous scrubbing usually makes acne worse. It irritates the skin, and can weaken its natural defenses against bacteria and infection.


Choose a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil or Noxzema. These soaps will help keep the skin moist and clean. The best way to massage to soap into the skin for cleaning is with you hands and fingers. Make sure you wash your hands before applying the soap.

, In fact, the opposite might be true: by upsetting the balance of your skin, you can cause redness, dryness, and irritation that keeps your skin unhealthy and uncomfortable.


Don’t give up on treatment too quickly! Many treatments take a long time to have a positive effect on unhealthy skin, so follow the instructions and be patient. Experts recommend waiting at least six to12 weeks before deciding a treatment doesn’t work for you.

Wash the affected area gently.,
Stop touching your face.,
Reevaluate your makeup.,
Learn about acne and diet.,
Take zinc supplements.,
Make natural skin treatments.,
Be careful with essential oils.",How to Treat Acne During Pregnancy2," Wash with lukewarm water twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Wipe gently using your bare hands only until your skin is free of excessive oil. Pat dry with a towel instead of rubbing.


Despite popular belief, acne is not caused by dirt. Scrubbing hard, using hot water, or washing more than twice a day can make your acne worse by irritating your skin.Wash again if you gets uncomfortably sweaty. Sweat may make acne worse., Many people touch their face without thinking, which can trigger a breakout. Try to keep your hands at your side.


If you have oily hair, wash and condition frequently, and keep it out of your face.
The physical irritation of your skin causes the breakout, not bacteria from your fingers. Keeping your hands clean won't solve the problem., Some makeup products help prevent acne, and others encourage it. Because skin is particularly susceptible during pregnancy, cosmetic products that did not bother you before can cause acne now. Stick to makeup labeled ""non-comedogenic."" This is less likely to clog pores.You may want to talk to your doctor about safe cosmetic use during pregnancy. In the United States, the FDA takes pregnancy into consideration when evaluating cosmetics.Not all countries have this level of protection.

, Although people often blame acne on diet, the connection is shaky. A healthy diet for you and your baby is much more important than an ""acne diet"" that might not even work.


Notably, some anti-acne diets cut fat (with only slight evidence). This is a bad idea while pregnant. Aim to get roughly 25–35 percent of your calories from fat., Oral zinc supplements seem to help acne, even though zinc lotions probably do not.15 mg of zinc per day (including from food) is recommended during pregnancy, and may even slightly reduce the risk of complications.Stop taking zinc supplements once you start breastfeeding.

, These are generally not as effective as medication, but the examples here have no risk of harming the baby. These come in two types:


To exfoliate clogged pores, add honey to superfine sugar or ground oatmeal, scrub gently, and rinse off. Use sparingly to avoid irritation or drying.
To soothe irritated skin, massage gently with a plain carrier oil (such as argan oil or olive oil).

, Some essential oils can be dangerous during pregnancy, including sage, jasmine, and many others. Different types of essential oil, including eucalyptus and citrus oils, are most likely safe but have not been thoroughly tested. If you decide to use them anyway, take these precautions:Never use them in the first trimester.
Confirm that the oil you chose is safe by asking a doctor or other trusted source.
Mix one drop into at least 1 tsp (5mL) of a carrier oil.
Use sparingly. Daily use carries a higher risk.

Request a short fade style.,
Request specific measurements.,
Ask for a textured cut near the top.",How to Do Daniel Craig Hair1," Request a ""short fade"" hair style at your barber's. This style will allow you to style your hair like Daniel Craig at home. The short fade style means your hair will start off longer near the top of your head and gradually get shorter as your barber works their way down the sides.A short fade helps emulate Craig because of the style Craig usually wears his hair. His hair frames his face by making a round curve near the top his head that fades out slightly towards his temples. This frames his face and softens his features.;
, Request your barber cut your hair between one and one point five centimeters (about .4 and .6 of an inch) on the sides. On the top of your head, request the length be around 2 centimeters (about .8 of an inch).It can also help to let your barber know you're going for a rounded effect. You want a look that will frame your face, so your hair's length should be reduce gradually as your barber moves from the top of your head to the sides., Texturizing a cut means hairs are cut with minor variations in length. While most of the hair near the top of your head will still be the appropriate two centimeters (.8 of an inch), your barber will cut some hairs shorter or longer here and there. These subtle variations in length create a sense of depth, making thinner, shorter hair look and feel fuller."

Towel dry your hair after showering.A microfiber towel is your best option for towel drying.,
Let your hair dry.,
Rub matt clay into your hair.You can purchase matt clay at most hair salons or online.,
Give your hair a messy part.,
Add some texture with your fingers.",How to Do Daniel Craig Hair2," Once you get out of the shower, very gently run a towel through your hair. Go slowly and be gentle to keep your hair looking smooth. If you want, you can apply a leave-in conditioner just prior to towel drying for added smoothness., It's always best to style your hair when it's completely dry. Towel drying does not usually completely dry your hair. You can use a blow dryer if you're in a hurry to dry your hair further.Air drying is also an option if you're not in a rush.

If you do go the blow drying route, blow dry your hair to one direction and slightly back. Use a small, round brush to direct your hair as you blow dry.This will help emulate the rounded style of Craig's hair. Remember, Craig's hair frames his face by curving around it., Start by applying the clay to the top of your head. Work the matt clay into your hair by moving from your roots to your tips. Push the clay outward from the top of your head as you go, dispersing the clay throughout your hair.Refer to your package's instructions for the precise amount to use. The amount of matt clay you need depends on your clay's specific formula.

, Near one side of your head, give yourself a somewhat messy part. Craig's hair is not known for being perfectly neat, so have some hairs criss-crossing to create a rough, uneven line separating your hair.A comb may create a very neat part, so it's easier to use your fingers to emulate the messy look of Craig's hair.

, Craig's hair creates a rounded shape that frames his face, so your hair should move in opposing directions on either side of the part. However, your hair should not lie completely flat. Use your fingers over a brush to style your hair. As you push your hair to frame your face, tousle your hair slightly using your fingertips. This will cause some hairs to stand up slightly, preventing a flat look. You want a slight spiked effect to give off the Daniel Craig vibe."
"
Plan extra time to style your hair in the mornings.,
Cut your hair every three weeks.,
Shave regularly.",How to Do Daniel Craig Hair3," The Daniel Craig look takes a bit of time and effort achieve, especially considering your hair should be completely dry before you style it. Make sure to give yourself an extra few minutes in the morning if you want to wear the Daniel Craig style to work or school.While blow drying your hair can speed up the drying process, it still takes a little extra time. Give yourself extra time even when blow drying.

, You need to keep your hair fairly short to maintain your style. Every three weeks, make an appointment with your barber to get a haircut.Remember to request a short fade and provide specific measurements., If you want to emulate other aspects of Craig's style, remain clean shaven. Craig is known for having minimal facial hair, so keeping your face bare can help you look more like Craig."

Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Clean your face.,
Gather clean dental floss.,
Remove the pimple.,
Clean the wound.,
Use over-the-counter topicals.,
Try prescription-strength topicals.,
Take oral prescriptions.,
Avoid known irritants.,
Be careful about what touches skin.",How to Remove Pimples Using Floss and Mouthwash," If you're set on popping a pimple by any method, it's important that you wash your hands before touching your face. The bacteria on your hand, even from just opening/closing the bathroom door, could potentially contaminate the small wound you're about to create or enter other pores on your face.Remember that bacteria is one of the leading causes of acne, along with excessive oil and dead skin cells.Scrub your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Make sure you get under your fingernails and between your fingers, and rinse all the soap away under clean, running water.If you do not have soap or running water, you can clean your hands with hand sanitizer. Simply squirt out hand sanitizer into one hand (about enough to apply to both hands), then rub your hands together. Be sure to cover every surface of your hands and fingers with the hand sanitizer, and keep rubbing your hands together until the hand sanitizer completely evaporates.;
, Not removing excess dirt and bacteria off of your face can also contaminate the site of the pimple, so it's important that you wash your face before and after popping any pimples.Benzoyl peroxide is one of the most effective ingredients to look for in a facial wash, as it kills bacteria on your skin. However, other ingredients like salicylic acid are also effective at exfoliating the skin, and may help by simply washing away bacteria.Do not over wash your face or scrub excessively. This may result in irritated skin and worsened acne.Wet your face with clean lukewarm or cool water.Apply the non-abrasive daily facial cleanser of your choice. Avoid scrubbing. Just gently rub it on your whole face, giving special attention to the affected area and surrounding areas.Thoroughly rinse your face using clean lukewarm water. Pat your face dry with a clean paper towel or a soft, clean cloth towel. Do not rub your face with the towel, as this may irritate the skin., Gather enough dental floss to wrap around your fingers as if you were about to floss your teeth. About 20 to 30 centimeters (approximately 8 to 12 inches) should be more than enough floss. Wrap both ends of the floss around your two forefingers so that you can properly angle and maneuver the floss., To actually remove the pimple, you'll simply position the floss right against one side of the pimple. Then draw the taut line of dental floss across the pimple, staying as close to the surface of your skin as possible.Try to use a somewhat swift ""scratching"" motion, but don't go too fast or you may inadvertently injure your face.Some people may want to do a second ""walk through"" with the floss to ensure any deposits in the skin are removed.Throw out the floss when you are finished.Do not reuse floss for any other purpose, including the popping of other pimples. Floss that has already been used can spread bacteria, and should be discarded immediately.

, Some folk remedies advise using mouthwash to clean the wound after you've popped the pimple. The reason for this is that mouthwash has antiseptic properties (due to the alcohol content of most mouthwashes), but mouthwash will not burn as badly as higher alcohol agents like pure rubbing alcohol would.Be advised that using mouthwash on your skin for pimple removal purposes is very likely to dry out the skin on your face. It can also make the area inflamed and even scaly.If you are intent on using mouthwash, simply pour a little unused mouthwash out of the bottle onto your face, or apply some mouthwash to a clean cotton ball and wipe the affected area on your face with the cotton.Do not reuse mouthwash that has touched your face or cleaned a wound. Pour out a little bit of mouthwash to use onto a cotton ball. If you contaminate the mouthwash it could potentially spread blood-borne illness and bacteria to your mouth or the mouths of others.

, Many over-the-counter medicated washes and topicals are available at drugstores and pharmacies that are proven to help fight acne. The most common ingredients found in over-the-counter products include:


benzoyl peroxide - works by killing bacteria to prevent pores from becoming clogged and forming new pimples. Benzoyl peroxide also helps clear away excess oil and dead skin cells, which could also clog pores if left untreated. Benzoyl peroxide is usually found in strengths varying between 2.5 percent to 10 percent in over-the-counter products.salicylic acid - helps prevent pores from clogging, and may even help unclog pores that have already become plugged.It is usually found between 0.5 percent and five percent strengths in most over-the-counter topicals.
alpha hydroxy acid - helps clear away dead skin cells and reduce inflammation, and may promote new, smoother skin growth. There are two types of alpha hydroxy acids: glycolic acid and lactic acid.
sulfur - helps clear away dead skin cells and excess oil from the body, and is usually used in combination with other topical over-the-counter ingredients when found in a skin wash or medicated topical. Be aware, however, that some products containing sulfur will carry an unpleasant odor.

, If you have severe acne or acne that hasn't responded to over-the-counter products, you may need to talk to your doctor or dermatologist about a prescription-strength medication. Common prescription-strength ingredients include:


retinoids - prevent pores and hair follicles from being plugged, thereby reducing the occurrence of acne.dapsone (Aczone) - kills bacteria and prevents pores from becoming clogged.antibiotics - topical antibiotics kill bacteria on the skin to help treat current outbreaks and prevent future occurrences of acne. Common antibiotics include clinamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin).

, There are a number of oral medications that your doctor may prescribe to help treat severe acne outbreaks. These may include oral antibiotics (specifically tetracyclines), or combined oral contraceptives for women and adolescent girls.Talk to your doctor or dermatologist about whether an oral prescription may be right for your acne treatment plan.

, Many products cause acne outbreaks because of their ability to enter and clog pores in your skin. If you're prone to acne, you may want to avoid potential irritants, especially oily or greasy products. These may include cosmetics, hair styling products, and acne concealers.Instead of oil-based products, choose water-based products or those labeled noncomedogenic (meaning that they're not as likely to cause or worsen acne).

, Another easy way to reduce the occurrence of acne is to limit your skin's exposure to oil and sweat. This means keeping your hair out of your face, limiting your face's contact with a phone receiver or cellphone, and avoiding touching your face with dirty hands.You may also need to limit or avoid wearing baseball caps, hats, and helmets, or at least wear a clean absorbent headband underneath."

Don’t try to pop your pimple.,
Apply a warm compress to an area that is sore and may be breaking out.,
Wash your whole face with a mild cleansing agent containing salicylic acid.This will help to rid your face of dead skin cells and excess oil, thereby diminishing the severity of the pimple that is forming.,
Don’t wear makeup on the area until it is absolutely necessary to cover it up.",How to Stop a Pimple from Forming1," If you see a pimple forming, do not squeeze it or try to pop it. Squeezing can actually push the infected material deeper into the skin, worsening the pimple and causing it to become more red and inflamed. It is also more likely to result in permanent scarring if you pick at it., Before washing, applying a warm, damp washcloth to the area will help to clear your pore. This will improve the chances of your pimple clearing up naturally as soon as possible.

, Pimples are worsened by clogged pores and oily skin, so washing twice a day will help to keep the zit as short-lived as possible.


Note that it is important not to rub your skin too harshly, particularly over the sore or affected area. This can worsen the potential breakout.

, Applying a thick layer of any product will trap bacteria, dead skin cells, and oil inside the pore. Keep your skin clean and follow your preventive skincare regimen as closely as possible, wearing makeup only when needed.


Note that, for some people with acne problems, even non-comedogenic products clog their skin and cause pimples.
Test all makeup products and replace them if they start to clog your skin.

"
Wash your face every day.,
Use a face cleanser with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.,
Avoid touching your skin.,
Shower after exertion.After an exercise routine where you have worked up a good sweat, it is a good idea to hop in the shower as soon as possible.,
Choose non-comedogenic makeup.You will want to use water-based cosmetics (labeled ""non-comedogenic"") rather than oil-based ones, as these will help to prevent your pores from getting clogged.,
Reduce the amount of dairy in your diet.,
Use medical strategies as a last resort.If you find that you are unable to control or prevent acne breakouts using skin care strategies alone, speak to your doctor about other options.",How to Stop a Pimple from Forming2," Note that washing your face more frequently than twice a day may irritate it and strip essential oils from your skin, which can lead to breakouts.Washing once in the morning and once in the evening with a mild cleanser is a good routine to get into to prevent pimples from forming.

, Choosing a product to wash your face with either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient will help to prevent the formation of pimples.This is because these ingredients help to dry excess oil from your skin, thereby decreasing the chances that a pimple will form.


Note that these products are most effective as part of a regular skin care regimen., If you feel like you could be breaking out, keep your hands off you face to prevent spreading more dirt and oil to the area. Wash your hands before you clean your face.Also avoid touching or picking at areas of irritation. If you suspect a breakout may be forming, it is best to keep your hands off it and to use other preventative strategies to ward it off as best as possible.

, Sweat and moisture on your skin increases the chances of pimple formation, so rinsing off sooner rather than later can help to prevent this problem.


This is the exception to the washing your face only twice daily rule — it's okay to wash once in the morning, once after working out, and once before bed.
Also, wear loose-fitting clothing. Areas that are covered by tight-fitting clothing, where moisture and sweat can collect (such as under a sports bra or tight-fitting shirt), are often where breakouts occur.

, Also, only use makeup when needed, as any skin products, including those that are labeled as ""non-comedogenic,"" are worse for your pores than wearing no makeup at all.


When you are done wearing makeup, wash it off your face.
Always remove your makeup before going to bed at night, as this will give your pores a chance to clear during the night., Consuming too many dairy products, such as milk, cheese, yogurt, etc., has been linked to increased breakouts of acne. Choose non-dairy alternatives whenever possible, such as almond milk or soy milk, and see whether reducing dairy in your diet has a positive impact on preventing breakouts.

, Common medical treatments for persistent or recurrent acne breakouts include:


Using topical acne creams. These usually contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient, and the formulations provided from your doctor can be more potent and effective than those available at your local pharmacy or drugstore.
Taking oral antibiotics. Because acne is linked to bacteria on your skin, taking an oral antibiotic such as minocycline can help to diminish outbreaks.
Using the birth control pill. For women with acne, the hormones provided in the birth control pill (namely, the boost of estrogen) can help to prevent acne breakouts. This is because acne is fuelled by androgens such as testosterone, so raising female hormones can help to counterbalance the effect of the testosterone that is present in all of us (both women and men have testosterone — the difference is that men have more of it).
Taking isotretinoin. Also known as Accutane, isotretinoin is a powerful medication to prevent acne and is used only in more severe cases, as it can have serious side effects. Speak to your doctor if you think this may apply to you. If you are planning to get pregnant, isotretinoin should be avoided, as it is known to cause birth defects.

"
"
Get a prescription for retinoids.,
Talk to your doctor about androgen inhibitors.,
Ask your doctor about contraceptives.,
Undergo light and laser therapy.",How to Reduce Sebum Production1," If you are struggling with excess oil and acne, you may want to talk to a dermatologist about retinoids. This type of medication is the most common treatment for acne and excess oil production. You can get an oral retinoid, like Accutane, or topic medications, like tretinoin, adapalene, tazarotene, or isotretinoin. Oral retinoids are generally more effective than topical ones.You may experience side effects like dry skin or sensitive skin.;
, Excess oil production can be caused by an excess of androgen hormones. If this is why your skin is oily, the doctor may prescribe you an androgen inhibitor, such as spironolactone and cyproterone. These medications can help reduce the amount of sebum your body produces. These medications may be either oral or topical., If you are a woman who has excess sebum production, you can try taking a birth control pill. For some women, this can help reduce the oiliness of their skin, but for others it might make it worse. Talk to your doctor about this option to determine if it is right for you.Birth control may help reduce the androgens in your body, which can help reduce your body’s sebum production.

, Another procedure you may want to try to help your sebum production is light and laser therapy. Photo Dynamic Therapy and Diode Laser Therapy can work to decrease oil production from your sebaceous glands. Many people use light or laser therapy with other treatments to really reduce their sebum production.This is a good option for people who cannot use medication to treat their oily skin, such as pregnant women. These treatments are non-invasive and fairly safe.
You need to get multiple treatments to get the best results. These treatments can be expensive.

Wash with a gentle cleanser.,
Rinse with warm water.,
Avoid using harsh materials to wash.,
Adjust your facial cleaning routine.",How to Reduce Sebum Production2," One way to help reduce the oil on your skin is to cleanse it properly. Use a gentle face wash or body wash. Using harsh soaps may cause your skin to produce more oil. Try a basic oil free cleanser, or one with salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, beta-hydroxy acid, or glycolic acid. These ingredients help to dissolve the oils and clean your skin.Try a small amount of the face wash on your skin before using it regularly. These ingredients may irritate your skin, so find one that works for you.

, When washing your face, make sure to use warm water instead of hot water. Hot water can irritate your skin. This can cause your skin to to produce even more oil. When washing your face or body, use lukewarm water., Though you may think that scrubbing your skin will help get rid of oil, that can actually be worse for your skin. Don’t use rough wash rags or bath puffs on your skin. Scrubbing your skin with harsh materials can make your skin create more skin. Either avoid using anything on your skin or use a soft cloth., Your sebum production may vary depending on the season. Your hormone levels may change weekly or monthly and affect your oil production. When you notice that your face and body are oilier than usual, you may want to wash with a cleanser with oil-fighting ingredients more often than when your skin is not as oil.You may want to include toners or clay masks to your regimen when you have more oil. Only apply the toner or mask to the oily areas on your face or body. These products can over-dry your skin.
For example, your body may produce more sebum during the summer than during the winter. This means you may need a more intense cleaning routine during the summer than the winter.

Make an egg white mask.,
Rub on a green tea lotion.,
Change your diet.,
Moisturize with argan oil.",How to Reduce Sebum Production3," You can have a spa day and make your own mask to help reduce oil production. Egg whites are a natural remedy that can soak the oil on your skin. Make the mask by mixing an egg white with a teaspoon of honey. Add a little bit of flour so you can make a paste for the mask. Place the mask on your face, or any body part that has excess oil.After 10 minutes, wash it off with warm water.

, Green tea is not just tasty to drink, but it can help reduce sebum production. Using a green tea lotion on your face and body may help reduce oil, inflammation, and acne on your skin.You can also try drinking more green tea.

, Eating healthy can help reduce sebum production naturally. Many vitamins and minerals can help reduce your oil production, but they need to be obtained from food sources to be helpful. You can get the nutrients you need by eating fresh vegetables and fruits and significantly reducing how much processed food you eat.Wheat, dairy, and sugar may lead to excess sebum production. Try cutting these things out of your diet to see if they help reduce the amount of oil your body produces.

, The towel will trap the steam and keep it from escaping, improving the effects of your steam facial.

, When the boiling water is producing enough steam, remove it from its heat source. Lower your face over the bowl, letting the towel drape over you like a tent, trapping the steam. Stay in this position for 4 to 8 minutes.

Be careful when handling the hot water container. You may wish to use oven mitts to protect your hands.
Do not bring your face close enough to the steam to burn your skin. The effect of the steam should be pleasant, not strident.
A little bit of redness from the steam is normal, but stop the steam facial if your skin begins to feel irritated.

In general, you should mix equal parts baking soda and lukewarm water. How much you use depends on how many areas of your face you need to cover.If you want to add a dash of apple cider vinegar to the mixture, this can serve as a toner. It's optional, however.Mix the ingredients together until they form a paste-like substance.;
, Before you use the mixture, you should wash your hands. You want to make sure you don't get any outside debris into your pores while you're washing your skin.


Wet your hands with clean running water and then apply an antibacterial hand soap. Work the soap into a lather.Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds, making sure to wash the back of your hand, under your fingernails, and between your fingers. To keep track of time, you can try humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice.Rinse your hands thoroughly and dry them off using a clean towel., After you've washed your hands, splash your face with clean, warm water. This will open your pores and help with the cleansing process. You can also wet a washcloth with hot water and drape it over your face until it cools., Once your face is washed and dried, you can apply the mixture to the blackheads.


Use your hands to gently rub a thin layer of the mixture to all your blackheads.Gently massage the paste into your skin as this aids in the exfoliating process., Once you've applied the mixture, wait 2 to 3 minutes or until it dries completely. Ideally, it should be dry enough that it's hard to the touch and feels somewhat like dried glue., After the paste has dried, rinse with warm water.


Use cool water to completely rinse off the mixture.
Pat your face dry with a clean towel.Baking soda can dry out skin, so make sure you use an oil free moisturizer after rinsing and drying your face., Baking soda and water is not always as effective as expected. If the method does not work for you, you can try adding different liquids in place of or in addition to water to the paste.


Baking soda and honey, which is naturally antibacterial, can be added to wet skin for an exfoliating cleanse.You could dry dabbing a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol on your skin before applying baking soda and water. Rubbing alcohol disinfects the skin, which may increase the overall effectiveness of the treatment.Adding salt to baking soda and water can help dry out oily skin. You can also try adding a bit of honey to the mixture., Baking soda is not only effective at treating blackheads. Overall skin acne can be lessened by using baking soda. If baking soda worked on your blackheads, you might want to try a baking soda bath to treat acne of the back, thighs, and face.


Add half a cup of baking soda to a tub of warm bathwater. Mix thoroughly and get in.This can be an especially good treatment is your skin is irritated after being exposed to the chemicals in pool water., If you have acne at your hairline, adding 2 to 3 grams of baking soda to your shampoo can help with acne reduction. However, it's a good idea to talk to a hair stylist before attempting this to make sure it won't damage your hair."

Grab as many ice cubes as you'll need to treat the outbreak area.
Wrap the ice in a thin, clean towel.If you don't have a towel, you can use a ziplock bag to hold the ice.
Do not apply ice directly to skin, as this can cause capillaries in your skin to break.;
, Once you've wrapped the ice cubes in a towel or sandwich bag, apply the ice pack to your face.


Rub pimples and acne scars with the ice pack for 10 to 15 minutes.Do not apply ice for longer than 20 minutes, as this can cause damage to your skin., You can use the ice method twice each day.Aim to use it first thing in the morning when your skin is puffy, and again at night before you go to sleep., Acne affects between 70 and 87 percent of teenagers, and many adults.There are four main causes of acne:


excessive oil production in the skindead skin cell accumulationclogged skin poresdirt and bacteria entering enlarged pores, Because most cases of acne involve the pores in your skin, acne medications typically work in one of three ways:


exfoliating your skin (removing dead skin cells)killing bacteriaunclogging pores, Ice is helpful with managing current acne outbreaks and with preventing future outbreaks from occurring.


Ice helps relieve swelling in the skin where acne persists. It can also reduce the redness associated with active pimples and old acne scars.Ice shrinks the size of your skin pores, which can help prevent future acne outbreaks by reducing the chances of your pores getting clogged or infected.Ice can be used for both short-term acne remedies and longer-term acne treatments., There are many over-the-counter acne creams, washes, and lotions, which all typically clean out pores by removing oil and dead skin.The most common over-the-counter acne product ingredients include:


Benzoyl peroxide - this compound kills bacteria, removes some excess oil, and sloughs off dead skin cells, effectively protecting open pores from dirt and bacterial infections.Salicylic acid - this mild acid helps protect pores from becoming clogged.Alpha hydroxy acids - these compounds, which typically include glycolic acid and lactic acid, help exfoliate the skin by removing dead skin cells and stimulating new skin growth.Sulphur - this chemical element helps exfoliate the skin and remove some excess oil from the skin., Over-the-counter treatments are often effective in treating mild to moderate cases of acne. In more serious cases of acne, your doctor or dermatologist may recommend a prescription-strength acne medication. The most common topical acne prescriptions include:


Retinoids - this class of chemical compounds are derived from vitamin A, which helps promote new skin growth.Retinoid-based medications are typically used in the evening, and may be applied three times weekly, working up to daily use, depending on the severity of acne symptoms.Antibiotics - antibiotics work to kill bacteria that persists on skin and in pores, and may reduce redness and inflammation associated with acne.The frequency of antibiotic use will depend on the severity of your acne. Follow your doctor's instructions when it comes to using antibiotics.
Dapsone (Aczone) - this gel kills bacteria on the skin and helps keep pores clean.Dapsone is typically applied twice daily in adults, and is not recommended for children. Your doctor or dermatologist may give you different dosage instructions, and you should follow any instructions from your doctor., In cases of severe acne where prescription medications are not effective, some dermatologists may recommend more aggressive therapy treatments. Some of these therapy treatments are also used to treat acne scars.Common therapy methods include:


Light therapy - this method involves using light from various parts of the spectrum to kill bacteria that can cause acne flareups. Blue-light therapy can be performed at home without a doctor's supervision, while other types of light therapy require a doctor to administer the therapy.Chemical peel - this method involves the application of a chemical solution to aggressively treat acne. Salicylic acid is a common chemical used in chemical peel procedures.Extraction of whiteheads/blackheads - in this invasive method of treatment, a dermatologist uses specialized tools to surgically remove whiteheads and blackheads that have not responded to other topical treatments.Extraction methods should only be performed by a dermatologist in a controlled medical environment.
Steroid injections - this method involves treating acne lesions by directly injecting a prescription-strength steroid into the lesion."

Sanitize the extractor.When you work with the comedo extractor, there will be a small opening in your skin where the blackhead or whitehead comes out.,
Position the extractor properly.,
Press down gently but firmly.Once the comedo is within the extractor’s loop, you want to apply enough pressure to force the whitehead or blackhead up out of the skin.,
Re-sanitize the extractor before using it again.,
Protect your opened pores.",How to Remove Blackheads and Whiteheads with a Comedo Extractor2," If you’re not working with sterile tools, you may introduce bacteria into your skin, making the outbreak you’re trying to treat even worse! To sterilize the comedo extractor, simply soak it in rubbing alcohol for one minute.

Keep the rubbing alcohol on hand while using the extractor to continue cleaning it as you go.
Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly or wear vinyl gloves while working on your skin. Your hands carry many germs that you don’t want to transfer to your skin.

, The extractor will have a loop on one end of it. Position the loop around the whitehead or blackhead you are trying to extract.

If you’re having trouble seeing what you’re doing, try using a magnifying mirror. These can be purchased inexpensively at pharmacies, department stores, or online.
At the very least, make sure you’re working in a well-lit environment.

, Press against the base of the comedo from all sides, working all of the material completely out of your skin. Comedones can reach deep down into the skin, so don’t assume you’ve extracted the whole thing as soon as a little bit of material comes out. Keep pressing from different angles until nothing more emerges from your skin.

When you’re satisfied that you have the whole comedo, simply swipe the extractor loop over it to remove it from your skin.
Either wash the extractor off in the sink or wipe the material away on a paper towel.

, You should sterilize the extractor for every new comedo, even if you’re treating them all in one sitting. Soak the instrument in rubbing alcohol for a minute, then repeat the process with your next whitehead or blackhead. Continue until you’ve removed all the blemishes on your skin.
, When you extract a comedo, you leave an open “wound” of sorts in your skin that, while not very noticeable, will take a little while to heal. Apply a small amount of astringent to the treated areas to protect them from bacteria or debris that might cause another outbreak.

Moisture your skin after applying your astringent to keep it from drying out.
Do not apply makeup to your skin until you’ve treated it with an astringent.

Figure out your skin type.,
Buy a facial cleanser that is right for your skin.,
Wash your face twice a day.,
Avoid using abrasive cleansers or skin brushes.,
Apply a toner to your face.,
Moisturize your skin.,
Use a topical anti-acne cream.,
Avoid friction against your skin.,
Do not pop or pick zits.,
Avoid touching your face.,
Wash your hair regularly.,
Wear as little makeup as possible.,
Wear sunscreen.,
See your doctor.",How to Stop Breakouts," Your skin will likely fall into one of five categories: normal, oily, dry, sensitive, or combination (i.e. dry in some spots, oily in others).Normal skin has little to no imperfections, no major sensitivities, tiny pores, and a healthy glow. (Normal skin sounds more perfect than normal, doesn’t it?)
Oily skin has blemishes such as blackheads, pimples etc. It has enlarged pores and the complexion may be dull or shiny.
Dry skin has barely visible pores, rough/dry patches, redness, and a dull complexion.
Sensitive skin will often be red, itchy, dry, or irritated in some way.
Combination skin is dry or normal in some areas, and often oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin).;
, Most companies make this easy by putting the skin type that the wash is designed for right on the label. You may even consider buying a facial cleanser that is specifically designed for acne.


Ingredients to look for in acne-targeting cleansers include benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycol acid, or lactic acid, but be careful as these can dry your skin.If you prefer natural treatments, you may consider using a face wash with tea tree oil or witch hazel.If you have a lot of breakouts, gentle cleansers that won’t spread the infection or further irritate your skin are best., There are differing opinions as to whether or not you should wash more than this, with some experts advising to wash twice a day plus after sweating (i.e. more than twice a day), and other experts arguing that to wash more than twice a day could irritate your skin.If you have dry skin, you may choose to only wash it once each night before bed, and then use only cool water on your face in the morning so as not to dry out your skin.If you have oily skin, don’t give in to the temptation to wash it more often. Still use a gentle cleanser and wash twice a day (and after sweating, if you find that it helps).
Sensitive skin can be easily irritated by ingredients in your bath products, or even just too hot of a shower. It may help to buy products that are unscented and that have as few ingredients as possible. It’s largely trial and error, but choosing products that are specifically designed for sensitive skin (it will say so on the label) is your best bet.

, Contrary to popular belief, harshly scrubbing the skin can actually make acne worse.Experts recommend exfoliating once or twice a week at most, and only if your skin is free of zits.If you have whiteheads, you may very well end up popping them and then spreading the infection as you use an exfoliating scrub on your face.
Exfoliating is meant to remove dead skin cells, so if your skin is flakey, it would be appropriate to use an exfoliator. The flakiness may be a sign of dryness though, so be careful not to exfoliate more than twice a week as it will only dry out your skin further.

, After washing your face, wet a cotton ball or cotton pad with a facial toner, and gently apply it to your face. This can help remove oils and cells not caught by the cleanser. It can also help balance your skin’s pH levels.Avoid toners that contain alcohol, even if you have oily skin.pH stands for “potential hydrogen”, which refers to your skin’s acid-alkaline ratio., Again, most moisturizers will be labelled by skin type. Seek a moisturizer that won’t clog your pores. Choose one that is noncomedogenic, which means it shouldn't cause acne., You can buy these at your local drugstore or, if you desire something stronger, you can get something prescribed.


When buying over-the-counter formulations, look for products containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycol acid, or lactic acid. Start small to ensure that the product doesn’t irritate your skin., This includes exfoliating face washes, but also popping zits, wearing a bike helmet, plucking your eyebrows — really anything that may cause some stress to your skin. Friction of any kind will increase your chances of breaking out.


For men who shave their faces, shaving and shaving products can also cause breakouts.Ideal shaving gels are lubricating gels or prescription ones containing benzoyl peroxide or a topical antibiotic. Shave downward, in the direction of hair growth, with a sharp razor., This only prolongs healing and could spread the infection, creating a cluster of zits around the original one. It can also cause acne scars. , Touching your face can cause flareups for a number of reasons. Your hands may be oily or have dirt on them, and the friction of your fingers on your face could irritate your skin., Oily hair can make for an oily face and, if your hair is longer, it may cause breakouts on your neck or back, too. In addition, pay attention to your hair products, being careful to avoid fragrances, oils, pomades, or gels, which can transfer from your hair to your skin and clog your pores., Whether your acne is mild or severe, it’s always tempting to cover it up; doing so will likely only make your acne worse. If you must wear makeup, choose formulas that are non-greasy, non-comedogenic (or non-acnegenic), hypoallergenic, non-irritation, and oil free.Choose products whose first ingredient is water.
Mineral-based cosmetics are often good choices for acne-prone skin.
If you can’t avoid wearing makeup, try to at least not wear it when you are at home. Wash it off as soon as you’re home from school or work. On the weekends, try to go without.

, Choose a sunscreen that is at least SPF 30 and offers both UVA and UVB protection. Look for light, non-pore-clogging sunscreens that are either water-based, light liquid-based gels, or spray-on.Burnt skin is weaker skin, more prone to blemishes and lines.


Avoid chemicals such as PABA and benzophenone, which are irritants.
Ingredients such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are okay.

, If you are struggling with moderate to severe acne, you may want to see a doctor. A doctor can refer you to a dermatologist, and can also prescribe you medications if he or she sees fit.


Medications include antibiotics, isotretinoin, and for women, certain birth control pills and other pills that target hormones.Dermatological procedures include laser and other light therapies, chemical peels, and drainage and extraction."

If you do not have a commercially manufactured strip, you can try using a band aid or piece of tape.
Wash the area thoroughly afterwards to prevent infection.;
, This will prevent infection and promote healing.


Try a 1:3 mixture of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar and water. Use a cotton swab to thoroughly coat the blackhead. This will help dissolve the plug of dead skin and oil, but it may sting.The acid has a similar effect to the alpha hydroxyl acid that is in many acne medications., Tea tree oil is a natural remedy with antibacterial and antifungal qualities.Make a solution of one part tea tree oil to 19 parts water. Dip a cotton Q-Tip into the mixture and dab it onto the blackhead. Wash it off the blackhead after 15–20 minutes.
Tea tree oil is not recommended for people with sensitive skin because it can cause irritation., Garlic is antiseptic and contains sulfur which will aid healing.


Cut a fresh garlic clove in half or mash it to create a paste. Rub the sticky juice directly onto the blackhead and allow it to work its way into the black plug for about five minutes. Then wash the blackhead and garlic off with warm water., This will draw out the excess oil and any pus that may have built up. This treatment is also good for exfoliating the area and removing dead skin cells.Make a paste of baking soda and water by adding just enough water to make a stiff paste. Put a dollop on the blackhead and gently rub it into the pore. Once it dries into a white crust, wash it off.

, As they dry, the egg whites will draw out oils and unclog the pores. In addition, the proteins and vitamins will also be nourishing for your skin.Apply raw egg whites directly to the areas of your skin which are prone to blackheads. Mix them with a fork first to break them up and make them easier to apply. After they dry, wash them off.
Be careful not to get any raw egg in your mouth.

, Cucumber will nourish your skin with potassium and vitamins A, C, and E.


Grind a cucumber in a blender, skin and all. Apply the wet mixture to your skin as a mask and let it your skin absorb the nutrients for 15 minutes.

Noncomedogenic products have been tested and verified to not plug up pores.Oily foundations frequently clog pores.
Wash off your makeup before you go to bed. This will allow your pores to breathe and prevent the makeup from getting stuck in the pores.

Go to a doctor if these methods do not reduce your blackheads.,
Consider various therapies, often prescribed together with medications.,
Consider isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, Sotret) if nothing else works.",How to Reduce Blackheads4," Your skin should improve after four to eight weeks of treatment with prescription medication. Possible medications your doctor may suggest could include:Topical medications such as retinoids (Avita, Retin-A, Differin, Tazorac, Avage) to prevent clogging of hair follicles, antibiotics to kill bacteria and reduce inflammation, or dapsone (Aczone).
Oral antibiotics. This is likely if your blackheads are prone to infection and inflammation.
Combined oral contraceptives (Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Estrostep, Yaz) which contain estrogen and progestin may be prescribed for women and girls with severe acne.

, Your doctor may suggest: Light therapy to kill bacteria causing the inflammation. This may be useful for drug resistant bacteria. Some lasers and a light-based treatment called photodynamic therapy can reduce blackheads by reducing oil production as well as reducing bacteria.
Chemical peeling and microdermabrasion to exfoliate dead skin cells.
Injecting a steroid into blackheads that are red and inflamed to make them less obvious without the need for extracting the plugs.
Extracting the black plugs are blocking your pores. Because this may cause scarring (though this is rare if done by a professional), it should only be done if other methods do not work.

, This medication works well, but many people find the side effects unbearable.Isotretinoin is only approved for severe or cystic acne.


People with a history of depression or digestive problems should not take this medication.
Because it can cause severe birth defects, women must participate in a Food and Drug Administration-approved monitoring program in order to receive it.

Gather your supplies.,
Know the effects.,
Use the whole tomato.,
Make a mask.,
Create a paste.",How to Reduce Acne Using Tomatoes1," The most important thing is to make sure that you have tomatoes handy. You need to use fresh tomatoes, not canned. Fresh tomatoes will not have added preservatives or seasonings, so they will be most effective for your skin.Use full size tomatoes, not cherry or grape. These will be easier to handle and will give you more material to work with.
Choose tomatoes that have a vibrant color and are firm. Make sure they smell sweet. If you wouldn't eat that tomato, don't use it on your skin.;
, Why should you use a tomato? Because they are filled with vitamins and antioxidants that are great for your skin! One of the main benefits is that tomatoes are packed with lycopene, which is a powerful antioxidant. Lycopene increases your skin's protection factor, increases collagen production, and helps your skin cells regenerate.Tomatoes can reduce redness caused by acne and can also help to try out problem areas, reducing blemishes.

, The simplest way to get skin benefits from a tomato is to just apply it directly to your face. Cut the tomato in half, and rub the cut side onto your problem area(s). After the juice is on your face, use your fingertips to gently massage the liquid into your skin for a few seconds. Then rinse your face with warm water.Make sure to do this over the sink, as it may be a bit messy. Have some towels nearby in case you drip.
Repeat once daily, and you should see results within one week.

, If your acne is worse than a mild case, you will want to try this method. Mash a whole tomato--you can use regular kitchen utensils to do this in a bowl. Use the pulp (inside part) of the tomato as a facial mask. Spread it on your face and leave it there for one hour. Rinse your face and then apply a gentle moisturizer.


Do this 3-4 times a week. You will begin to see your acne lighten within a matter of weeks.
You can also create a mask using a combination of tomato and avocado. Mash a tomato and an avocado together to combine, and then apply to your skin. Leave in place for 15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. This will help reduce oil in your skin.

, Tomatoes can be combined with other common household ingredients to give you additional benefits. For example, you can combine tomato juice with honey to make a thick paste. Simply squeeze a tomato to get fresh juice and then combine with a small amount of honey.Apply this combination to your skin and leave in place for 15 minutes. When you rinse it off, you will see that your skin has an extra glow.
Another method is to combine a tomato with yogurt. Crush half a tomato and mix the pulp with two tablespoons of plain yogurt. Apply to your skin for 20 minutes, then rinse. This will help with inflammation.

Understanding causes and risk factors of acne scarring.,
Avoid touching your face.,
Avoid too much sun exposure.,
Choose cosmetics with care.,
Don't smoke.,
Avoid stress.,
Get enough sleep.,
Exercise regularly.,
Keep your clothes and bedding clean.",How to Reduce Acne Scars with Home Remedies1," Picking, popping or squeezing a pimple can cause further breakouts and permanent acne scars. The fewer breakouts you have, the less likely you are to develop acne scars. Treating acne is important to prevent scarring, especially with any of the following:Severe, painful cysts and nodules. Nodules are hard, large and inflamed pimples. Cysts are pus-filled, painful pimples, both of which occur deep in the skin and can often cause scarring. This is called ""cystic acne.""
Acne that began at a young age. This often develops into severe acne within a few years. Dermatologists recommend that a preteen who has acne receive a dermatologic exam. Treating the acne before it becomes severe reduces risk of developing acne scars.
Blood relatives who have acne scars. The tendency to develop acne scars often runs in the family.;
, Dirt and bacteria on your hands can clog your pores and cause acne if you touch your face too much. If you feel irritation due to acne, use a gentle, oil-free daily facial wipe to remove excess dirt and reduce irritation. Resist the temptation to touch our pick at your face.Keep your hands clean by frequently washing them or using a hand sanitizer on the go.
Do not squeeze or pop your blemishes. This increases the risk of developing scars. In some cases, squeezing a pimple may spread the bacteria even further.
Do not cover blemishes with your hair. Keep your hair away from your face with ponytails, headbands or hair clips.
Dermatologists also recommend that you wash your hair regularly if it is oily. The oil can transfer to your forehead and face and lead to breakouts., Moderate sun exposure is beneficial to your immune system. It helps your body produce vitamin D. But, acne scars that are exposed to excessive ultraviolet radiation from the sun often become permanent.Excess exposure to sunlight may also cause sunspots, known as solar lentigines. Sunspots begin forming beneath the layers of the skin and cause small dark spots on the surface of your skin as you age.
To protect your skin from sun damage, use a sunscreen with a minimum SPF (sun protection factor) of 30.
Some chemicals in sunscreens may cause allergies. You may want to consult with a dermatologist to find the sunscreen that’s right for you.

, Some cosmetic products can worsen acne and increase the risk of scarring. Choose non-toxic cosmetics and apply them sparingly.


Use paraben-free skincare. Parabens are preservatives used in many cosmetic products. They can cause skin irritation and inflammation for people who suffer from acne, and may be a potential allergen. Butyl and propyl paraben are more toxic than methylparaben and ethylparaben. But, the latter is more easily absorbed by the human body.Do not use cosmetic products with synthetic dyes. Your skin absorbs almost 60% of all substances applied to its surface. Avoid cosmetics with synthetic colorings. Specifically, avoid E102, E129, E132, E133, and E143. Besides being bad for your skin, they are neurotoxins and may also promote cancer.Use oil-free cosmetics for your skin and hair.
Do not apply makeup immediately after washing your skin as it can also clog your pores, leading to more acne breakouts.

, Smoking can cause smoker’s acne. This is a condition in which the body does not produce an inflammatory response to heal the skin as quickly as it would with normal acne.Smokers are also four times more susceptible to moderate post-adolescent acne. This is particularly true for women between the ages of 25-50.Cigarette smoke may cause skin irritation for people with sensitive skin.
Smoking can also cause other skin conditions such as wrinkles and premature skin aging by creating free radicals. Free radicals are chemically reactive molecules that can damage cells.
Smoking also impairs collagen production and degrades skin proteins. Collagen is a structural protein with anti-aging properties. It promotes cell growth and repair, improving the durability and appearance of our skin. Not having enough collagen can greatly reduce the effectiveness of acne treatments. Reduced collagen production can also slow down the rate of healing for scars.

, Studies show that emotional stress can worsen acne, especially in females.Some ways to manage stress are:Listen to music. Listening to soothing music can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety.
Make time for recreation. Replace unnecessary time-consuming chores with pleasurable or interesting activities. If the source of stress is in the home, plan some time away, even if only for an hour or two per week.
Meditation. This can help reduce blood pressure, chronic pain, anxiety and lower cholesterol levels. This is promoting physical and emotional well-being.
For a simple meditation exercise, sit with your legs crossed in a quiet environment and take slow, deep breaths for at least 5–10 minutes. Try to get at least five minutes of meditation time every day to help keep your stress in-check.
Other meditation techniques include exercises such as tai chi or yoga, biofeedback, and massage therapy.

, Collagen production and cell repair is faster and more effective when you’re sleeping. You must give your body enough time to heal itself to get rid of scars.


Having a regular sleep schedule helps to ensure better quality and consistent sleep.
Avoid caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and sugary drinks four to six hours before sleeping. These can act as a stimulant to keep you awake.A quiet, dark, and cool environment can help promote sleep. Use heavy curtains or an eye mask to block light. Keep the temperature comfortably cool—between 65 and 75°F—and the room well ventilated., Exercise helps reduce stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. It also helps strengthen the immune system to fight off bacteria, viruses and harmful free radicals.This plays an important role in reducing acne.


You should get at least 30–40 minutes of moderate exercise or 10-15 minutes of intensive exercise each day. Moderate exercise includes walking or recreational swimming. Intensive exercise includes activities such as such as basketball, soccer, and hiking.

, Do not wear tight-fitting synthetic clothes that rub against your skin. Keep your pillowcases clean.Helmets, masks, headbands and other tight-fitting sports equipment can rub against your skin and make acne flare up. Be sure to keep sports equipment clean and shower after exercise.
Pillowcases and sheets can trap bacteria, dirt and dead skin cells. These can get into your pores when you sleep, causing more acne breakouts that can lead to further scarring. Change your pillowcases often.
Consider putting a fresh towel on your pillow every night if you apply an overnight acne treatment.

Thus you can pull it out and prevent blackheads from forming.

, For these pore strips, you will need the egg white specifically, which can be difficult to separate from the yolk. Consider saving yourself the trouble and purchase egg white that has already been separated.


Alternatively, you can use an egg white separator. Crack the egg and let it run through the separator. The yolk will get caught in the separator and the white will flow through. Have a container underneath to catch the egg white.
You can also break the egg into a bowl. Use your hands to gently pick up the yolk and move it to a separate container., Put egg white in a small bowl and place a large piece of two-ply toilet paper or paper towel in the bowl. It is imperative that the paper be thoroughly soaked in egg white.


Alternatively, you can use a makeup brush to spread the egg white directly on your face, stick the paper on your face, and then use the paper to apply an additional layer of egg white on top., A large piece of paper can be spread across your entire face, or at least most of it. This will allow you to get a lot of blackheads at the same time. Be especially careful to target problem areas, where you have or are experiencing blackheads.

, The paper should harden, so that it sticks to your face. This might take anywhere from 10-20 minutes.There is no need to tear the paper up into thin sheets, like store bought pore strips. You can use one large paper towel or piece of toilet paper to cover much of your face. This makes the process quicker and easier.

, After approximately 10-20 minutes, slowly remove the paper from your face. Start from the edge when peeling it off. Do not pull it off so quickly that you hurt yourself., After removing the strip, rinse your face with cold water.

It is also a good sign if the strip seems to stick well to your skin. If it is hard to remove, then it is working well.

, The egg white solution might remove blackheads, but can also cause pimples. Sometimes this is temporary. However, if this is a reoccurring problem, consider a different method., You can reserve this treatment for when a blackhead appears. But to ensure that blackheads are a thing of the past for you, try this treatment every 1-2 weeks. This will keep your pores clean and forestall the appearance of blackheads."

Many pharmacies and cosmetic stores sell scar gels containing alpha and beta hydroxy acids.
Apply the gel to the affected area up to twice daily.

Disinfect a sewing needle.,
Prick the surface of the whitehead.,

Soak the tip of the needle in rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide for one minute., Insert the needle at an angle. If you poke the needle in a vertical downward motion, you could hit live skin under the pus. Remove the needle as soon as you see pus oozing from the whitehead.


If you see clear liquid or blood instead of pus, stop. Squeezing a whitehead that isn't ready to be popped can cause it to swell and stick around even longer., Place each of your index fingers at the base of the white area.

Determine if over-the-counter treatments are working.,
Decide if you are using the correct skincare products.,
Determine if you cleanse your face properly.",How to Know if You Need a Prescription Acne Treatment1," Many people treat acne with face wash, creams, or gels purchased at the store containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, or alpha hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid and lactic acid.Using these products, acne should clear up within four to eight weeks.If this has not occurred, you may need prescription acne medication.

When using a product with benzoyl peroxide, the common OTC strengths are 2.5 to 10%. For salicylic acid, it ranges from 0.5 to 5%. You may want to try a stronger OTC treatment before going to the dermatologist.

Press on the area every 15 seconds to increase the intensity pushing the pimple down.,
When the cotton ball begins to dry, get another one and repeat step 1.

,
Repeat step 2-3 times for 10-20 minutes.

Take oral acne medications.",How to Instantly Get Rid of a Pimple (Cotton Ball Popping Method)," Put a small amount of the face wash on your hand and wash into your skin with water. Rinse off and dry with a towel.

,, Make sure you are doing so using preferably a product consisting of benzoyl peroxide applied to the area.

,,, Try to simulate popping the pimple in a way so that you are not pushing down. Pushing up prevents the infection from spreading further.



Note: Only pop the pimple if you see a whitehead or blackhead develop after you've pressed down on it with the warm cotton ball.

Note: Do not put so much pressure on the skin or pimple that you get blood. You want any pus to come out of the pore, but not blood.

, Do this carefully and don't do any more than that!

, Do this gently, perhaps with a Q-Tip, while barely touching your skin. Rub it in for a while.

, Go to the mirror, and your zit should be gone. This process only takes 25 minutes. Here's what happened; the benzoyl peroxide dried the pus inside the pimple and flushed the redness out while the Clindamycin prevented the infection of the pimple going deeper into your skin (a risk of popping the pimple).

, This will sooth your face. If you still have some redness left from when you popped your pimple, this will take it away. Good Luck!

, There will come the time, of course, when you feel like you need to pop a pimple, but that should be the exception to the rule. Why is popping pimples not so great for your skin? Popping a pimple will actually damage the surrounding skin, introduce gunk and bacteria from your hands, and cause even more inflammation and redness.If you can, resist popping pimples!
, Wash your face once in the morning and once at night, before you go to bed. Be sure to remove any makeup you might have on your face before you go to sleep.


Wash your face gently. No need to scrub furiously, like you're trying to remove a stain from the carpet. Gentler is better.
Always moisturize after each wash. Washing your face strips the oil from your skin, which is both good and bad. Good because that oil is what gets infected and causes acne; bad because your skin is an organ, and like any other organ in your body, needs moisture.

, Many people find that exfoliating the skin once a week is a good way to prevent breakouts from happening. Exfoliating means removing the top layer of skin (the epidermis) so that it can't clog the pores, causing acne. Try not to exfoliate more than twice a week. There is too much of a good thing.

, Lots of over the counter (this means you can buy it at your friendly, local drugstore) acne medicines do help clear up acne, although they don't help to prevent it. If you have a small eruption of acne on your face that you don't want to pop, use some salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil directly onto the skin at night., Studies have shown that stress has a negative impact on your skin, specifically making acne worse.Pretty much, when your body is stressed, the cells that regulate sebum production stop working. Sebum is the stuff that contributes to acne.

, Regular exercise is helpful both in jump starting your immune system and cutting down on stress.Try to do at least 30 minutes of simple exercises (such as walking) a day, and mix in three hour-long sessions of intense cardio during the week.

, Studies have shown that there is a link between sleep and stress: the less sleep you get, the more likely you are to be stressed, and we've already learned how bad stress is for acne.If you're still under the age of 18, shoot to get between nine and ten hours of sleep every night., Gels, mousses, hair sprays — these all can cause acne. Be careful with what you put in your hair, and how often you do so.


Wash your hair about every other day. Don't go a week without washing your hair. Although beauticians may say it's good for your hair, the buildup of oil on your scalp can cause acne around your hairline.

, Scientists are beginning to believe that diet does play a role in how much acne you have. Eat a balanced diet of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, lean protein, fiber, and healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Stay away from high-glycemic diets that involve a lot of refined sugars, simple carbohydrates, and saturated fats.


Don't drink as much milk, if possible. Studies have found that people who drink more milk suffer from more acne than people who don't drink as much.Scientists believe that the hormone-laden dairy produces more sebum, causing acne and making it worse.

, These have been shown to reduce or eliminate acne in a variety of ways. Talk to your doctor or your dermatologist about which medications might be most effective for you.


For females, oral contraceptives such as birth-control are sometimes used to treat acne. The birth control regulates the hormones produced by the body, cutting down on breakouts.
Other oral antibiotics attack the bacteria that causes acne. They can assist in reducing the number of breakouts, as well as in fighting inflammation. Patients are usually given a higher dosage earlier on before being moved to a lower dosage.
For severe cases, isotretinoin, or Accutane, is available through a prescription. Isotretinoin is a vitamin-A derivative that shrinks the glands that produce sebum. It comes with various risks and side-effects, which you should fully understand before embarking on a course of treatment.

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Visit your dermatologist.,
Try a topical medication.,
Consider oral medications.,
Take isotretinoin for more severe acne.,
Talk to your doctor about hormonal acne treatments.",How to Know if You Need a Prescription Acne Treatment3," Visiting your general practitioner first can help you determine if you have acne by itself or an underlying problem. Sometimes, acne or bumps may be caused by other underlying medical factors, like hormonal imbalances.


If an underlying condition is causing your acne, treating the condition may get rid of the acne. This may mean you don't need a prescription acne medication.

, To get a prescription medication for acne, you should see a dermatologist. They can look at your skin to determine the severity of your acne and the proper treatment.Your doctor will determine your skin type, which will help them figure out the proper treatment.
Your doctor will also explain how you should use the medication, how often to use it, and how to ensure proper skin care.

, If you have moderate to severe inflammatory acne, a doctor may prescribe a topical prescription. Topical medications are placed directly on your skin. You can get creams, lotions, gels, and pads.Topical antibiotics work to eliminate bacteria in the follicles. They help alleviate redness and inflammation.
Retinoids are derived from vitamin A. They help unclog pores. They may be used before or with antibiotics to unclog the pores so the medicine can work. Retinoids can also help new pimples from forming.
Your doctor may prescribe stronger versions of treatments containing benzoyl peroxide or sulfur.

, Oral medications may be the right fit if you have moderate to severe acne. Oral medication helps reduce inflammation and the growth of bacteria. Oral medications are often prescribed alongside topical ones.Sometimes, bacteria will become resistant against one antibiotic. If this occurs, your doctor will change your prescription.
Some oral medications cause negative side effects. Some are not recommended for pregnant women or children under the age of 14. Talk to your doctor about any side effects the medication may have.

, If topical or oral medications don’t work, you may need something stronger. This usually occurs if you have severe acne with cysts or nodules. Isotretinoin is a retinoid taken orally for about four to five months. It helps your body produce less oil and works to decrease bacteria growth.Isotretinoin helps reduce the risk of scarring.
Women who are pregnant or thinking about pregnant should not take isotretinoin.
There have been correlations between teens taking isotretinoin and severe depression and suicide. There is no evidence that the medication caused these symptoms. However, if you are a teenager taking this medication, make sure to monitor for depression symptoms or suicidal thoughts., Teenage girls may have acne due to hormonal changes. For acne caused by these androgens, a prescription medication may be the best treatment. Birth control pills or spironolactone are often prescribed for this type of acne.Androgens are hormones that are found in both men and women. They overstimulate oil glands and irritate follicles, which can lead to acne.

Understand how baking soda can help to get rid of pimples.,
Be careful using baking soda if you have sensitive skin.,
Use baking soda as a spot treatment.,
Use baking soda as a face mask.,
Use baking soda as a cleanser/exfoliator.,
Use baking soda as a bath soak.",How to Get Rid of Pimples with Baking Soda," The notion that baking soda can help to get rid of pimples has been around for some time, and although this simple home remedy may not be as effective as some of the professional acne-treating products on the market, it still has its benefits.


Baking soda is amphoteric - which means that it can operate as either an acid or a base. In this way, it can help to neutralize any pH imbalances on the skin. pH imbalances on the skin are a common cause of acne.
Baking soda helps to dry the skin, removing the excess oil which leads to blackheads and breakouts. It also has mild anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, which help to reduce the size of pimples.
When mixed with water, baking soda forms a fine, gritty paste which helps to clean and exfoliate the skin, removing oil, dirt and dead skin cells.;
, Baking soda can also be very drying and sometimes causes redness and irritation in people with sensitive skin.


Therefore it is a good idea to test out the baking soda treatment on a small patch of skin before applying it all over the face. If you experience any negative side effects, do not continue
Even if you do not experience any negative side effects, you should avoid using baking soda too regularly. Over time, the baking soda can upset the pH balance of your skin, potentially leading to bacteria growth and more pimples.
Therefore, baking soda should be used on the skin no more than twice per week.

, Mix two tablespoons of baking soda with two tablespoons of water to form a smooth paste.









Cleanse and dry your face thoroughly, then apply the baking soda paste to any pimples. If any of the pimples are open, this could sting a little.
Leave the spot treatment to sit on the pimples for 15 minutes, then rinse off. Some people leave the baking soda on their pimples overnight, but this can be very drying on the skin, so exercise caution.
Moisturize your face after using the baking soda treatment., Mix two tablespoons of baking soda with two tablespoons of water (or more if necessary) and add a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice.









Thoroughly cleanse and dry your face, then apply a light layer of the baking soda mask all over your face. It may tingle or sting slightly.
Leave the mask to sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse off with warm water. Your skin may appear quite red afterwards, but this will fade shortly. Make sure to moisturize after using the mask., Mix two tablespoons of baking soda with two tablespoons of water until it forms a smooth paste. Add a dash of lemon juice, if you like. (The citric acid in the lemon juice also acts as an exfoliator and helps to dry out pimples.









Dampen your face with warm water and apply the baking soda paste to the skin. Gently massage the paste into the skin using small circular motions - avoid scrubbing too hard.
Wash the paste off your face using warm water and a washcloth. Your face will be red and glowing afterwards. Apply a good moisturizer to the skin.

, If you suffer from acne on the skin of your back or chest, you can benefit from taking a bath with baking soda.

Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda into your warm bathwater (don't use any bubble bath) and stir with your hand to combine.
Hop into the tub and try to stay there for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse yourself off in the shower following the bath.
The baking soda will help to prevent breakouts and minimize blackheads on the back, chest and any other acne-prone areas of the body."

Sleep.",How to Have Flawless Skin in a Week," Is it oily, dry, normal, or combination of either? In order to do this, wash your face, let it dry and leave your face completely untouched for an hour. Inspect by dabbing a tissue between your nose and cheek, called the T-zone:










Normal skin shows neither oil nor flaking skin. It should feel supple and smooth. If you have it, consider yourself lucky!

Oily skin is characterized by the grease on the tissue. It is also common for a person with oily skin to have large pores and a bit of a shine.

Dry skin may feel taut or show flakes of dead skin. It is associated with small pores. Moisturizing is important for this skin type.

Combination skin is most common. It exhibits traits of all three of the above skin types. Usually, the skin is oily in the T-zone and normal to dry elsewhere.;
, (If you're young there's no need for a facial scrub.) You might have to test out a couple of brands before you find the perfect one. Talk to an associate at a makeup or skin care counter. You will be able to test different formulas. They may even offer samples so you can try a product out for a day or two.


Try to get a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer that is non-comedogenic. This just means that it won't clog your pores, leading to pimples.
If you have a bad case of acne or any other skin problem like eczema, see a dermatologist. They will give you the specific treatment you need. It's likely that any medication you get from a dermatologist will be prescription strength, too, meaning it will be stronger.

, Try for a facial sunscreen with no fragrance or oil. Sunscreen will help block harmful UV-A and UV-B rays that can lead to skin damage and cancers.


Many moisturizers these days have sunscreen built into them. Experiment with different moisturizers to see if the sunscreen works well and the moisturizer keeps your face hydrated.

, You will not see a difference if you only use it once a week. Use your scrub, which lifts off dead layers of skin, only every few days as to avoid scrubbing off too much skin.









Do not use a washcloth, loofah or any other abrasive material to wash your face. Washing with your hands is perfectly acceptable, and will lower the irritation you might otherwise get with an abrasive material.
Wash once in the morning and once at night. This is especially important if you have very oily skin or numerous pimples.
Moisturize after every wash. Washing your face with a facial cleanser sucks all the natural oils from your face. Clear, beautiful skin is hydrated skin.

, Before going to bed remember to take off any makeup you put on. Washing your face may do the trick, but some makeup may require makeup remover.









Don't be lazy about taking off makeup. If you're prone to leaving your makeup on or forgetting to wash your face, invest in some wipes and keep them close to your bed. Although this isn't exactly optimal, it is only for time-saving, so if you can, wash your face after to remove any excess makeup.

, A great menu is a balanced menu. Remember the food pyramid? Eat fruits and vegetables. Nutritionists recommend eating 3 servings of fruit and 5 servings of vegetables daily. Avoid foods with caffeine and sugar, as well as greasy foods and red meat.

, Try to drink 8 glasses of fluids, preferably water, every day! Avoid sugary soft drinks, caffeine, and coffee. Green/herbal tea is rich in antioxidants, which protect cells in your body from damage.

, Exercising helps you metabolize. A walk with your dog or some yoga lessons do make a difference! Healthy skin is just another part of a healthy body.


Exercising is also good for relieving stress. Studies showthat there's a link between how stressed you are and how bad your acne is. So if you're super-stressed all the time, try your favorite form of exercise to get rid of it pronto.

, Make sure you get your 8 hours every night, perhaps a bit more if you are a teenager. Being well rested gives your body more energy to go about its daily routine, and leaves you feeling even better. Flawless skin doesn't have big dark circles.


Do this every day, and you will soon begin to see the results.

",How to Keep Your Hands Away from Your Face,"


Do a bit of research on acne scarring. Acne.org forums are a good place to start. Acne RX by James Fulton is also a good resource for information on the damaging effects of picking, as well as advice for treating acne.
Most types of acne will not cause scars if left untouched. It is the damage caused by picking, gouging, and irritating the skin that causes acne scarring.
Do a Google image search for ""acne scars"" to see what you may be in for if you continue to pick.;
,



Unconscious Picker - You casually touch and/or pick your face while using the computer, reading a book, or watching television. This is a very dangerous type of picking because you often won't realize you're doing it.

Bathroom Mirror Picker - You go in to grab the floss and end up spending fifteen minutes in front of the mirror, picking and popping.

Idle Picker - You pick while you're waiting for the bus, you pick while you're on the phone, and you pick while you're waiting in traffic.

,


Keep your hands busy. Do crossword puzzles or play video games while you're waiting for the bus. Give yourself a hand massage while you watch television. Start a knitting project to keep yourself busy at night.
Place signs that say ""NO PICKING"" up on your bathroom mirror, in your compact mirror, on the TV remote, or wherever you are likely to see them when you start to pick.
Wear Gloves. It may sound silly, but it will be impossible to pick your face while wearing gloves. You can wear them overnight, too, if you tend to sleep with your face on your hands. Just be sure to wash the gloves regularly.
If wearing gloves isn't an option, consider placing bandages or narrow strips of tape over your fingertips. This is a bit more discreet, and will make it very difficult to pick your skin.
Get other people involved. A close friend, parent, or roommate can be a very valuable asset. Ask them to gently scold you if they notice you touching your face.
Don't give up. Like any bad habit, you may not be able to quit picking overnight. Try not to become discouraged.

, Congratulations!

, Make sure that there is NO grime under your nails because most of the bacteria is there on your hands. Hygiene is very important, as you know fingers and hands are one of the dirtiest places on human areas.

, It's gross and there's plenty of bacteria inside your nose. Do you want those germs all over your face?

, To avoid this, stop using your hands, such as when sitting at the table. DO not put your hands on your face and use it for hand resting.

, While sitting down on a chair while in front of the table, lay your hands or hold your hands on the table or put your hands on your lap or put your hands right under your thighs and sit regularly on your hands. This may seem silly but it helps with the need to touch your face. You can do this during a job interview, or places like a simple restaurant.

The water has to be hot enough so the Epsom salt can dissolve into the water.;
, Mix in 1 teaspoon of Epsom salt with 3-5 drops of iodine.Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure the Epsom salts dissolve completely and the iodine is blended in.

, The solution should be warm, but cool enough to stick your finger in for a few seconds and not feel uncomfortably hot.


The warm solution will be soothing to your face as it works on the blackheads.

, Dip a cotton ball into the solution and dab it on the affected area. Let the solution dry completely (5-10 minutes).


The cotton ball will absorb a lot of the solution, so be careful not to drip any on your clothes.
For acne on other parts of the body (back, chest, upper arms), it’s more useful to take an Epsom salt bath.That way, you can soak bigger areas of your body at the same time.

, Use clean, warm water and a washcloth to gently rinse the solution and any blackhead residue off your face.


Repeat this process regularly for the best results.

, It can be tempting to use any means necessary to try and get rid of blackheads, but it’s important to be gentle to your face when trying to control acne. More people actually do more harm to their skin than good when they try to get rid of their blackheads.



Don’t pinch of squeeze your blackheads. Squeezing or pinching can make your skin inflamed and infected. Your hands also have natural oil on them that could transfer to your skin and make your blackhead problem even worse. Instead, loosen the blackheads by putting a washcloth that has been drenched in hot water and wrung out, on the affected area. Once the washcloth has sat on your face for about 10 minutes, use a spot treatment to target the blackheads.Don’t use any sharp tools on your skin. These small extraction tools trap bacteria and can bruise your face if used improperly.

Don’t sleep with makeup on. Makeup contains ingredients that could significantly clog your pores as you sleep (talc, titanium dioxide, etc.). Be sure to clean your face with a mild cleanser before bed to prevent further build up of oil from your hair, oil you’re your hands, sebum, and chemicals from makeup.Don’t go overboard with scrubbing. Harsh scrubs can irritate your skin and make your blackhead and acne problem appear worse, so avoid large grain exfoliator cleansers such as almond or walnut exfoliators.Instead, use a gentler cleanser (such as rice or jojoba exfoliators) to remove dead skin off the surface of you face., Use an oil-free face wash to wash your face both morning and night to remove daily impurities and excess sebum. Sebum is the oily substance underneath your skin that builds up and creates whiteheads and blackheads. Just like the makeup ingredients, sebum can clog your pores too., Benzoyl peroxide is an ingredient found in many acne treatments that is extremely helpful in diminishing acne spots. Benzoyl peroxide could dry out some areas of your face, but you can always apply a moisturizer after you have let the benzoyl peroxide work its magic.Retinol is also known for its acne fighting abilities, but the trick is you need to find products that contain enough of the ingredient to actual help your blackhead situation. An amount that would prove to be useful would be about 0.5 or 1.0%.Any product with less retinol than that, or a product where the percentage isn’t listed probably only has trace amounts of the ingredient, and won’t be enough to effectively treat your acne.
Salicylic acid is another gentle alternative, but not it is not as helpful at removing blackheads.

, . Wash your pillowcases at least twice a month, wipe and disinfect your cellphone along with glasses, and any other item that can transfer and hold onto oil from your face.Wash and disinfect these items once a day to help stop bacteria from spreading from the different surfaces to your face.

Speak with a professional.",How to Heal Acne Fast and Naturally," There are different treatments for acne depending on how severe your condition is. Most cases of acne are moderate, but severe acne with deep nodules or cysts may cause swelling and scarring. This acne needs immediate medical attention.Common types of acne include:


Whiteheads (closed comedones): occur when dirt or excess oil (sebum) is trapped below the skin's surface, forming a firm white bump.
Blackheads (open comedones): occur when pores open up, causing the dirt and sebum to rise to the surface of the skin. The blackish color comes from oxidization when the air reacts with melanin, a pigment in sebum.
Pimples (or pustules): acne lesions that form when the excess dirt and oils stay trapped under the skin, causing inflammation, irritation, swelling and redness often with pus. Pus is a thick, yellowish liquid made of leukocytes (white blood cells) and dead bacteria, usually in response to an inflammation or infection of body tissue.
Nodules: hard, large and inflamed pimples that occur deep in the skin.
Cysts: pus-filled, painful pimples that form deep in the skin and can often cause scarring.;
, Smoking can cause a condition called smoker’s acne, in which the body does not make an inflammatory response to heal the skin as quickly as it would with normal acne. Smokers are also four times more likely to get moderate acne after adolescence, particularly women between the ages of 25-50. Cigarette smoke may also cause skin irritation for people with sensitive skin.


Smoking is known to cause other skin conditions like wrinkles and premature skin aging. It does this by creating free radicals, impairing collagen production, and degrading skin proteins., Dirt and bacteria on your hands can clog your pores and make acne worse if you constantly touch your face. If your skin feels irritated from acne, use a gentle, oil-free daily facial wipe to remove excess dirt and calm your skin.


Do not squeeze or pop your blemishes or you may risk developing scars. Squeezing a pimple might even spread the bacteria further., Use a mild non-soap cleanser, free from sodium laureth sulfate. Sodium laureth sulfate is a detergent and foaming agent that can cause irritation. Many non-soap cleansers are free from harsh chemicals, use natural ingredients, and are available at most drug stores.Harsh soaps and scrubbing can irritate your skin and make acne worse.

, Wash your skin using your fingertips, once in the morning and once at night. Remember to thoroughly rinse your skin with lukewarm water after washing it. Limit washing to twice a day and after you sweat.Sweating can irritate your skin. Wash your skin as soon as possible after sweating.

, Apply an oil-free moisturizer if your skin is dry or itchy. An astringent is only recommended when you have oily skin and even then the astringent should only be applied to oily spots. If you want to use an exfoliating product, ask your dermatologist about the best treatment for your skin type.People with non-inflammatory acne, like whiteheads and blackheads that do not cause redness, can use mild exfoliating products that are available at most drug stores. People with dry, sensitive skin should limit exfoliating to once or twice per week, while people with oily, thicker skin can exfoliate once every day.

, Avoid meat that contains hormones and similar substances which could throw your hormones out of balance, causing acne. Instead, eat plenty of fiber, fresh vegetables and fruits. Foods rich in vitamin A, C, E, and zinc can help reduce the severity of acne through the nutrients’ anti-inflammatory properties. Some good sources of these vitamins include:Sweet red peppers
Kale
Spinach
Amaranth Leaves
Turnip Greens
Sweet Potato (Yams)
Pumpkin
Butternut Squash
Mangoes
Grapefruit
Cantaloupe

, Studies show that oral zinc therapy can help heal acne.Zinc is an essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties. This helps protect cells in the body from damage caused by bacteria and viruses. It’s common to have slightly low levels of zinc, but taking a multivitamin and eating a healthy diet should give you all the zinc you need. While you can take supplements, the best dietary sources of zinc are:oysters, shrimp, crab, and shellfish
red meats
poultry
cheese
beans
sunflower seeds
pumpkin
tofu
miso
mushrooms
cooked greens.
easily absorbed zinc: zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc acetate, zinc glycerate, and zinc monomethionine. If zinc sulfate causes stomach irritation, you can try another form, such as zinc citrate.

, According to studies, you might have low levels of vitamin A if you have severe acne. Vitamin A is an anti-inflammatory substance that balances your hormones and might help reduce oil production. You can increase your vitamin A intake by eating a healthy diet and avoiding unhealthy fats like margarine, hydrogenated oils, and processed food.Vitamin A is found mostly in carrots, green leafy vegetables, and yellow or orange fruits. If you take a supplement, the recommended daily dose is 10,000 to 25,000 IU (international units). High doses of Vitamin A can have toxic side-effects, including birth defects, so watch how much you're getting.

, It does this in part by helping to make collagen, an important protein used to repair skin tissue, cartilage, blood vessels and heal wounds. You can take 2 to 3 doses of Vitamin C for a total of 500 mg a day. You can also add vitamin C-rich foods to your daily diet.Good natural sources of vitamin C are:


Sweet red or green peppers
Citrus fruit such as oranges, pomelo, grapefruit, limes or non-concentrated citrus juices.
Spinach, broccoli and brussel sprouts
Strawberries and raspberries
Tomatoes

, Drinking green tea is not directly linked with preventing acne. But, it contains many antioxidants that show anti-aging effects and protect the skin. These can help your skin look fresher and younger.To make green tea, steep 2-3 g of green tea leaves in one cup of warm water (80-85°C) for 3–5 minutes. Green tea can be taken two to three times daily.


Green tea may also have anti-inflammatory effects that reduce the risk of cancer. Some research shows that green tea is especially useful in protecting skin from harmful UV radiation., Tea tree oil is often used topically for conditions like acne, wounds, infections and skin lesions.To treat your acne, use a tea tree oil that's at a dilution of 5–15 percent. Apply 2-3 drops to a cotton ball and dab it over your acne.


Never take tea tree oil orally. You should also avoid exposing it to open air for a long time. Oxidized tea tree oil may trigger allergies more than fresh tea tree oil.

, Apply 5-6 drops of jojoba oil on a cotton ball and dab over your acne. Jojoba oil is an extract from the seed of the jojoba tree. It is similar to the natural oil (sebum) that your skin produces, but it won't clog your pores or cause excess oil.Jojoba oil will keep your skin moisturized. It doesn't usually cause irritation, but speak with your dermatologist before using if you have sensitive skin.

, Juniper oil is a natural antiseptic astringent. You can use it as a facial cleanser and toner to clear blocked pores and treat acne, dermatitis and eczema.Apply 1-2 drops of the oil with a cotton ball after washing your face.


Avoid using too much juniper oil, or it can cause irritation and make the skin worse.

, Daily apply aloe vera gel liberally over your skin. You can find it at most drug stores. Aloe vera is a succulent plant with antibacterial properties that are effective in treating acne and reducing inflammation. It prevents bacteria from infecting acne wounds and speeds up the healing process.Some people may be allergic to aloe. If a rash develops, stop using it and speak with your healthcare provider.

, Look for a sea salt lotion or cream with less than 1% sodium chloride. Apply it up to six times a day for 5 minutes each time. Studies show sea salt may have anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and protective properties against harmful ultraviolet radiation. You can also use sea salt as a facial mask to reduce stress.Look for sea salt or sea salt products at most pharmacies and stores.


People with mild to moderate acne may safely use sea salt products. People with dry, sensitive skin or moderate to severe acne should talk with a dermatologist before starting any salt treatments, since it could possibly cause dryness and irritation.

, Laser and phototherapy are popular alternative options to treat acne. Light therapy uses light to treat inflamed acne lesions, severe nodular acne, and cystic acne.Studies show that light therapy is an effective treatment for many people. Speak with your healthcare provider to see what option is best suited to your individual needs.

, High levels of androgen (hormone) activity, primarily in women, may lead to excessive sebum production that causes acne.Sebum also contains fatty acids that encourage acne-causing bacteria. Some causes that lead to hormonal changes may be puberty, pregnancy, amenorrhea or changes in medication.


The best way to determine if your acne is caused by hormonal changes is to speak with a dermatologist.

, Dermatologists can diagnose your skin condition and offer targeted approaches to curing your acne.Surgical options may include removing whiteheads and blackheads or cryosurgery, a freezing technique in which steroids are injected into acne lesions. Dermabrasion is a type of surgical procedure that can remove surface scars and reduce the depth of deep acne scars by removing the dead layers of skin cells. Several sessions might be necessary depending on the severity of your acne scars


If you're thrown for a loop with acne and you've tried everything under the sun, don't be afraid to ask for help.

Try dermabrasion.,
Do chemical peels.,
Fill the cystic acne scars.,
Use laser and light therapies.,
Get small skin grafts.",How to Get Rid of Cystic Acne Scars2," While you can try home remedies or over-the-counter treatments, if you don't see any improvement in your acne scars within 6 to 8 weeks, you should see a dermatologist. Acne can be painful and the scars probably won't go away on their own so getting medical attention is important.Your primary care physician may need to refer you to a dermatologist in order for your insurance to cover the exam. Or, your doctor may simply recommend dermatologists who specialize in cystic acne.

, Dermabrasion removes the top layers of skin and is used for small scars. It is the most common treatment for acne scars. The dermatologist will apply a local anesthetic and will use tools that carefully sand away the top layer of skin. If your cystic acne covers a large area of skin, your dermatologist may give you a sedative or recommend general anesthesia.Your skin will be red and swollen after the treatment. The swelling should go down within 2 or 3 weeks.

, If you have more severe acne scars, the dermatologist may want to remove the topmost layer of skin. You'll probably get general anesthesia so you'll be asleep during the procedure. The dermatologist will apply the chemical peel to small patches of your skin and remove it along with your top layer of skin which will remove the cystic acne scars.If you had a deep peel, the dermatologist will show you how to change your surgical bandages after the procedure. If you had a moderate peel, you'll probably need to apply cool compresses and lotion.

, If you have ice pick (punched-out) scars, you may be able to remove them by getting a dermal filler injection. During this procedure, collagen (a protein approved by the FDA) is injected under your skin to fill in the pits caused by acne.Your dermatologist may also use steroid injections for scars that are hyper-pigmented or darker than surrounding skin.

, Pulsed dye lasers or intense pulsed light can be used to treat raised acne scars. These high energy light beams burn away damaged skin and scars. Once the scars have been burned away, your skin is more likely to heal normally and without any scarring.Less intensive lasers and lights can be used to leave your skin intact while stimulating the collagen underneath your skin., Small skin grafts (also known as punch grafts) are usually used to treat deep cystic acne scars, especially if they don't respond well to other treatments. During the graft, the dermatologist will punch a hole to remove the scar. The scar is replaced with your own skin (which usually comes from behind your ear).Be aware that many insurance policies may not cover scar removal because it is considered to be cosmetic surgery unless the scar is a physical impairment. Check with your insurance carrier to find out what your policy covers.

Brush a light layer of concealer over the scar.You can use your finger to apply the concealer. Just take care not to apply to much or it may actually draw attention to your scar.

, You'll need to apply a foundation to hide your concealer, especially if your skin tone is a little different than the makeup or you've used a green concealer that's very noticeable. Apply your usual foundation so that your skin tone evens out and the scar is no longer visible.Take care when applying the foundation directly over the scar to avoid rubbing away the concealer.

, Let your foundation rest for a minute so that it dries a little. Take a large powder brush and apply your powder with broad upward strokes. You can use a loose powder that you simply dab the brush into and tap. Or, you can rub the brush into a pressed powder and tap it before applying.Remember to wash off your makeup every night.

These injections reduce inflammation and shrink pimples. According to research, treating acne during the inflammation stage can prevent scarring., While it may be tempting to squeeze a large pimple so that you can make it smaller, this will make scarring more likely.

Choose a topical skincare product that contains retinoic acid and apply it according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Studies show that a combination of retinoic acid and glycolic acid is more effective than retinoic acid on its own.

",How to Get Rid of Blackheads Using an Egg," You may not need to use every bit of egg. However, since you will only be using the whites, you need more eggs. You might want to chill the eggs to make them easier to separate, but that isn’t necessary.;
, Once you get the hang of it, the easiest and cleanest way to separate an egg is with the cracked pieces of shell. Crack the egg along the equator and open it as cleanly as possible. Taking care not to puncture the yolk, transfer the innards back and forth, letting the egg white drip into a bowl below. After a few transfers, you should have little more than the yolk in one half the egg and the white in a bowl.


You can throw away the eggshell and yolk. You won't need it.
Repeat this process with the remaining 2 eggs. Collect the egg white in the same bowl.

, Another easy way to separate the egg white from the yolk is letting it drip through your fingers. Some may not prefer this method because the texture of egg white is unpleasant. However, it is the most simple. To do this, crack an egg and hold one hand over a bowl. Pour the insides of the egg over your hand. The white will slide through your fingers, but the yolk shouldn’t.


Discard the yolk and shell, and repeat with the other 2 eggs.

, An increasingly popular method is using the suction of a plastic water bottle to suck the yolk out of the egg white. Crack the egg directly into the bowl this time. Make sure the mouth of the water bottle is a little wet to make it easier for the yolk to slide through. Squeeze it slightly. When you place it over the yolk and release your squeeze, suction should pull the yolk into the bottle.Discard the yolk, rinse the bottle, and repeat with the next 2 eggs.
For more details about these methods and more, see Separate an Egg. Since separating eggs has been essential to cooking and baking for a long time, there are countless methods. If you aren’t comfortable with the more common methods for doing this, look around to find one that meets your needs.

, It is not necessary to do this, as the texture of the egg is less important than the nutrients themselves. However, it may be easier to apply an even coat to your skin this way. In a bowl, use a whisk or fork and beat the egg until it is light and frothy.

, Adding lemon juice may help to loosen the blackheads, though it is not entirely necessary. Juicing a real lemon is the most natural way, but store-bought lemon juice would do fine. Add 1 tablespoon to your egg white and mix it up., This natural substance helps your skin heal as well as providing a barrier against infection. Mix a little honey into the egg white with a fork or whisk. Apply to your face the same way as if you were only using egg whites., This can be easily paired with any other 'optional' substance. Baking soda is good for your skin in several ways. First, it helps create a paste that cleans and exfoliates your skin. Second, it helps neutralize Ph imbalances that cause acne. Finally, baking soda helps dry out your skin, killing acne and other bacteria. Try adding one tablespoon, and increase gradually if this makes the treatment more effective without harming your skin.


To see similar treatments, see this guide about using baking soda to treat acne.

, The egg white helps get rid of skin discoloration. It is also packed with nutrients that are good for your skin. Once all the layers dry, the mask can be removed, bringing blackheads and acne discoloration with it. You can use your fingers or a small brush to apply the egg white.

, Before applying any more layers, you need the first to dry. The idea here is to get multiple layers to create a thick mask of egg white on your skin. If you don’t let each layer dry, subsequent layers will simply combine with the others, and may not dry quickly or evenly. By applying a thin layer at a time, you are creating the mask bit by bit., A way to ensure you have separate but conjoined layers is by putting a clean piece of tissue or toilet tissue between them. After painting on the first layer, immediately press on the tissue. Allow this to dry before applying more layers. You will apply tissue on top of each layer before it dries.

, Now that you have a foundation of egg white, you need to add more layers. It should go on thinly and evenly, and bond with the dried layer. Add tissue on top of this layer if you are using that method., Two layers of egg white may be enough for many cases of blackheads. However, if you have many blackheads, you may want to apply a third layer.

, Once you feel the final layer, and the mask as a whole, tight and dry over your skin, it is time to remove. Try to peel off the mask, especially if you used tissue. Rinse your face with water and use a gentle cleanser to clean all the egg white off your skin. Pat your skin dry to avoid irritating it.

, You may not see the blackheads magically disappear after one application. Wait a few days and do this treatment again. Apply the mask a couple times a week until the blackheads go away and stay away.

Your skin type (normal, oily, combination of normal and oily) will determine what type of skincare product you should use to get rid of blackheads and whiteheads. If you are not sure about your skin type, your dermatologist will be able to help you determine your skin type.Try a commercial product that is formulated for specific skin types. For example, Clinique has a four step skin care line that is fashioned for different skin types.
If you have a normal skin type, your skin type is not overly sensitive to skin care products. You may use over the counter skin care products already, but want to focus on removing blackheads and whiteheads to improve your skin tone. If you have normal skin type you will want to use a gentle astringent and soap as well and a gentle exfoliant.
If you have an oily skin type, your skin may be prone to oil buildup on your “T-zone” (forehead, nose, and chin). You may use prescribed products from a dermatologist and have acne prone skin due to your oily skin type. If you have oily skin you will want to use a harsher astringent and soap and a coarser exfoliant on the skin.
If you have a combination skin type, your skin may have normal and oily patches. Your skin may also be prone to dryness, especially in the winter months, and be sensitive to over the counter skin care products. You may use prescribed products from a dermatologist to fight off the development of acne. For this type of skin, be gentle when it is normal and use harsher cleansing when it is oily.;
, These ingredients are dermatologist approved for the removal of dead skin cells and have been shown to cleanse the skin of blackheads and whiteheads. The best commercial products for the removal of blackheads and whiteheads will contain one or a combination of these three ingredients. However, some people can be allergic to these ingredients or develop dry skin due to these ingredients. Talk to your dermatologist if you are concerned about having an allergic reaction to any of these ingredients.If you have an allergic reaction to a product, then you will see intense redness or urticaria of the skin.
If you have normal or oily skin that is not overly sensitive, you can use products with a high concentration of salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and glycolic acid. Using products that contain all three ingredients will cause your blackheads to fade fairly quickly.
If you have sensitive skin that may be allergic to salicylic acid, causing chapping and dryness, you can still use products that contain benzoyl peroxide or glycolic acid, or a combination of both.

, This depends on your skin type and the needs of your skin. If you have normal skin with some blackheads and whiteheads, you may be able to use one product that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and glycolic acid on the area of your face that has blackheads and whiteheads. You may apply this product after you have washed your face with your normal cleanser to remove the dead cells from the surface of your skin.


If you have oily or combination skin, and are prone to the development of acne as well as blackheads and whiteheads, you may want to use a combination of products. You may follow a strict skin care regime where you use a cleanser that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and glycolic acid, followed by a toner that contains benzoyl peroxide, and ending with a moisturizer that contains glycolic acid. This will help to improve your skin tone overall, and get rid of blackheads and whiteheads.

, Clay facial masks can help to absorb excess oil on the surface of your skin and exfoliate your skin, removing the sebum buildup that causes blackheads and whiteheads. These deep cleaning masks should be applied on a regular basis, at least once a week, to work effectively.You can find clay facial masks over the counter at your local drugstore or you can ask your dermatologist for medicated facial masks that contain clay.

, Look for pore strips at your local drugstore that are made specifically for blackheads. Though the use of pore strips on your blackheads can help to release clogged pores, your blackheads will come back if you do not follow a regular skincare regime. Pore strips can provide immediate removal of your blackheads but they are not as effective as using skin care products that target the buildup of sebum on the surface of your skin.

, One of the best ways to clear clogged pores and stop blackheads from developing is to take prescription strength formulas like retinoids, a vitamin A derivative. Your dermatologist can prescribe retinoids in pill form or cream form and provide dosage information on how often you should take or apply the retinoids.Retinoids work by improving the way your skin grows and sheds so it is less likely to develop acne. They will also even out the outer layer of your skin, the epidermis, and help your skin shed dead skin cells. You may have peeling when you first use retinoids, but after regular use three to seven times a week for four to six weeks, your skin should appear more clear and even.

, Microdermabrasion is a professional method that uses an abrasive instrument to gently massage your skin, removing the thicker outer layer of your skin, including blackheads and whiteheads. Your dermatologist can perform microdermabrasion or recommend home microdermabrasion instruments you can buy at your local drugstore.A chemical peel is a procedure where a chemical solution is applied to your skin to exfoliate the area and peel off the outer layer of skin. You will then have new, regenerated skin that is free of dead skin cells, as well as blackheads and whiteheads. Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun as it heals, but you should see a noticeable improvement in your skin tone. Chemical peels should always be performed by your dermatologist., Though it may be tempting to squeeze a swollen whitehead or a prominent blackhead, squeezing, poking, and picking at them can cause the skin to become even more inflamed. This can also lead to an infection or scarring. Instead, make sure you wash the area well and apply skin care products that will work to treat and heal the blackheads or whiteheadsNever use any sharp tools on your skin, even if it is advertised as a blackhead removal tool. This can lead to permanent damage to your skin that can be difficult to treat or that will require more intense skin care treatments to heal.

, To make sure you are removing dead skin cells from your skin, you should wash your face at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Use a cleansing product that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and glycolic acid to remove blackheads and whiteheads effectively.If you wear makeup every day, you should always wash your face well and remove all makeup products from your face before going to bed. This will prevent a buildup of dirt and dead skin cells on your skin and ensure you do not develop any blackheads or whiteheads during the night.

, As part of your daily skin routine, you may consider using a toner that contains salicylic acid after you have washed your face with a cleanser. Toner, usually applied with a cotton pad, can help to remove dead skin and dirt that can lead to the development of blackheads and whiteheads.If your skin is sensitive or allergic to salicylic acid, you can talk to your dermatologist about using a toner that contains benzoyl peroxide or glycolic acid.

, Choose an exfoliation product that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or glycolic acid to help get rid of any clogged pores. Apply the exfoliator in circular motions to any areas that have blackheads and whiteheads, such as your nose, forehead and chin.Exfoliation will remove dead skin cells and encourage a newer, smoother skin surface. It will also help to prevent further breakouts and diminish blemishes and pigmentation spots from acne.

, Lots of commercial products can dry out your skin, especially if your skin is still trying to get used to the ingredients in the product. To prevent dryness or chapped skin, use a moisturizer that is oil-free and noncomedogenic. This will ensure the moisturizer does not clog your pores or irritate your skin.Avoid using moisturizers that are heavy in oils, such as Vaseline and mineral oils. These products will only increase the buildup of oil and debris on your skin and the development of more blackheads and whiteheads.

Rub a thin layer over your face and allow it to sit for 10-25 minutes., Drug stores sell mechanical brushes that can be used to clean your face. This will help loosen up the blackhead in preparation for a pore strip. Follow the directions on the box to ensure that you are using the brush correctly.The brush should be moist to help it move over your skin.Turn it on and run it over your skin in conjunction with a cleansing cream. The brush will exfoliate your skin and help the cream penetrate deeper into your pores.You should clean and replace the head of the brush frequently.
There are several models and types of brushes. The faster the head of the brush, the more effective it will be.There are also several shapes; a round brush is the best for cleaning your face. The smaller the brush, the easier it will be to get hard to reach spots., Milk and honey are both thought to be good for the skin, but they can also stick to the blackhead, creating a homemade pore strip. Pore strips, will, ideally, lift the blackhead directly off the skin. As is generally the case, a pore strip is most effective when the blackhead has already been softened up.Mix 1 tablespoon of organic taw honey with 1 teaspoon milk. Heat for about 5 to 10 seconds in a microwave. When the solution has cooled to a comfortable temperature, apply it to the blackheads.

Figure out your skin type.,
For more sensitive skin, choose a product with salicylic acid.,
Use benzoyl peroxide.,
Consider an alpha hydroxy acid product.,
Decide if you want to use a topical cream or face wash.",How to Get Rid of Blackheads1," Knowing if you have oily, normal, dry, or sensitive skin will determine what kind of product you should look for when buying a cleansing product from your local store or pharmacy. The main two categories of treatment are those with benzoyl peroxide, and those with salicylic acid.


Products with these active ingredients can cause allergic reactions. If your skin reacts badly, stop using it.You can actually have more than one type, which is ""combination"". For example, your nose and forehead may be oily, but you may have dryness on your cheeks.
Most acne-prone skin is actually ""sensitive"", as acne tends to react to products such as harsh soap, makeup, or fragrances. If in doubt, go with products designed for sensitive skin.;
, If you have sensitive skin that can dry out and be irritable it is best to go for a product with salicylic acid. Just check the ingredients on the package in the store to know which is which. Salicylic acid is more gentle to the skin, rarely causes redness and peeling, and works more slowly than the stronger alternatives.Look out particularly for products that combine salicylic acid with glycolic acid., If you don’t have particularly sensitive skin that is not prone to drying out, seek out products that have benzoyl peroxide. This key ingredient breaks up the waxy clog so it loosens and comes out of the pore. This is the fastest working store-bought option, but it can be a little harsh on your skin.The strength of the benzoyl peroxide usually ranges between 2.5 and 10%. This, combined with how long you leave the product on your skin, can influence any irritation you may experience. If your skin is sensitive, you can try a product at the lowest percentage and don't leave it on your skin too long.
Benzoyl peroxide can be harsh on your skin, but it is also more effective than salicylic acid.

, Alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) include glycolic acid and can be very effective at exfoliating your skin.You will find glycolic acid in daily exfoliators as well as chemical face peels. It dissolves and releases dead skin cells, which is an excellent way to tackle your blackheads.


Use it in the same way you would a benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid product, and always read the instructions.
AHAs can increase sensitivity to the sun, so be careful if you are going out in bright sunlight after using this treatment., Skin products are usually sold as either face washes or topical creams. A topical cream is usually left on longer, which means it has more time to work, but it is also more likely to irritate your skin. Follow the guidelines for the given product, and be especially careful if you have sensitive skin.

Cleanse areas from under the jaw to the hairline, then rinse the areas thoroughly.If you do not have sensitive skin and your skin tends to be oily, opt for an acne cleanser with either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.
Strong soaps, scrub pads, or rubbing your skin harshly does not help, and may cause your skin to become irritated causing areas of acne to worsen.
Wash your hair regularly to control the release of oil from sebaceous glands located on the scalp.;
, Four main ingredients are found in the topical products that can be purchased without a prescription. The two more popular ingredients, both of which have been studied and found to be effective, are benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.


Benzoyl peroxide works by controlling the bacteria, called Propionibacterium acnes, that normally lives on the skin. It also helps unclog pores.When pores get clogged with oil and dead skin cells, the bacteria can grow causing areas of acne to develop. Start with the lowest strength of benzoyl peroxide, which is 2.5%, if you have never used it before. Move up to stronger benzoyl peroxide products once you are tolerating the treatment. You may see some good results but feel you may get better results with a stronger product. Benzoyl peroxide products are made as strong as 10%, and come in many different forms, like gels, creams, lotions, and pads.
Salicylic acid products help to control the build-up of skin cells, and help to break down developing whiteheads and blackheads. Salicylic acid products also come in different forms, so you can choose the type of product that best suits your skin and your routine. Additional topical products are available that contain either sulfur, usually combined with sodium sulfacetamide to help mask the unpleasant smell, or resorcinol. Both sulfur and resorcinol work by aiding the breakdown of blackheads and whiteheads and reducing acne-causing bacteria.
These products may not be appropriate for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; consult a doctor or pharmacist if selecting an acne treatment under these conditions.

, Treatment with over-the-counter topical acne products sometimes take 8 weeks or even longer to see results. Some people even experience a worsening of acne symptoms prior to improvement. Be patient. Stay with your regimen of proper cleansing and using a topical product long enough to see results., The goals of treatment are to heal existing acne lesions, prevent the formation of new ones, avoid scarring, and improve self-esteem. The drugs contained in the topical products work in 4 primary ways, but no single over the counter product can do it all.


The targets for effective treatment include preventing cells in the follicle areas from clumping together, controlling oil production from the sebaceous glands, controlling the growth of bacteria, and helping to stop inflammation.
Whiteheads form when oil from the glands combines with dead skin cells to form a plug. The plug allows the bacteria underneath to grow beyond what is normal. The follicle wall may expand and become red. Blackheads form the same way, except the plug allows some of the bacteria to be exposed to air which causes it to darken. The darkened spot is not from dirt. Pimples result from inflamed or infected follicles that are blocked. This results in a raised, reddened area with a visible white spot in the center., The FDA has identified a trend of serious, sometimes life-threatening, allergic reactions that may occur with over the counter topical acne products. The exact cause of the allergic reactions can be the active ingredients, the vehicles used, like creams or gels, or a combination of both.


To be safe, apply a small amount of product to a few small areas of acne for three days. If you should develop any signs of an allergic reaction stop using the product immediately and seek emergency medical attention.
The signs of a serious allergic reaction include tightness in the throat, difficulty breathing, feeling dizzy or faint, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips, or tongue. Hives, redness, rashes, and itching are also signs of an allergic reaction., After consulting a doctor or an aesthetician, consider using home microdermabrasion treatments or home chemical peels.


Microdermabrasion is essentially an aggressive exfoliation that removes layers of skin and the bacteria that may be hiding there.Light chemical peels can be done at home. These are usually not as effective as the deeper physician treatments, but they may be effective for some people. This process involves applying a solution to your face that strips away surface layers of skin., If you don’t have a dermatologist, then see your regular doctor first to get started with prescription treatment, or to get a referral to see a dermatologist.


You may want to consult your dermatologist about any existing scars from acne outbreaks as well.

, Your doctor can help you by prescribing treatments that are more effective than products that are available over the counter.


Some treatments, such as topical azelaic acid, are considered safe for pregnant women, although they may cause some temporary skin discoloration in pregnant women and women who use hormonal birth control.Other treatments may not be pregnancy-safe, so you should disclose any possible pregnancy to the doctor prescribing your medications.
Retinoids are topical treatments,usually available only by prescription, though you can now find a retinoid called adapalene gel (Differin gel) over-the-counter. They have been studied and shown to be effective in treating acne. Just like over the counter products, retinoids are made in different forms, such as creams, gels, and lotions, and also are available in different strengths. Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives. They work by helping the skin to get rid of dead cells and by preventing future development of clogged pores. Many retinoids can also help by treating areas that are reddened or inflamed.Retinoids also help keep your skin clear after it has cleared your existing acne.
Topical dapsone products have recently been approved in the United States for the treatment of acne. Dapsone has both antibiotic-like activity, and it acts as an anti-inflammatory. This form of therapy has been shown to work fairly quickly. In some cases, dapsone works best when combined with other forms of treatment, like the use of a topical retinoid product. Using dapsone with benzoyl peroxide could cause discoloration, so it is usually not recommended.Your doctor may also prescribe a topical combination medication. Some medications such as Benzaclin and Ziana combine antibiotic with a retinoid or benzoyl peroxide.

, The most common problems with using prescription topical products are burning and stinging of the skin, dryness, and scaling. By using the product gradually at first, for example just three times weekly then build up to once or twice daily as prescribed, will help your skin to tolerate the new treatment without the discomforts., Your dermatologist will monitor your progress and may consider adding other types of treatments to your topical regimen.


Oral antibiotics have been prescribed to help treat acne for many years, but that practice is changing. Antibiotics work by controlling the growth of the bacteria that can cause acne to develop.
Antibiotics that are commonly used to treat acne include doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline. These are not generally recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women or for children under the age of 12.
Due to the ability of that bacteria to become resistant to treatment, oral and topical antibiotics are now used less frequently than they were in the past.They are most often used to control inflammatory acne while other treatments take effect.

, In women, it is common for acne to worsen just before, and during, the menstrual cycle. Some studies suggest that as many as 63% of women who experience breakouts are particularly prone during their periods, usually about a week before your usual cycle.In many cases, treatment options may include the use of oral contraceptives, or birth control pills, to help regulate the hormonal changes and thereby improve acne conditions. Birth control pills carry some risks and are not to be used in everyone. Talk to your dermatologist about this option.
Pay attention to washing and cleansing your face thoroughly when your period approaches, as your skin tends to produce more sebum, or oil, during this time.In boys, acne can also be caused, or worsened, by hormonal changes. Some oral medications are available to help, but also carry risks and are not often prescribed., In some types of severe acne, called cystic or severe nodular acne, Accutane therapy is very effective. Accutane therapy requires a good understanding of the common side effects, as well as possibly serious ones.


This form of therapy also requires a serious commitment to therapy that includes 2 forms of birth control in females due to the high risk of birth defects. Other commitments are also required. The effectiveness of the drug is very good, but there are risks. Talk with your dermatologist to learn more about Accutane treatment., Some treatments that may be effective against moderate to severe acne include chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and laser or light treatments. These should be done under a physician’s care.


Chemical peels involve applying a chemical solution that peels away layers of skin.They can be effective in treating some types of acne, such as blackheads, whiteheads, and pustules.Chemical peels should not be combined with oral retinoids, though it may be most effective when combined with other types of acne treatments.Microdermabrasion or dermabrasion involves using abrasive brushes (sometimes in conjunction with small crystals) to remove layers of skin.Microdermabrasion is appropriate for all skin tones and can help treat some types of acne.Dermabrasion is not usually recommended for people with darker skin, as it may cause scarring. It is also usually not recommended for acne, or for people who have used the acne medication isotretinoin in the past year.Light therapy — which includes blue light, red light, or lasers — is a somewhat new treatment that has shown promise in treating a variety of skin conditions, including acne. Specific layers or areas of skin are targeted with a narrow spectrum of light, which can help eliminate bacteria in the skin or reduce oil production., Talk with your dermatologist about the best product choices. While oil production is directly linked to acne, drying out your skin too much will eventually cause more oil to be produced. This can cause your acne to get worse. Some acne products dry out your skin, so it is important to keep your skin moisturized properly., Skin damage from the sun can make acne worse, plus lead to other serious skin diseases. Before going into the sun, always apply sunscreen to prevent sun damage. Your dermatologist can help you choose the best sunscreen product for your skin type.

, Squeezing, picking, or pinching areas of acne actually make things worse. This can also lead to scarring, or darkened areas on your skin., Stress does not directly cause acne, but it can make it worse. Develop new hobbies and discover relaxation tools to help you unwind and stay stress-free.

Thyme, oregano, clove, and cinnamon oil can cause skin irritation in some people. Many citrus oils can cause burning on your skin if it is exposed to sunlight after application.

, Bring the water to a boil and let it boil for a minute or two.

, Several essential herbal oils have antibacterial or antiseptic properties, allowing them to kill the bacteria and other microorganisms on your skin that can promote acne. You should never ingest essential oils, as many are toxic or cause unpleasant side effects when consumed. Here are some good options:


Spearmint or peppermint. Add one drop per quart of water; you can increase this if necessary. Both peppermint and spearmint oil contain menthol, which has antiseptic properties.Thyme. Thyme has antibacterial properties and increases blood circulation by opening up blood vessels.Calendula. Calendula has antimicrobial properties and can help accelerate skin healing.Lavender. In addition to being very soothing, lavender oil has antibacterial properties.Rosemary. Rosemary is naturally antibacterial and is especially effective against P. acnes.Oregano. Oregano oil is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory.Avoid tea tree oil for steam baths, as it is highly toxic when consumed.
You can substitute ½ teaspoon of the dried herb for essential oil if you can’t find the essential oil.

, After you have added the herbs and boiled for one minute, remove the pot from the heat. Move it to a stable, comfortable area, such as a countertop or table.


You may want to place the hot pot on a trivet or cloth.

, Place your face over the steaming pot. Close your eyes.


Keep your face at least 12 inches from the water. The steam will dilate your blood vessels and open up your pores, but getting too close to the hot water could damage or even burn your skin.

, Try to relax and take even, calming breaths. Keep your face over the steam for 10 minutes.


If you begin to feel uncomfortable before the 10 minutes is up, move away from the steam.

, Use lukewarm water to rinse your face, and then pat it dry with a clean towel. Don’t rub your skin.

, You can use a brand of moisturizer that will not block pores, such as Olay, Neutrogena, or Clinique. You can also make your own acne-fighting moisturizer using natural oils.


Check the labels of store-brand moisturizers. Choose one that states that it will not clog pores (noncomedogenic) and is oil-free..

, You can safely use this steam cleanse up to twice a day: once in the morning and once at night. After two weeks, you should see improvement in your acne.


Once you see improvement, you can go down to once a day.

Wash your face once a day.,
Keep your skin hydrated.,
Refrain from abrasive creams.,
Don’t pick what you have.,
Skip the sweat.",How to Get Rid of Blackheads Naturally2," It is a myth that blackheads are caused by poor hygiene. However, washing your face once or twice per day with soap and water is beneficial. Washing more often than that can actually be abrasive and make your acne worse., Hydrating lotions, soaps, and creams can be purchased over the counter at any drug store. Follow the directions on the box. These will keep your skin from becoming dry and damaged., Many people will recommend that you use rough scrubs on your face to get rid of acne. However, these can actually irritate your face and make your acne worse. Use gentle soaps when washing your face., Popping blackheads is a rite of passage for many teenagers, but it shouldn't be. Not only can popping and picking blackheads leave scars, it can spread acne by producing inflammation. Be patient with your acne treatment., It is commonly believed that you can sweat out a blackhead either with a sauna or exercise. Actually, evidence seems to indicate that high temperatures and humidity can make acne worse. You should probably skip these treatments."
"
Understand the limitations and risks of homemade treatments.,
Try an egg white mask.,
Use warmed honey.",How to Get Rid of Blackheads2," There is little to no scientifically-backed support for most homemade treatments; support for these methods is mostly anecdotal, or based on personal accounts. These treatments may or may not work, and could potentially damage your skin. Talk to your doctor before attempting any homemade treatment.


If you have particularly sensitive skin take extra care and use more diluted versions of these solutions.
Stop if any of these irritate your skin.

, It is thought that a proteins found in eggs may kill bacteria that causes acne. To make a face mask, separate an egg white from the yolk and, after patting dry your face, apply the egg white to your skin. You can use a cloth for this, if you use your fingers make sure they are clean and dry first. Once the first egg layer has dried, add another. Repeat this 3-5 times, always letting each layer dry first. Then wash it off and pat dry.You can add a layer of tissue between each egg layer. Peel each layer off before you wash your face at the end.Raw egg whites can grow salmonella.Be sure not to ingest raw egg white.

, Honey has both antiseptic and anti-bacterial properties and may assist in healing wounds and skin infections. There is, however, no evidence that it has any affect on blackheads or acne. It is thought the stickiness may help it bind to the blackheads and remove them.


Warm up some honey in a pan, or place a jar of honey in hot water. When the honey is hot to the touch, but there is no danger of you burning yourself, dab it onto your blackheads and let it dry for around ten minutes.
Wash off your face with a damp cloth.You can leave this treatment on overnight, but make sure it has dried or you might wake up with your face stuck to your pillow!

"
"
Check with your doctor before proceeding.,
Make a boric powder solution.,
Use Iodine and Epsom Salts.",How to Get Rid of Blackheads3," As with homemade treatments with natural ingredients, there is very little scientifically-backed evidence for the effectiveness and even the safety of homemade acne and blackhead treatments. You should talk with your doctor or dermatologist before attempting a homemade treatment — you could end up seriously damaging your skin, which could lead to far worse problems than a few blackheads.

, One recommended treatment is the application of highly diluted boric acid mixed with water. Boric is a mild acid that you can buy from the pharmacy. Mix one and a half cups of hot water with half a tablespoon of boric acid powder. Dip a face cloth into the solution and dab this onto your skin. You can leave this for fifteen or twenty minutes to work.There are no studies supporting the use of boric acid for acne. There is evidence to suggest that it does have antibacterial and antiviral properties; however it has not proven to be effective for acne.
Although diluted formulations are known to be safe for abrasions and treating vaginal bacterial disease, boric acid if not diluted properly can cause severe skin and eye irritation.
In addition, there are a few case reports of patients who used an ointment containing boric acid that caused an acne eruption.Be aware that boric acid is a pesticide and be toxic to infants if inhaled or ingested., This method is supposed to pull the plug of oil and dead skin out of your pore. Epsom Salts can be a good exfoliant.Mix a teaspoon of Epsom Salts with four drops of Iodine in half a cup of hot water. Stir until all the salts have dissolved and the temperature has dropped a little.Once the solution is at a safe temperature, apply to your face with cotton balls and let it dry. Then wash off and pat your face dry.


Again, there is no evidence that this method actually removes blackheads. If left on your skin for too long or overused, iodine can cause severe skin reactions, or may put you at risk for hyperthyroidism."

Steam open your pores.,
Use a comedones extractor.,
Pull them out with blackhead strips.,
Avoid squeezing.",How to Get Rid of Blackheads4," Before you think about squeezing or pulling them out, you need to really loosen the pores. Blackheads are very sticky and won’t come out easily, but by loosening the pores you give yourself the best chance of success. An excellent way to do this is to carefully hold your face at least a foot above a bowl of steaming water for ten to fifteen minutes. Getting any closer can cause burns.


Place a towel over your head so the steam can't escape.
You will feel the steam beginning to loosen your pores.
You can also soak a washcloth in hot water and lay it over your face.

, A comedones extractor is a tool used by dermatologists and licensed aestheticians to remove blackheads, but you can use one at home, too. It is easy to use and there is far less risk of damaging your skin than if you try to squeeze out a blackhead with your fingers.


After cleansing your skin, place the loop over the blackhead and apply gentle pressure, then pull the tool down. The blackhead should pop out of your pore.Do not press too hard. If the blackhead doesn't come out with gentle pressure, treat it with a topical cream. Pressing too hard may damage your skin.Make sure you clean your skin and the tool after use to avoid the spread of bacteria and possibly clogging other pores., You can use special blackhead strips to pull out your blackheads. This technique is less likely to irritate your skin. It is only a temporary fix, but it could be exactly what you need in an emergency.Combine occasional use of strips with a good cleaning and exfoliating regime.


For the best results, it’s a good idea to use a treatment cream for a few nights in a row to loosen your pores before you try using a blackhead strip., Never squeeze, pick, or pop blackheads. Squeezing blackheads can cause inflammation and infection, and will certainly not stop the blackheads coming back."
"
If they persist, visit your doctor.,
Consider prescription products.,
Be prepared for oral antibiotics and a topical treatment.",How to Get Rid of Blackheads5," If you are having a really tough time with bad skin and blackheads, pay a visit to your doctor or dermatologist for some advice. She will be able to examine your particular skin type closely and provide the best type of treatment for you, be it something from the store, pharmacy, or even a natural remedy.

, There are some products that dermatologists can prescribe if you have if you have acne that is not getting better with over-the-counter products. This is not for people who just have a few awkward blackheads on their nose every now and then.


Your doctor may prescribe benzoyl peroxide. It is comedolytic (unclogs pores), anti-inflammatory, and also has been shown to reduce the bacteria thought to play a role in acne.

, It is possible that your dermatologist may prescribe you a course of antibiotics to take orally alongside a topical treatment if you also have inflammatory acne lesions alongside your blackheads.This will only be in the most serious cases.

Wash, but don’t over-wash, your face.,
Avoid exfoliation.,
Avoid products that contain alcohol.,
Shower once a day.,
Change your makeup and skin products.",How to Get Rid of Acne Without Using Medication4," Over washing your face can irritate the skin and create redness.

Make sure your cleanser is labeled “non-comedogenic” or says something else about not causing breakouts.
Apply soap and water with clean fingertips. Massage gently without scrubbing. Scrubbing or using an abrasive cleaner, such as a washcloth or mesh sponge, could cause irritation or scarring.Wash your face after you’ve sweated, especially if you have been wearing a hat or helmet.

Shower daily.,
Try not to scrub your back.,
Dab acne cream on the acne.,
See a dermatologist.",How to Get Rid of Back Acne Fast1," Taking a shower every day can help remove oil and impurities that cause back acne.

Some have handles for that hard-to-reach middle back while others are made to spread across your back.They come with heads made of soft cloth, natural bristles, or sponge. Apply the cleanser directly to the back-washer. If you prefer baths, cleaning your back could still benefit from a soft-tipped back-washer. Use an exfoliating body wash or one that contains sulfur, salicylic acid, glycolic acid or benzoyl peroxide.Make sure to use a new washcloth each day. Bacteria can grow and remain on a washcloth after your shower.
Make sure to wash after exercising. Sweat build up can cause acne.;
, While you may think scrubbing will help get rid of the acne, scrubbing can cause more acne. Scrubbing irritates and damages the skin. Instead, wash your back gently. Also use gentle cleansing products that are non-comedogenic — they should be labeled as such. Products that are non-comedogenic are Neutrogena, Aveeno, Cetaphil, and Olay.You can also use acne cleansers marketed for your face on your back. These cleansers contain benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids.

, If you have a partner willing to help, have them dab a bit of acne cream or gel containing 2.5 to 10% benzoyl peroxide, 0.5 to 2% salicylic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids. Apply the cream or gel directly onto the blemish using a cotton swab or cotton ball. If you can reach, you can apply it yourself.Use the least concentrated to begin with to make sure that you aren’t sensitive to these chemicals.
Make sure to follow the directions and not apply too much cream or gel.

The peeling process encourages cell turnover, which can help heal scars. You can buy a commercial peel kit to use at home, but the most effective treatment is 30% salicylic three to five times times, every three to four weeks weeks.Unlike benzoyl or hydrogen peroxide, it does not lighten the skin making it susceptible to ultraviolet radiation. Salicylic acid has minimal side effects, but is not recommended for people allergic to aspirin.You can ask your dermatologist for recommendations before buying a commercial salicylic acid peel kit. Or, your dermatologist can apply a peel at their office.;
, Apply the gel to the affected area up to two times a day. Make sure not to use any product with more than 20% concentration of AHA or glycolic acid since it can strip your skin of oils and moisture. You can find topical scar gels containing alpha and beta hydroxy acids at most pharmacies and cosmetic stores. Your dermatologist can also apply a glycolic acid peel at their office.Alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA) such as lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid and beta-hydroxy glycolic acids are naturally found in foods like citrus, sugar cane, sour milk, apples, and fruits, among others.They can help reduce the appearance of scars, blemishes and wrinkles by gently exfoliating the top layer of skin., You can buy onion extract gel from most pharmacies. Apply it once or twice a day until the scarring improves. Studies show that onion extract helps heal scars and burns. It contains a natural antioxidant that reduces inflammation, stimulates cell growth, and repairs damaged tissue. The antibacterial sulfur compounds (or substances) found in onions can also help reduce acne breakouts, reduce blemishes, and improve hyperpigmentation., Use a mechanical grater to puree a small onion. Refrigerate the puree for 20 minutes to reduce the pungent smell that can cause irritation. Remove the puree from the fridge, then apply it to affected areas. Leave the mixture on for 10 – 15 minutes, then rinse with cool water.


This method can be used once daily until the scars heal, about four to 10 weeks. Stop using it if you notice severe irritation., You can find natural aloe vera gel at most pharmacies and drug stores. Apply it regularly to reduce the appearance of scars. Aloe vera contains active compounds that reduce inflammation while stimulating cell growth and repair. It's a popular treatment for wounds, scars and burns. Aloe vera also works as a moisturizer because of its high water content.Try to find an aloe that has as few additives as possible. You can also use the aloe vera directly from an aloe vera plant. Simply cut a leaf from the plant and squeeze the gel onto the affected area.

, You can apply an ointment of 2 – 5% calendula, three to four times a day as needed. This will reduce the appearance of post-acne scars and blemishes since calendula, or marigold, stimulates cell growth and repair. It also improves skin hydration and firmness.You can make a daily calendula facial rinse by placing 2 to 3 grams of florets in a jar and pouring 1 cup of boiling water over the florets. Cover the jar and allow it to steep for 15 minutes or overnight. Use this to rinse your face once cooled.
Be aware that people who are allergic to plants in the daisy or aster family, including chrysanthemums and ragweed, may have an allergic reaction to calendula., You can purchase a commercial face mask containing sea silt at a pharmacy or cosmetic store.

Vitamin E helps moisturize the skin and reduce the appearance of scars., Simply spread a thin layer of honey onto the affected area or try combining 2 tbsp. of raw honey with 1 tbsp. of baking soda to make an exfoliating wash. Honey has been shown to speed up healing, but more research is needed to determine if it has any effect on scarring.


Honey has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. These may may help improve the appearance of scars and reduce inflammation.

, Your skin absorbs almost 60% of all substances you put on it. Non-soap cleansers are free from chemicals such as sodium laureth sulfate which is a detergent and foaming agent that can cause irritation and scarring in acne-prone skin. Look for an organic, chemical-free cleanser to avoid further irritation and scarring. Many natural cleansers are easily available at most pharmacies.Before using treatments for scarring, it is important to make sure you no longer have active inflamed or cystic acne. If you have sensitive skin, avoid astringent cleansers, since they can dry and irritate your skin., If you don't want to buy a cleanser, head to the kitchen and make your own. Infuse one teaspoon of green tea, which contains natural antioxidants, in a cup of warm water for 3–5 minutes. Strain the tea into a clean bowl and let it cool for 15–20 minutes. Dip a cotton ball, facial wipe, or microdermabrasion cloth into the infusion and apply it to your skin.Never apply makeup immediately after washing your skin. It can also clog your pores, causing more acne breakouts. Also be sure to use oil-free cosmetics for your skin and hair.

, Wash your hands before applying the cleanser, so that dirt and bacteria don’t clog your pores and gently rinse your face using lukewarm or cold water.

Wash your face once in the morning and once at night, as well as after sweating heavily. Wash your skin as soon as possible after sweating, since it can irritate your skin., Exfoliation can improve your skin's appearance and remove dead skin cells, preventing acne.For a natural exfoliant, boil 1 tablespoon of organic oatmeal in ¼ cup water. Once it cools, gently massage the mixture onto your face. Oatmeal is a natural plant-based cleanser with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and photoprotective properties. Its high concentration of starches helps the skin stay moisturized too, so it is safe to use for people with sensitive skin.Before using any exfoliating products, ask your dermatologist what treatment may be right for your skin type. People with dry, sensitive skin should limit exfoliating to once or twice per week, while people with oily, thicker skin can exfoliate once every day.

, Dry skin can irritate and worsen the appearance of scars and blemishes. A non-comedogenic moisturizer can help prevent dryness while keeping your skin fresh. Look for a natural, organic cream or lotion with anti-inflammatory plant extracts such as chamomile, green tea, aloe, calendula, or oats.Make sure to apply a moisturizer regularly after cleansing or exfoliating. Consider choosing from the following moisturizers:


A moisturizer with alpha-hydroxy acids (such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid and tartaric acid): can help reduce the appearance of scars, blemishes and wrinkles.
Hyaluronic acid (widely available as a lotion, toner, or mist): naturally helps the skin retain moisture and may prevent aging of the skin.Aloe vera (widely available in moisturizers and topical gels): reduces inflammation, stimulates cell growth and repair, and can reduce the appearance of scars with regular application.
Virgin coconut oil (available in variety food stores): contains a blend of anti-inflammatory fatty acids that fight off bacteria that can cause other skin infections. Applying 1-2 drops of coconut oil on your skin twice a day to significantly reduce dryness, repair skin cells, and reduce the occurrence of scars. It should not be used by people with nut allergies., While some sun exposure is good for your immune system, acne scars that are exposed to excessive ultraviolet radiation from the sun often become permanent. To protect your skin from sun damage, apply a non-comedogenic sunscreen with a minimum SPF (sun protection factor) of 30. Some chemicals in sunscreens may cause allergies, so ask your dermatologist what sunscreen is right for you.Excess exposure to sunlight may also cause sunspots, known as solar lentigines, that start forming beneath the layers of the skin and cause small dark spots on the surface of your skin as you age., Parabens are preservatives used in many cosmetic products. Many studies have found that parabens can disrupt hormonal balance and put you at a higher risk of breast and uterine cancers. They can also cause skin irritation and inflammation for people who suffer from acne, and may be a potential allergen.Butyl and propyl paraben are considered more toxic than methylparaben and ethylparaben, but the latter is more easily absorbed by the human body., To keep hydrated, drink at least eight ounces of water every two hours. Try to get at least 2–4 liters of water per day. Staying hydrated can improve your skin’s elasticity. This can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and lessen the extent of depressed acne scars, such as ice pick scars.Dehydration causes dry skin, but it can also weaken your immune system. If you're dehydrated, your body is not flushing out toxins through sweat and excretion, making it harder for your body to heal surface wounds such as acne scars.

, Studies show that oral zinc therapy can help heal acne.Zinc is an essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties. This helps protect cells in the body from damage caused by bacteria and viruses.It’s common to have slightly low levels of zinc, but taking a multivitamin and eating a healthy diet should give you all the zinc you need. While you can take supplements, the best dietary sources of zinc are:


Oysters, shrimp, crab, and shellfish
Red meats
Poultry
Cheese
Beans
Sunflower seeds
Pumpkin
Tofu
Miso
Mushrooms
Cooked greens
Easily absorbed zinc: zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc acetate, zinc glycerate, and zinc monomethionine. If zinc sulfate causes stomach irritation, you can try another form, such as zinc citrate.

, According to studies, you might have low levels of vitamin A if you have severe acne. Vitamin A is an anti-inflammatory that balances your hormones and might help reduce oil production. You can increase your vitamin A intake by eating a healthy diet and avoiding unhealthy fats like margarine, hydrogenated oils, and processed food.Vitamin A is found mostly in salmon, egg yolks, tuna, carrots, green leafy vegetables, and yellow or orange fruits. If you take a supplement, the recommended daily dose is 10,000 to 25,000 IU (international units). High doses of Vitamin A can have toxic side-effects, including birth defects and depression, so watch how much you're getting.

, You can take two to three doses of Vitamin C for a total of 500 mg a day. You can also add vitamin-C-rich foods to your daily diet. Good natural sources of vitamin C are:Sweet red or green peppers
Citrus fruit such as oranges, pomelo, grapefruit, limes or non-concentrated citrus juices.
Spinach, broccoli and brussel sprouts
Strawberries and raspberries
Tomatoes

, Green tea is rich in antioxidants called polyphenols that stimulate collagen production, repair skin cells, fight harmful free radicals, protect against ultraviolet radiation, reduce wrinkles and help reduce stress. To make green tea, steep 2-3 g of green tea leaves in one cup of warm water (80-85°C) for 3–5 minutes. Green tea can be taken two to three times daily.Topical treatments that contain green tea may also effectively reduce the appearance of scars.

, You should get at least 30–40 minutes of moderate exercise, such as walking or recreational swimming, or 10–15 minutes of intensive exercise, such as basketball, soccer, and hiking, on a regular basis. Exercise helps reduce stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. It also stimulates endorphins, chemicals in the brain that help elevate your mood. Exercise also helps boost self-esteem and strengthen the immune system.Make sure to wear loose, clean clothes and avoid tight-fitting synthetic clothes. When helmets, masks, headbands and other tight-fitting sports equipment rub against your skin, they can cause acne to flare up. Keep your equipment clean and shower after exercising., Acne and acne scarring can cause low self-esteem, anxiety and depression. If you suffer from acne scarring, remember that a variety of treatment options are available. Studies show that emotional stress can make acne worse, especially in women, and often lead to thoughts of suicide. Some other ways to manage stress are:Listening to music: Research finds that listening to soothing music can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety.
Making time for recreation: Replace unnecessary time-consuming chores with pleasurable or interesting activities.
Meditation: Try sitting with your legs crossed in a quiet environment while taking slow deep breaths. Regular meditation can reduce blood pressure, chronic pain, anxiety and lower cholesterol levels.
Other meditation techniques: These include exercises such as tai chi or yoga, biofeedback, and massage therapy.

, Pillowcases and sheets can trap bacteria, dirt and dead skin cells. These can get into your pores when you sleep and cause more acne breakouts leading to further scarring. Change your pillowcases often and consider putting a fresh towel on your pillow each night if you apply an overnight treatment., The fewer acne breakouts you have, the less likely you are to develop acne scars. Treating acne is important to prevent scarring, especially with any of the following:Severe, painful cysts and nodules. Nodules are hard, large and inflamed pimples and cysts are pus-filled, painful pimples, both of which occur deep in the skin and can often cause scarring.
Picking, popping or squeezing a pimple. This can cause further breakouts and permanent acne scars.
Acne that began at a young age. People who develop acne in their preteens often develop severe acne within few years. Treating the acne before it becomes severe has benefits, including less risk of developing acne scars.
Excessive exposure to sunlight. This causes photoaging and hyperpigmentation due to ultraviolet radiation.
Harsh scrubbing. This can aggravate existing acne, increasing the risk of permanent scarring.
Blood relatives who have acne scars. The tendency to develop acne scars often runs in the family.
Inflammation. Scarring can also be caused by inflammation in reaction to allergens or deep cuts and injuries.

, Scarring is often a permanent condition but can be reduced with topical or surgical treatment. Hyperpigmentation occurs when red or dark marks are left behind after a pimple heals. These marks are not actually scars and can last for months or years before they fade, but treatment for hyperpigmentation and acne scars is usually quite similar. Common types of acne scars are:


Ice pick scars: deep pits caused by cystic acne, usually less than 2mm across. They extend into the skin, giving the skin an appearance of having been punctured by an ice pick.
Isolated large cysts: pits, called craters, can be up to a quarter-inch in diameter. Minor cosmetic surgery is usually needed.
Boxcar scars: angular scars with sharp vertical edges, resembling the scars left by chicken pox. They may be shallow or deep, and are most often found on the cheeks and temples.
Rolling scars: caused by damage under the surface of the skin. They give the skin a wave-like appearance and tend to be wide and shallow.
Hypertrophic scars: less common, raised and lumpy in appearance. They tend to appear on the back and chest, but can also appear on the neck and face. They generally stay within the boundary of the original wound, and may decrease in size over time.

, Dirt and bacteria on your hands can clog your pores and infect acne if you excessively touch your face. If you feel irritation from acne, use a gentle, oil-free daily facial wipe to remove excess dirt and reduce irritation. Do not squeeze or pop your blemishes, or you run the risk of developing scars. In some cases, squeezing a pimple may spread the bacteria even further.Do not cover blemishes by sweeping your hair over them. Keep your hair away from your face with ponytails, headbands or hair clips. Dermatologists also recommend that you wash your hair frequently if it is oily, because the oil can transfer to your forehead and face, leading to breakouts., Smoking can cause a condition called smoker’s acne, in which the body does not make an inflammatory response to heal the skin as quickly as it would with normal acne. Smokers are also four times more likely to get moderate acne after adolescence, particularly women between the ages of 25-50. Cigarette smoke may also cause skin irritation for people with sensitive skin.


Smoking is known to cause other skin conditions like wrinkles and premature skin aging. It does this by creating free radicals, impairing collagen production, and degrading skin proteins. Increased acne can cause even more scarring, while impaired collagen production can slow down the rate of healing for scars., While some doctors may suggest using benzoyl peroxide as an alternative to antibiotic treatments, it can do more harm than good.Benzoyl peroxide works against acne mainly as an anti-inflammatory antiseptic on the surface of the skin. It can be used occasionally in small concentrations, but regular use may cause some side effects. Some side effects benzoyl peroxide might include:


skin irritation, such as dry skin, redness, itchiness, irritation, and peeling skin
uneven pigmentation in people with darker skin and a blotchy complexion in lighter skin types
increased sun sensitivity and possibly premature aging.
damage to your skin from generating free radicals
possibility of ties to skin cancer when used at concentrations greater than 20%.

Benzoyl peroxide is not recommended for people with dry, sensitive skin and for pregnant women.



, Retinoids are compounds that come from Vitamin A. Vitamin A that you get from your diet makes healthy retinol that maintains your immune system and repairs your skin, but topical retinoid treatments have been linked with causing depression, anxiety, and triggering thoughts of suicide and episodes of violence. Avoid retinoids and high intake of vitamin A during pregnancy as they can be highly toxic to the child and cause birth defects.The most common retinoids used in treatments for acne are roaccutane and accutane, also known as isotretinoin, and retin-a, also called tretinoin. Retinoids treatments help reduce acne symptoms by controlling oil production and normalizing the shedding of dead skin cells so that they don’t clog pores.

, If you have raised scars, getting an anti-inflammatory steroid injection may help reduce scarring. While a recovery period isn’t necessary, you may have some side effects like allergic reactions, bruising, tissue death, dilated blood vessels, lightened skin, and hyperpigmentation.Injections can cost anywhere from $50-$75 for each injection. Keep in mind that you may need repeated injections every few months until your skin improves. Speak with your healthcare provider to determine if the treatment will be effective for you.

, If you have raised scars, you might get cryosurgery which freezes the scar tissue with liquid nitrogen. The scar tissue will die and slowly fall off. Talk to your healthcare provider or dermatologist to determine if the treatment is right for you.Understand that cryotherapy can cause permanent light spots to form on the treated skin, so it's not recommended for darker skinned people. Other side effects include swelling, hyperpigmentation, and blistering that can take 3–4 weeks to heal.

, Surgical treatment options are available for people with severe scarring. A dermatologist can help determine what kind of treatment will be best for your individual needs. Surgical options include:Laser resurfacing: If you have severe scars, a laser is used to remove skin so new skin can form in its place. The procedure involves passing the laser over the treatment area 1–3 times and can take a few minutes for smaller areas or an hour for larger areas. Common side effects include prolonged redness, raised scarring, dilated blood vessels, cysts, acne, eczema, lightened skin or hyperpigmentation.
Dermabrasion: If you have severe scars, your dermatologist will use a high-speed diamond or wire wheel brush or sandpaper to remove the skin’s surface, brushing away surface scars and reducing deeper scars. Common side effects include sun sensitivity, raised scarring, dilated blood vessels, eczema, lightened skin or hyperpigmentation.
Silicone dressings and bandages: A dermatologist applies these to reduce discomfort and scar size. They must be constantly used until you notice an improvement. Silicone may cause allergic reactions or dry, irritated skin.
Light chemical peels: A dermatologist administers peels with alpha-hydroxy or beta-hydroxy acids to exfoliate the skin. Skin will be sensitive after treatment and may have redness and peeling.

, For many people, natural treatments can safely and effectively reduce the appearance of scars caused by acne. When selecting a natural remedy for acne scars, however, make sure that you use the treatment for scars instead of using it for active inflamed or cystic acne.

, Most natural remedies are safe for most people, but in some cases, you might be allergic or especially sensitive to one of the remedies suggested. If you've never been exposed to the remedy itself, a good way to determine if you might be allergic to it is to note any allergies you have to related substances.


In particular, you should avoid salicylic acid peels if you have an allergy to aspirin, since aspirin is derived from salicylic acid.You should also avoid calendula ointment if you have an allergy to daisies, ragweed, chrysanthemums, or other plants in the aster family.To be on the safe side, research any unfamiliar home remedy before use if you have any known allergies to verify that it won't trigger those allergies.

, While many natural, non-chemical acne scar remedies are safe for all skin types, a few may irritate sensitive skin. If you have normal to oily skin, most remedies should be okay to use; if you have dry or sensitive skin, however, you should opt for those least likely to cause problems.


For instance, sea salt masks can increase irritation for those with dry, sensitive, or inflamed skin.Astringent cleaners may also irritate sensitive skin.

, When followed properly, regular skin care, acne scar prevention techniques, and natural remedies won't usually cause a problem, especially if you don't have sensitive skin or any allergies. Using these measures in excess could actually create more issues, though, so it's best to follow all guidelines in moderation.


Note that scar gels containing more than 20% alpha-hydroxy acid may strip away essential oils and moisture from your skin, so you should consider using lower concentrations.You should only wash your face twice a day and after periods of heavy sweating to avoid drying it out. Similarly, only exfoliate roughly once a week if you have dry or sensitive skin, or once a day if you have notably oily or thick skin.
Also note that high doses of vitamin A and zinc can be toxic, so it's best to follow dietary guidelines closely when adding either nutrient to your diet., Consulting a dermatologist may not be strictly necessary for mild scarring and normal skin types, but it's not a bad idea, either. Furthermore, if you have any special concerns, consulting a dermatologist before attempting home treatment is actually advised.

, After starting any acne scar home treatment, monitor the results. Stop use if a negative reaction occurs. If the treatment doesn't help after several weeks, you may also need to cease use and try something else.


Even if no negative reaction occurs, you should notice at least minor to moderate improvement after three to four weeks of treatment.

This is often enough to keep your skin clean and clear., Before you go to bed or exercise, take off your makeup. Not doing this can clog your pores and cause more acne.Remove every trace of makeup with a gentle cleanser or make-up remover.
Cleaning your makeup applicators regularly with soapy water can get rid of acne-causing bacteria., If you exercise often or are very active, shower when you’re done. Sweat may stimulate the production of oil or bacteria that could cause acne., Rub a skin-type specific moisturizer following your cleansing routine. Properly hydrating your skin may get rid of and prevent acne.Even oily skin requires a moisturizer. Choose an oil-free and non-comedogenic product.Talk to your dermatologist or doctor about your skin type and then buy products specifically formulated for your needs.

, Dead skin and debris can clog pores and cause acne. Use a gentle exfoliator on your skin to clear away acne-causing debris.


Understand that an exfoliator only scrubs away surface skin and cannot remove acne.
Choose an exfoliator with either synthetic or natural beads to minimize irritation. A soft washcloth can also gently exfoliate your skin.

, Apply a product to absorb excess oil from your skin. This may help remove oil that is clogging your pores, but also keep bacteria and dead skin that cause acne at bay.Apply an over the counter treatment of salicylic acid. Your doctor can prescribe one if your acne is more severe.Using a clay mask once a week in conjunction with your mint mask may further absorb excess oil and also help purify your skin.
Place an oil blotting paper on your face to soak up excess oil.

, Apply non-comedogenic products to your face. Skincare marked “non-comedogenic” won’t clog your pores and may help prevent breakouts and irritation.Look for products with the label “non-comedogenic,” which means the company has tested it for acne-prone skin.Consider using skincare marked “hypoallergenic” as well.

Incorporate foods with omega-3s.,
Get more Vitamin D. Vitamin D has many benefits for the skin.,
Limit your dairy intake.,
Try garlic.",How to Get Rid of Back Acne Fast4," Foods with lots of sugar can cause acne. Numerous studies have found that low-glycemic index foods can help reduce acne.Low-glycemic index (GI) foods release sugars into your blood more slowly. Low GI foods include:


Most vegetables
Most fruit — Mango, banana, papaya, pineapple, raisins, and figs have medium GI
Brown rice, barley, and whole grain pasta

Vegetables are high in Vitamin A. Try dark leafy greens, carrots, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash, and pumpkin.
Eat fruit like cantaloupe, mangoes, and apricots.
Legumes have a good amount of Vitamin A.
Meat, especially liver, is a good source of Vitamin A., Omega-3 fatty acids are supposed to help control the production of oil. Omega-3 fatty acids are most commonly found in food: fish oils and fish, such as salmon, sardines, mackerel, whitefish, and shad; nuts, like butternuts and walnuts; seeds, like flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, and chia seeds; and avocados.You can also take a supplement.

, It helps boost the immune system, reduces inflammation, acts as an anti-microbial, and reduces oil production.The best place to get Vitamin D is from the sun. Go outside and sit in the sun for about 10 to 20 minutes. If your skin is darker, spend more time in the sun.

Start with a cortisone cream.,
Try an over-the-counter skin lightening cream.,
Use glycolic or salicylic acid treatments.,
Use retinoid skin products.,
Think about microdermabrasion and chemical peels.",How to Get Rid of Acne Scars Fast2," Cortisone creams help reduce inflammation of the skin and promote healing.Talk to your doctor to determine which kind of cortisone cream is right for you.


Cortisone creams are available in both prescription and over-the-counter forms. Only apply the cream to the affected skin, and be sure to read the labels for instructions on use.

, Lightening creams that contain ingredients such as kojic acid, arbutin, licorice extract, mulberry extract, and vitamin C can help safely lighten and fade skin hyperpigmentation caused by acne scars without causing damage or irritation.Avoid products that contain hydroquinone, as this popular skin-lightening chemical can irritate your skin and has been labelled a potential carcinogen.If you have darker skin (esp. for black/African people), avoid lightening creams. They may permanently remove melanin from your skin, which can create a worse blemish.

, Glycolic and salicylic acids are found in many skincare products, such as creams, scrubs and ointments, as they are effective exfoliants which help skin to shed layers, bringing hyperpigmented skin to the surface, before helping it to disappear completely.You could also book an appointment with a dermatologist to get a glycolic chemical peel, which work in the same way, but will penetrate deeper layers of skin.

, Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives which are used in a wide array of skin care products treating fine lines and wrinkles, skin discoloration, and acne. Retinoids boost collagen production and speed up cell turnover, making them a great choice for targeting acne scars. These creams can be a little on the pricey side, but they are highly recommended by dermatologists for their fast, effective results.


You can purchase some retinoid creams over-the-counter, such as those produced by major skincare brands. However, stronger creams are available by prescription from your dermatologist.
The ingredients in retinoid creams are sensitive to the UVA rays in sunlight, so these creams should only be applied at night in order to protect your skin., These treatments are not going to fade your acne scars overnight, as they can be quite harsh and the skin will take time to heal. However, they are definitely worth considering if your find that creams and lotions aren't working, or you're more concerned about evening out your skin tone.


A chemical peel involves having a concentrated acidic solution applied to the skin. It will burn away the top layers of skin, leaving fresh, new layers of skin underneath.
Microdermabrasion produces similar results, but it works by exfoliating the skin using a rotating wire brush.

Apply fresh lemon juice.,
Consider exfoliating with baking soda.,
Use honey.,
Experiment with aloe vera.,
Use an ice cube.,
Make sandalwood paste.,
Try apple cider vinegar.",How to Get Rid of Acne Scars Fast3," Lemon juice has natural skin bleaching properties, and can help to effectively lighten your acne scars. Simply combine equal parts lemon juice and water and apply this liquid directly onto your scars, avoiding the surrounding skin. Wash off the lemon juice after 15 to 25 minutes or you could put the lemon juice on overnight as a mask.


Remember to moisturize immediately after washing off the juice, as the citric acid in the lemon can be very drying on the skin.
Lime juice, which also contains citric acid, can be used instead of lemon in a pinch.
Since lemon juice has a pH of 2 and skin's pH is 4.0-7.0, this method needs to be used carefully. If left on too long, or not diluted this can lead to significant chemical burns. Citrus juices also contains a chemical called Bergapten, which binds to DNA and allows UV radiation to damage skin more easily, so you need to watch your sun exposure if you have any citrus juice on your skin. Rinse it off before going into the sun, and wear sunscreen.

, Baking soda can be used to exfoliate the skin and minimize the appearance of acne scars. All you need to do is mix one teaspoon of baking soda with two teaspoons of water to form a liquid paste. Apply this paste all over your face and use gentle circular motions to rub the baking soda into the skin, concentrating on the scarred areas, for about two minutes. Rinse off with warm water and pat the skin dry. You could also use the baking soda paste as a spot treatment, applying it directly onto the scarred area and letting it sit for 10 to 15 minutes before washing off.
Some skin advocates suggest foregoing this method. The pH of baking soda is 7.0, which is far too basic for skin's pH. Optimal skin pH occurs between 4.7 and 5.5, which is an inhospitable environment for p. acne (the bacteria responsible for causing most acne).

, Honey is a great natural solution for clearing up pimples and reducing the red marks they leave behind. This is because honey contains antibacterial properties and helps to soothe the skin and reduce inflammation. Raw or manuka honey is the most effective. It can be dabbed directly onto the scarred area, using a q-tip.


Honey is a great option for those with sensitive skin, as honey is non-irritating, and will moisturize your skin instead of drying it out, unlike other treatments.

Aloe vera helps to rejuvenate and moisturize the skin, encouraging acne scars to fade. It is possible to buy aloe vera products in the drugstore, but the best thing to do is buy an aloe vera plant and use the sap from a broken leaf. This gel-like sap can be applied directly on the scarring, and there is no need to wash off.


For a more intense scar treatment, you can mix a drop or two of tea tree oil (which promotes clear skin) into the aloe vera gel before applying.

, Ice is an extremely simple home remedy which can help to fade acne scars by soothing the inflamed skin and reducing redness. To use, just wrap an ice cube in a clean cloth or piece of paper towel and hold it against the scarred skin for a minute or two, til the area starts to feel numb. Sometimes it can burn.


Instead of freezing regular water, you can freeze some strong green tea in an ice cube tray and use the resulting ice cubes on the acne scars. Green tea has anti-inflammatory properties which complement the cooling effects of the ice.

, Sandalwood is known for its skin healing properties, and is easy to prepare at home. Just mix one tablespoon of sandalwood powder with a few drops of rosewater or milk to form a paste.

Always protect your skin from the sun.,
Use gentle skincare products.,
Exfoliate regularly.,
Avoid picking at spots and scars.,
Drink plenty of water and follow a balanced diet.",How to Get Rid of Acne Scars Fast4," Ultraviolet rays from the sun stimulate pigment-producing skin cells,which can worsen the appearance of acne scars. If you spend time in the sun, protect your skin by applying sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher), wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and keeping to the shade as much as possible.

, A lot of the time, people are so desperate to get rid of acne scars and skin discolorations that they will use all manner of abrasive products and methods which can irritate the skin and make the situation worse. Try to listen to your skin -- if it's reacting badly to a particular product, you should stop using that product immediately. Stick to gentle facial cleansers, make-up removers, moisturizers and scrubs that soothe your skin rather than inflame it.


A big mistake people make is applying moisturizers to dry skin. Apply your moisturizer to WET/damp skin to guarantee that the moisturizer can work its way into your pores.
Instead of using a regular moisturizer, mix some of your favorite facial cream with some Aloe Vera Gel. Aloe is a natural humectant which means that it sucks all the moisture from the air onto your face. This will leave your face hydrated.
Avoid using very hot water when cleaning your face. Hot water can be very drying to the skin, so turn the temperature down a few notches.
You should also avoid using rough facecloths, sponges and loofahs on the face, as these are too harsh and can irritate the skin.

, Exfoliating helps to slough off dead skin, revealing the fresh, soft new skin underneath. As acne scarring usually only effects the top layers of skin, exfoliating can speed up the fading process. You can exfoliate using a specific facial scrub, just make sure it's designed for sensitive skin.


Alternatively, you can exfoliate using a gentle washcloth and some warm water by moving the washcloth around your face in small circular motions.
You should exfoliate at least once a week and at most once a day, though if your skin is very dry you may want to keep it to 3 to 4 times a week.

, Though it may be tempting, picking at your scars interrupts the process by which your skin naturally heals and can worsen their appearance. Picking at existing pimples, meanwhile, can cause your skin to scar in the first place, as bacteria from your hands may be transferred onto your face, causing it to become inflamed and infected. Therefore, picking should be avoided at all costs.

, Although eating healthily and staying hydrated isn't going to magically make acne scars disappear, it will allow your body to perform at its best and help skin to heal itself. Water will flush toxins from the body and keep skin looking plump and firm, so you should aim to drink 5 to 8 glasses a day. Vitamins such as A, C and E will also help to feed the skin and keep it hydrated.


Vitamin A is found in vegetables such as broccoli, spinach and carrots and vitamins C and E are found in oranges, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and avocados.
You should try to avoid greasy, fatty and starchy foods as much as possible as they will not do your skin any favors.

Apply ice.,
Coat with lemon juice.,
Dab with milk of magnesia.,
Treat with toothpaste.,
Apply honey.,
Douse with eye drops.,
Cover using concealer.",How to Get Rid of Acne Redness Fast1," Icing your problem area is the quickest (and cheapest) way to reduce the swelling that causes redness. Ice will reduce the size of your pimples, reduce the pain associated with your blemish, and even shorten the duration of a breakout.Ensure your skin is clean and freshly washed.
Wrap the ice cube in a washcloth. You should never apply ice directly to your skin.
Place the wrapped ice directly upon your breakout and hold for a minute.
Give your skin a five-minute break, then reapply as needed for an additional minute.;
, Lemon juice fights inflammation and has antibacterial properties. The surface of your skin is healthiest when it's slightly acidic — and your skin's ideal pH is roughly equivalent to the pH of lemon juice.Apply for 15 to 30 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.
Use caution in applying lemon juice if you have sensitive skin.
This treatment is not recommended for people with darker skin tones. Lemon juice stimulates the melanocytes, or pigment-producing cells, in your skin to produce protective antioxidants. Darker skinned individuals have more melanocytes, which means their skin produces more antioxidants. As a result, application of lemon juice can produce skin spots, especially when the skin is then exposed to sun.

, Unfortunately, the concealing qualities of milk of magnesia are only truly effective if your skin happens to be the same tone as the milk. If this happens to be the case, this inexpensive cover up is worth pursuing — if not, you'll want to try something else., While this treatment should not be used on widespread acne, you can quickly minimize the appearance of smaller outbreaks by applying toothpaste to the affected area. Let the toothpaste sit on the affected area for at least an hour before rinsing (you may even try leaving it on overnight)., Honey is a natural antibiotic and can reduce the inflammation that causes redness. You can use honey straight from the jar as a facial mask, washing it off after about 30 minutes. It can also be used as a spot treatment.


Consider diluting honey with water and applying as a ""honey toner"" for overnight treatment. Thinly apply this ""toner"" and allow it to dry slightly before going to bed., The drops you use for eye redness can also reduce the red appearance of your acne. Apply with a cotton swab or cotton ball and leave the solution on for about 30 minutes before rinsing., Note that applying makeup over active breakouts may cause additional clogging of your pores, so when possible it's best to avoid using concealer as a solution. When you need to reduce redness in a hurry, however, concealer is a quick and easy way to do so — just be sure to wash your face once you get home.


Green concealer does a good job of canceling out redness and can then be hidden by using foundation in your natural skin tone. Bear in mind that oily skin can sometimes cause concealer layers to separate, rendering the green visible.
You may also use gold concealer on white skin tones or brown concealer for Asian, brown, and black skin tones. Again, cover the concealer layer with foundation in your natural skin tone."

Consult with a dermatologist about treatment options.,
Discuss over-the-counter treatments with your dermatologist.,
Talk to your dermatologist about treatment options for mild acne scarring.,
Consider resurfacing to treat severe acne.,
Discuss subcutaneous treatments with your dermatologist.",How to Get Rid of Acne Scars Naturally2," Your doctor will determine what type of acne scars you have. The severity of your acne will vary the type of treatment applied. Acne scars can be divided into several types:Hyperpigmentation (darker areas of the skin) is not scarring, but can benefit from the same treatments as acne scarring.
“Ice Pick” scarring are small, pitted scars.
“Box Car” scars are distributed at an angle and look a lot like the scars left by chicken pox. They are shallower pits than the “ice pick” type of scar.
“Rolling” scars represent deeper skin damage. They are wide and shallow and look like “waves” moving across the skin.
Hypertrophic scars (keloids) are a type of scarring that occurs when the skin over-reacts during the healing process. They are raised and lumpy. These scars are most commonly the result of severe, cystic acne.

, Your dermatologist might even suggest an over-the-counter treatment before you ask about them. Over-the-counter treatments for mild acne usually contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acids., Your dermatologist should give you several options, as there are a number of dermatological treatments for light acne scarring. Options include:


Topical treatments: these include topical creams that usually containing retinoids or silicone. These are also very commonly used along with other treatments.
Dermabrasion: removes the top layers of skin and is used for small scars. It is the most common treatment for acne scars.

, Scarring that is severe will take more intensive treatment to heal. Resurfacing may be needed to treat severe acne scarring.


Chemical Peels can be used to remove the topmost layer of skin.
Laser resurfacing and light therapies are high-energy light beams can be used to burn away damaged skin. Raised acne scars can be treated with a pulsed dye laser or an intense pulsed light.
Cryotherapy freezes the scar tissue, which eventually falls off. There is a tendency for the skin to lighten up after cryotherapy.

, Sometimes your doctor will need to treat the acne scarring from beneath the skin. There are a variety of ways your dermatologist may go about this:


Dermal Filler Injections can be used for the “Ice Pick” scars and others. Collagen is injected under the skin to “fill in” the pits.
Punch grafts are small skin grafts. The dermatologist will punch a hole to remove the scar and then replace it with your own skin. Punch grafts are most commonly used to help treat deep acne scars.
Subcutaneous incision, also called subcision. The dermatologist will use a surgical probe to pull apart the skin and scar tissue. This results in the scar flattening and is used for pitted acne scars.
Autologous fat transfer. This procedure fills in any pits by transferring fat from one site in your skin to another and is most commonly used to treat deep, pitted scars.
Injections. A steroid is injected directly into a raised scar. This makes the scar get softer and flatter.

This product may eliminate redness overnight, making it an especially helpful tool for combating redness quickly. It will reduce swelling over the course of a week or so. Sources differ regarding how high a concentration of oil is necessary for effective treatment. Many tea tree oil products are sold in a 5 percent concentration, which has proven effective over time. Consider seeking a 10 percent solution for quicker treatment.Test the tea tree oil on a small patch of skin before use. Tea tree oil can sometimes cause a rash or worsen rosacea. If you find that it is worsening redness, stop use immediately.

Wear hair away from problem areas, avoid tight clothing, and refrain from resting your hands or objects such as telephone receivers on your face., Your body does not produce vitamin E on its own, but it can be absorbed through digestion or through the skin. Its anti-inflammatory properties mean it can reduce redness on your skin. In addition, research suggests vitamin E is expelled from the body through the same substance in your skin that clogs your pores. This means you may naturally clear your pores by consuming vitamin E; the extra vitamin E may push clogs out of your skin.Sunflower seeds, almonds, spinach and other leafy greens, pumpkin, red peppers, mangoes, avocados, swordfish, and peanut butter are all good sources of vitamin E., It also boosts your body's immune system, reducing your body's inflammatory response to the bacteria that cause acne (and thus reducing redness).Cantaloupe, citrus fruits, kiwi, mango, papaya, pineapple, berries, watermelon, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, green and red pepper, spinach and other leafy greens, cabbage, sweet and white potatoes, tomatoes, and winter squash are all good sources of vitamin C."

Grow out your bangs.,
Straighten your hair.,
Use styling products lightly.,
Part your hair in a way that's asymmetric.,
Tussle shorter hair.",How to Have Emo Hair Without Going to Extremes1," A big aspect of emo hair is bangs. Many emo kids have side bangs that are usually swept to one side, slightly covering one part of the face. Bangs are a fairly easy, non-extreme way to obtain emo hair.If you already have bangs, simply let them grow out until they can be swept to the side.
If you don't have bangs, let your hair grow out slightly if necessary. If you have long hair already, you do not need to let it grow. You can have a hairstylist or a friend cut long bangs into your hair, which you can push to one side in an emo style.;
, Emo hair is known for being long and straight. A non-extreme way to adopt the emo style is simply straightening your hair each morning before you go out. You can do so using a flat iron, which you can purchase at most supermarkets or beauty salons. If your hair is on the shorter side, it can still be flattened. In fact, flattening shorter hair can add a bit of length, giving you a more emo look.Choose the correct size flat iron. If your hair is shorter, you can go with a smaller iron. Longer hair requires a bigger flat iron.Heat the iron before use. If your hair is damaged or thin, use a lower heat setting. If your hair is thick, use a higher setting. If your flat iron only has two settings, high and low, start out using a low setting. If your hair does not respond to this, turn to the higher setting.
Clip your hair into sections. Three to four sections is usually enough. With shorter hair, you may be able to get by with only two sections. Slowly run the flat iron over your hair, working your way from the root to the tip. Only go over each section of hair once to avoid damage.
Make sure to straighten your bangs as well. Long, straight bangs are an essential aspect of emo hair.

, If you're going for an emo hairstyle, you can add some styling products. A non-extreme emo hairstyle usually involves straight hair and long bangs, so you do not need a lot of product to maintain this look. A light application of a few styling products, however, can help keep your hair looking straight and emo throughout the day.You can use a light texturizing spray made from natural ingredients to help your hair look smooth and clean. Emo hair is often glossy, so a light spray can help. Texturizing sprays made out of natural ingredients, such as sea salt and lavender, can be particularly helpful for emo hair.
Use a small amount of hairspray to keep your hair in place. Spritz some hairspray over your bangs to make sure they stay straight and to the side throughout the day.

, Emo hair is known for being asymmetric. Oftentimes, a large amount of hair will fall on one side of the face. This is often achieved by having your hair layered by a stylist at a salon.However, if you want a less extreme way to get your hair asymmetric, simply change how you're parting your hair.You can achieve fake layers by combing all your hair over to one side. Half the strands will be pulled over your head, making them look shorter. This can help you encapsulate the emo look without having to see a hairstylist.
You can also experiment with parting your hair very far to one side. You can push excess hair partially over your face. A major aspect of the emo hairstyle is having some hair covering the face.

, If you have shorter hair, you can make it look emo by simply tussling it a little. Making your hair look a little messy can contribute to the asymmetrical appearance of emo hair. You can tussle your hair and push it slightly to one side, creating a somewhat spiked and sloppy look. To get your hair to stay this way throughout the day, use a small bit of hairspray."

Dye your hair black.,
Use another color, if possible.,
Try light highlights.,
See a hairstylist about layering your hair.,
Spike your hair.,
Try a mohawk.",How to Have Emo Hair Without Going to Extremes2," Many people who identify as emo like to dye their hair black as the dark color can indicate a dark, unhappy mood. Black hair can be appropriate for a work or school setting, keeping your hair emo without going to extremes.You can go to a salon to have your hair professionally dyed. If you're unfamiliar with working with hair, this is probably the best option. If a salon is not in your budget, however, you can use store bought hair dyes to dye your hair.
Choose a black store bought hair dye. Before applying, section your hair into four even sections. You'll be dyeing one section at a time. Use hair ties or clips to secure the sections. Only have one section of hair down at a time as you dye.Pour the dye into a small bowl. Use the wands or brushes that came with the hair dye package. Dip the brushes into the dye and gently paint the dye over your hair, working from the root to the tips. You will want your roots slightly darker, so apply more dye to the top of your head. When you're done with a section, clip or tie it up and move on to the next section.
Refer to the package's instructions to see how long to let the dye sit. You can wear a shower cap over your head while you let the dye remain in your hair. Then, wash out your hair.

, Sometimes, people dye their head in brighter, more dramatic colors to convey an emo look. For example, hair may be dyed purple, blue, or red. Combined with other elements of the emo aesthetic, such as long bangs or asymmetrical hair, this can look emo. However, some people feel this is too extreme.


If you're worried about your hair at work or school, review policies ahead of time. If brightly dyed hair is against the rules, you may want to opt for black.
It's a good idea to talk to a stylist before dyeing your hair a brighter color. Brighter colors are harder to get to show up, and you may need to bleach or otherwise treat your hair before adding a color like red or blue.

, Many people who identify as emo add other colors to their hair. They may add bright colored tips or add highlights to their hair in shades like pink, red, and blue.However, if you want non-extreme emo hair, it may be a bad idea to add color. Unusual hair colors may reflect poorly on you at work or school.


If you'd like to add some color, consider adding color to a part of your hair you can conceal. For example, dye a strand of hair that's not easily visible, like a strand of hair buried in the back of your head, in a bright shade. During the day, you can keep the dyed hair hidden. When you're going out socially, you can clip parts of your hair up to show off the dyed bit, or work the dyed bit of hair into a ponytail or braid.
You can also use hair clips in bright colors, which you can purchase at many department stores and beauty shops. These can be clipped into your hair to make it look as if you have bits of your hair dyed bright.

, Layering is a key aspect to many emo hair styles. You can ask your hairstylist to layer the ends of your hair. If that's out of your budget, see if you have a friend who knows how to cut hair. Some light layering can really help you pull off the emo look, and layered hair is rarely a problem at work or school., If you have shorter hair, layering and bangs may be difficult to obtain. Many emo kids have hair that stands up in spikes. Consider spiking your hair to achieve the emo look without having to grow your hair out.In order to spike your hair, you'll need some product. If you have short, thin hair, light mousse or light hold gel will work. If you have thicker hair, you'll need to invest in a pomade or a stronger hair gel.Apply your chosen product and use your hands to work your hair into the right shape. You can run your fingers quickly through your hair, causing it to stand up slightly. Then, shape your hair into spikes as you wish.

, If you have shorter hair, you can cut it into a mohawk. You can shave the hair around one side of your head, or around both sides of your head, creating a line of hair running down the center of your scalp. If you're unsure how to do a shave your head on your own, have your hair done in a salon."

Wash your hair regularly.,
Use protective products after straightening your hair.,
Take precautions with hair dye.",How to Have Emo Hair Without Going to Extremes3," People associated with the emo culture are known to be caring and conscientious about appearance. Therefore, hair should not be messy or dirty. Wash your hair at least a few times a week to keep it clean and smelling fresh., The heat from a flat iron can really dry your hair out. Therefore, you need to use certain protective products before and after using a flat iron.


Wash and dry your hair before using a flat iron. You should also add a small amount of a heat protectant to your hair before you begin the straightening process.After you flatten your hair, mist your hair with a shine spray. This helps your hair look shiny and finished after being dried., If you're going to dye your hair at home, make sure you take certain precautions. Without paying attention to safety, hair dye can cause major damage to your hair.Test dyes on a small patch of skin behind your ear before applying to your hair. Hair dyes can cause allergic reactions, so you should make sure your chosen hair dye does not cause itching, burning, or redness.
Never dye your eyebrows or eyelashes.
Do not mix different types of hair dye.

Add some color to your hairstyle (optional).,
Dye the tips.,
Add streaks.,
Dye a whole section of your hair.,
Dye all of your hair.,
Figure out what might look good on you.",How to Style Scene Hair2," You don't have to dye your hair to make it scene, but it's a fun way to express your style. In this section, you'll see some suggestions on where to add dye to your hair; for information on the process itself, see the Related wikiHows at the bottom of the page.

, Dyeing the tips of your hair along a straight line is called ""dipping"" (because some people actually do dip-dyes). This is a low-risk way to add color to your hair, because if you don't like it, you can always cut it off instead of having to wait for it to grow out. Try doing it in a color that's opposite the rest of your hair (blond tips if you have dark hair, or dark tips if you have light hair), or in a bright color such as blue or purple.

, Select streaks of your hair to dye a color that contrasts with the rest of your hair. You can do streaks in one color, or in several colors, and make them narrow or wide.


If you work or go to school somewhere that doesn't allow you to have dyed hair, streaks might be a good choice. You can place them strategically, so that they won't show up when you put your hair into a ponytail.

, A popular scene look is dyeing an entire section of your hair a different color than the rest of it; for example, making your bangs and front layers blond, and keeping the rest of your hair black. For something a little more subtle, you could dye the underside of your hair a bright color, and keep the rest of it a more natural shade.

, If you want to go all-out, you can dye your entire head of hair a bright color. Note that most unnatural colors are semi-permanent, so you'll have to re-dye regularly to keep the look up.


Black hair is good for any length, on any gender.
Try red, blonde or black if you don't want to be too outstanding.

, Try wearing a shirt that's the same color as what you're interested in. If it seems to go well with your skin tone and eyes, it will probably look good in your hair. If it makes you look washed-out and tired, try something else.

Gather the necessary tools.,
Straighten your hair.,
Tease the top.,
Smooth over teased hair.,
Curl the ends.,
Add accessories (optional).,
Make bouffant hair.",How to Style Scene Hair3," What you need will depend on the natural texture and thickness of your hair. However, here are some items that can be used to create scene hairstyles:


Blow-dryer: Blow out curly or wavy hair to make it mostly straight before flat ironing.
Flat iron: Necessary to achieve the silky-straight look on the bottom of hair, as well as flattened bangs; can also be used to add curl to the ends of hair.
Curling iron or wand: Use it to make bottom strands curly or wavy.
Rat-tail or fine-toothed comb: Use to tease, backcomb or ""rat"" hair for volume on top.
Hairspray: You'll need this to tease your hair, as well as to set the style.
Heat protectant: It's necessary to apply this before blow drying or straightening hair, especially if you do it often.
Root lifter or volumizer: If you have thin hair, you can use this to add a bit of volume. Follow the directions on the bottle.
Dry shampoo: This can help re-volumize dirty or oily hair if you don't have time to wash it.

, Scene hair is centered on sleek, straight locks that can be thinned down or ratted out. Even if you plan on curling the bottom parts of your hair, you probably want to straighten them first, then curl. Here are some things to keep in mind:


If you have curly or wavy hair, blow dry it 10 or 15 minutes after you get out of the shower. Use a round brush or paddle brush to separate sections, and spray on a heat protectant before you start.
After you've blow dried your hair (or if you have mostly straight hair to begin with), spritz on another layer of heat protectant and smooth it out with a flat iron.
Work in sections - if your hair is thick, clip up the top portion and work out the bottom first. (You might have to work in 4 or 5 stages if you have ultra-thick hair. Just start from the bottom and keep moving up in manageable sections.)

, Once your hair is straight, you can focus on teasing the top portions so they'll look volumized and big. Here's how to do it.


Put hairspray on the section you want to tease. Don't totally soak your hair with hairspray - one spritz per area should be enough.
Grab a section of hair, and backcomb it with a rat-tail or fine-toothed comb. Pull the bottom of the section out and away from your hair, so that it's somewhat horizontal. Then, starting at the end, comb backwards toward the scalp in small sections. Do 3 or 4 combs over one part, then move up. Keep doing this for each piece you want to tease.
After you've teased every section you want, set with hairspray.

, Because the hair that you teased is probably sticking straight up by now, you'll want to smooth it back down so that you have the volume without looking crazy. Use a regular comb to gently comb each section downward.

, If you want to curl up the ends of your layers (using a flat iron or curling iron), do it after you're finished teasing. You can flip up the ends of your layers, or even curl the longer sections at the bottom of your hair. Do whatever you think looks good!

, If you want to add bows, bobby pins, headbands or other accessories to your hair, now's the time. A lot of girls like to put a cute bow on the side of their bangs, or use bobby pins to put up random sections of hair.


Look around the internet for ideas on how to use accessories. See if you can find any blogs or Tumblers that feature scene hair.

, Split the hair in parts and clip them up. Put hairspray right on your scalp and then tease each section. Don't fully brush your hair but brush it swiftly and easy. Add more hairspray and you'll be done.

If you want your hair to be bigger, use a crimper on the layers you are teasing, but don't crimp the top layer of your hair. Don't crimp a lot but do remember to tease the back too.

Wash acne-prone areas frequently and gently.,
Consider other cleansing options.,
Know the most important acne-fighting tips and tricks.,
Limit the amount of products you use.",How to Get Rid of Acne Quickly and Cheaply1," Using a gentle, non-soap cleanser twice a day is likely the most powerful weapon in the battle against acne. Another key tip: don’t be overzealous. Wash consistently, but without scrubbing, as this can actually make acne worse.Favor a cleanser that dissolves during washing, as these are less abrasive.
Avoid cleansers with something ground up in them (like fruit pits or plastic), as well as cleansers that contain aluminum oxide. Use a cleanser that is made specifically for your face.
Avoid messing with blemishes. Picking at or squeezing blemishes will likely result in acne-worsening infections and may even lead to scars.
Wash stuff that touches your face. Wash your hair, keep your hands clean by washing them whenever you’re in the bathroom or kitchen, wipe your cell phone with an alcohol pad, and wash any beauty products regularly.;
, There are a handful of different options for non-medicated cleansing.Use cleansing towelettes. Even within the realm of mini cleansing cloths, you have several options. Use open-weave cloths for dry, sensitive skin. Use tightly-woven cloths for removing dead skin cells.
Try pore-cleaning adhesive strips. There are skincare products designed to physically remove dirt, oil, and plugs from your pores. Apply while your skin is wet, let it dry, and gently remove the strip.

, The lower-strength-first rule holds more often than not, you’re going to want to switch things up, it may be worth moisturizing, and there's a few products to avoid.With all acne products, less is more. Whenever there’s an option, go with a lower-strength version first. This will minimize side effects like redness and dry skin. You can always adjust the frequency of your use of the product instead of blasting your skin with potentially irritating chemicals.
Use a water-based, oil-free moisturizer. If dead skin is the likely culprit for clogging your pores, moisturizer can be effective in diminishing acne by alleviating dry skin. Use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen during the day to protect your skin from sun damage.
Keep in mind that many acne products tend to dry or irritate the skin, so a good moisturizer can help reduce these side-effects.
Don’t use oily skin or hair products. Only use cosmetics, sunscreens, and hair products that are water-based and noncomedogenic.

, Whatever you use, don't use too much. Only use enough of whatever you’re using to do the job. After washing, apply only enough acne product to cover the affected area.A pea sized amount is usually enough.


Note that some cleaning options (such as some towelettes) come with benzoyl peroxide and other active ingredients in them. If you’re using these, don’t apply more of the same acne products after cleansing.
Vary the use of products with different active ingredients. If you have especially frustrating bouts of acne, try one product in the morning and a different one at night. You will likely see improved results as well as less skin irritation.

Pay attention to damage control.,
Use a quality shampoo and conditioner.,
Deep condition your hair once a week.,
Always use a heat protectant when you blow dry or straighten your hair.,
Trim up split ends.,
Wash hair regularly.",How to Style Scene Hair4," Dying, straightening and teasing can all cause harsh damage to your hair. In order to keep your scene hair looking stylish and healthy, make sure you take steps to care for it.

, Try to find products that are meant for your type of hair (such as oily hair, thick hair, curly hair, and so on).


If you've dyed your hair, buy shampoo that's specifically meant for color-treated locks. It will help your dye job last longer.
Also, if you have dyed hair, wash it in water that's as cold as you can stand. Hot water will make your dye fade out faster, as well as making the shade slightly off.
If possible, try to find shampoo that doesn't contain sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate. These compounds are alcohols that dry out your hair.

, Schedule a deep conditioning treatment for your hair on the same day every week. Browse around for one that suits your hair type and budget. If you need something simple to start with (and you live in North America), try Aussie 3-Minute Miracle.

, Find a product you like, and use it religiously whenever you apply heat to your hair. Your ends will thank you for it.

, The only way to get rid of split ends is to cut them off. If you notice your ends starting to fray, book an appointment with your stylist or trim them yourself. Either way, make sure the cut is high enough to remove all of the damaged hair.

, You're probably going to use a lot of styling product if you want to have scene hair, and it's important to wash it out. Every other day or every third day should be sufficient.

Use benzoyl peroxide first.,
Try a product with salicylic acid.,
Consider a product with retinol or sulfur.",How to Get Rid of Acne Quickly and Cheaply2," If you want to try an acne product, start with one that contains benzoyl peroxide as an active ingredient. This ingredient kills the bacteria that cause acne, helps remove excess oil and dead skin cells, and is comfortably tolerated by most people’s skin.It will take a few days before benzoyl peroxide achieves its full acne-preventing power. If you have more moderate acne, then it can take at least a few weeks to see significant results.
Start with a low-percentage option. Stronger is not necessarily better. A 2.5% product may even work better than those with higher strengths, and will cause fewer side effects.
Beware of side effects including dry skin, scaling, redness, burning and stinging.Benzoyl peroxide can also bleach towels, sheets, pillow cases, and clothing, so be careful when using this product.

, Salicylic acid is especially helpful in preventing pores from becoming clogged. You can get over-the-counter products made with various percentages of salicylic acid. Remember, less is more!,Use salicylic acid-based products daily to see quick results.
Possible side effects of salicylic acid use include skin irritation and stinging.
Dryness and flakiness following your first few applications should eventually diminish.

, Retinol is a form of vitamin A, which dries the skin and can help clear your pores. Though it may be harsh for some people, it may be worth a try. Alternatively, sulfur helps remove dead skin cells and diminishes excess oil (while admittedly a bit overly-aromatic).Since retinol can be particularly harsh on your skin, take care to apply minimal amounts.
Apply ample amounts of a water-based moisturizer when using retinol.Sulfur is usually included as an additive in acne medications that also include benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, giving you two acne-fighting agents in one product.
Apply retinol at night, as it increases sensitivity to sunlight

"

Use tea tree oil.,
Consider using products that include naturally-occurring acids.,
Look into natural acne treatment options.",How to Get Rid of Acne Quickly and Cheaply3," Of all the natural products marketed towards helping you combat acne, naturally anti-bacterial tea tree oil may be the most effective. It may even be as effective as benzoyl peroxide for some people.,Though it may work more slowly to actually prevent acne, it can help reduce inflammation and redness associated with acne overnight.
Use a gel containing 5% tea tree oil topically every day.
Be wary if you have rosacea, as tea tree oil may worsen your symptoms.
Allow tea tree oil to soak into your skin for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing it off.

, Alpha hydroxy acids (including glycolic acid and lactic acid) and azelaic acid can help remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and reduce inflammation associated with acne.,Alpha hydroxy acids will also help new, healthy skin grow.
Beware of the side effects of using hydroxyl acid, which include sensitivity to sunlight, redness of your skin, and mild stinging.
Azelaic acid has antibacterial properties, and has been shown to be equally as effective as conventional acne treatments when used correctly – though, again, it takes a bit longer to work. Azelaic acid may also be helpful in reducing redness associated with acne and rosacea.
Use a 20% azelaic acid cream twice a day for at least four weeks.
Prescription azelaic acid medications are great options to fight acne during pregnancy and while breast-feeding.

, There are a few natural options that may seem odd, but may also help you combat acne quickly and cheaply. Consider each of the following:,Toothpaste. Silica in toothpaste will reduce the size of pimples by drying them out overnight. Use a natural toothpaste to avoid potentially irritating ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate.
Ice cubes. Ice can be used to reduce inflammation by rubbing a small cube on the affected area. Stop if your skin begins to go numb.
Aloe vera. Especially in conjunction with conventional acne treatment, a 50% aloe vera gel can greatly assist in your battle against acne. As a nutrient and vitamin rich moisturizer, it will help your skin heal, recover, and generally look and feel more healthy!
Coconut oil. Another natural moisturizer, coconut oil is also known for skin healing properties. Spread a teaspoon of coconut oil over the affected area, and allow it to soak in for half an hour or so before washing it off.
Aspirin tablets. Crush up an aspirin tab and mix it into warm water. Use a Q-tip to apply the paste to individual pimples. Allow the paste to dry and wash it off with warm water. This will make pimples less noticeable, and is a great option to reduce the appearance of acne overnight.Zinc. Lotions and creams that contain zinc may be more effective in helping to reduce acne breakouts.
Green tea extract. Use a lotion with 2% green tea extract to reduce mild to moderate acne.
Bovine cartilage. Get a cream containing 5% bovine cartilage and apply it twice a day.
Brewer's yeast. There’s a specific strain of brewer's yeast – CBS 5926 – that may reduce your acne. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use.

, Search online or in magazines for haircuts you like. If you find one you want to imitate, take a copy of the photo with you when you go in for your haircut.

, For super-sharp, straight edges on the ends of your hair, ask your stylist to use a razor comb.

, A lot of emo hairstyles feature hair that's teased and thick on top, but thin and straight on the bottom. It will be easier for you to achieve this if you ask your stylist to thin out the bottom 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) of your hair.

, Remember that you can always cut more hair off later, but growing it back takes awhile. If you're not sure about what kind of length you want, stay a bit longer than you think you might want. You can trim it up more next time.

, Keep your haircut looking sharp and fresh by staying on top of ragged ends. Go in for a trim every 6 to 8 weeks, or touch it up yourself. If you razor trim your ends at home, use a straight razor and work with dry hair.

, Typically emo hair colors include jet black, bleached blonde, or neon streaks running through dark hair. Look around for inspiration, and settle on something you like.

, If you want to dye your hair by yourself in the future, pay close attention to the stylist's method and ask questions about the process.

,, You can use these to experiment with different colors before committing to dye your hair.

, A standard emo look requires the top or back of your hair to be teased out, while the bottom strands are sleek and straight. Tease your hair by grabbing a section that lays on top, applying hairspray, and using a rat-tail or fine-toothed comb to backcomb the hair (moving the comb ""against' the grain and toward your scalp, not the ends of your hair). Backcomb as many times as necessary, then move on to the next section.

, Spray the foam along the root of your hair in 1 or 2-inch sections, working from bottom to top. Muss it through the top of your hair, and let it sit for a minute. Then try backcombing as normal.

, Straightening your hair can help it look sleek and flat where you want it to (like on your bangs or the bottom of your hair). If you have thick, curly hair, you'll need a higher-quality straightener (like the ones sold at hair salons that run around $100 USD). If you have thinner hair that tends to be wavy or straight, you can get away with a less expensive straightener sold at a good quality hair store.

, This helps minimize the damage caused by the heat.

, If you have a lot of hair, clip up the top sections so that you have a manageable amount to work with. Once that's straightened, unclip another section. Keep going in that way until you've worked through all your hair.

, Dying, backcombing and straightening your hair can all be harsh on your hair. Here are a few ways to lessen the damage.

, (It will be greasy at first, but just spray the roots with a dry shampoo and go over your hair with a blowdryer set to cool).

, If your hair is dyed, purchase a shampoo and conditioner set that's specifically formulated for colored hair. In general, though, seek out products that don't contain sodium laureth sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate - these are alcohols that make shampoo foamy when you lather, but they can damage your hair. (If you buy new shampoo that doesn't foam up, don't worry - it's still cleaning your hair.)


Although excessive use of sulfate-containing shampoos can dry the hair (causing frizz and brittleness), they are good for cleansing excessive products from the hair. When hair-products build up, the hair tends to get difficult to manage (clumping, lying flat, sticking up abnormally, tangling, etc). This is the result of silicones and other ingredients causing the hair to hold in positions you don't want, as a result of sleeping on it. Sulfates are the only common shampoo ingredient capable of efficiently removing silicones and other styling products from the hair, and as such are useful when your hair seems to be suffering from buildup. Just make sure to use a good conditioner after using a harsh shampoo.
Consider giving your hair a break once or twice a week. When possible, try to give your hair a ""day off"" every so often, during which you don't style it with heat or backcombing. Tie it up in a ponytail, or wear a hat over it instead.

If more than one section is being dyed, choose one section to dye at a time. Curly hair will need to be straightened to makes the dying process easier. You should also try to ensure that the section of hair you have chosen is of a consistent length, and that the section falls together.; sections that do not fall together will not give you the desired effect when dyed.;
, Prepare pieces of scotch tape between 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) long, depending on the thickness of your chosen strand, and wrap it around that section of hair. Rubber bands and baby oil also work.

Although scrunched, air-dried hair works well, you might want to blow dry if you're in a hurry. You must have a diffuser if you do not want a cloud of frizz. While blow drying, place a section of hair in the bowl and press the bowl to your head. Then turn on the ""warm"" setting of your blow dryer. Press the cool shot if your head gets too hot. Make sure to turn off the air before you take it away from your head as well. Blow drying like this minimizes frizz.

, Some scene hairstyles have even bangs that go across the forehead, but if you have curly hair, you want ""side tapering bangs"". When your hair is curly, pin your bangs to the side with a bow, a butterfly clip, or some other clip.








, This will add more flair to your hairstyle.








, Think of a cute color that would compliment your skin tone.








, Red, blue, purple, yellow, orange, etc. Get creative with that. If you have dark hair and don't want to bleach it, look into colored hair extensions.








, It's cute and not very expensive to buy plain hair things and decorate them with random objects. Get creative! Go into the fabrics/craft section of a store and add things like buttons, zipper pulls, ribbons, etc.








, When getting your hair cut, be careful. Take it slow. Maybe start off with some layers, if that works out, then go back and get some more cuts and colors. Take it slow until you love it.








, This way you won't have to style or damage it at all. Streak it, put it in a ponytail, and clip back your bangs.

Trim your hair regularly.",How to Get Emo Bangs," Emo bangs are usually pretty long to begin with, but you want your hair to be a few inches longer than you want it to be. This will make it easier for you to cut your bangs. Remember, you can always cut your bangs shorter, but you can't add hair back if they are too short.


As a general rule, your bangs should be longer than your nose, but no longer than your jawline.;
, It is okay if you just washed it, but your hair needs to be perfectly dry when you cut it. This is because hair is longer while it is wet, and you don't want to cut too much off by accident.

, Emo bangs are straight, so if you have curly or wavy hair, you will have to straighten it to get the right look. This will ensure that you cut the right length. Curly hair, after all, becomes longer when you straighten it., Emo bangs are usually swept either to the left or the right side of the face. If your hair has a center part, you will need part your hair in the direction you want your emo bangs to go, and secure it with some bobby pins. Keep this up for a few weeks until your hair starts naturally falling to the left or right.

, Cutting your hair changes the way it falls, so the strands catch the light differently. You will also end up using less dye if you cut your hair first, because you will have less hair to work with., This way, you won't have to reach far in order to get what you need. Here's a list of what you should have ready:


Rat-tail comb
Hair shears
2 or more hair clips
Spray bottle filled with water
Razor (optional)

, If you have short hair, you can use bobby pins or hair clips. May sure that you do not have too much hair in your bang area; emo bangs look better when they are thinner.


Most emo hair does not have a part. All the hair, including the bangs, tend to come from one point on the hair, either on the far left or the far right. Keep this in mind when pulling your bangs forward.

, If you have very thick hair, you probably don't need to do this. If you have thinner hair, you might want to consider this. If you choose to separate your hair, clip the top layer back. Follow the rest of the steps for bottom layer, then repeat them for the top.

, You will be cutting your bangs at an angle towards the other side of your face.

, Start at the roots and slowly bring the comb down towards your fingers. You want all of the hairs from that segment to lay smoothly.

, Try to cut in an upwards motion, but be careful not to nick your own fingers. Don't worry if the cut looks jagged. Emo style bangs are supposed to have a jagged, feathery look to them.

, Be sure to measure this new segment against the one you just cut. Cut the hair on the new segment just below your fingers, using that same upward motion.

, Do this until you each the other end of your bangs. Be sure to work in small sections.

, If you want, you can use a razor to thin our your hair, or to give it a feathered look. Simply run the razor down your hair, starting close to the roots and working your way down towards the end. You can use a razor comb or a fresh, clean shaving razor.

, Unclip the upper layer of your bangs. Measure them against the bottom layer, and cut them in small segments using that same, upward cutting motion. Make the upper layer about 1/8 inch shorter than the bottom layer.

, As your hair continues to grow, your natural roots will begin to show. This can actually make your bangs look more punkish or emo. If you don't want your roots to show, you will need to re-touch your dye job. This can be a big commitment.

, Dyeing hair by yourself can be tricky, especially if you have never done it before. Bleaching your hair can be even trickier, and you will need to do it if you have very dark hair and want a lighter or brighter color in it.

, This will allow you to determine how much time your hair will need to get the look you want. Everyone's hair is different after all. Simply snip off about an inch of hair from an out of sight area (like the back of your neck) and coat the hair with about a teaspoon of bleach of dye. Leave it on for the time specified, then rinse it off., If you want to dye your hair something bright, like pink or purple, you probably won't need to bleach your hair. However, you might still want to do a test strand first. Blond hair has yellow undertones. This means that some colors might end up different after you put them in your hair. For example, bright pink might end up looking more orange, and bright blue might look a little greenish.If you have light hair and want to dye it black, go for a soft black or a natural black. A blue black will appear too dark against your naturally fair skin tone.

, If you have very dark hair and want to go with a lighter or brighter color (such as blond, blue, or purple), you will need to bleach your hair first. If you don't, the colors may appear dull or not show up at all. If you want to go darker, however, you should have no problems.

, Dyeing bangs can get messy. Working in a bathroom will make cleaning up a lot easier.

, Once you start dyeing your hair, it will be difficult to move about. Make sure that everything you need is on the bathroom counter and within reach. Here's a list of what you will need:


Old t-shirt
Old towel
Plastic gloves
Shower cap (optional)
Tint brush
Tin foil (optional, for streaking)
Hair bleach (optional)
Hair dye

, Even if you are careful, there's still a chance that a drop of dye might land some place it shouldn't. Put on an old t-shirt and drape an old towel across your chest and shoulders. Put on a pair of plastic gloves; they usually come with hair dye kits.

, If you are not going to clean your hair, the skip down to here. Here are some guidelines as to what volume you should used based on your natural hair color:If you have blonde, dry, or very damaged hair, use a 20 volume.
If you have a medium brown to a blond hair, or somewhat damaged hair, use a 30 volume.
If you have dark brown to black hair, use a 40 volume.

, You can bleach all of your bangs or just the tips. Start applying the bleach ¼ to ½ inch away from your scalp; if you apply it any closer, you might burn your scalp.If you want to do streaks, pick up a segment that you want streaked and apply the bleach to it with a brush. Wrap some tinfoil around the segment, then move on to the next.

, Check back on your hair every 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Over mixing a solution that is too strong for your hair, and never leave it in longer than the time specified. Doing so can burn your scalp or fry your hair. If you bleached your hair, and it is not light enough, wait at least one day before bleaching it again.If you have blond hair, wait 15 to 30 minutes. The darker it is, the longer you will have to wait.
If you have light brown hair, wait 25 to 35 minutes.
If you have medium brown hair, wait 30 to 45 minutes.
If you have dark brown or black hair, wait 45 to 60 minutes.

, Carefully lean over the sink and rinse all the bleach out using cool water. If you want to do this in the shower, then tilt your head back. Be careful not to get any of the bleach water into your eyes. You may also want to wear some plastic gloves while doing this.

, Most emo bangs will be black, but you can color it another color (such as red, blond, or brown) or leave your hair its natural color. You can even add brightly-colored streaks to it.

, Even if you are very careful, there is still a chance that you might get some hair dye on your skin. The Vaseline will help keep your skin from getting stained.

, Usually, you will need to mix the color into the activated cream.

, You can color all of your bangs, or just the tips. If you want to do streaks, pick up a segment that you want streaked and brush the dye onto it. Wrap tinfoil around the segment, and move onto the next.

, You don't have to do this, but it will help keep the dye moist. It will also help trap the heat from your head, and make the dye more effective.

, For most dyes, this will be about 20 minutes. Carefully lean over the sink and rinse the dye out using cool water. If you want to do this in the shower, then tilt your head back. You may want to leave the gloves on for this step, just in case any of the dye stains your hands.

, You can style your hair however you want, but the traditional emo style has a specific look to it. This section will give you a few tips on how to get that look. You don't have to use all of the ideas in this section., If your hair is not already straight, you might want to straighten it, especially your bangs. Be sure to spray your hair with a heat protective spray before you take a flat iron to it. If you don't, the heat will damage your hair and make it look frizzy.


If you have curly or wavy hair, consider straightening just your bangs and leaving the rest of your hair natural.

, Even though they are straight, emo bangs also have volume. Use a round brush to blow dry your bangs upwards, or use a styling mousse to give it some extra fluff. Take a 1 to 2 inch wide segment of hair from the top layer, and pull it upwards. Mist it with some hairspray, and then backcomb it. Keep doing this until you have teased all the hair in the top layer. Gently smooth the upper layer down and mist it with some more hairspray., If you want to keep your bangs in place or give them some texture, use a little bit of hair gel or styling wax towards the ends. If you want to give your bangs some volume, as a little bit of mousse at the roots. Avoid applying too much styling product all at once. You will either weigh your hair down or keep it from moving naturally., It should be covering at least of one eye as well. The idea behind this is that your bangs are shielding you from the world around you.

, Even though emo hair has a jagged cut to it, it is not messy. Use heat protecting sprays when your straighten it. If it gets dull, add a tiny amount of oil (such as hair oil, argan oil, or coconut oil) to make it smooth and glossy again.

, Use a razor to trim it when it gets too long; this will help keep that feathery, textured look.

Use a spot herbal treatment.,
Make an herbal mask.,

The following herbal astringents can be used to dry individual pimples:


Black or Green teaLemon juice
Chamomile teaYarrow tea
Sage tea
Apple cider vinegar, Facial masks can help clean, tighten, and heal the skin and minimize pimples. Astringent herbs tighten or tone the skin while the antibacterial herbs help kill off bacteria.

, Understand the basics of scene haircuts and which elements create what kind of look. Scene hair means short, choppy layers but different techniques create different looks so it’s important to know terminology, especially if you’re trying to convey to a professional the kind of look you’re going for.Fringe: the trademark side-swept bangs common for scene haircuts.
Razored: a razor edge is used to skim hair off of your ends by thinning out the strands. It makes the end result appear more messy and lived-in.
Choppy: purposely uneven layers that contrasts the typical straight, bluntly cut layered hairstyle.
”Asian Mullet”: commonly used refer to scene hair. It is a cut divided into two parts where the top of the hair is choppy, short layers and the bottom of the haircut is left long. Be sure to include the length you’d like your layers and the bottom so that you aren’t literally left rocking a mullet.
Teased: sections of your hair are backcombed to create big volume. It is another element of scene hair.

, Don’t be afraid to look at his/her portfolio and to describe in depth the kind of haircut that you want. It is important to be vocal and as descriptive as possible. Use your research, photo references, and previously mentioned terminology to ensure that you are getting your ideal scene hair cut by the stylist.


If you have curly hair, decide whether or not you want to use a straightener everyday to maintain your scene look. If not, make sure that whatever length you decide on works for both curly and straightened hair – that way the length you want isn’t contingent upon daily heat application.

, This is optional, but as we talk about colors, is an important suggestion to offer. Bleaching the hair provides a clean slate for colors and dyes to show up in their brightest hues possible. This should of course be done by a professional if possible to decrease likelihood of hair damage.

, This is a two-step process consisting of: 1) which colors you want your hair to be and 2) what hair sections you want as these colors. Bright, edgy colors typically associated with scene hair include pink, blue, and purple., This gives room for mistakes and allows you to learn what colors you like for your cut and style. It is also less harsh on your hair than permanent dyes so it promotes less damage to you hair. Once you’ve decided on something permanent, go to a colorist to achieve a more permanent version of your look in the least damaging way possible.


You can have the entirety of your hair one color, have the lower section a different color than the upper section, or you can have single strand highlights. Get creative!
Popular scene hair colors for the main section of your hair include bleach blonde and dark brown/black but whatever color you like best is fine.
You can also keep your entire hair your natural color if that is more to your liking.
Natural-colored hair dyes can easily be purchased at grocery stores, while other colors may require you to go to specialty shops. You can always have your hair colored at a salon as well.

, Follow the movement of your layers to act as a guide to applying the dye. If you’re at home and using packaged dye, follow the instructions and timing correctly to ensure your best color result.


Apply petroleum jelly on your hairline, around your ears, and at the base of your neck to keep dye off of your skin.
Wear protective gloves to further prevent staining your skin.
Prevent staining by using a towel over your shoulders.
Do not wash your hair the day of dyeing your hair, to help your scalp keep its oils and its moisture.
Use a water bottle to dampen your hair and promote even coloring.

, Scene styles often require straightening and a great deal of products such as hairspray but this is not healthy for your hair. Straightening can fry your hair, making it weak and prone to breaking. Products such as hairspray and gel are similarly damaging to your hair, as well as the dyes commonly used for scene hairstyles.


Make sure that you regularly condition you hair.
As an extra measure to revitalize your strands, consider deep conditioning your hair once weekly as well.
You can use normal conditioner in the shower but it is also possible to purchase products like hair serums, which can be much more effective and are usually placed after washing but before drying (much like gel).
How often this is required will vary for each person. You may need to condition every day, every other day, once a week, etc. You may need to experiment to find what is best for you.

, If you decided to dye your hair as well, you will want to be sure that you use the correct shampoos for dyed hair and that you re-color your hair as necessary.


How often this needs to be done will vary by person, similar to conditioning of the hair.
If your hair is similar in color to how it was dyed, then you may need to touch up the color less often than if there is a noticeable color difference.

, Colorful extensions can be purchased and placed to give your a hair a multicolored look. These can be woven into your hair or function like clips, hidden by the layering. It depends largely on how nice you want them to look, how permanent you want them to be, and how much money you want to spend.


Woven extensions are usually placed by a hair stylist and cost more money. They are also more of a long-term commitment. Clip on extensions, however, are cheaper and can be switched out whenever you want.
Popular colors for the highlights and extensions include pink, green, blue, and bleach blonde.

, These can be used to give your hair volume and shape. Purchased easily at a grocery or drugstore, there are a large number of different types that are used in different ways. Be sure to check the instructions and labeling to be sure that you are buying the appropriate type for your hair and needs.Hairspray is used after your hair has dried and is sprayed in as you move your hair into the shape you would like it to be. This is good for adding just a little volume. You can also purchase special hairsprays which contain things like glitter, to really step it up.
Gels come in many types but are usually best put in when your hair is wet. This will help the product distribute evenly and avoid that greasy look. Once you’ve got the product in your hair, you can style it however you'd like, usually by blow drying it into the shape you'd prefer.

, Clips, ribbons and other additions can be easily purchased at stores or made yourself at home. Headbands in bright colors look particularly good with scene hairstyles and tiaras are another popular accessory. Additions such as these are a great way to emphasize your personal style.

, Have all of the necessary combs, brushes, clips, razors and scissors nearby. This will save you the trouble of having to reach or look for them while you are trying to cut your hair. Setting them out on a table near where you will be working will significantly help.The better the quality of tools, the better the final product. Hair scissors, specifically, work much better than normal scissors for cutting hair because they are made with sharper blades. Purchase these at local beauty supply stores.
Be sure the razor you are using is sharp and fresh. This will make it easier to cut your hair and reduce the likelihood of damaging it in the process. Be careful of cutting yourself.

, Try to have multiple mirrors so that you can see your head from many different angles. This will help you reach the areas you can't normally see.


Position a mirror in front of you, as well as one or two angled toward your side, if you have more than one large mirror.
A hand mirror or additional large mirror can be placed behind you in order to view the back.
Alternatively, make sure a broom and dustpan are available. A vacuum will pick up the hair great also.

, Cutting hair is messy. Cover yourself, if you want to, to keep your clothes clean. You can use a bathrobe, a bed sheet, a towel, or any other cover as you see fit. You may also wish to cut your hair in a bathroom or kitchen, which will be easier to clean when you are done.

, Using a comb, separate your upper layers of hair from your lower layers, around the level of your ears. Tie this hair up and away, so that you can more easily access the lower layers. You may also wish to divide the lower section of hair into three parts: left, right, and back.Large clips can be used to keep the mass of your hair on top of your head and away from the areas you are cutting. This will help ensure that you do not accidentally cut the upper layers while you are working on the lower layers.

, Using scissors, cut your hair to the intended length of the longest layer. Removing this hair will ensure that you don't waste time layering hair that you don't intend to keep!


Start by taking a small section of hair towards the front and comb through to make sure it is smooth, then place and hold it between your pointer and index fingers, to the place you want to cut.
It is easiest to start higher, then bring your fingers down to the desired length, keeping the hair smooth. Then cut the section.
Take a second section next to the first, as well as a small portion of the cut section, and cut the new section so that it is even with the previous one.
Continue cutting your hair until you have removed the excess from the entire layer. Divide your hair again if necessary.

, Practice on mannequin first if possible! Use your razor to thin and cut your hair. Thinning with this technique will leave the layers of your hair with many different sub-layers. This will help create the “scene” look.Take small sections of your hair and twist this small section into a single strand.
Take a razor and run it down the strand of hair, thinning and cutting it.
The more you do this, the thinner your hair will be. This not only creates layers but also helps existing layers to blend better.Make sure to go slowly and run the razor several times, to avoid cutting the hair too bluntly or too much. Do not press the razor too hard, you just want to press lightly.
Continue twisting and thinning until the lower layers are even along the bottom and at the desired thickness.

, Thin the next layer of hair to the desired thickness and length. This section should be shorter than the layer below it.


Release the upper layers of hair and resection and tie them if you wish to have three or more layers.
Continue to thin and cut it in the same manner as the previous layer.
Be careful not to accidentally cut the lower layers while working on the upper layers.
Continue to a third or fourth layer if you wish to. These layers should be the shortest and also contain less hair than in the previous sections.

, Make sure you cut all areas and that your hair looks even. Cut anything you may have missed until you are happy with how it looks.This is when having access to multiple mirrors will be most useful."

Understand that drugs and anti-scarring treatment make cystic acne much more manageable than before.,
Make an appointment with your dermatologist today to discuss cystic acne.",How to Get Rid of Acne Cysts Fast1," Cystic acne affects tissue that is deeper down than its more superficial counterpart, common acne. Cystic acne is a type of abscess that occurs when oil ducts get infected, usually under the skin.For this reason, cystic pimples usually appear further underneath the surface than common pimples.;
, Scarring is more common in cystic acne, doctors say, because of the collagen-damaging infection of deep tissue.Cystic acne scars come in three basic forms:


Atrophic scars, sunken but mostly shallow, which can be effectively treated.Boxcar-shaped scars, which are harder to treat.
Ice pick-shaped scars, which are narrow and deep.

, Although dermatologists and doctors alike warn against popping common pimples, many whiteheads and blackheads can be effectively popped, even if increases the chance of infection and worsens the inflammation. Cystic acne, on the other hand, cannot be effectively popped because it's further underneath the skin.

Have your doctor or dermatologist drain the cyst using a scalpel or needle.This will not remove the cyst, but can reduce the swelling if the cyst is pus-filled.

, In some cases your doctor or dermatologist may recommend removing the cyst. This is typically done if the cyst is large and is accompanied by painful symptoms.Cysts can be removed surgically or through laser treatment.

Make a honey mask.,
Give yourself a tomato facial.,
Rub your face with a potato.,
Try using a strawberry.,
Crush up some garlic.,
Make a mint mask.,
Put on an egg white mask.",How to Get Rid of Acne Fast2," A natural antibacterial agent, honey works to clear clogged pores and lift off excess oil and dead skin. Coat your whole face in honey and leave it for as long as you can before rinsing off. Additionally, dab honey directly on your pimples and cover with a bandage while you sleep overnight. By morning, your zit should have significantly reduced in size and redness.

, Strange, right? But tomatoes actually do help to clear up acne-prone skin. Blend up a tomato to create a thick, pulpy juice. Spread this smoothie-like mixture onto your entire face and allow it to soak into your pores. Wash it off after 20-30 minutes.

, It’s not a joke, really. Potatoes will help to soak up excess oil while clearing up grime-filled pores. Slice a potato into wide pieces which can be rubbed onto your face. After a minute or two of this, wash off the juice with warm water.

, Go green and use every part of the strawberry - eat the fruit and save the top for your skin. Strawberries will lighten your acne and help kill bacteria. Rub the top of the fruit over your skin where you’re breaking out, holding it on particularly bad areas for up to a minute. Splash your face with cool water when you’re finished to remove the juice.

, It may have a strong smell, but garlic is one of the best natural skin remedies for acne. It is a natural antiseptic, quickly killing off bacteria in your skin. Mince up a clove of garlic into a paste, and apply it to your acne for 20 minutes. Rinse off with cool water afterwards, and be amazed at how quickly your skin will transform. However, be warned that this can be very painful and might leave a burning sensation for a few days. It can also make your eyes water and might elevate/bloat your skin and make it red.

, Not only does mint smell and taste great, it does great things for your skin as well. Grind up a few mint leaves to form a paste. Spread this over your acne and allow it to soak for 15-20 minutes. The mint will soothe and cool your face while working to clean out your pores. Rinse it off with cool water afterwards.

, If you’ve ever gotten raw egg whites on your skin, you’ll notice the tightening effect they have. Dab some egg whites onto your pimples and leave it overnight. By the morning your pores should be closed up and your acne reduced. Rinse off the mask with warm water.

Apply aloe vera.,
Make a baking soda paste.,
Apply a clay mask.,
Use a bit of toothpaste.,
Try using Listerine.,
Make an aspirin mask.",How to Get Rid of Acne Fast3," There’s a reason aloe vera gel is applied to sunburns - it soothes and takes away pain while preventing infection. Do the same for your acne by dabbing on some fresh aloe vera from the plant (or from a bottle of the pure stuff). Leave it on as long as you can or overnight, and rinse off with cold water afterwards.

, If you’ve ever cleaned your home with baking soda, you know the wonders it can do in killing bacteria and brightening surfaces. Mix baking soda with enough water to form a paste, and dab it onto your acne. Leave it be until it has dried and begins to flake off, after 20-30 minutes. Rinse off with warm water (scrub gently to use the exfoliating powers of the powder as well).

, Clay is a natural way to dry out your skin, removing the excess oil that is the source of most acne. Make your own clay mask out of powdered cosmetic clay and water or purchase one from the store. You can leave it on your pimples only or cover your entire face. Allow it to dry completely (around 20-30 minutes) before rinsing off with warm water.








, The whitening toothpaste you use isn’t just great for your smile, but for your skin as well. The chemicals present will dry out your acne while the whitening agents will work to reduce redness. Dab a bit of (white, not clear gel) toothpaste onto any pimple and leave it overnight. Rinse off after a few hours or in the morning.








, For the same reason toothpaste works so great, so does Listerine. Grab a cotton ball and pour it on, dabbing it onto your acne. Leave it on for as long as you are able before washing off with warm water. Your skin should feel tight and smooth afterwards as well.

, Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory as well as a pain reliever. Use both of these to the benefit of your skin by turning an aspirin tablet into a face mask. Grind up 1-2 pills and add just a bit of water. Dab this mixture onto your pimples and leave it to dry. Rinse off after a few hours (or overnight) with warm water.

Talk to your doctor about antibiotics for treating cystic acne.,
Talk to your doctor about hormonal treatments (for females only).,
Talk to your doctor about topical retinoids.,
Talk to your doctor about systemic (oral) retinoids.,
Talk to your doctor about laser therapy.",How to Get Rid of Acne Cysts Fast2," For a long period of time, cystic acne was treated effectively with antibiotics. Now, most likely due to overuse, bacteria have formed a resistance to antibiotics, limiting its standalone effectiveness.Antibiotics used to treating cystic acne are either tetracyclines or erythromycins.The most common antibiotics available by prescription are:
Tetracycline
Doxycycline
Minocycline


Talk to your doctor about possible side-effects. Side-effects of antibiotics include photosensitivity, possible liver damage, and complications with pregnancy., Like it or not, acne is effected by our body's hormones.That's why many doctors prescribe the birth control pill or anti-androgen medications to stem outbreaks.Talk to your doctor about anti-androgen medications that may limit the severity of your cystic acne.


Understand the possible side-effects. Side-effects include irregular menstrual cycle, fatigue, dizziness, and breast tenderness., Topical retinoids unplug clogged pores, allowing other medications to come in and fight the acne-causing bacteria.Topical retinoids are usually reserved for moderate to severe acne, for which other methods of treatment have not worked.


Topical retinoids include:
Adapalene.
Tazarotene. Not recommended for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.Tretinoin. Is more effective if starting with a lower dose, and then ramping up.Topical retinoids may initially make your acne worse before it gets better. Redness, dryness, and peeling appear in many cases, along with increased cystic severity in some, before getting better after several weeks to a month.Talk to your doctor about possible side-effects. Side effects include photosensitivity, dryness, redness, and peeling of skin.

, Systemic retinoids, such as isotretinoin (also called Accutane), are extremely effective in treating cystic acne.Taken orally, usually for a period of six months to a year, isotretinoin can dramatically reduce the incidence and visibility of cystic acne, and in many cases, produce prolonged remission. In some cases, isotretinoin is looked at as the closest thing to an acne ""cure"" as dermatology will get.Still, isotretinoin comes with some very serious side effects. These include: depression, birth defects, miscarriage, deafness, and bowel disease, among others.Talk with your doctor about using isotretinoin; only the worst cases of cystic acne, or years of trial and failure, may warrant prescription of this very strong drug.

, Laser therapy is now used not only to minimize scars caused by cystic acne, but to actually fight cystic acne outbreaks. Laser therapy does this by either burning away the follicle sac, by burning away the sebaceous gland (which produces oil), or by oxygenating the bacteria, and thereby killing them.Still, there are side-effects and contradictory results, which means the treatment works for some patients but not for others. In some cases, the laser cooling system has malfunctioned, resulting in burns.

Wash your face twice a day with a gentle, water-soluble cleanser.,
Make sure to properly moisturize after each wash.,
Exfoliate at least once a week, preferably with a salicylic acid-based exfoliant.,
Don't pick at your cysts or skin.,
Keep your routine simple.",How to Get Rid of Acne Cysts Fast3," Water-soluble cleansers are gentler than harsher cleansers and just as effective.

, Your skin needs moisture after you strip it of oil and water. Use noncomedogenic moisturizers that won't block your pores, and look for light moisturizers (especially gels) instead of heavy ones.

, Salicylic acid is a chemical peel, which means that it will peel off the dead skin on the epidermis, revealing the layer underneath., Chances are that you have common acne in addition to cystic acne. Common acne and cystic acne can get inflamed when touched, producing more redness and irritation in addition to bumping up the likelihood of scarring when the collagen under the surface is repeatedly disturbed. As hard as it is, try not to touch your face or feel your pimples. You'll end up with healthier skin and fewer pimples.

, After you see your doctor and get a recommended skin regimen, keep things simple. Follow prescription advice your doctor gives you, wash your face and moisturize daily, and don't fall for any clear-skin gimmicks. Getting rid of acne takes patience, but it can be done by letting your medicine and routine work its magic.

Pay attention to diet.,
Cut down on stimulants like alcohol and smoking, if possible.,
Reduce the amount of stress you're under.,
Get enough sleep.,
Drink water.",How to Get Rid of Acne Cysts Fast4," For a long time, doctors and scientists were unwilling to draw a link between diet and acne. Now, doctors and scientists are beginning to reevaluate the evidence.It turns out that many studies support the hypothesis that what you eat affects how much acne you have and how bad it gets, although diet isn't the only culprit.Try eating a low-glycemic diet. That means going for the whole grains, beans, and veggies before you reach for the white bread, pasta, and sugar. Low-glycemic foods take longer for the body to absorb and are usually healthier.Several studies have found that people who eat low-glycemic diets have a lower incidence of acne.Low-glycemic-load diets not only improve the health of your skin, but also help you lose weight.Cut back on dairy. Studies suggest that the amount of dairy you consume does have an effect on acne.While it's unreasonable to think that completely cutting milk and yogurt out of your diet will magically cure you of acne, the evidence suggests that dairy does make your acne worse, possibly because of the hormones present in milk., Studies around the world have linked toxins like tobacco and alcohol to acne.And it's little wonder: smoking and drinking aren't exactly wonderful for your health. If you're a regular smoker and drinker with cystic acne, consider cutting down on these habits if you're serious about seeing a reduction in acne and an uptick in overall health.

, Scientists aren't exactly sure why, but they do know that stress will cause acne to get worse.Perhaps especially in males, an increase in stress has also been linked to worsening of the severity of acne.While stress is notoriously difficult to control, just realizing that stress may contribute to acne can give you pause the next time you start tearing your hair out over a bad grade or a bad date.


Try to carve out time for exercising. Scientists think that regular exercise can help reduce acne by regulating hormones, bringing more oxygen to your cells, and boosting your immune system, not to mention reducing stress.If nothing else, try walking at least 30 minutes a day.

, Increased sleep may help improve acne by limiting the amount of stress the body experiences. Scientists believe that stress can increase about 15% for each hour of sleep you lose during any given night.And, as we know, the more stress, the worse the acne. One study focusing on acne patients in Korea found that lack of sleep correlated significantly with an aggravation in acne., If you're trying to reduce the amount of sugar you take in, cut out all the sugary drinks (sports drinks, cola, sweet teas, juices) and reach for that H2O instead. Drinking more water will help your body's blood flow and assist it removing waste material caused by metabolism."

Try applying cortisone to reduce inflammation and fade creams to make scars less visible.,
Talk to your doctor about stronger chemical peels.,
Talk to your doctor about dermabrasion.,
Talk to your doctor about laser treatments.,
For large, deep lesions or scars, talk to your doctor about skin surgery.",How to Get Rid of Acne Cysts Fast5," Acne scars caused by cysts can be made less visible by applying cortisone and fade creams to your skin.


If your skin is red and swollen, apply cortisone to reduce the inflammation.Cortisone is a common medication for all sorts of skin irritations, and will be absorbed by the skin.Stay away from hydroquinone. Hydroquinone is a fade cream used to lighten pigments in the skin, but which has recently fallen out of favor due to concerns about possible cancer-causing properties.Instead, opt for a lightener such as kojic acid, arbutin, or ascorbic acid.

, Chemical peels use potent acid formulas to lift off the top layer or layers of skin, thereby minimizing the appearance of scars.Very strong chemical peels should be used in combination with a doctor's advice and/or guidance.

, Dermabrasion is the process of sloughing off top layers of skin with a rapidly rotating wire brush.Blemishes on the surface of the skin are usually removed, and deeper scars are usually minimized, although dermabrasion can cause changes in skin pigments for patients with darker skin.


Talk to your doctor about microdermabrasion. A lighter procedure than dermabrasion, microdermabrasion is the application of small crystals onto the top layer of skin, which are then vacuumed up, along with dead skin cells.Because the procedure only removes the top layer of skin, results are generally a lot less pronounced than dermabrasion.

, Lasers blast the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and heat the layer of skin just beneath it. Skin heals, lessening the appearance of scars. Sometimes, multiple laser treatments are needed to lessen the visibility of scars; repeated treatments offer subtler results.

, Skin surgery is a minor surgery in which a punch excision cuts out the scar and replaces it with stitching or a skin graft."

Consider other natural remedies.",How to Get Rid of a Pimple Using Toothpaste," The warm water will help unclog the pores and the face wash will help dissolve any dirt or oil. This will make the pimples easier to manage.


Consider using a face wash formulated for acne. Avoid anything alcohol-based, as it can dry out your skin and lead to breakouts.
Avoid using anything with exfoliants or alcohol, as this can irritate or dry out your skin. If your skin becomes too dry, your body will produce extra oils, which will lead to even more acne.;
, Use a soft towel, and gently pat your skin dry. Do not scrub your skin, or you might agitate the pimple.

, Dirty hands may transfer bacteria to your skin, which may result in more pimples and breakouts. Before you start applying the toothpaste, wash your hands well with soap and warm water.

, Not just any type of toothpaste will get rid of pimples. A plain, white toothpaste will be the most effective, but there are a few other things you should look for as well. Here are some things to get you started:


Choose a white-colored toothpaste.
Make sure that it is a paste, and not gel.
Consider getting a toothpaste that has baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, or menthol in it.
Consider getting a toothpaste that has a minty flavor. It may have a slight cooling effect on your skin.

, Some types of toothpaste may actually do more harm to your pimple than good, while others just won't be effective at all. Here are some things to avoid when searching for the right toothpaste:


Do not use a gel toothpaste, as the ingredients in it will not be as effective and might actually worsen the pimple.
Avoid anything that is colored or has a stripe through it, or has additives, such as cavity-fighting properties, whitening agents, or extra fluorides.
Consider getting a mint-flavored. It might have a cooling effect.

, Toothpaste may help dry the pimple out, but it can make your acne worse and irritate your skin.Before your start tackling those pimples with toothpaste, consider applying toothpaste on just one pimple in an inconspicuous area on your face.

, Use no more than a pea-sized amount.

, Make sure that you cover the entire pimple in a thin layer of toothpaste. Avoid getting any toothpaste on the skin around the pimple. Because toothpaste dries out pimples, it may also dry out your skin, which may lead to further irritation and breakouts.


If you have a lot of acne, consider using a doctor or pharmacist-prescribed ointment instead. You should never apply toothpaste to your entire face or use it as a face mask.

, How long you leave the toothpaste on the pimple will depend on your skin type and the size of the pimple. The general rule of thumb is 30 minutes, but if you have sensitive skin, then you may have to leave the toothpaste on for even less time. Here are some guidelines:


For sensitive skin and small pimples, leave the toothpaste on for 5 to 10 minutes.
For regular skin or large pimples, leave the toothpaste on for 30 to 60 minutes.
Consider leaving the toothpaste on overnight. Keep in mind, however, that this may irritate your skin, especially if you have sensitive skin. It may also get messy if you tend to move around a lot in your sleep.

, Do not use any soaps or facial cleansers. You can use just water or you can use a damp washcloth, but be careful not to rub the pimple too hard, or you will irritate the skin. The pimple should be smaller and less-inflamed.

, Do not use it every single day or several times a day. If you have severe acne, then consider using a cream made specifically for treating acne. Toothpaste does not replace medical treatment.

, Plan on drinking around eight glasses of water each day. Water helps flush out your system. A clean system leads to a clear complexion.

, Some types of food are more likely to cause pimples and acne to flare up, while other types are less likely. Here are the types of food you should avoid:Sweet and sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, and soda.
Processed foods, such as chips and fries.
Starchy foods, such as bread, pasta, and potatoes.

, Fruits and vegetables are not only good for your health, but also good for your complexion. Vitamin A is especially good when it comes to clear skin, and is found in fruits and vegetables such as cantaloupes, carrots, and sweet potatoes.Other healthy and vitamin-rich foods that help maintain a clear complexion include:Salmon may be fatty, but it is full of good fats, which help give your skin a healthy glow and keep those pores clear.
Avocado, artichoke, and broccoli are full of vitamins and antioxidants that help maintain your complexion and give your skin a healthy glow.
Brown rice, nuts, and whole grains are a great replacement for starchy foods, such as white bread and white rice. They are full of nutrients and vitamins, and help you feel full longer as well.
Garlic may be smelly, but it is full of antioxidants that not only fight off acne-causing bacteria, but also other viruses as well.

, If you work or spend a lot of time in an area that has a lot of dust (such as a warehouse) or a dust of grease (such as a kitchen in a restaurant), then you will have to clean your face often so that your pores don't get clogged up. Clogged pores lead to acne and pimples.

, Do not wash your face too often. Washing your face too often may cause your skin to dry out, which may lead to your body producing extra oils to make up for it. This will lead to more breakouts., If you must wear makeup over pimples, avoid anything that contains oils, and reach for some light-weight, oil-free products instead.In general, however, try to avoid wearing too much makeup over your pimples. The less you clog up your pores, the clearer your skin will look.


Consider using some concealer over your pimple. Be sure to blend it in properly and to set it with some setting powder.
Use green-tinted concealer with care. The green may reduce the redness of your pimple, but it may also make it appear more obvious under certain lights.If you wish to use a green-tinted concealer, put it over the pimple and blend in the edges. Follow with your regular foundation and concealer, and finish with some setting powder., If you wear makeup, be sure to wash it off with makeup remover before going to bed. If you go to sleep wearing makeup, you will clog your pores, which will lead to breakouts and more pimples. Also, make sure to clean your makeup brushes once a week using soap and water; this will prevent acne-causing bacteria from building up on your brushes., Picking and popping the pimples may flush out the pus that makes them so noticeable, but it won't get rid of the redness. Picking at your pimples may also lead to further irritation, scabbing, or even scarring. If you must touch your pimple, make sure that your hands are clean.

, Sometimes, toothpaste alone will not be enough to get rid of a pimple or severe acne. In these cases, consult your doctor or pharmacist and purchase some over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or sulfur and resorcinolfrom your pharmacy.

, Natural remedies can help reduce the redness and swelling of a pimple. Here are some ideas:


Hold an ice cube against your pimple for a few minutes to reduce redness and swelling. You can use ice cubes made from water or green tea.Soak a cotton ball with a drop of tea tree oil or lavender and wipe it across your pimple. The oil will reduce redness and swelling.
Disinfect the pimple by wiping it with a cotton ball soaked with apple cider vinegar or lemon juice. If you use lemon juice on your pimple, do not go out into the sun; make sure to clean the lemon juice off before doing so.Purchase a cleansing clay or mud mask from a health and vitamin store.

Speak to your doctor if you have chronic acne. If you just have one spot and generally do not experience dermatological issues, then a moderate salicylic acid is right for you.


Begin with a 15% concentration if you just have the occasional spots. It might take a couple of weeks for your skin to get used to this acid. If after a couple of weeks, you don’t experience intense dry skin, you can move up to 20 or 25% mixtures.;
, These will serve as your applicators. You don’t want to put the salicylic acid on with your finger as this will only introduce more bacteria to your already damaged skin. Alternatively, the salicylic acid may damage your fingers as well. Tissue paper can be used instead, but some people complain that their tissue doesn’t allow for targeted application., In general, you want to buy something made for deep pore cleansing. The salicylic acid will clean the surface of your skin and work on sloughing off dead skin cells on your skin’s surface (reducing the redness in the process), but it won’t clean into your pores. , You are going to apply an acid to your face. This will cause its own kind of damage, most notably, it will dry your skin out. You’ll want to replace natural oils to your skin for a healthy glow. Make sure that you purchase a moisturizer that works for your skin. For example, if you normally have dry skin, you’ll want a heavy-duty moisturizer.

Shower or bathe every day.",How to Get Rid of a Blind Pimple Overnight," Fill a one-quart pot with water and boil it for a minute. Add one to two drops of essential oils (or use 1/2 teaspoon of dried herb for every quart of water). Using essential oils can help your body quickly reabsorb blind pimples or draw them out so they heal faster. Some essential oils can even prevent pimples. Boil the water for another minute after adding the essential oil. Choose one of the following oils:Spearmint or peppermint: these contain menthol which is an antiseptic and can improve your immune system. Since some people find mint irritating, start by using one drop for every quart of water.
Calendula: this plant accelerates healing and has antimicrobial properties.
Lavender: this herb is soothing, calming and can help with anxiety and depression. It also has antibacterial properties.;
, Since essential oils come from plants, you should test for skin sensitivity to the plants before you steam your face. Place a single drop of the essential oil on your wrist and wait 10 to 15 minutes. If you have a sensitivity or allergy to the oil, you'll probably see a mild rash that may or may not be itchy. If you have no sensitivity, you can steam your face. If you do have a sensitivity, continue testing for a different oil to use.Remember that you can develop sensitivity to an herbal oil that you didn't used to react to. This is why it's important to always test an oil for sensitivity.

, Turn off the stove and move the pot away. Tie your hair back so it's out of your way and cover the back of your head with a large, clean cotton towel. Bend over the steaming pot so that the towel falls around the sides of your face, trapping the steam. Close your eyes, breathe normally and relax for 10 minutes. Rinse your skin with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a clean towel.


Be sure to keep your face at least 12 to 15 inches (30.5 to 38.1 cm) away from the water so you don't burn yourself.
To repeat steam facials throughout the day, simply reheat the water till it starts to steam. Steaming will open up your pores to clean out deep debris and facial oil. This can draw out the blind pimple., Seal in the moisture from the steam facial by applying a moisturizer. Select a non-comedogenic moisturizer. This won't clog your pores or contribute to acne. Moisturizing also helps prevent damage to your skin while keeping it soft and flexible.


If your skin is sensitive to products you use, look for a moisturizer that doesn't contain fragrance or perfume., Since the blind pimple is deep under your skin, it will take longer to come to the surface before it heals. To speed this process along, use a warm compress to draw the blind pimple to the surface. Soak a cotton ball or cloth in hot water and apply it to the blind pimple for a few minutes. Do this up to three times a day until the blind pimple comes to a head.You can also soak a cotton ball in a hot herbal tea that contains peppermint, lavender, calendula, or thyme.

, If the blind pimple is causing your skin to feel red, inflamed, or painful, apply an ice pack for up to ten minutes. This can reduce swelling and make it easier to apply concealer if you're getting ready to start the day. It also reduces the pain of a blind pimple.Always wrap an ice pack in a thin cloth. Avoid applying ice directly to your skin since this can damage your skin's delicate tissue., Use a lotion that contains 2% green tea extract to reduce your acne.You can also soak green tea bags in warm water and apply them directly to the blind pimple for several minutes. The tea can act as an astringent which will make the pimple reabsorb or bring it to the surface where antibacterial herbs can kill the bacteria.


Studies show that green tea is useful in treating a variety of skin conditions., Dip a cotton ball or cotton swab in undiluted tea tree oil. Apply the oil directly to your blind pimple. Don't rinse off the oil. The tea tree oil can reduce the inflammation that's causing your blind pimple, making it heal faster.Studies suggest that tea tree oil also has antimicrobial properties.More research is still needed to determine how effective topical tea tree oil applications are in treating bacterial or viral infections.

, Create an all-natural mixture with antibacterial, astringent, and skin healing properties.Combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of honey, 1 egg white (which binds the mixture together), and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice (which acts as a bleaching agent). If you don’t need or want a bleaching agent, substitute witch hazel which can reduce inflammation.Add ½ teaspoon of any of the following essential oils and stir well:


Peppermint
Spearmint
Lavender
Calendula
Thyme

, Spread the mixture over your face, neck or wherever you have blind pimples. Let the mask dry on your face for 15 minutes. Gently, rinse the mask of completely using lukewarm water. Avoid rubbing your skin when removing the mask. Pat your skin dry with a clean cloth and apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer.


If you want to use the mixture like a spot treatment instead of all over your face, dip a cotton swab in the mixture and spread it just over the blind pimples.

, Look for a gentle, non-abrasive, plant-oil based product that's labeled as ""non-comedogenic."" This means the cleanser won't clog your pores, a major cause of acne. Many dermatologists recommend using glycerin, grapeseed and sunflower oils. You should also avoid cleansers that contain alcohol. Alcohol dries, irritates, and can damage your skin because it strips away your skin's natural oils.Don't be afraid to use an oil to clean your face. Non-comedogenic oils can be used to dissolve your skin's oils.
Wet your face with lukewarm water and gentle use your fingers to apply cleanser, rags or scrubs maybe too abrasive. Resist the temptation to scrub the face, pat dry with a soft towel, and apply a moisturizer. Limit washing to twice a day and after sweating., Apply the cleanser to your skin using your fingertips. Don't use a washcloth or a sponge since these could irritate your skin and worsen the acne. Gently rub the cleanser into your skin in a circular motion, but take care not to scrub. Scrubbing and exfoliating your skin can cause tiny tears or scars. Wash your face twice a day. Pat your face dry with a soft clean cloth.


Never pick, pop, squeeze or touch your pimples. You could cause flareups, scarring, and delay healing., There are many skincare products and treatments on the market, but not all of them are gentle on your skin. Avoid irritating skincare products like astringents, toners, and exfoliants. You shouldn't use products containing salicylic acid or alpha hydroxy acids which dry your skin. Be wary of over-the-counter treatments like dermabrasions. Only trained dermatologists should perform certain skincare treatments to prevent skin damage.Makeup can make blind pimples and acne worse. It can clog the pores or cause irritation probably because of the chemicals or the mixtures of chemicals used., You should be in the habit of washing your skin every day by taking a bath or a shower. If you sweat a lot, wash more frequently.

Let it dry.,
Use a light moisturizer.,
Repeat as directed.",How to Get Rid of a Spot Quickly and Easily Using Salicylic Acid2," Apply some face wash/scrub to your face and your neck, if it is an affected area. Work into a lather. Leave for a couple of moments, then rinse well with cool, but not cold, water. When all of the wash has been rinsed off, splash your face with cold water; make it as cold as you can stand it. Do this for a minute or two to close the pores.


If you have an astringent, apply some to the cotton wool and sweep gently over the face. Generally, dermatologists argue that astringents shouldn't be used by people with chronic acne as they can dry out the skin too much.
If you just have one spot to target, then simply hold the cotton wool soaked with astringent on the spot for a minute or two. No need to rinse it off. Do the same with the witch hazel/toner/alcohol., If you have bought the cotton pads, a clever tip is to simply 'poke' one of the pads with the Q tip, so that some of the product transfers to the Q tip. However, if you have a large area to target, simply use a pad or a cotton wool pad with salicylic acid on it. You can purchase these separately., Do not wipe it prematurely or the acid may not have had a chance to work its magic. Normally, salicylic acid dries in around 30 seconds to one minute. Take this time to discard your used Q-tip and any other toiletries you may have needed to apply the acid.

, The biggest side effect from salicylic acid is dry and flaky skin. You effectively change out a acne “spot” for a big flake of dry skin. That’s not what you want. Remember that salicylic acid is a powerful acne fighting tool, but is just one thing in your face-care repertoire. Coconut oil based moisturizers are a great choice because of their natural anti-bacterial properties., You can apply lighter dosages of salicylic acid two or three times a day if needed. For prescription strength, you’ll do it less frequently. Pay close attention to the guidelines on the particular product you purchase.Keep in mind that it may take up to three weeks for your face to respond to the salicylic acid."

You can also moisturize your skin before applying concealer to avoid a sloppy, caked on look., Get a make-up sponge from your local drug store. Concealer looks best when it's gently dabbed on with a sponge rather than spread with your fingers. Not only does concealer look messier when spread on, your fingers may contain bacteria than can worsen symptoms of acne. Only use your fingers when initially dotting the concealer on your face.

If the pimples are in an area where your hair can reach them, use hair clips, a ponytail, or braid to keep your hair off your face. Your hair can transfer oils to your skin and make them worse.

But if that is not an option, look for products that say noncomedogenic on the label. That means that they won’t form a plug in your pores. You'll want to choose water- or mineral-based makeup. Oily, waxy foundations are more likely to seal the bacteria and dirt into the pimple.

Add essential oils to the steam bath.,
Steam your face.,
Care for your skin after steaming.",How to Get Rid of a Forming Pimple1," Using your fingertips and a gentle cleanser, gently rub your fingers over your skin. Use gentle, circular motions for about a minute. This helps the cleanser loosen and absorb dirt and oils.


Use lukewarm water, not hot water, as water that is too hot can damage sensitive skin.
Use your fingertips — not a sponge or washcloth.
Pull any hair off your face by tying it all back before you start to pre-clean your face. This will make sure it doesn’t interfere with the pre-cleaning. Then pre-cleanse your skin.
Non-oil based cleaners can be used, but you can also choose a plant-oil based cleaner. Many dermatologists recommend using glycerin, grapeseed, and sunflower oils, among others. Oils are the best to use to absorb and dissolve other oils.Then rinse your face with lukewarm water thoroughly and pat dry using a clean, cotton towel. Don’t rub, as you want to avoid doing anything that can irritate your skin.;
, A steam bath will help to clean pores and get rid of any dirt that is embedded in the skin.Fill a one quart pot with water. Place the pot on the stove and bring to a rolling boil, which usually takes several minutes.


Having a rolling boil assures that the water is hot enough to produce a lot of steam.
Water that is fully boiling will be approximately 212°F (100°C), depending on your elevation.This is very hot and so you should use caution when dealing with it — you could suffer third degree burns from the steam.

, Before heating up the water pre-test your skin by putting a single drop of the oil on your wrist and waiting for 10 – 15 minutes. Since these herbs are plant-derived, and since people can have allergies and sensitivities to plants, you can have a reaction to any essential oil. Usually, the reaction is a mild rash that may or may not be itchy. Some essential oils you may want to use include:Spearmint, or peppermint: Peppermint or spearmint can be irritating to some, so be sure to pretest your skin. If there is no irritation, you should be able to use the oil. Start with 1 drop/quart of water. Both peppermint and spearmint contain menthol which has both antiseptic and immune-boosting properties.
Calendula: Calendula accelerates healing, is anti-inflammatory and has antimicrobial properties.
Lavender: Lavender is soothing, calming, and can help with anxiety and depression. As a bonus, it also has antibacterial properties.

, You can add one to two drops of any essential oil. These essential oils have either antibacterial or antiseptic properties. Using them can help prevent the formation of pimples, stop them by helping them to reabsorb into the body, and draw them out.You do not have to add essential oils to your steam to make it effective. The steam itself opens the pores, helping to clean them out and, hopefully, allow the pimple to heal before it fully develops.
If you don’t have the essential oils, substitute ½ teaspoon of dried herb per quart of water. Once you have added the herbs, boil for another minute, turn off the heat and move the pot to a comfortable area.
Always remember that you can develop sensitivity to an herbal oil where it didn’t exist before. Thus, you should always be aware of a chance of sensitivity. Try each herb for about a minute, take your face away from the steam for 10 minutes and assess. If you are not sneezing or have any skin reaction, reheat the water and repeat the steaming.

, Make sure the heat is off and the water is no longer at a roiling boil. Cover your head with a large, clean cotton towel and place your face over the steaming pot, keeping your face at least 12 – 15 inches above the the water. This opens up pores, releases deeper debris and removes more face oils. It may be enough to clear out the pore with the forming pimple.


Close your eyes, breathe normally, and relax!
Keep your face over the steam for 10 minutes.

, Rinse your face well with lukewarm water and pat dry with a cotton towel. Don’t rub your skin, just gently pat it dry. Then apply a moisturizer.


Apply a non-comedogenic (meaning it will not block your pores) moisturizer to your face is important. Moisturizing helps prevent damage to your skin and helps keep it soft, flexible, and hydrated. You can check the labels of store-brand moisturizers. You want to look for the term “non-comedogenic” or wording that indicates that it will not clog your pores."

alpha hydroxy acids - there are two types of alpha hydroxy acids commonly found in OTC products: glycolic acid and lactic acid. Both acids are effective at removing dead skin cells, reducing inflammation, and stimulating new skin growth.
sulfur - removes dead skin cells and excess oil to prevent pores from clogging and helps kill bacteria on your skin. May cause dry skin and carry an unpleasant odor.

, If OTC acne products do not adequately treat your skin problems, you may need to talk to a dermatologist about prescription-strength medications. Topical prescriptions are medications that are applied topically (to the external surface of your skin). For best results, wash your skin with a gentle cleanser and dry your face about 15 minutes before using a topical medication.Common prescription-strength topicals include one or more of the following ingredients:


retinoids - prevent hair follicles from becoming plugged, which can help prevent pimples from forming. Retinoids also reduce inflammation. Start by applying retinoids in the evening three times each week, working your way up to daily use as your skin becomes accustomed to the medicine.
antibiotics - kill excess bacteria on your skin and reduce redness and inflammation. Topical antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the chances of becoming resistant to the antibiotics. Common antibiotic combinations include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin).
dapsone (Aczone) - kills bacteria and prevents skin pores from becoming clogged.May cause dry or reddish skin.

Apply essential oils directly to the skin.,
Apply a green tea bag treatment.,
Use an apple cider vinegar treatment.,
Apply tea tree oil.",How to Get Rid of a Forming Pimple2," When a pimple is forming, you can do direct herbal treatments using essential oils. These can help clean, tighten, and help heal the skin and minimize the pimples. Some essential oils that can help with acne include tea tree oil, lavender oil, clary sage oil, and juniper berry oil. Astringent herbs tighten or tone the skin, often allowing the blind pimple to reabsorb or come to a point, while the antibacterial herbs help kill off bacteria.

, Take a green tea tea bag and soak it in warm water briefly, so that it is thoroughly moistened. Apply the tea bag directly to the developing pimple.


The green tea acts as an astringent to draw out the pimple, along with pus, bacteria and cell debris.
There have been several studies in which green tea extract minimized acne in adolescents with moderate acne., Pour some apple cider vinegar on a cotton ball or a Q-tip. Apply directly to the pimple by gently rubbing it on. The apple cider vinegar acts as an astringent, clearing out dirt and cleaning the skin.It also can help dry the pimple and acts to kill any bacteria.

, Tea tree oil is an antibacterial, antifungal, and astringent oil. Before applying, mix three to five drops of tea tree oil with about a teaspoon of olive, almond, or castor oil.

Use a honey and baking soda exfoliant.,
Exfoliate with an oatmeal mixture.,
Use a sugar and olive oil exfoliant.,
Make a sea salt exfoliant.,
Use an over-the-counter exfoliant.",How to Get Rid of a Forming Pimple4," Gently exfoliating the skin around pimples can essentially “pull out” the embedded contents and can accelerate healing. Try using natural exfoliants that you can make yourself. For example, mix ¼ cup of honey with enough baking soda to make a paste.


Using gentle, circular motions, apply this mixture to the affected areas. You can also use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply the mixture to smaller areas. Just be sure not to be too firm with your cleaning, as this can damage the skin more than help it.Gently work the mixture into the area for two to three minutes and then gently rinse off with warm water.

, Grind ¼ to ½ cup of rolled whole oats in a food processor or coffee grinder. Add enough oil (olive, jojoba, Vitamin E, avocado, or almond oil) to make a paste. Using gentle, circular motions, apply this mixture to the affected areas or use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply to smaller areas.


Consider adding a tablespoon or two of honey to this mixture, so that it will stay in place on your face.Work the oatmeal mixture into the area for two to three minutes. Then rinse with warm water.

, Mix a teaspoon of sugar with ½ cup of olive oil. Using gentle, circular motions, apply this mixture to the affected areas or use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply to smaller areas.Gently rub the mixture on to the area for two to three minutes and then rinse with warm water.
You can also use castor, jojoba, Vitamin E, avocado, or almond oil, whichever you prefer.

, Take 1 – 2 teaspoons of sea salt and add enough oil (olive, jojoba, Vitamin E, avocado or almond oil) to make a paste. Using gentle, circular motions, apply this mixture to the affected areas or use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply to smaller areas.


Work the mixture into the area for two to three minutes and then rinse with warm water once the area is exfoliated.

, Most of these contain salicylic acid, usually 2%. These are available at most drugstores and department stores and should be used following the manufacturer's instructions.Salicylic acid can dissolve dead skin cells and skin oils. It can also help kill any bacteria that is forming the pus in a pimple.

Wash your face at least twice a day.,
Use a gentle, plant-oil based product to clean yourself.,
Use your fingertips to gently apply the cleanser.,
Stay out of the sun and don’t use tanning beds.",How to Get Rid of a Forming Pimple5," Pimples do not occur because your face isn’t clean, but keeping your face clean can decrease the amount of sebum (oil) and cell debris — some root causes of pimples. Make sure you wash in the morning and before bed and after any periods of heavy sweating.Take a bath or shower once a day, and if you sweat a lot, consider taking a shower afterwards.

, Look for a cleanser labeled as “non-comedogenic.” Because these products will not clog your pores, they should not promote the formation of acne — blackheads, whiteheads or pimples.


There are many store-brand products that are non-comedogenic but you will need to read the label to be certain.
Use alcohol-free products. Alcohol dries, irritates and can damage the skin because it strips off the natural oils.
It is recommended that you be gentle with your skin. Don’t use astringents, toners and exfoliants that irritate your skin. Chemical exfoliants such as salicylic acid (beta hydroxy acid) and alpha hydroxy acid chemically detach the dead and dying skin cells, but these can be drying and irritating as well., Do not scrub. This can cause permanent scarring and the skin will take longer to heal. Vigorous exfoliation often does more harm than good.


Exfoliation can cause micro-scarring, obvious scarring, and it can often make acne worse.
Don’t use a washcloth or a sponge, as this can irritate the skin and cause even more problems.
Don’t pick, pop, squeeze, or touch blackheads.This can also cause flare-ups, cause scarring, and will cause a longer healing time.

, Sun (and tanning beds) can damage your skin cells with UVB radiation.Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, daily. If you are active then you will want to use a water-resistant sunscreen.
Some specific acne medications or certain other types of medication can make your skin even more sensitive to the sun. This is called photosensitivity of the skin and you should talk to your doctor about this side effect. These drugs include antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim); antihistamines (diphenhydramine); drugs used to treat cancer (5-FU, vinblastine, dacarbazine); heart drugs (amiodorone, nifedipine, quinidine and ditiazem); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) like naproxen; and the acne medications isotretinoin (Accutane), and acitretin (Soriatane).

Use heat or ice therapy.,
Make an apple and honey mask.,
Try tea tree oil.,
Apply aloe vera.",How to Bring a Blind Pimple to a Head2," Depending on your skin and the severity of your blind pimple, you may want to consider using heat therapy or ice therapy. A warm compress can dry out a blind pimple and help it drain, while an ice pack can help reduce pain and swelling at the site of the pimple.You may want to use ice for the early stages of a blind pimple. If the pimple gets larger, more inflamed, or more painful, then you may want to use more warm compresses to try to draw out the fluid.


You can make a simple warm compress by soaking a clean wash cloth in warm to hot water (but be careful not to burn yourself). Apply a warm compress for just a few minutes at a time, but you can repeat the process as often as necessary throughout the day.For ice therapy, apply an ice pack, or wrap ice cubes in a clean towel or wash cloth. Apply the cold compress for no more than 10 minutes at a time, up to four times each day.

, Apples and honey are thought to be helpful for treating acne (including blind pimples) due to the properties of both ingredients. Apples contain malic acid, which can help make skin firmer and stronger, while honey has antimicrobial properties that can help fight bacteria (which may be the cause of your clogged pores).Blend an apple into a pulp. Then gradually add all-natural honey to thicken the pulp until it forms an easily-spreadable paste.
Apply the paste to your blind pimple and let it stay on for at least ten minutes. Then wipe or rinse the paste away and wash your skin with a gentle facial wash.

, Tea tree oil is often used in natural remedies to treat a variety of skin conditions. Applying tea tree oil to a blind pimple may help remove dead skin cells, oil, and dirt that has clogged your pores and reduce inflammation.Use a small amount of oil on the blind pimple three times each day. This may work best when combined with other skin care routines, like using exfoliators or a gentle face wash.

, Aloe vera has long been used to remedy skin ailments, and many people believe that aloe vera may help treat blind pimples. If you're using a store-bought gel, simply apply the aloe vera gel to the affected site. If using your own aloe leaves, break the leaf along the stem and squeeze out some of the plant's gel-like juice.Apply aloe vera directly to the site of the blind pimple, and leave it on for at least 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, rinse your face with warm water to clear away your skin.

Practice good hygiene.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Reduce your stress.",How to Bring a Blind Pimple to a Head3," Keeping your face clean is one of the best things you can do to prevent blind pimples from forming. That's because most pimples are caused by pores clogged with dirt, bacteria, and oil, all of which can be removed by using a daily facial wash. It's also important to properly wash your hands any time you will be touching your face, as unwashed hands could introduce new bacteria to your skin's pores.Choose a gentle cleanser. Opt for facial cleansers that are non-abrasive and do not contain alcohol.Wet your face with clean lukewarm water. Then use your fingertips (after washing your hands) to apply the cleanser. Do not scrub your skin, as this can cause irritation and damage.
Rinse with clean lukewarm water and pat your face dry with a clean, soft towel.
Wash twice daily and any time you sweat excessively.

, Properly hydrating your body can help improve your skin's elasticity.Though elasticity is not necessarily correlative with reduced acne, it can help improve your skin as part of an overall skin-care regimen.


Aim for eight glasses of water daily. Avoid consuming sugar, alcohol, and excess caffeine to help prevent dehydration.

, Avoid foods with high in sugar or fat, and reduce processed foods. Eat more healthy, whole foods like fruits and vegetables. There is no conclusive evidence, but studies have show links between acne and foods containing high levels of refined sugar, fat, or dairy.Foods that cause your blood sugar to rise (like sugar and carbohydrates) cause your body to release insulin, which may cause your oil glands to overproduce.A low-glycemic diet may help prevent acne., Stress is not likely to create new cases of acne, but if you're already prone to acne, stress can induce a bad flare up.Reducing your daily stress levels can help reduce acne outbreaks, including blind pimples.Try autogenic relaxation. This method of stress relief involves repeating calming words/phrases in your mind while focusing on your body's sensations. Try concentrating on your breathing or relaxing each limb in succession while reciting your calming mantra.
Use progressive muscle relaxation. This technique involves tensing, holding, and then relaxing each major muscle group in your body in succession. Start at your head and work your way down, or vice versa. Hold your tensed muscles for at least five seconds, then release the tenseness and let your muscles relax for 30 seconds before moving to the next muscle group.
Visualize a peaceful place/situation. Close your eyes and sit alone in a quiet spot. While picturing a relaxing scenario or place, try to engage your senses. Think about the feeling of sitting on the floor/ground/bed, the sounds of ocean waves (for example), and the smell of salt water wafting over you.
Meditate. Sit alone in a quiet place. You can sit with your legs folded under you, or you can sit upright with your feet firmly planted on the floor (whatever is most comfortable). Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Breathe through your diaphragm (down near your stomach) rather than your chest. Take slow, deep breaths in and out, and try incorporating a mantra (if you're comfortable with it). Your mantra can be affirming (I love myself) or relaxing (I feel completely peaceful) - whatever will help you relax and sit in peace."

Try benzoyl peroxide.,
Add salicylic acid to your skincare regimen.,
Consider alpha hydroxy acids.,
Use sulfur.",How to Clear Mild Acne Fast1," If you're looking to clear up acne fast, the most widely used and effective over-the-counter skin cream available is benzoyl peroxide. It can be purchased at most drug stores. This should be the first option you try for mild acne.


Benzoyl peroxide works by killing bacteria that causes acne. It comes in cream form in a variety of strengths, from 2.5 to 10 percent. Start with a lower dose kind as stronger is not always better. Your skin might respond better to a 2.5 percent cream than a 10 percent one.It also reduces inflammation and helps keep your pores clean.
Side effects can include red skin, dry skin, scaling, and burning. Severe side effects are rare, however, but you should be careful if you have sensitive skin.Be careful when using benzoyl peroxide. It can bleach clothing and skin.;
, If benzoyl peroxide on its own does not work, add salicylic acid to the mix. Salicylic acid can also be purchased at most drug stores and often works great in conjunction with benzoyl peroxide.


Salicylic acid mainly works by preventing pores from being clogged which stops acne breakouts from starting. If your breakouts usually start small and build from there, you might want to use salicylic acid right away to prevent the breakout spreading.Side effects can include mild stinging and skin irritation. As with benzoyl peroxide, it's best to start with a weaker prescription-strength product., Alpha hydroxy acids come in several types, most commonly glycolic acid and lactic acid, and can be purchased at most drug stores without a prescription. These are synthetic versions of acids normally drawn from fruits and work by removing dead skin cells and preventing inflammation of the skin.Alpha hydroxy acids can lessen the appearance of acne scars by stimulating the growth of new skin. If you popped or picked off a pimple, applying alpha hydroxy acids might lessen the appearance of the scar.Alpha hydroxy acids can also make pores look smaller, improving the overall appearance of the skin in addition to eliminating acne., Scrubs and over-the-counter acne products that contain sulfur help remove dead skin cells that clog pores and lead to acne. Sulfur also helps reduce the bacteria in the skin that cause acne. You can combine sulfur-based products with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. However, be careful as sulfur can cause dry skin and might produce an unpleasant odor."

, If you decide to remove your blackheads with an extractor, you might be confused by the variety of tools available at pharmacies, health stores, beauty supply outlets, and larger retailers. Select one based on the type of blackheads you want to remove. Your options for buying extractor tools include:


A two-headed tool. One side has a small spoon with a hole that fits closely over the blackhead to release the blackhead. The other side has a small and very sharp lancet that can be very dangerous if not used by a professional.A cupped-end tool. This kind of tool may have one or two cupped ends that fit different sizes of blackheads.In some cases, one end of the tool might have an angle to get at difficult areas like the side of the nose.Consider buying a tool in stainless steel. Not only is the product generally considered hypoallergenic for most people, but you can also easily and effectively disinfect it between uses., If you want to remove blackheads with something other than an extractor, look for products specific to your skin type and prepare to use it. Most pharmacies, skin care and cosmetics stores, beauty supply stores, and some medical supply stores carry the different types of removal implements.


Buy your choice either in a store or online.
Read product labels to help ensure you can effectively use the product and don’t have any allergies to any of the ingredients.
Ask staff any questions you may have about the product.

, Wash the area where you're removing the blackheads. This can open up your pores and remove surface bacteria or debris that may make removal difficult or cause infection.Wash with a gentle cleanser that has a neutral pH.

Do not scrub your skin.
Wash with lukewarm water. Hot water can strip your skin of natural oils that moisturize your skin and also can irritate it.Dry your skin and avoid putting any products on it before you remove the blackheads.

, Opening your pores and making your skin more pliable can help you more effectively remove blackheads. Boil water and pour it into a bowl (do not try to perform this while the water is still on the stove). Steam your skin over the bowl for a few minutes to help open pores and make your skin softer for removal.Place your skin at least 12 inches away from the boiling water to minimize the risk of burning yourself. Steam burns can be extremely severe, so use caution.
Drape a towel over your head and bowl to capture more of the steam.

, If you’ve decided to use topical creams to remove widespread or especially persistent blackheads, apply it to the area you want to treat. Use clean fingers to spread a thin layer of the product.Leave the product on your skin for as long as the package suggests. Allowing it to stay on longer may cause irritation.
You may need to apply a moisturizer to the area if you leave it on overnight. This may help minimize irritation.

, If you’ve chosen to use a comedone extractor or loop, use it once you’ve steamed your face. Be as gentle as possible when you press it against the blackhead for removal.Gently press on only one side of the affected blackhead and gently move the extractor across the area of the blackhead.Move the tools over the top of the blackhead, which should cause the blackhead to come out as a plug.Once you’ve removed the blackhead, wash the extractor in hot, soapy water., Though further study is needed to determine the ideal method, light source and dose, light therapy has been shown to kill the bacteria responsible for blackheads.Blue light therapy can be done by a doctor or at home with a hand-held kit or mask.

Instructions for use will vary depending on which device you buy. Follow the manufacturer's instructions closely and speak with your doctor or dermatologist if you have any questions.
Treatment with light may cause temporary redness, pain, and sensitivity to light.

, If you’ve chosen to use pore strips for smaller and more widespread blackheads, place them on the areas you want to treat. Make sure you place the strips flush against your skin to maximize the efficacy of the product.Wet the area you want to treat with your finger or washcloth to help the strips adhere to your skin.
Allow the strip to dry completely before removing it. This ensures that you get as much of the blackhead material as possible.
Remove the strip from the treatment area gently. Peel it off slowly to minimize pain.
Examine the results if you want.

, Rinse your skin once you’ve completed removing your blackheads. You may also want to re-wash it, but be aware that this may cause irritation.Use lukewarm or cool water.Use a gentle cleanser or a soothing toner to remove any lingering residue. This can also help remove any bacteria that came out with the blackhead.

, Apply a skin-type specific moisturizer to your skin. Properly hydrated skin may minimize irritation and help prevent further breakouts.Choose a moisturizer specific to your skin type, such as dry, combination, or oily.
Even if your skin is oily, it needs moisturizer to help balance it out. In this case, choose an oil-free and non-comedogenic moisturizer.Ask your dermatologist or skin care professional what type of skin you have.

Consider the problems with untreated acne.",How to Start Using Accutane," Only a dermatologist can tell you if Accutane is right for you. Many dermatologists will not see patients without a referral from a doctor (depending on your insurance plan), so you may wish to visit your regular healthcare provider first.;
, Accutane is used to treat severe acne, called ""severe recalcitrant nodular acne"", that has not responded to other forms of treatment.


Nodular acne (sometimes referred to as cystic acne) is the most severe form of acne. Pustules develop on the body in the form of hard, painful, cysts that are often larger than normal areas of acne.
Left untreated, this form of acne can lead to heavy scarring, as well as potential psychological problems associated with stress and self-esteem.

, If your acne is persistent, but not severe, then you may want to consider a different form of treatment. Accutane is not used for mild to moderate acne because of the risk and range of its side effects.


Prescription oral antibiotics may be used to successfully treat moderate acne.Other treatment options include phototherapy (light treatment) and laser treatments. These are often successful in treating moderate acne and acne scarring., Side effects range from mild discomforts, such as dry skin, to complications that can be serious. Up to 80% of Accutane users will experience at least some side effects.The FDA placed a warning on Accutane in 1998 informing healthcare providers and the public about an increase in the incidence of depression, suicidal thinking, and suicide attempts.
Recent research shows that Accutane users have a higher risk of developing digestive disorders, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Many lawsuits have been filed against the original manufacturer specific to people that developed serious side effects while taking Accutane..

, You should tell your doctor about any medical or psychological conditions you have, as well as any medications or supplements, including vitamins, that you take. Also consult with your doctor if:You are allergic to vitamin A-containing drugs (such as other retinoids)
You have diabetes or a family history of diabetes
You have high blood fats or a family history of high blood fats
You or someone in your family has a psychiatric disorder (including mood disorders such as depression)
You have liver disease
You are overweight or obese
You have an eating disorder
You have a problem with alcohol abuse
You have a bone loss condition (e.g., osteoporosis)

, If both you and your dermatologist agree to proceed with Accutane treatment, your doctor will ask you to agree to several specific conditions before you can proceed., Due to the risk of birth defects, enrollment in this program is required for women of child-bearing age. The iPLEDGE program involves routine pregnancy tests and a commitment to avoid pregnancy by promising to use 2 acceptable forms of birth control during Accutane therapy.


Acceptable forms of birth control include oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, implanted devices, patches, physical contraceptives, such as condoms or diaphragms, and a solemn swear of abstinence (meaning absolutely no sexual contact) during the course of treatment with Accutane.

, Individuals are required to sign an informed consent before beginning therapy, and must be considered reliable in understanding and following instructions.

, You can't donate blood while you are taking Accutane, or in the first month after you stop taking it. In addition, you must agree not to share the prescription with anyone.


Encourage people with similar symptoms to see a dermatologist and obtain a prescription for Accutane.

, The brand name product, Accutane, is no longer made, but several companies make the generic formulation, isotretinoin. The generic form of Accutane is covered under most insurance plans, so you can obtain a monthly dosage for a relatively inexpensive price.

, For female patients of child-bearing age, the prescription must be filled and picked up within 7 days of the office visit when the tests were done to confirm that you are not pregnant. For everybody else, each prescription must be filled and picked up within 30 days of the office visit.

, Doses are to be taken orally, with food, and at approximately the same time each day. Food in your stomach helps the drug to be absorbed.

, An Accutane regimen will usually last several months. Remember to take your pill every day. It may be helpful to set a daily alarm on your cell phone or your alarm clock to remind yourself not to miss a dose.


If you do miss a pill, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. In that case, just skip the dose you missed completely. Do not double up doses in an effort to catch up.

, In addition to birth control, monthly blood tests are required to monitor for changes, including the balance of different forms of cholesterol in your blood (specifically, your triglyceride levels). Routine lab work is necessary to ensure that Accutane is not causing any internal damage to your liver or kidneys.


Triglycerides refer to the fatty acids that are normally found in your blood. These may peak when eating particularly fatty foods, such as fast food or other deep fried meals. Maintaining a healthy diet helps the drug to be better absorbed, and helps to avoid abnormally high levels of fatty acids sometimes caused by eating meals high in fats.

, Taking Accutane during pregnancy has been shown to significantly increase the risk of birth defects. Women who get pregnant while taking Accutane have a 30% chance of birth defects, as opposed to the normal 3-5% chance.

, Remember that Accutane works by targeting your sebaceous glands. Using over-the-counter and prescription acne products will only aggravate your skin and increase dryness. Talk with your dermatologist about using any skin products while taking Accutane.


Use a gentle skin cleanser, such as Dove or Aveeno, when using Accutane to avoid skin irritation.

, As the saying goes: Knowledge is power. Let your dermatologist know if you are experience anything unusual during your treatment. Ask about specific side effects to look for, such as blurry vision or severe back pain.

, The generic name for Accutane is isotretinoin. The drug is a derivative of vitamin A, and falls in a class of medications known as retinoids. Accutane works in 4 ways.


Accutane helps to control the size of the sebaceous glands, which are the glands that produce oil. This reduces the amount of oils produced by these glands. At the same time, it decreases the amount of acne-causing bacteria that live in the oil from these glands. Accutane also slows down the development of some cells that cause pores to get blocked, and it decreases inflammation of the skin..

, The dose is determined by body weight and by the severity of the acne. The usual dose ranges are 0.5-1.0mg/kg per day. For example, in someone that weighs about 150 pounds, the dose would range from about 20mg to 35mg, taken twice every day., Take Accutane for the length of time prescribed. One course of therapy can last for 4 to 5 months. Sometimes more than 1 course of therapy may be needed. The best response happens when the cumulative dose, or the total dose taken over a period of time, is considered. Your doctor knows how to monitor your progress and keep up with the cumulative dose in order for you to get the greatest benefit from Accutane therapy.

, As many as 85% of people treated with Accutane see great results after just 1 treatment course, lasting about 4 to 5 months. More than 1 course of treatment may be needed to permanently clear the skin and avoid any future relapse of the acne.Although there is no guarantee that everyone will see improvement, most people see their acne disappear, and in many cases it never comes back., Acne commonly develops during the adolescent and early adult years, but acne can also occur later in life. If left untreated, severe acne may result in physical disfigurement and associated psychological problems. According to the FDA and the parent drug company, acne leads to more feelings of insecurity and inferiority than any other disease.

Do not use a towel that's been sitting out in the bathroom as you want to keep bacteria away from your skin.Always wash your skin after working out. If any sweat or dirt is left on your face after a hard workout, it can clog pores and cause acne. Make sure you wash your face after a workout., While there is conflicting evidence on the effects of diet on acne, you can try to change your diet for a week or two and see if it makes a difference. Dairy foods, chocolate, and foods containing a lot of sugar seem to increase the likelihood of breakouts.


Some research indicates dairy, skim milk in particular, increases the likelihood of acne breakouts. You should try cutting back on dairy for a week or two and see if you notice any changes in your skin.While further studies are needed to verify, some research does show chocolate can cause breakouts. High sugar food especially can cause breakouts, so it might be a good idea to avoid sweets in general in addition to chocolate., Sun can damage skin and some acne medications can make you more susceptible to sunburns. Always apply a layer of sunscreen to your face before going outdoors. Remember, even if it's cold out, if the sun's shining, it could cause burns. Aim for a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher., If you're looking to cure a breakout fast, eliminate any potential skin irritants until your acne is gone.


Certain makeups and cover ups can clog pores. While they may not cause a breakout in and of themselves, using makeup during a breakout can prolong its duration. It's a good idea to go without makeup until acne is eliminated,but another option is to talk to your doctor or skin care expert about better choices of makeup, such as loose mineral-based powders. A tinted moisturizer may be a good choice as well. Look for makeup that is water-based or noncomedogenic.
If you've recently started using a new bath wash or shampoo, this may have caused your breakout. Cease use and see if it makes a difference."

Ask a dermatologist about prescription acne creams.,
Consider oral contraceptives.,
Ask about chemical peels and other skin therapies.",How to Clear Mild Acne Fast3," If your acne does not respond to over-the-counter medications, see a dermatologist about prescription creams. The ingredients are generally stronger and may help clear up your acne faster than drugstore brands.


Retinoids come in the form of gels, powders, and creams. They are derived from vitamin A and add nutrients to the skin that can eliminate acne. Retinoids are applied three times a week in the evening. If you need to use retinoids for an extended period, you'll eventually move up to using them once at night.Note that there is a retinoid cream called Differin gel (adapalene gel) that is now available over-the-counter. It is a little more gentle than other retinoids.
Antibiotic creams kill bacteria and reduce redness in skin. Usually, antibiotic creams are used in conjunction with retinoids or benzoyl peroxide. You would apply antibiotics in the morning and retinoids at night. The combination may clear up mild acne faster, so ask your dermatologist about using both if you're interested in fast cures.Dapsone is a gel that is sometimes prescribed with retinoids. It may cause redness and dryness, however. If you're trying to clear up acne fast for a big event, you may want to consider other methods.Dapsone gel is not recommended to be used with benzoyl peroxide, due to the possibility of causing a yellow or orange discoloration of the skin.

, If you're female and frequently break out with mild acne, you might want to talk to a doctor about oral contraceptives. The hormones found in most oral birth controls can help prevent acne.


Combined oral contraceptives contain estrogen and progesterone, and these hormones combined can prevent acne. While this might not help clear up acne fast, it's worth looking into if you're looking for a long-term solution.Such products may cause headaches, breast tenderness, mood swings, and spotting between periods. For most women, side effects taper off within the first three months.If oral contraceptives do not work, consider an antiandrogen agent as a possibility. This is a drug that works by blocking the effect of certain hormones on the glands, eliminating acne from developing., A dermatologist can perform chemical peels and other skin therapies that should remove acne fairly quickly. Ask your dermatologist about skin therapies if you're interested in swift removal.


A chemical peel is usually done in one treatment, but some people need several treatments for the full effect. Your dermatologist will apply a solution to your skin designed to designed to exfoliate it. The solution may be left on or washed off before the end of the session. The procedure is non-invasive and usually takes less than an hour. They are fairly effective at quickly removing acne or acne scars. While your skin may sting, the procedure is not painful. The downside is, however, the chemical peels are generally not covered by insurance and may be somewhat expensive depending on your dermatologist's rates.You may experience some redness and flaking or peeling of the skin for several days after having the peel.
A microdermabrasion is a non-surgical means to rejuvenate the skin. Skin is gently sanded to remove the thicker, outer layer. It can lessen the appearance of acne and acne scars and make skin look younger and lighter overall. Like chemical peels, however, the procedure can be expensive and is generally not covered by insurance.Ask about light and laser therapy for acne. You will likely need multiple treatments for this to work, and it must usually be done in combination with a topical treatment. Blue, red, and blue and red light devices can be used to reduce pimples. There are even some at-home light treatments you can use. Other options include treatment with infrared light, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and photopneumatic therapy."

Never pick or pop your blackheads.,
Don’t use your own blackhead removal tools.,
Avoid ultra-abrasive exfoliants.,
Wash your face twice daily.,
Wash your pillowcases.,
Don’t touch your face.",How to Remove Blackheads1," Using your fingers to try to remove blackheads actually adds more dirt and bacteria to your pores, making your blackhead-filled skin worse. As difficult as it may be, avoid touching your skin and removing your blackheads with force at all times. It may lead to bumps on your skin or even lead to scars.;
, Many stores now offer your own blackhead removing instruments to give yourself an at-home facial. However, these tools often get full of bacteria and can scar your skin. Leave using steel instruments to the professionals and stick to using cleansers and exfoliants.

, If you have sensitive skin, using harsh exfoliants can just irritate it and make your blackheads worse. If you are ever in pain from an exfoliant, stop using it and go with a more gentle cleanser. Try using oatmeal as the most gentle exfoliant if you are having issues with harsher scrubs.

, Make sure yours is clean and clear by washing it once in the morning and once at night. Always be sure to remove all makeup before washing your skin (if you’re wearing any). Follow up your face wash routine with a gentle facial moisturizer to keep your skin from over-producing oils which cause blackheads.

, Your pillowcases catch dead skin cells and excess oil from your face when you sleep on them at night. Wash them at least once a week to remove the buildup of dirt from the fabric to help keep your face clear of blackheads.

, Even if you aren’t picking at your blackheads, touching your face transfers bacteria from your hands to your face. Your hands are the dirtiest part of your body and are often the cause of many cases of blackheads. Avoid resting your face on your hands or needlessly touching your skin.

Use oral contraceptives.,
Consider bioidentical hormones.,
Understand the risks of hormone replacement therapy.",How to Balance Hormones for Acne1," If acne is thought to be complicated by a hormonal imbalance, your dermatologist may choose hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as part of the treatment. The most common HRT for acne is contraceptive therapy using birth control pills. These often contain estrogens, progestins or both in varying concentrations. The type and dosing of oral contraceptive is an important factor in acne treatment, and only a dermatologist specialized in their usage for this condition should be treating acne with HRT. The use of HRT may be very effective in young women. Sometimes another hormone, spironolactone, is also added.Treatments with oral contraceptives can help some women with hormonal acne, but can have significant side effects. Side effects may include dizziness, headaches, weight changes, stomach upset, bloating, nausea, depression, chest pain, increased risk of heart disease (especially in women who smoke), shortness of breath, lumps in the breast, and liver problems.
These drugs have also been implicated in increasing the risk of breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis, and strokes. There doesn’t appear to be much difference in which oral contraceptive is used.Keep in mind that the biggest risk factors for women taking HRT is obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity and a history of clotting disorders. Like most medical treatments, inform yourself fully about the risks and benefits of the treatment in consultation with a qualified medical professional.;
, Bioidentical hormones are synthetic hormones that are most commonly used as topical treatments, but they are increasingly being used to treat hormonally-related acne.Bioidentical hormones are often recommended by naturopathic providers and are available over-the-counter. It is very important to note that these are non-regulated, meaning there is no standard or testing for quality or purity before they are released on the market and they may be manufactured without following pharmaceutical standards. While their chemical compounds are labeled as “chemically identical” to your own human hormones, no medically sound research determining the risks and benefits of these compounds exist. Premarin, for example, is derived from the urine of pregnant female horses.Before taking a bioidentical hormone, you should speak with a dermatologist who can order tests to determine your individual hormone levels and determine the specific hormones to be replaced to restore your body to normal physiologic levels. Monitoring of the hormone levels and any potential side effects is also a crucial part of treatment.

, With any form of hormone replacement therapy, the risks and benefits have to be weighed; you should do so with your doctor. Using oral contraceptives increases the risk of cervical, breast, and liver cancers, heart disease, and stroke.It has been reported that bioidentical hormones have been used safely in Europe for over 50 years to treat menopause, but there may still be risks associated with these hormones when used over a long time period and when used to treat acne, which has not been studied extensively. Exercise caution with any non-medical treatment that has not been studied using strict scientific methods to determine safety and effectiveness
The best advice is to consult your medical professional before using any treatment, including HRT, and to do so only under the supervision of that medical provider.

, You do not want to leave aspirin on your skin for longer than 15 minutes. Otherwise your skin will absorb a lot of aspirin into your bloodstream, where it will remain for awhile., This can also be an opportunity for light, gentle exfoliation.

, Tea tree oil can actually work better than benzoyl peroxide in reducing lesions and fighting acne.Apply a little tea tree oil to your pimple until it goes away.

, Raw potatoes can act as anti-inflammatory, if you apply them to your skin. Leave it on for a few minutes and then wash the potato residue off your skin with cold water.

Go for white-colored toothpaste.,
Avoid teeth-whitening toothpastes.,
Steer clear of gel toothpastes.,
Choose a toothpaste with a lower fluoride content.,
Go organic.",How to Apply Toothpaste on Pimples2," When choosing a toothpaste for acne treatment, go for an all-white version, not a toothpaste with red, blue or green stripes. This is because the ingredients which help to dry out pimples - such as baking soda, hydrogen peroxide and triclosan - are contained in the white part of the toothpaste, while the colored sections may contain ingredients which will irritate the skin., Whitening toothpastes contain bleaching agents (for making teeth whiter) which may actually bleach or burn the skin, causing patchiness. This is particularly true for people with darker skin tones - as the extra melanin in the skin makes it more reactive, and therefore more prone to marks and blemishes. People with fair skin may be less affected by such ingredients, however it is better to avoid whitening toothpaste regardless., Gel-type toothpastes have a different formulation than actual ""paste"" toothpastes, and so may be lacking the active ingredients necessary to effectively dry out pimples. Avoid using, as it will not do your skin any good.

, Fluoride is added to over 95% of toothpastes in the U.S. as it helps to remove dental plaque and prevent gum disease.However, many people actually suffer from a mild topical allergy to fluoride, and it may cause dermatitis (a skin rash) if it comes in contact with the skin. For this reason, it is best to find a toothpaste with as low a fluoride content as possible (or fluoride-free, if you can find it) to minimize the risk of skin irritation., Organic toothpastes are probably your best option when it comes to treating pimples. They contain no fluoride (unless it's naturally derived) and no nasty growth hormones, pesticides or other chemicals. On the other hand, they still contain the ingredients necessary for drying out pimples - such as baking soda and tea tree oil - with the addition of natural soothing and anti-bacterial substances like aloe, myrrh and eucalyptus oil.

Wash your face.,
Squeeze a little toothpaste onto your finger.,
Apply a small amount of toothpaste directly onto the pimple.,
Leave the toothpaste on for two hours or overnight.,
Gently wash off.,
Repeat no more than four times a week.",How to Apply Toothpaste on Pimples3," As with any spot treatment, it is important to apply the toothpaste to clean, dry skin. This ensures that there is no dirt or excess oil on the skin that may limit the effectiveness of the treatment. Wash your face well with warm water and your favorite cleanser, then pat dry to lock in moisture.

, Squeeze a little toothpaste onto your index finger or the back of your hand. A pea-sized amount should be enough, depending on the number of pimples you're treating.

, You will only need to apply a very small amount of toothpaste to the pimple for the treatment to be effective. Just make sure that you apply the toothpaste directly onto the pimple itself, not on the surrounding skin.


Toothpaste should never be spread all over the skin or used as a face mask. This is because the toothpaste works by drying out the skin, which can cause redness, irritation and peeling if applied anywhere but the pimple itself., Leave the toothpaste to dry on the skin anywhere from two hours or overnight, for best results. However, if you have extremely sensitive skin, it may be best to remove the toothpaste after 15 minutes to half an hour, in order to gauge your skin's reaction. If it seems to be handling the toothpaste okay, you can leave it on for increasingly longer periods.


Some people advocate placing a band-aid over the pimple to help the toothpaste stay in place. However, this is not advisable, as it may cause the toothpaste to spread on the surrounding skin, leading to irritation, while also preventing the skin from breathing.

, You can wash off the toothpaste with a damp washcloth, using small, circular motions. Make sure to do this very gently, as rubbing too hard might irritate or damage the skin. When all the toothpaste has been removed, splash your face with some warm water and pat dry with your hands or a clean, soft towel. You may want to apply a soothing moisturizer if your skin feels very tight and dry.

, As mentioned before, toothpaste may be irritating, especially if you have sensitive skin, so this is not a treatment you should be using multiple times a day, or more than four times a week. After applying the treatment once a day, 2-3 days in a row, you may notice an improvement in the size and color of the pimple. From that point on, you should allow the pimple to heal on its own.

Be aware that toothpaste is not a dermatologist-approved acne treatment.,
Try benzoyl peroxide.,
Give salicylic acid a try.,
Use sulfur.,
Try tea tree oil.,
Apply crushed-up aspirin.,
Use baking soda.,
See a dermatologist.",How to Apply Toothpaste on Pimples4," Although using toothpaste as a quick-fix for pimples is a popular home remedy that's been around for years, there are very few dermatologists, if any, who would recommend it as a treatment. This is because toothpaste can be very drying on the skin, causing redness, irritation and sometimes even burns.


Regular toothpaste also contains none of the anti-bacterial ingredients that make over-the-counter creams more effective in treating and preventing pimples.For this reason, toothpaste should only be used as an emergency treatment for pimples, and you should stop using it immediately if your skin is reacting badly. There are many other spot treatments you can try, as safer, more effective alternatives to toothpaste.

, Benzoyl peroxide is a great topical acne treatment that fights blackheads, whiteheads and larger pimples. It works by killing bacteria in the pores, preventing acne from forming in the first place. Though effective, benzoyl peroxide can cause the skin to become dry and peel, so it should be used sparingly. Benzoyl peroxide is available over-the counter, in creams, lotions, gels, medicated pads and cleansers., Salicylic acid is another effective over-the-counter acne treatment. It works by reducing inflammation and redness, while also exfoliating the skin. Unlike most acne treatments, salicylic acid actually helps to soothe and calm the skin, making it a good choice for sensitive skin-types. Salicylic acid is available in varying strengths and in many different forms, so ask your pharmacist or dermatologist about which type is best for you., Sulfur is an excellent pimple-buster for those with sensitive skin. It is extremely gentle, but also very effective at drying out pimples. It does this by drawing oil out of blocked pores and regulating sebum production. The only downside is that pure sulfur smells like rotten eggs, so you may need to use it in combination with another product in order to mask the smell., Tea tree oil is a pleasant-smelling, natural remedy for acne. It is an effective antiseptic, which helps to reduce the size of existing pimples, while also helping to prevent future breakouts. As it is an oil, tea tree will not strip skin of its natural moisture, making it a good option for those with very dry skin. Tea tree oil should be applied directly onto pimples, using a q-tip. , The official name for aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid, which is closely related to salicylic acid, mentioned above. Aspirin is a powerful anti-inflammatory, making it an effective treatment for reducing the size and redness of pimples. You can either crush one or two aspirin and mix with a little water to form a paste, which you can apply directly to the pimples, or you can dissolve 5-8 tablets in a few drops of water to make a face mask that will reduce redness and leave skin glowing., Baking soda is one of the best and safest home remedies for acne treatment. It contains anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, as well as being an effective exfoliant. Simply mix a teaspoon of baking powder with a little water to form a paste. You can then apply the paste to individual pimples as a spot treatment, or apply it all over the face as a mask., Finding an acne treatment that works for you can be a process of trial and error, but if you continue to suffer from breakouts, you should consider seeing a dermatologist who can provide stronger topical and oral acne medications. Getting rid of pimples once and for all will give you a major confidence boost and allow you to feel proud of your skin!

Apply the cleanser to your face.,
Rinse with lukewarm water.,
Pat your skin dry with a clean towel.,
Apply a moisturizer if necessary.,
Limit washing to twice a day, or after sweating.",How to Get Rid of Acne With Home Remedies1," You'll want a gentle face wash that is non-abrasive. Make sure that any product you use is free of alcohol to prevent further skin irritation. If you're unsure of what the best cleanser for you would be, ask your dermatologist for a recommendation., Cold water will close up your pores. While washing your face, you'll want your pores open so dirt, oil, and bacteria will flow out of your skin., Be sure to only use your fingertips when applying the cleanser. A washcloth or sponge will irritate your skin.Do not scrub your skin while washing your face. This will also irritate your face. Just apply the cleanser and allow it to sit for a minute or so.

, Again, make sure to use warm water to keep the pores open and allow dirt and bacteria to flow out of your skin., Do not rub your face with the towel. This can irritate your skin. Rubbing will also spread around bacteria and dirt, making your acne worse. Instead, just gently pat your face with the towel., While many people with acne would avoid moisturizers, your skin still needs moisture to stay healthy. Washing your face can lead to dryness. If you notice redness, burning, or itching, your skin may be dried out. Gently apply an oil-free moisturizer with your fingertips to help fight dryness after washing., While it may seem like more washing would be better for your acne, this isn't true. Washing too much will strip your skin of essential oils, which will dry out your skin and can even lead to premature aging. Repeat these steps only twice a day, morning and night. You should also wash your skin after sweating, since this can lead to breakouts."

Eat a diet high in omega-3s.,
Incorporate more vitamin A and D into your diet.,
Talk to your doctor about using herbs to help balance acne.",How to Balance Hormones for Acne2," Healthy and therapeutic lifestyle choices remain the mainstay of sensible treatment for most chronic conditions, including acne. Consuming recommended doses of omega-3 fatty acids can benefit those with hormonally-related acne. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a disorder associated with hormonally-related acne, may be effectively treated in part by switching to a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids and other anti-inflammatory foods. Food high in omega-3 fatty acids include:


Seeds and nuts: flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, chia seeds, butternuts, walnuts
Fish and fish oils: salmon, sardines, mackerel, whitefish, shad
Herbs and spices: basil, oregano, cloves, marjoram
Vegetables: spinach, sprouted radish seeds, chinese broccoli

, Vitamin A and vitamin D can help you treat your hormonal acne. They help balance hormones and promote skin health. You can take a supplement, but you can get your daily values from food. You can get enough vitamin D by spending 15 minutes in the sun.


Foods high in vitamin A include egg yolks, vegetables like sweet potato, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash, fruit like cantaloupe, mangoes, apricots, legumes, and meat and fish.Foods rich in Vitamin D include fish and cod liver oil, and dairy, like milk, yogurt, and cheese. Many foods are fortified with vitamin D., There are a number of different herbs that may be useful in rebalancing hormones in women with hormonal acne. For all the herbs listed, follow manufacturer’s instructions and always talk to your physician to determine if there may be interactions with any medications you may currently be taking.Consult with your doctor or a pharmacist for recommended brands when taking supplements. The supplement industry is not regulated by the FDA, so their purity and effectiveness has not been scientifically proven. Ask a medical professional about reputable brands.
Vitex agnus-castus or chasteberry is an herb traditionally used to balance female hormones. It has been shown very useful in treating Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) as well as Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and has been used to effectively treat hormonal acne.Maca is a root vegetable and has been traditionally used in South American native medicine. It has phytoestrogenic activity and may increase progesterone levels.Dong quai or Angelica sinensis is an herb used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and is known as a female ginseng. It has anti-inflammatory effects that may be helpful. Dong quai is commonly used during menopause to treat menopausal symptoms. It may promote progesterone secretion and inhibit estrogen secretions.Black cohosh or Cimicifuga racemosa is another herb traditionally used to balance female hormones, primarily during menopause, where it has been shown to be effective in reducing menopausal symptoms. Black cohosh has phytoestrogenic effects and has been used topically to treat hormonal acne."

Learn what causes hormonal acne.,
Identify the symptoms of hormonal acne.,
Determine the causes of acne.",How to Balance Hormones for Acne3," Many teenage and older women find that their skin gets worse right before their menstrual cycle, usually about 10 days before the period begins. Any acne that can be aggravated during different times of the menstrual cycle can be called hormonal acne.In the first half of the menstrual cycle, the prominent reproductive hormone is estrogen, and in the second half, the prominent hormone is progesterone, which stimulates the production of sebum. Additionally, the relative levels of testosterone increase, which stimulates even more sebum production.
In some young girls and women, the balance between these hormones is such that acne can flare up in those days before the period begins. In some, that balance can signal significant problems with the reproductive system while others will re-balance without using any hormonal treatment., Hormonal acne has a specific pattern so that you know when it’s going to pop up. This breakout usually occurs around the time of the menstrual cycle. Hormonal acne usually appears under the cheekbones and around the chin and mouth.Hormonal acne is generally painful, large, with pockets of pus. It’s usually resistant to any type of treatment.

, It is not always clear why acne occurs. Hormonal acne can be caused by an underlying condition, such as Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). A few common reasons for acne include reactions or sensitivities to chemicals in cosmetics or personal products, smoking, or sensitivity to dairy products and highly processed and sugary foods. It may also be due to inflammation from an underlying condition or bacterial infections.High levels or excess activity of the male hormone testosterone can cause acne. This can occur during the second half of the menstrual cycle. It is not necessarily a problem of too much testosterone; it may just be a matter of too much testosterone as compared to the levels of estrogen and progesterone.
Reduced fatty acid levels in the skin due to not enough essential fatty acids in the diet may also cause acne.
Acne commonly occurs in both male and female teens and young adults, but more women in their 30s, 40s, and 50s are getting acne

Visit your dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment options.,
Get a needling or rolling treatment.,
Try procedures like dermabrasion or microdermabrasion.,
Get steroid injections for raised scars.,
Try a chemical peel.,
Get soft tissue fillers for dimpled or puckered scars.,
Try botox injections to improve dimpling around scars.,
Have sporadic scars surgically excised.,
Consider trying a laser-based treatment, if recommended by your doctor.",How to Get Rid of Acne Scars on Your Chest1," Not everyone needs medical treatment to deal with acne scars, but visiting your dermatologist is a good first step in deciding on treatment. See your dermatologist for an exam to be sure you have acne scars and not another skin condition.Your doctor can then discuss your different treatment options with you, including the risks, possible side effects, and benefits of each, and if at-home remedies may suffice to deal with your scars.;
, Needling and rolling are non-invasive procedures that may minimize acne scarring. Your doctor will roll a needled device over your scars to stimulate the tissue underneath them. You will probably need multiple treatments to see results, but it’s a safe and effective scar treatment.Another small surgical procedure called subcision may help improve scar appearance. This is when your doctor loosens the fibers under your scar by inserting needles. This is a more invasive process than rolling, so talk to your doctor about what’s best for you.

, Dermabrasion is a minor medical process in which your skin is basically “sanded” with an abrasive, rotating brush. This allows newer, fresher skin beneath to shine through, appearing smoother and minimizing the uneven appearance of mild to moderate acne scars.Dermabrasion may cause some bleeding, and it takes about a week to heal; then some redness may occur for another 1-3 months. You’ll be required to follow some procedures afterwards such as avoiding certain products and direct sunlight. The outcome is usually quite good.
Microdermabrasion requires less downtime and may improve mild acne scars, but is not as effective as dermabrasion for reaching deeper layers of skin.
Dermaplaning is similar to dermabrasion, except that outer layers of skin are removed in small slices with a blade.

, Many body acne scars are raised, red, and lumpy – sometimes called keloid scars. Talk to your doctor about trying a series of injections of corticosteroids, which may decrease inflammation and minimize scars over time.Depending on how severe your scars are, you may need 2-4 rounds of treatment spaced several weeks apart.

, Your doctor will apply a potent acid to your skin to burn away the top layers, which lessens the depth or height of scars.This treatment works better on your face and hands than it does on your body, but deep peels can improve the appearance of shallow scars.A dermatological surgeon should do a good evaluation of your skin before you get a chemical peel. You should expect tenderness and peelings for up to 3 weeks, depending on the depth of the peel.


Chemical peels make your skin more sensitive to light for a while, so be sure to protect yourself from the sun.
You cannot get a chemical peel if you’re pregnant or nursing, have taken the medication Accutane within the last 6 months, or have an underlying skin condition such as eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea. You have to abstain from using retinoid products and bleaches for at least 48 hours before a chemical peel.

, Most acne scars on the chest are raised, but they can also be indentations in your skin. In this case, a filler injection can help improve the look and contour of your skin.Your doctor can inject collagen or fat beneath your dimpled scar to fill the skin and minimize the appearance of scarring.


The effects are temporary, so treatments need to be repeated periodically.

, Some scars can pull on the surrounding skin and cause dimpling or puckering. If this is a problem, your doctor may suggest getting botox injections in the surrounding skin to smooth it out. These treatments need to be repeated periodically., If you only have a few acne scars here and there, you can have them surgically removed. Your doctor can perform punch excision to remove scar tissue and then sew the wound or use a skin graft.Like any surgery, there is a risk of infection and other complications. This is not a good option for widely dispersed scarring.

, Laser- and light-based skin treatments can improve the look and contour of your skin, though it works best on fine lines and has questionable response with raised, lumpy body acne scars.However, laser therapy like Fraxel may soften scars over time, making them less visible.There are several devices that can be used, and healing time varies between them. Discuss this option with your dermatologist.Laser treatment goes by many names, including facial laser resurfacing, laser skin treatment, lasabrasion, laser peel, and laser vaporization.
A V beam vascular laser may decrease redness in scars by targeting the blood vessels within scars."

Use lemon juice on pimples.,
Experiment with honey.,
Mix up an apple cider vinegar toner.,
Mix a turmeric treatment.,
Rub tomatoes on your acne.,
Make a sea salt mixture.,
Use an egg white mask.,
Apply a yogurt mask to your face.",How to Get Rid of Acne With Home Remedies2," Tea tree oil is a pleasant-smelling essential oil derived from a tree native to Australia. There is clinical evidence that tea tree oil is effective against several skin conditions, including acne. It works as a natural astringent and can stimulate the immune system, making it an asset for your fight against acne.See How to apply for detailed instructions on how to use and apply tea tree oil.
Some people may be allergic to tea tree oil. Before using it on your face, test a drop of tea tree oil elsewhere, like your arm or leg. Wait several hours. If a rash develops, you may be allergic or sensitive to the oil, and should avoid putting it on your face.
Tea tree oil is toxic when consumed. Do not ingest tea tree oil.

, Lemon juice works as a natural disinfectant, which will kill bacteria that cause acne. It can also stimulate circulation to the skin, which will bring essential nutrients from your body to help fight acne. Follow these instructions to treat your acne with lemon juice.Wash your face normally.
Squeeze a large lemon into a bowl until you have about 2 teaspoons. Note that you may need to use a second lemon. Make sure to get the lemon juice by squeezing lemons instead of using store-bought juice- this usually contains preservatives that can irritate your face.
Use a cotton ball or Q-tip to apply the lemon juice to each one of your pimples.
If you do this treatment during the day, leave the juice on for at least 30 minutes, then rinse with cool water. If you are doing it at night, leave it on while you sleep, then wash it off with cool water in the morning.
Make sure you've removed the juice before going into the sun, as this can have a bleaching affect on your skin.

, Although there is conflicting evidence, some consider honey an effective treatment for acne because of its antibacterial properties. Advocates consider Manuka honey, harvested from New Zealand, and raw honey, to be the two best forms of honey for acne treatment. Both are available in health food stores and on the internet.Before applying honey to your acne, dab a small amount around your jawline. Wait about 30 minutes to see if you have an adverse reaction. If so, do not apply honey to your acne.
You may use honey in two ways. Either dab your pimples, or apply the honey to your whole face like a mask.

You could also add about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to your honey. This adds to its antibacterial properties and can promote circulation in your face.

, Apple cider vinegar helps to balance your skin's pH, leading to less blemishes and a more even tone. It also kills bacteria and can soften your skin. It is very simple to mix up a toner from apple cider vinegar.Thoroughly clean a glass bottle to store your toner in. Use only hot water and soap.

Apply the toner to pimples using a cotton ball.
Store the mixture in a cool, dry, dark place.
You could try applying apple cider vinegar to your skin without diluting it, but this is not recommended. The apple cider vinegar is harsh and can cause irritation if not diluted. If this mixture causes any irritation, try diluting with more water.

, Sea salt can help dry out your pimples and absorb excess oil. Mixed with honey, it can be an effective home remedy for acne.Mix 1 teaspoon of sea salt with 3 teaspoons of hot water.
Stir the mixture until the salt dissolves.
Add 1 teaspoon of honey and stir well.

Use bleaches and sunscreen to minimize color contrast.,
Try vitamin E oil.,
Use a lemon juice application.,
Try a natural exfoliant for mild, raised scars.,
Prevent chest acne.",How to Get Rid of Acne Scars on Your Chest2," Creams won’t really decrease your scarring, but you can use over-the-counter creams to bleach skin that has been darkened by scars, minimizing their appearance. Be sure to use sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher on your scarred area, as well, because scarred and unscarred skin tend to tan differently – scars are less noticeable when they blend in with the color of your surrounding skin., Some people find that rubbing vitamin E oil on their scars reduces their color and appearance.You can try this method by applying vitamin E oil to your scarred area, leaving it for 15-20 minutes, and washing it off with water. Do this regularly and watch for improvement.

, Wash your chest and pat the area dry. Use a cotton ball to rub fresh lemon juice onto your scarred area. Leave this on for about 10 minutes, then wash it off. This hasn’t been scientifically proven to decrease scarring, but doing this weekly may lighten the appearance of scars over time.Lemon juice can make your skin more sensitive, so always wear sunscreen on exposed areas when you’re outside.

, If you have mildly raised scars, you may benefit from using exfoliants made from natural ingredients – similar to a very mild at-home dermabrasion. Try periodically using one of the following natural remedies to see if scars appear smoother or lighter over time:Mix honey and a little milk to get a paste. Apply this to your scars and leave on for a few minutes before rubbing it off with a soft, clean washcloth in the shower.
Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water. Rub this onto your scars in a circular motion and leave it for 2 minutes. Wash it off with fresh, warm water.

, Preventing acne scars is easier than treating acne scars. See your dermatologist for medications as soon as you start to experience chest acne. You can also try to reduce your chest acne with natural remedies, such as:Do NOT pop your pimples. This can cause infection and worse scarring.

Wash your face thoroughly.,
Fill a sink or bowl with hot water.,
Hold your face over the steam for for 5-10 minutes.,
Wash your face with cold water.",How to Naturally Remove Blackheads (Steam and Towel Method)1," Steaming helps to relax and open the pores in your skin, which can help to clean them, but it also opens them up to more inflammation and can lock in any dirt already on your face. Before you steam your face, you need to wash it with room temperature water thoroughly, getting any dirt, grime, make-up, and oils off of your skin before you start. Never steam your face before cleaning your face.;
, You can steam your skin in any clean bowl, sink, or other water basin. It's usually done by draping a towel over your face and the sink creating a tent to trap the steam and heat inside, softening your skin and opening your pores.


Make sure you clean the surface of the water basin thoroughly with soap, and rinse it out before you attempt to steam your face. In the past it was thought that antibacterial soap would be helpful, but newer studies have shown that antibacterial soaps can cause superbugs, that is why ordinary detergent or soap is recommended. This will remove germs stuck to the bottom of your sink and you can be reassured that you will not vaporize germs.

, Relax and breathe deeply, enjoying the effect of the steam. This is a common feature of spa treatments, helping also to relieve sinus problems and other respiratory issues.


It's important that you do this for no more than 5-10 minutes at a time, and no more than once or twice a week. Over-steaming your face can eventually dry it out, which can eventually result in your skin over-producing oil to try to make up for the lack of moisture in your skin.

, To close your skin back up, rinse your face with cold water and moisturize, using a natural moisturizer. It's important to use cold water to close your pores gently and naturally, not products made from glycerine and alcohol, which can be extremely irritating to sensitive skin.

Drink plenty of water throughout the day.,
Eat enough good fats.,
Include proteins in your diet.,
Eat vitamin A.,
Cut artificial sugars out of your diet.",How to Get Rid of Acne With Home Remedies4," Water is one of your skin's absolutely essential needs. Water flushes toxins out of your body and also improves circulation, both of which are helpful in the fight against acne. Drink water whenever you become thirsty. A good rule of thumb to use is looking at the color of your urine: if it's mostly clear, you've had enough water; if it's yellowish, aim to get more water in your diet., While fatty foods are often considered bad for acne, there are good fats that help fight acne. Omega-3 fatty acids help keep the skin flexible, which drains sebum out of the pores. This will cut down on the oil that is associated with acne.For good fats, eat nuts, cold-water fish, and avocados.

, The body uses the amino acids from protein to produce collagen. This nutrient helps keep the skin healthy and hydrated.Good sources of protein include seafood, poultry, dairy products, and eggs, as well as beans and soy., This particular vitamin helps cut down on the oil your skin produces. Good sources include sweet potato, carrots, dark green vegetables, and sweet peppers., Sugar stimulates levels of insulin in your blood, which can in turn increase the amount of oil your skin produces. Limit your intake of junk foods and soft drinks to cut the amount of sugar in your system."

Reduce your stress level.,
Get enough sleep.,
Exercise regularly.,
Stop using heavy cosmetics.",How to Get Rid of Acne With Home Remedies5," Scientific evidence finds a correlation between a high stress level and acne breakouts. The same cells that make sebum, which is the oily substance that gives you acne, have receptors for stress hormones. This can lead to breakouts when you're feeling overwhelmed. There are a multitude of activities you can use to cut your stress, which is beneficial for your health overall.Meditation. Spend just a few minutes a day sitting with your eyes closed and focusing on your breathing. This will help your body and mind unwind, reducing your stress levels and hopefully cutting down on your acne.
Listen to music. While soothing music helps your body relax and stay calm, any playlist of music you enjoy can distract you from your stress and put you in a positive mood.
Exercise. This will release endorphins and put you in a better mood. Even a simple walk is enough to de-stress your body and mind.
Don't bottle up your feelings. If you're feeling overwhelmed, reach out and talk to others. This will help you work out your problems in a constructive way.

, Although the connection between sleep and acne is not entirely clear, most doctors agree that insufficient sleep puts you at greater risk for psychological stress. This will make your acne worse and is bad for your skin overall. Commit to getting 8 hours of sleep a night to give your skin a healthy boost., Besides reducing stress, exercise helps your acne by stimulating circulation to your skin. This brings essential nutrients to your skin and pulls toxins away, helping in the fight against acne. Doctors usually recommend 30-60 minutes of physical activity daily to keep yourself in healthy shape.Remember to wash your face after exercising to get sweat and dirt out of your pores.

, These will clog your pores and make acne symptoms worse."

Only use gentle cleaning techniques.,
Consider using home remedies to cleanse your skin.,
Use natural moisturizers.,
Never squeeze your blackheads.,
Use coconut oil.,
Eat a diet free of dairy products and sugar.",How to Naturally Remove Blackheads (Steam and Towel Method)2," If you want to remove blackheads naturally, it's important to separate the astringent cleaners from the gentle cleaners to keep your skin as healthy as possible. It's likely you'll want to avoid harsh, alcohol-based cleaners, as well as chemical-based commercial cleansers.


It's also important to be gentle with your skin as you wash. Don't pick at your blackheads, or scrub your skin vigorously. Only use gentle scrubbing, even if you're exfoliating. You don't need to dig at your skin to keep it clean.

, Done properly and applied in the correct way, home remedies can be crafted using a wide variety of ingredients that are effective at tightening, soothing, and exfoliating your skin, making your skin more inhospitable to blackheads.

, Using natural-based moisturizers is essential to healthy skin. While many associate oiliness with blackheads, it's true that using excessive products that dry out your skin will actually end up making your skin oilier in the long run. Remember to moisturize regularly with natural plant-based oils and moisturizers to keep your skin healthy.

, Again, this can't be overstressed. Do not squeeze, strip, or pick at your blackheads. They cannot be removed entirely or permanently, and attempting to do so is bad for your skin. However, skin specialists may sometimes use a comedone remover, which is available in surgical supply stores; this applies pressure only around the comedone with minimal pressure, so the rest of the skin does not get damaged.

, Coconut oil contains medium chain fatty acids, which are bactericidal and kill acne bacteria. They also function as a natural moisturizer and prevent comedones from forming. Buy organic coconut oil and use a thin film on your face once a day., It has been known for decades that only people in civilized countries come down with comedones and acne. In native populations of Brazil and Japan where food is eaten containing no milk products, sugar and starchy foods, there is no acne."

Keep hair clean.,
Wash twice daily.,
Use over-the-counter medications.,
Apply a moisturizer.,
Use non-comedogenic cosmetics.,
Try a clay mask once per week.",How to Get Rid of Teenage Acne1," This step is especially important for teens with long hair. Oily hair or hair products in constant contact with the face can help clog pores. Even those with short hair can see blemishes around the hairline due to oily hair or hair products. Wash your hair regularly and try to keep your hair off of your face as much as possible., One of the biggest causes of teenage acne is increased oil production based on hormonal changes. Washing your face once a day can still leave oil and dirt behind to clog pores. Instead wash once in the morning and once in the evening with warm water and a mild oil-free cleanser.Use clean fingertips and not a washcloth to clean your face.Do not use a regular bar soap or body wash. Always use a gentle cleanser especially formulated for facial skin.
Do not over wash. Washing the face more than twice a day can dry out the skin, which can actually cause the oil glands to go into overdrive production and make the acne worse.It can take anywhere from four-to-eight weeks of a daily regimen before you notice a significant difference., Depending on the severity of your acne, you should also use an over-the-counter medication once or twice a day. The two most commonly used OTC acne treatments are benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.OTC medications come in gels, lotions, creams, soaps, and pads.Gels and creams are good for spot treatments of problem areas whereas pads, soaps, and lotions are more commonly used on the entire face.
In addition to clearing pores, benzoyl peroxide has antibacterial qualities that makes it more difficult for the acne-causing p. acnes bacteria. And benzoyl peroxide reduces inflammation (which causes redness and swelling) of the skin.Benzoyl peroxide formulations are usually a 2.5% to 10% solution and salicylic acid formulations are usually 2% solutions., Since the additional washing and OTC medications can dry out skin, you want to add a daily moisturizer to your regimen. A standard lotion can have oils that will clog pores as well, so find an oil-free moisturizer that is nonacnegenic or non-comedogenic.These words simply mean that the product will not cause acne or clog pores.


If you apply a moisturizer for daytime use, then you should find one with an SPF of 30 as well., While certain cosmetics like eye makeup and lipstick aren’t likely to cause acne trouble, others such as blushes and foundations can clog pores and worsen acne.Make sure than any cosmetics applied to the face say they are non-comedogenic, which means that they will not clog pores. Many major brands provide such products, so they are not difficult to find., Using a clay mask once per week may help to eliminate excess oil and dirt, which may help with acne. You can find clay masks in most drug stores.


Apply the mask to clean skin and leave it on until it dries completely, which takes about 10 to 15 minutes.
Then, rinse off the mask using lukewarm water and your fingertips.
Pat your face with a clean, dry towel and apply moisturizer after you remove the mask.

Consult a dermatologist.,
Ask about birth control.,
Ask about acne-treating antibiotics.,
Discuss other topical prescription options.,
Ask about isotretinoin.,
Look into other treatments that might be helpful for you.",How to Get Rid of Teenage Acne2," If you have persistent acne that doesn’t respond to the first method or if you have severe, cystic acne, then you should consider meeting with a dermatologist who can prescribe other medications.

, For many women, certain birth control medications can help regulate acne-causing hormones. Since hormones are the initial cause of acne, regulating these hormones can lead to decreased breakouts., Oral antibiotics can decrease the amount of the p. acnes bacteria on your skin, which can decrease inflammation.Oral or topical antibiotics may be one of the first treatments that a dermatologist recommends for persistent acne.


Antibiotic treatments will usually require daily dosages for four-to-six months. After which point, they will be tapered off., In addition to some topical antibiotics, a dermatologist may want to prescribe other topical medications. These can range from prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide to azelaic acid or tazarotene and other retinoids.Most of these medications are meant to reduce skin lesions and inflammation associated with acne.
Another topical medication called Dapsone gel (Aczone) is especially helpful for hormonal acne in women.

, Isotretinoin is one of the most effective acne treatments available. However, it’s also the medication with some of the most serious potential side effects and risks, and usage is closely monitored.Isotretinoin actually shrinks the size of oil glands, which causes them to produce less oil.Side effects of isotretinoin include increased risk of depression, and it has also been tied to birth defects, so women who are pregnant will not be prescribed the medication. Other side effects may include very dry skin, dry eyes, and increased risk of sunburn.
In addition, women who could become pregnant need to take birth control or abstain from sex about one month before, during, and for one to two months after taking Isotretinoin. They also need to take monthly pregnancy tests during this time.
The medication is typically taken once or twice a day for sixteen-to-twenty weeks with results that are often permanent., If topical and oral medications do not work for you, then you may want to consider other types of treatments for your acne. Ask your dermatologist about your options, which may include:Laser or light treatments, such as photodynamic therapy.
Chemical peels.
Extraction of blackheads and whiteheads.
Microdermabrasion.

Pick something that makes you feel good.,
Try a classic no-bra top or dress.,
Look for items with built-in bras and support.,
Consider starting with a layered braless look.",How to Dress With No Bra1," The most important thing to consider when choosing how to dress without a bra is how an outfit will make you feel. Don’t wear anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious. Choose something that flatters your body, suits your style, and makes you feel great when you put it on.


For example, if wearing low cut tops makes you feel self-conscious, then this is probably not the best braless clothing choice for you. You might consider a low-back top or spaghetti strap dress instead.;
, There are some types of tops and dresses that don’t look as good with a bra, so wearing these when you go braless might be a good idea. Try wearing low back and backless tops, or go for a strapless or spaghetti strap dress or top. Some other items that might look better without a bra include:


Dresses and tops with plunging necklines.
Tops with laced-up fronts, backs, or sides.
Tops and dresses with keyholes in the back.
Halter tops and tube tops.

, Some items of clothing have built-in bras, breast cups, or elastic bands that eliminate the need for a bra. Try looking for clothes that have some built-in support to make going braless a little easier.


A tank top with a built-in bra may make a convenient undershirt while you’re transitioning into bralessness. Even once you’re accustomed to not wearing a bra, a shelf tank can make a great undershirt when you need one (with a thin, vintage T-shirt, for example).A bodysuit or leotard makes a cute addition to a braless outfit. Wear a thin button-down top or lacy sweater over it for a breezy, classic look. Bonus: bodysuits and leotards provide some built-in support for your breasts.

, Layers are great without a bra because they can hide your bralessness. This wardrobe technique is especially useful in the wintertime. For this reason, winter might even be the best time to try going braless, if you’re nervous about the transition.A thick sweater will hide your nipples, so this might be a good braless clothing choice if you are worried about your nipples showing.
A T-shirt over or under a long-sleeve shirt is also a great braless combo.
A jacket or cardigan is also a great option for layering your braless look. These can be a lifesaver when it gets cold or windy, or when it rains unexpectedly."
"
Wear nipple covers or tape to hide your nipples.,
Wear thick fabric tops.,
Choose dark colors.,
Use toupee tape to keep your neckline in place.,
Use tape to keep your breasts in place.",How to Dress With No Bra2," One way to prevent your nipples from being visible through your clothing is to cover them up with nipple tape or pasties.You can find these in the lingerie section of most department stores or in lingerie specialty stores.


To use pasties, remove the adhesive from the pasty and apply it over your nipple.
To use nipple tape, apply a couple of strips over your nipples in the form of an X.
You can also try silicone nipple covers. These are reusable and they will stick to your body without adhesive or glue. These work with just about every kind of fabric and every cut of clothing.

, Avoid clothing that is made with thin or sheer fabric. Thin fabric could expose your nipples, especially if the fabric is a light color. If you want to wear a top or dress like this without a bra, try wearing it over an undershirt or slip.Silk or satin tops might not be a good choice when you go braless because the material is thin and it may be too revealing.

, Dark colors are less likely to become see through in bright light or if your shirt becomes wet. If you will be outside on a sunny day or there’s a chance of rain, wear tops that are made with dark fabric. Otherwise, your nipples may be visible through the fabric.Fabric with patterns, especially small patterns, may also help to conceal your nipples.

, You may feel more confident if you tape the neckline of a low cut top or dress to your chest. This will help to prevent the fabric from slipping and showing your nipples. Toupee tape is ideal for keeping your neckline in place.Place the tape along the edges of your neckline and then press the other side of the tape against your skin to hold it in place.
Tape can’t make up for clothing that just doesn’t fit right. If you’re going to go without a bra, it’s essential that you make sure your clothes fit properly., Surgical tape is a heavy-duty tape made to stick to skin, so it works well for taping over your nipples and keeping your breasts in place when you go braless. You can find surgical tape in drug stores. To properly apply surgical tape:


Lean over slightly to lift your breasts. Apply a strip of tape 12 to 16 inches long from the side of one breast (near the armpit) to the other side, with the middle of the tape running along the underside of your breasts and pulling them together.
Stand up straight and apply another strip of tape horizontally across your breasts, pulling them together, so that the tape covers your nipples. Each end of the second piece of tape should touch the ends of the first strip of tape.
Taping is uncomfortable, so it is best to save this for special occasions. However, for some types of clothing, occasional taping may be worth the discomfort."
"
Consider your clothes.,
Examine the situation.,
Don’t worry about sagging.,
Ease into bralessness.",How to Dress With No Bra3," You may want to consider going braless in tops or dresses which your bra would peek out of if you wore one. Deep plunging necklines, large keyholes in the back, and backless tops or dresses are all items of clothing that look better when worn without a bra.


Tops or dresses with thin or no straps can usually be worn with a strapless bra.
Not all fabrics are suitable for bralessness. Thin or lacy fabrics will leave your nipples exposed, and some fabrics, like wool or stiff cotton, may irritate your skin. Synthetic fabrics like Lycra or nylon tend to work well without a bra.

, There are some situations where you might be expected to wear a bra. Job interviews, court appearances, or meeting your partner’s parents for the first time might not be the best times to go braless. If you decide not to wear a bra, think about the situation first and decide if you will feel comfortable going braless.Remember that you can dress your body however you like. If going braless makes you feel more comfortable, then you should do it. Don’t let anyone make you feel bad about your body—ever., There is no evidence that going without a bra makes your breasts sag earlier, and no evidence that wearing a bra keeps them from sagging. Several recent studies have even found that going braless regularly may actually help your breasts to become perkier.Keep in mind that it is still important to wear a sports bra when you exercise. Sports bras help to keep your breasts in place, which is important when you are moving and jumping a lot.

, If you want to start going without a bra more often, you may experience some discomfort since your breasts aren’t used to being free to move. To ease into bralessness, try trading in your padded underwire for one without pads or underwires. Or, you can go braless at night and around the house until you feel comfortable without your bra on."

Talk to your doctor first.,
Obtain the proper kind of hydrogen peroxide.,
Wash your face using your normal daily routine.,
Apply the hydrogen peroxide to your clean skin.,
Apply oil-free moisturizer.",How to Clear up Acne With Hydrogen Peroxide1," Consult your doctor or dermatologist before trying hydrogen peroxide for your acne. Many experts don't recommend using hydrogen peroxide for acne due to it's irritating and drying potential. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a chemical which can act as both a bleach and a disinfectant. Our bodies actually produce small quantities of hydrogen peroxide to help attract white blood cells to areas where there’s an infection. Because of its disinfectant abilities, hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria. But it isn’t selective in what bacteria it kills, and our bodies contain a lot of necessary and healthy bacteria., You can use hydrogen peroxide to clear acne using one of two methods: in a cream, which contains a concentration of up to 1% hydrogen peroxide; and in “pure” liquid form, which should contain no more than a 3% concentration. Hydrogen peroxide can come in concentrations higher than 3%, but those higher concentrations should never be used on your skin.Hydrogen peroxide in a 3% concentration can almost always be found in a drugstore, near the first aid supplies. If you are only able to find hydrogen peroxide in larger concentrations (normally 35%) you will need to dilute it with water before using it on your face. To dilute a 35% concentration to 3%, you’ll need 11 parts of water for every one part of hydrogen peroxide.If you use the cream version, follow the instructions on the package as to how to apply it to your face, and how often.

, If you have acne, this should include using a gentle soap and only your hands — not cloths or brushes. Wash your face using warm water to help open the pores before cleansing and using the hydrogen peroxide. Dry your face completely before applying the hydrogen peroxide. Dry skin will absorb the hydrogen peroxide better than wet skin., Use a cotton pad, cotton ball or even a Q-Tip, soak it in the hydrogen peroxide, and move it over the affected areas of your skin. Do not apply it to unaffected areas. Leave it to soak into your skin for 5-7 minutes.Try out a small amount on a small area of your skin before putting it over larger areas to make sure your skin can tolerate it and that it doesn't cause too much irritation. And if it is too irritating to your skin, talk to your doctor about a different option.
Do not apply hydrogen peroxide to the skin more than once a day.

, After the hydrogen peroxide has soaked into your skin, gently apply a high-quality, oil-free facial moisturizer. One of the reasons that hydrogen peroxide works on acne is because it helps dry up the excess oil on your skin. A moisturizer helps ensure you do not completely dry out your skin and keeps your skin soft and smooth."
"
Try benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.,
Tone your skin with lemon juice.,
Use tea tree oil.,
Create a baking soda paste.",How to Clear up Acne With Hydrogen Peroxide2," Benzoyl peroxide is similar to hydrogen peroxide in that it can act as an antibacterial agent and it can help dry out excess oil on your skin.Salicylic acid helps reduce inflammation and unclog pores, which in turn helps reduce or eliminate pimples.Both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid can be found as the main active ingredient in topical skin treatments (i.e. creams or lotions) or cleansers designed specifically to treat acne. There are a large number of options available over-the-counter at your local drug store.It can take six to eight weeks before such treatments start to show serious results, so be patient. If you do not notice any difference after 10 weeks, consider trying something else.

, Lemon juice works as both an antibacterial agent and an exfoliant. It not only kills the bacteria that causes acne, but it help remove excess oil and dead skin from your face. Lemon juice can also act as a natural bleach and can help lighten acne scars over time. After you’ve washed your face using your normal daily routine, apply one to two teaspoons of pure lemon juice to the affected areas of your skin using a cotton pad or ball. Leave for at least 30 minutes. If you do this before bed, you can let the lemon juice dry and simply to go bed. If it’s during the day, rinse the lemon juice off your face with cold water.Apply your normal daily facial moisturizer when your face is dry.


Be careful using lemon juice if you have open sores, as lemon juice can cause stinging if applied to open sores.
Due to the skin lightening effects, you should not use lemon juice if you have naturally dark skin.

, Tea tree oil is a natural ingredient that works as an antibacterial to kill the bacteria that causes acne. It is also gentler on your skin that many other more acidic treatments. You can use 100% pure tea tree oil directly on pimples after you’ve washed your face, or you can mix it with either aloe vera gel or honey to create a cream that can be used for spot treatments.Make your very own facial scrub by mixing ½ cup of sugar, one tablespoon of honey, ¼ cup of olive or sesame oil and 10 drops of tea tree oil together. Once mixed you can apply it to your skin and scrub for three minutes to help exfoliate your skin, then rinse off with warm water.
For some people with acne, tea tree oil can be too irritating, so try it out in a small area before using it all over, and stop using it if it causes significant irritation to your skin.

, Baking soda is a great natural exfoliant, and it is very inexpensive. You can mix baking soda with warm water until it forms a paste, and then apply the paste to your face like mask for up to 15 minutes. Before rinsing off the mask, make sure you very gently scrub it into your skin to help remove excess oil and dead skin cells. You can also add a teaspoon of baking soda to your non-exfoliating facial cleanser before washing your face. The baking soda will add exfoliation properties to your cleanser."

Consult a dermatologist regarding topical treatments.,
Ask a dermatologist about oral antibiotics.,
Ask for medical extractions.,
Look into getting a chemical peel.,
Get a cortisone injection.,
Ask about light therapy.,
Discuss the option of an oral retinoid with a dermatologist.",How to Clear up Acne With Hydrogen Peroxide3," Discuss, and show, your specific acne problem to a dermatologist and work with him to develop a personalized treatment plan for your specific situation. Several topical treatments (i.e. creams, lotions, gels, etc.) are available via a dermatologist that may work for your acne. Those treatments may include:Topical antibiotics that you can dab onto your problem areas to help control the bacteria that is causing your acne.
Topical retinoid medications, which are made from vitamin A and can help unclog your pores, and they can also help antibiotics work more effectively.

, Oral antibiotics (i.e. pill form) are also available from your dermatologist for acne problems, should your dermatologist deem them a good treatment plan for you. These antibiotics would be similar to those you’d take if you had any other type of infection, such as a bladder infection. They’d help to kill the bacteria that is causing your acne.


Some doctors may also consider prescribing oral contraceptives (i.e. birth control pills) to young women with acne problems. Some low-dose oral contraceptives, which contain a combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin, can actually help control and reduce the amount of acne on your skin., You’ve probably heard people telling you not to pop your own pimples (and they're right) — but this doesn’t mean that a doctor can’t do it for you! Medical extractions area a safe way to clean out infected pores without the increased risk of scaring that can happen when popping pimples on your own. Since medical extractions focus on specific pimples, you will probably need to go back to the doctor again if you suffer from another breakout.Spas that offer facials specifically for helping clear up acne may also perform extractions, and this option is certainly better than doing it yourself. However, you may want to ask the aesthetician what type of products they’re using on your skin during the facial to ensure they don’t end up clogging your pores all over again!

, Chemical peels must be done by a trained professional. That professional will use a high concentration solution of something like salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to remove the top layers of skin on your face (or elsewhere on your body where you have problems). The removal of these layers of skin helps clear up excess oil and dead skin to help your pores work properly.Chemical peels should not be done to people who are also taking oral retinoids (like isotretinoin) as the combination of the two products can cause your skin to become severely irritated.
While the effect of one chemical peel may show results for you, chances are you will need more than one to achieve a lasting effect.

, Cortisone is an anti-inflammatory steroid medication that can be injected right into an acne lesion. The cortisone will reduce the swelling of the lesion acne within 24–48 hours after the injection. Obviously, because it’s being injected directly into a specific pimple, it is more of a spot treatment than an overall solution and is normally not used for those with severe acne., Light therapy has shown some promise for people suffering from acne, but it is still a “work-in-progress”. The idea behind light therapy is that certain types of light (i.e. blue light) can target specific bacteria that causes acne and help reduce the inflammation in your pores. Most light therapy is done by a professional, in a clinic. But there are some at-home solutions available as well.Similarly, several lasers have been used to help clear acne breakouts and improve scars.

, Isotretinoin, which is an oral retinoid, can help reduce the amount of sebum your pores produce, which in turn will help reduce inflammation and acne.However, isotretinoin, which is also known as Accutane, is normally used by doctors as a last resort for patients with severe acne who who haven’t responded to other methods of treatment. If it is prescribed, it is normally only taken for four to five months.Isotretinoin has some very serious side effects. It can increase the amount of fat in your blood to risky levels, and it can impact the function of your liver. It can also cause serious dryness to your skin, especially your lips and areas where you have acne. Doctors will usually test your blood regularly to monitor these potential side effects.
The most serious side effect of isotretinoin is birth defects. Obviously this means it should never be taken if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant, or are trying to get pregnant. If you are sexually active while taking isotretinoin, you must protect yourself with at least two forms of birth control to ensure you do not get pregnant."

Reduce stress.",How to Get Rid of a Breakout," Use your hands instead of a washcloth, which can irritate your skin and wash with a gentle cleanser. Use lukewarm water, since hot water can dry out and irritate your skin. If you use water that is too cold, then your pores can close up.You should wash your face twice a day, probably once in the morning and once at night to remove makeup. Avoid washing your breakout too much, because doing this can irritate your skin and actually make it worse.
Use a gentle cleanser. Acne prone skin is sensitive, so use a soap or face wash that is gentle to skin. Choose soaps that are ""gentle"" or ""sensitive"", and if possible choose unscented over perfumed.;
, Use a very soft towel and carefully pat your face dry. Do not rub the towel over your skin. Then, softly apply a non-cosmedogenic moisturizer, which is designed to not clog pores., You may opt to look to your kitchen before purchasing acne treatments. While many of these lack scientific backing, many people claim they help clear up breakouts.


As with any acne treatment, watch your skin for signs of irritation after trying any new treatment.
Lemon juice is a popular at home treatment. Simply dab your blemishes with a cotton ball soaked in lemon juice. Let sit for thirty minutes, then rinse with cold water. Lemon juice is a disinfectant that can kill the bacteria causing acne. It is also a natural exfoliant and can lighten the skin which can hide inflammation from blemishes.Honey is well known for its antiseptic and antibacterial properties. While you can apply it directly to the skin, let sit, and then rinse off with water, you can also make an herbal honey mask. Combine honey with milk, applesauce, yogurt, aloe vera, or egg white and apply to your skin. Let sit and then rinse off with water.Avoid using toothpaste, which can actually trigger pimples and cause allergic reactions.Likewise, you should avoid applying crushed aspirin, since it could also irritate your skin., Most stores which carry health and beauty products will also have acne treatments. Common ingredients for these products include benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and tea tree oil. Pay attention to how your skin reacts and stop using if you notice inflammation, irritation, or dryness.


Benzoyl Peroxide is used to kill bacteria that can cause acne, but it may take up to four weeks to notice results. Salicylic Acid can unclog pores and reduce redness or swelling. It too requires time and constant use. Tea Tree Oil is also a milder way to kill bacteria that causes acne. Be sure to dilute it before applying.Most moderate acne will require a combination of treatments. If your acne doesn't start clearing up after about six weeks, you may need to get a prescription for a systemic treatment.
Often, there is no simple way to know what will work for you, as what works with one person will not work for another. A lot will come down to trial and error.
In general, it is best to try a product with a lower dose of active ingredient, rather than go for the higher. The more active ingredient, the more likely there will be drying, irritation, or other reactions.

, If over-the-counter treatments are not enough, you may need to go to a medical professional, such as your general practitioner or dermatologist. A general practitioner may be able to rule out other conditions that can be confused with acne, look at your overall approach, and prescribe medications like antibiotics or Retin-A. Dermatologists are experts in treating skin conditions, and can also be helpful in coming up with the right treatment for you.


Oral treatments are often prescribed by a dermatologist and include antibiotics, retinoids or vitamin A derivatives, and oral contraceptives (for females). Oral treatments are used for moderate to severe acne and may have noticeable side effects.Antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat the inflammation of severe acne. Most oral antibiotics are used for less than six months, since your they will gradually lose effectiveness. For this reason, oral antibiotics are often used in addition to other treatments that focus on the cause of your acne.Examples of oral antibiotics include tetracycline, minocycline, and doxycycline.
Oral retinoids or vitamin A derivatives are reserved for the most severe acne that has not responded to other treatment. Side effects of Isotretinoin include increased risk of depression, suicide, and inflammatory bowel disease. Pregnant, nursing, or women not using contraception should never take Isotretinoin due to the risk of severe birth defects.Oral contraceptives can only be used by women since they contain ""female"" hormones that counteract ""male"" hormones that can trigger acne. (Both men and women have these hormones, but an imbalance can trigger acne). Although uncommon, side effects can be noticeable and in some cases, treatment must be agreed to by your gynecologist. Like oral antibiotics, oral contraceptives will only be effective for several months before gradually losing potency., Be sure to hold ice in a soft paper towel to avoid a mess and hold it in place for just a minute or two., Use an oil-free and non-comedogenic concealer that will provide enough coverage to hide the breakout. Be sure it is close enough to your skin tone to not be noticeable. You may be able to find a concealer with salicylic acid. Very gently blend the concealer into the area surrounding the blemish so that the makeup is not noticeable.


If you can, try to avoid using makeup during a breakout. Makeup tends to clog pores, even if advertised as non-comedogenic. This can help your skin heal faster and can prevent further irritation from the fragrance, oil, and chemicals in makeup.
If you cannot avoid make-up, try to take it off as soon as feasible. Just using soap and water may not be enough. Be gentle when washing your face with lukewarm water and a mild cleanser, but be sure to remove every last trace of the day's makeup.Do this every day to help your skin heal. Be sure to rinse off every bit of cleanser too.

, This should be applied evenly all over your face to create a uniform tone. Avoid using heavy foundation with powder and blush, as these can be harsh on your already sensitive skin.Keep your makeup minimal during a breakout.

, Makeup brushes should be washed and air dried weekly to prevent bacteria from growing.Wash your pillowcases once a week (or more) since oil from your face and hair will build up. Frequently wipe down your cell phone with disinfecting wipes since it comes into direct contact with your skin., You may have heard that eating greasy food causes breakouts, but that is untrue.On the other hand, eating fresh fruits and vegetables containing lots vitamin A can improve your complexion.Some foods that are high in vitamin A include sweet potatoes, carrots, dark leafy greens, dried apricots, melons, and tuna.

, These make your blood sugar spike which triggers insulin production. Insulin production also leads to oil production which can clog up your pores., While stress itself does not actually cause acne, it can lead to a more noticeable breakout. Find relaxing things to do on a regular basis. Meditation, exercise, reading, or learning a new skill are great things to add to your schedule and might keep the breakouts at bay.


Stressing about acne can make it even worse. Not only will your mental state aggravate acne, but getting too aggressive about treating acne (such as scrubbing, harsh chemicals, or too frequent washing) can also aggravate the problem.
Typically, you are the only person who notices your own acne. Other people will usually not scrutinize your skin as closely as you do.
Use your acne regimen as an opportunity to relax and take care of yourself. The actions of washing the face, drying the face, and smoothing on moisturizer all massage and can help you feel good. It can be a calming ritual in your day. Slow down and enjoy. An approach like this can help you relax, feel good about taking care of your skin, and make you feel better about yourself.
A typical acne breakout will generally resolve itself within a few days, even if untreated.
If you take on a new sport or like to exercise, be sure to wear loose fitting clothing so that your skin doesn't come into prolonged contact with sweat. Also, shower immediately after so that the oil and bacteria doesn't sit on your skin."

Know and understand the effects of color.,
Keep the jewelry conservative.,
Avoid trying to look sexy or cute in the office.",How to Dress Your Best at Work," If you're currently a paralegal, but you aspire to be a lawyer one day, then dress like a lawyer.

Get a feel for the atmosphere at your school.,
Consider the age and stage of your students.,
Wear slacks or a skirt, if in doubt.,
Pick out a blouse or a dress shirt, to be safe.,
Consider bringing a cardigan or sweater.,
Pick shoes that go with the outfit.,
Keep in mind exceptions.,
Dress up more when the occasional calls for it.,
Pick a professional style.,
Tame your locks.,
Avoid any style elements that make you seem young.",How to Dress when You're a Teacher," Some schools are much more formal than others, so it helps to know how your fellow teachers, administrators, and even the students are going to dress before you pick your outfits. For example, teachers will likely dress more formally in a private school with a uniform and strict dress code than they will in a more loose public school setting where the kids dress very casually, too.;
, A teacher has to dress far differently to teach preschool, compared to high school. Are you going to be doing art projects, changing diapers, and getting messy? If so, a more casual look is warranted. Are you going to be teaching AP classes and meeting with parents to discuss student progress? Then a more formal look is a good idea.

, Most schools these days are okay with teachers wearing jeans; however, if you're in doubt, a pair of dark or beige slacks or a fairly professional skirt is never a bad idea.


If you do wear jeans, make sure they're on the formal side of the spectrum. Avoid jeans with holes, patches, or lots of fading, and stick to dark and more conservative styles. Leave the sagging to your students.

, Again, most school are okay with teachers wearing t-shirts. However, if the school is new to you, and if you want to project an air of professionalism and stand out from your students, picking a nice blouse or shirt is a good idea. You probably don't need to bother with a dress or a blazer and tie, but find the middle ground on formality, depending on what's normal at your school.


If you do wear t-shirts, make sure any slogans and logos are school-appropriate. You're setting the standard for students, so avoid anything that anyone might find offensive.

, Many school have air-conditioning that can result in cold classrooms and meeting rooms! Bringing along a cover-up that suits the formality of your outfit is a good idea.

, Avoid sneakers unless you're doing a ""dressed down"" look with jeans. They do not look presentable with pants like slacks for men or women, so if you're going for a more professional vibe, wear some ""business casual"" loafers or flats.


Avoid heels for most teaching positions; it generally seems over-the-top, and heels are a bad idea if you're working with young kids and need to be able to move and react quickly.

, There are some exceptions to the guidelines - for example, if you're a gym teacher and coach, you can probably wear sweatpants or a track suit. You can also wear sneakers.


If you're a preschool or kindergarten teacher, that's another reason to go more informal. If you're going to be painting and playing with play dough all day, avoid formal clothing that will stop you from participating fully with your students. Parents will understand your being less dressed up in that setting, since being willing to ""get dirty"" makes you a more interactive and fun teacher!

, If you're doing Back to School Night or hosting parent conferences, it doesn't hurt to dress up just a little more formally. You're meeting parents and want to make a good impression. Plus, some of them might be coming from very formal work settings; you'll seem more professional to them if you dress it up a little bit, sticking with skirts/slacks and maybe adding a blazer or jacket to your look.

, The choice is easier for men with short hair or women with one go-to style (like a bob haircut). If you have longer hair, try to keep it tamed and professional, but avoid a big up-do or something that might look either too youthful (like your students) or too glamorous.

, Your hair can be loose or in a bun, or you can even keep it down, as long as it doesn't get in your way. You can do a ponytail; just avoid anything that looks like you think you're attending the Oscars or a ballroom dance. Keep it professional but not too glamorous.

, You want to project an air of professionalism and stand apart from your students; this can be particularly difficult if you're a young teacher. To keep things professional, avoid using bright hair dye or adding feathers or other vibrant hair accessories. It's best to keep things simple.

If you don't have a suit jacket, then wear a vest and roll up the sleeves of your collared shirt.
Either wear a white collared shirt with a black tie or a black collared shirt with a white tie.
Wear a pair of black or brown dress shoes.;
, Find a black, white, gray, or pinstriped fedora. A popular look among traditional mobsters was to wear a black hat with white trim, or white hat with gray trim.


Be sure that the hat matches your suit. Again, stick with neutral colors like black, white, grey, and brown.

, Toy guns can be purchased from Halloween stores or toy stores. Consider buying a squirt gun and spray-painting it black.

, In old films, criminals, gangsters, and other ""bad guys"" were often portrayed smoking cigars. While you certainly don't have to smoke it, carrying a cigar around will add an authentic element to your costume.

Wear an oversized hoodie or puffy jacket.

, Gangsters are notorious for their tattoos. You can draw on fake tattoos using a pen, or apply temporary stick-on tattoos.


Many gang members get tattoos of the faces of loved ones who have passed away on their upper arms.
Draw tattoos on your face, neck, and/or chest.

, Find long silver or gold chains with dollar signs, crosses, or other symbols on them. Try wearing multiple chains of different lengths and colors.

, Either tie a bandana around your head or wrap it around your neck and tie it in the back. Beanies can be worn in any color, but should not have any designs or logos on them.

Ready your face for steam cleaning.,
Choose your essential oils.,
Prepare your steaming water.,
Test for skin sensitivity.Always be aware that you can develop sensitivity to an herbal oil.,
Steam your face.,
Care for your skin afterward.,
Repeat this procedure until you see improvement.",How to Get Rid of Acne Naturally1," If your hair falls into your face, pull it back and secure it with a hair tie, head band, or bobby pins. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser — either a non-oil-based product or a plant-oil-based product. Many dermatologists recommend using glycerin, grapeseed and sunflower oils, as oils are best to absorb and dissolve other oils.Use your fingertips instead of a washcloth or sponge that could further aggravate your skin.
Massage the cleanser into your skin for about a minute using a gentle, circular motion. You're not trying to scrub, just help the cleanser loosen and absorb dirt and oils.
Rinse your face thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Pat your skin dry using a clean, cotton towel. Never rub a towel over your face, as this could further irritate your skin.;
, The oils listed here all have either antibacterial or antiseptic properties, meaning they can kill the bacteria that cause acne and prevent the formation of new pimples. You can choose based on personal preference (which one smells best?) or based on your unique situation. If you tend to be anxious or depressed, use the lavender. If you have some pimples (usually bacterial), in addition to blackheads, use an herb with antibacterial properties. If you are battling an upper respiratory infection, use thyme to both treat the infection and break up the congestion with heat.


Spearmint or peppermint oils may be irritating to some, so pre-test your skin by putting a single drop of it on your wrist and waiting for 10-15 minutes. If there is no irritation, you should be able to use the oil. Start with 1 drop per quart of water. Both peppermint and spearmint contain menthol, which has both antiseptic and immune-boosting properties.Thyme boosts the immune system and has antibacterial properties. It also increases circulation of the blood by opening up blood vessels.Calendula accelerates healing and has antimicrobial properties.Lavender is soothing and can help with anxiety and depression. It also has antibacterial properties., Fill a 1-quart pot with water and bring it to a boil for a minute or two. Once the water has been steaming for a couple minutes, add 1-2 drops of any of the listed essential oils.


If you don’t have the essential oils, substitute with ½ teaspoon of the dried herb per quart of water.
Once you have added the herbs or oils, let the water boil for another minute.
After a minute, turn off the heat and move the pot to a comfortable area for steaming. Make sure you won’t have to hunch awkwardly over the pot, as you’ll have to hold that position for a while.

, Even if you've successfully used oil in the past, retest it every time you steam your face with it. Try each oil for about a minute, then take your face away from the steam for 10 minutes. If you're not sneezing and you're skin isn't reacting poorly, reheat the water and proceed with the steaming.

, Place a large, clean cotton towel over your head. You'll use this to create a sort of ""tent"" to trap the steam around your face. Once you've made your towel-tent, lean over the steaming put to put your face in the steam.


Keep your eyes closed during the steaming process to protect them from steam damage.Keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water so you don't burn your skin. You want heat to dilate blood vessels and open up pores, but you certainly don’t want to damage your skin with heat.
Breathe normally and relax! This should be a pleasant, soothing experience.
Keep your face over the steam for about 10 minutes.

, Rinse your face well with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a clean cotton towel, remembering not to rub your skin. Moisturize your skin with a non-comedogenic lotion or cream that won't clog pores and worsen acne. Look at the packaging to make sure it's a non-comedogenic product.


“Non-comedogenic” products don't promote the formation of acne like comedones, blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples.Any product you put on your face — from lotion to cleanser to makeup — is likely produced in a non-comedogenic formula for people with acne-prone skin.
One skin moisturizer is coconut oil. You can use plain coconut oil or garlic coconut oil mixture: squeeze the juice of one clove of garlic into 1 jar of coconut oil and stir well. The shelf life is about 30 days in the fridge. Sparingly rub this into your face once or twice per day. Both garlic and coconut oil kill acne germs. The medium chain fatty acids liquefy comedones and keep your skin pores open. The garlic gives it a bit of garlic smell; if you do not like that you may want to just use plain coconut oil instead., At the beginning, you can steam your face twice a day — once in the morning and once in the evening. After two weeks or so, you should see some kind of improvement in your skin. When you see improvement, reduce the frequency of your steam treatments to once a day.

Learn why herbal masks work.,
Mix your herbal mask base.,
Add an essential oil.,
Apply the mask.,
Allow the mixture to dry.,
Rinse your face.",How to Get Rid of Acne Naturally2," The mask ingredients described here have astringent properties that clean, tighten, and help heal skin while treating pimples. Astringents can dry out skin, so don’t apply it to already dry areas.However, if you have oily skin, a mask with astringent properties will help normalize your skin’s moisture level.

, In a bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon of honey, 1 egg white, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. These ingredients have natural properties that will help heal your skin. For example, honey has antibacterial and astringent properties.The egg whites not only thicken the mask, but also act as an astringent, and the lemon juice is both an astringent and a natural bleach/whitening agent., Once you've made your mask base, mix in 1/2 teaspoon of any of the following essential oils:


Peppermint
Spearmint
Lavender
Calendula
Thyme

, Using your fingertips, spread the mixture over your face, your neck, or wherever you're having a problem. This process might get messy, so make sure to do it in an area that can be easily cleaned, like a bathroom. Don't glop on so much of the paste that it will drip off your face or take too long to dry.


If you don't want to apply an entire facial mask, you can use the mixture to spot-treat problem areas. Simply use a Q-tip to apply the mask directly to pimples.

, Depending on how much of the mixture you applied to your face, drying time may vary. However, it should take somewhere around for 15 minutes. Be careful not to let the mask drip everywhere while you're waiting for it to dry.

, After the fifteen minutes have passed and the mixture has dried and had time to work on your skin, it's time to wash it away. Rinse it off completely using lukewarm water and your hands. Don't use a washcloth or sponge that might further irritate your acne skin. Pat your face dry with a clean cotton towel, making sure not to irritate the skin by rubbing.


Apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to finish.

Learn how sea salt treats acne.,
Ready your skin for treatment.,
Mix a sea salt mask.,
Apply the mask.,
Make a sea salt spray as an alternative to a mask.,
Spray the mixture onto your face.,
Soak in a salt bath for a “whole-body” method.",How to Get Rid of Acne Naturally3," Experts don't actually know exactly how sea salt reduces acne. It may be that the high salt concentration helps kill off bacteria or that the sea salt replenishes minerals that help heal the skin.Sea salt may also be helpful in dissolving sebum.


This method, has helped many with mild-moderate acne and will not interfere with any medications used.
Still, it's always best, if you are seeing a dermatologist, to let them know what you are doing at home to help yourself.
Be careful not to over-use sea salt, as it can dry your skin and stimulate sebum production that might cause a breakout.

, Always cleanse your face first with a gentle non-alcohol based cleanser. Place the cleanser on your fingertips and use gentle, circular motions to loosen any dirt. Wash for about a minute, then rinse with cool or lukewarm water. Pat dry with a clean towel and use one of the sea salt methods given below as an after-cleanse treatment.

, A mask is useful if the acne you want to target is on your face. Stir 1 teaspoon of sea salt into 3 teaspoons of hot water. The water should be hot enough to dissolve the sea salt completely when you stir it together. To this solution, add 1 tablespoon of one of the following:


Aloe vera gel (to help heal)Green tea (for antioxidants)Honey (for its antibacterial actions and to promote healing), Spread the mixture over your face with your fingertips, making sure not to make too much of a mess. Avoid getting the mixture near your eyes. Leave it on for 10 minutes, but no longer. Sea salt draws water out and can dry your skin out too much.


After 10 minutes, rinse the mask off with cool to lukewarm water, and pat your face dry with a clean towel.
Apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to finish.
While you may be very tempted, use this bath or facial wash only once a day. Otherwise, you may dry out your skin too much, even with a moisturizer.

, The ingredients for the spray are essentially the same as for the mask. However, use 10 teaspoons of sea salt in 30 teaspoons of hot water, and 10 tablespoons of the aloe vera gel/green tea/honey. Once you've made your solution, pour it into a clean spray bottle.


Store this mixture in the refrigerator to preserve it.

, Every time you treat your skin with anything, you should always wash it with lukewarm water and a gentle cleanser. Close or cover your eyes to protect it from the sting of salt water, then spritz the mixture onto your face and neck.


Just as with the mask, you don't want to leave it on your skin for more than 10 minutes, after which you should rinse thoroughly with cool to lukewarm water.
Pat your skin dry, then finish with a non-comedogenic moisturizer.

, If you have outbreaks of acne on large portions of your body, immersing your whole body in treated water might be a better option than a mask or spray. While regular table salt won't hurt your skin, it also won't offer all the benefits of the other minerals found in sea salt: calcium, magnesium, sodium, chlorine, iodine, potassium, zinc, and iron.The bath won't really be worth it if you're using regular table salt.


Add 2 cups of sea salt to very warm-to-hot water as it is filling the tub. This helps the sea salt to dissolve.
Soak in the water for up to 15 minutes, but no more. Longer than that might over-dry your skin.
If you have pimples on your face, soak a washcloth in the tub water and place it over your face for 10-15 minutes.
Rinse off the sea salt water with cool water.
Pat your skin dry and apply a moisturizer to your body to prevent the sea salt from over-drying your skin.
Don’t bathe more than once a day in sea salt.

Learn how acne is formed.Sebum is a naturally produced oil that, when overproduced, clogs up your pores, causing blackheads and whiteheads.,
Familiarize yourself with natural acne-fighting theory.,
Choose your primary oil.,
Decide on a second, anti-bacterial/antiseptic.,
Mix your oil cleanser.,
Use your natural cleanser.,
Wash your face.",How to Get Rid of Acne Naturally4," When the skin is also infected with the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes, pimples, pustules, cysts, and abscesses form.

, Sebum, the most direct cause of acne, is an oil. Based on the principles of chemistry, the best way to dissolve oil (and dirt, cell debris, dirt, bacteria etc,) is to use another oil.We've grown used to thinking that oil is always bad for the skin, so we use cleansers with (often) irritating chemicals. We forget that the natural oils on the skin are there to protect, moisturize, and keep the skin healthy. Oil has the ability to not just break down dirt and unwanted oils, but also to prevent the stripping of the skin that you see with soap., Choose oils wisely, making sure to avoid sensitivities and allergies. If you have a nut allergy, for example, you won’t want to use hazelnut oil. The following list of oils is varied — some are more expensive than others, some are easier to find than others. However, all are non-comedogenic, and will not clog the pores and contribute to the acne problem:Argan oil
Hemp seed oil
Shea nut oil (Shea olein)
Sunflower oil
Alternative oils that you can use (that are non-comedogenic for most people) include olive oil and castor oil. Castor oil can be drying for some people, while for others, it is moisturizing.
Coconut oil is different from the other oils in that it contains medium chain fatty acids. It kills bacteria including Propionibacterium acnes. It counters the long chain fatty acids in sebum that block the skin pores., The herbal essential oils on this list are known to have properties that will help minimize the presence of P. acnes bacteria. Many of these oils have pleasant aromas, so you might choose an oil based on personal preference. With all oils you put on your skin, always remember to try them on a small area of skin first to determine if you have a sensitivity to it.


Oregano: antibacterial, anti-inflammatoryTea tree: antibacterial, antifungalLavender: antibacterial, calming and soothing.Rosemary: specifically antibacterial against P. acnes Frankincense: anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, You can make as much or as little of your cleanser as you'd like. It may be more efficient to make larger batches and store them somewhere cool and away from light. The ratio you should maintain for all batches is:


For every fluid ounce of primary oil, add 3-5 drops of secondary herbal essential oil.

, Pour a small amount of the oil mixture into the palm of your hand and apply it to your face. Never use a washcloth or sponge, which might further irritate your acne. Using small, circular motions, gently massage the oil into your skin for 2 minutes.

, A simple rinse will not be as effective as usual, since water does not dissolve oil. To remove the oil cleanser from your face, place a washcloth soaked in warm water on your face for 20 seconds. Slowly and gently wipe of the oil, then rinse the washcloth in warm water. Repeat this procedure until you've wiped all the oil from your face.


Use a cotton towel to pat dry your face.
Use this method twice a day and after heavy sweating.

Make washing a regular part of your routine.,
Use proper washing technique.,
Do not pop your pimples.No matter how bad acne looks, you need to understand that those pimples and pustules are actually keeping harmful bacteria contained.,
Protect your skin from the sun.",How to Get Rid of Acne Naturally5," Wash your face at least twice a day — once when you wake up to clear away oils that accumulate on the skin during sleep, and once before sleep to wash away the day's accumulation.Beyond that, always wash your face after periods of heavy sweating, whether you've gone to the gym or just been outside on a warm day. Take a bath at least once a day, and consider taking an extra shower after heavy sweating.


Always use either a non-comedogenic product or your homemade oil-based cleanser.
Use sea salt as directed. Overexposing your skin to drying sea salt could dehydrate your skin, causing a flare-up of acne.

, You may be tempted to use a washcloth or exfoliating gloves to wash your face, but your best tools are your fingertips. Especially if your skin already has acne on it, you don’t want to irritate it with abrasive surfaces. Massage cleansers into your skin in gentle, circular motions for about 10 seconds. Don’t exfoliate blemished skin, as it could pull away skin that’s not ready to come away yet. This is like pulling off a scab that’s still working to heal your skin, and will leave behind scars and discoloration. ., The pus that comes out of a popped pimple is full of the P. acnes bacteria. It may be satisfying to see it leave the skin, but all you’re actually doing is exposing your other, healthy skin to the bacteria that was previously contained in the pimple. This could potentially lead to acne spreading, rather than your pimple disappearing. Popping zits can also cause scarring and discoloration.

, A popular myth suggests that a tan can help treat and prevent acne, but scientists have found no evidence to support that.In fact, both the sun and tanning beds damage your skin and raise your risk for cancer. Be aware that some acne medications or other types of medication can actually make your skin even more sensitive to the sun. These drugs include antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benedryl); drugs used to treat cancer (5-FU, vinblastine, dacarbazine); heart drugs like amiodorone, nifedipine, quinidine and ditiazem; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen and the acne medications isotretinoin (Accutane) and acitretin (Soriatane).

Eat foods with a low glycemic index (GI).,
Fill out your diet with Vitamins A and D. Along with eating foods low in GI, you should also make sure that you're introducing the appropriate nutrients for skin health into your body.,
Get Vitamin D through sun exposure.,
Increase your omega-3 fat consumption.",How to Get Rid of Acne Naturally6," Skin specialists tell us that despite stories you may have heard about milk and chocolate, diet doesn’t directly cause acne. However, recent research examined diets of indigenous populations around the globe where there was no acne in the teenage subpopulations. When diets were compared between the controls in the US who had more than 70% acne and the indigenous teenagers without acne, it was clear that milk products in combination with too much sugar were missing in the diets of the acne free teenagers, but present in the US controls.This explains why for some people, certain foods including dairy products and diets high in processed sugars increase the risk for acne. These foods increase inflammation and provide an environment where bacteria can flourish.Studies have indicated that low glycemic index foods (GI) reduce the severity of acne.Low glycemic index foods are those foods that release sugars into your blood more slowly. The lowest GI foods are:Bran cereals, Natural Muesli, rolled oats
Whole wheat, pumpernickel, whole grain breads
Most vegetables except beetroots, pumpkin and parsnips
Nuts
Most fruit except watermelon and dates. Mango, banana, papaya, pineapple, raisins, and figs have medium GI.
Legumes
Yogurt
Whole grains are low- to- medium GI. The lowest GI are found in brown rice, barley, and whole grain pasta.

, The vitamins that appear to be most important for the skin are vitamins A and D.Work the following foods into your diet:Vegetables: Sweet potato, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash
Fruit: Cantaloupe, mangoes, apricots
Legumes: Black-eyed peas
Meat and Fish: beef liver, herring, salmon
Fish: Cod liver oil, salmon, tuna
Dairy: Milk, yogurt, cheese

, Though many foods are fortified with Vitamin D, it doesn’t exist in abundance in the foods we eat. While you can try to increase your Vitamin D levels through eating, the single best way to get Vitamin D is to expose your skin to the sun 10-15 minutes a week. Sunlight triggers Vitamin D production by the skin.Do not wear sun screen, and leave as much skin exposed as you feel comfortable with.


Do not over-expose your skin to sunlight without sun screen, as it is very dangerous and could lead to cancer., Studies suggest that omega-3 fats can benefit those with acne.Omega-3 fats limiting the body’s production of leukotriene B4, which increases sebum production and leads to inflammatory acne. Sebum is a natural oil produced to moisturize the skin, but when it's over-produced, it clogs the skin and causes acne. By increasing the omega-3 fat in your diet, you can help control your acne. Foods you should look for include:


Seeds and Nuts: flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, chia seeds, butternuts, walnuts
Fish and Fish oils: salmon, sardines, mackerel, whitefish, shad
Herbs and Spices: basil, oregano, cloves, marjoram
Vegetables: spinach, sprouted radish seeds, chinese broccoli

Determine if your sweater can be frozen.,
Check your angora sweater for snags or stains.,
Place the sweater in a bag.,
Freeze your sweater.,
Remove the sweater and shake it.,
Rub a pumice stone to stop pilling.,
Use a humidifier.,
Wash the sweater only when it needs it.,
Wash your angora sweater by hand.,
Dry your angora sweater.,
Clean your sweater before storing it.,
Reshape your sweater.",How to Stop an Angora Sweater from Shedding," This method of freezing works best for angora sweaters that are blended with another material. If your sweater is 100% angora, your sweater will still shed because of the high amount of angora. The freezing method relies on making the fibers easier to shake out. So, after you freeze the sweater you can vigorously shake out all of the fibers that will fall out so they come out at once instead of throughout the day.


Many angora sweaters you purchase are mixtures of a low percentage of angora and other wools (like cashmere or wool from sheep) and synthetic fibers like viscose or polyester. These combinations can minimize shedding.;
, This way, you can care for the problems and wear the sweater as soon as it's out of the freezer. To deal with snags, take a sewing needle and push or pull the snag through the sweater. Tie a knot in the snag and dab the knot with clear nail polish to hold it in place.You can also insert a small crochet hook from the inside of the sweater so that the hook grabs the snag on the outside of the sweater. Carefully pull it back in through the sweater, so the snag ends up on the inside.
Never pull the snag away from the sweater or cut it off. This could make the sweater start unraveling or create a large hole.

, Fold your angora sweater into a small square. You should be able to fit it in a plastic freezer bag. While you could freeze the sweater without putting it in the plastic bag, the bag prevents the sweater from absorbing any smells from food in the freezer. While you might worry that your sweater will freeze solid, it will remain flexible.
To keep the sweater from creasing while it's freezing, consider layering tissue paper between the folds of the sweater.

, Place the bag holding the sweater in the freezer for 3 to 4 hours before you plan on wearing it. Make sure the sweater is laying flat in the freezer so that you don't accidentally create wrinkles while it's freezing. Freezing the sweater will also prevent moth eggs from hatching in the sweater.You could also be in the habit of leaving the sweater in the freezer when you're not wearing it. That way, it's always ready for you to wear.

, Take the sweater out of the plastic bag and unfold it. Give it a really good shake so that any angora hairs fall out before you wear the sweater. Understand that this method removes most of the hairs, but you'll still shed a little throughout the day so you might want to carry a lint roller to deal with remaining shedding.The idea is that freezing the sweater makes the hairs shed all at once instead of over the course of several hours. This is why you'll need to freeze the sweater every time you want to wear it.

, Take a pumice stone like one you use for pedicures and gently rub it over any part of your sweater that's starting to pill. The fibers will get caught in the rough texture of the stone. Use light pressure so that you don't pull on the fibers of the sweater. As soon as you feel the sweater start to pull away with the stone, stop rubbing the pumice and remove the pills.Avoid pulling the pills since this can damage the angora by pulling the fibers out even more., One of the reasons angora sheds is because the fibers can get statically charged. This means they'll draw other things (like hair or other fibers) to them. To avoid this, place the sweater in a room with a humidifier before you wear it. A humidifier or steam can keep the air from becoming too statically charged. You might need to do this frequently in the winter when the dry air can create static charges.Try to cut down on static. Static can easily build up if you blow dry your hair every day, so let your hair air dry instead or use an ionizing hair dryer. These create ions that reduce static electricity., If you're in the habit of wearing a sweater for a short period of time and then washing it, you might be damaging the fibers. Unlike a sweater made from cotton or a synthetic material, angora only needs to be washed when it's truly dirty. You can overwash an angora sweater which will wear out the fibers quickly. Wash your sweater if you notice dirt or sweat on the sweater or if it smells.


Avoid washing your sweater in a washing machine and never use a dryer.
You should also keep your sweater out of direct sunlight and never use bleach, since these can ruin the fibers of the sweater.

, Turn your sweater inside out. Fill a sink with water that's barely warm and add a little natural soap. Don't add so much soap that you get suds in the water. Add the sweater and let it soak for 20 minutes. Rinse out the sweater while you hold the sweater. Support the sweater and avoid wringing or twisting the sweater.If you pull or tug your sweater while it's wet, you might damage or stretch the sweater. This is why you shouldn't wash it in the washing machine, which can twist or knot the fibers.

, Scoop up the angora sweater so that it's still in a lump and lay it flat on a towel. Roll the towel up so that the water from the sweater blots onto the towel. Lay it flat on another dry towel and make sure it's laying in the shape you'd like it to dry. Let it dry overnight. In the morning, turn the sweater over and let the other side dry completely.To get most of the water out of the sweater quickly, you can also put it in a salad spinner. Spin until most of the water is collected in the spinner., If you plan on storing your sweater for a long period of time (like over the summer), be sure to clean it thoroughly. A sweater that's free of dirt or perfume won't attract bugs like moths. Consider folding tissue paper in between the folds of the sweater to prevent creasing.


Never store your angora sweater by hanging it. You should always fold the sweater so that it keeps its shape., If you've accidentally stretched or twisted your wet sweater or dried it on a hanger so that it has hanger marks, you can reshape your sweater. Reshape the sweater by blocking it. Wash the sweater again, but this time, avoid pulling and tugging the wet sweater. Lay the flat clean sweater on your drying rack and shape the sweater so that it will dry the way you want it.


For example, when you lay the sweater flat make sure the arms don't fall or drape over the drying rack. This can make ridges in the sweater when it's dry. Your sweater should be completely flat.

You can also go for a tapered leg, as a wider leg can swallow up a shorter frame., As jumpers usually draw attention to your midsection, you'll want to think about torso length. Whether your torso is long or short makes a difference in your jumper options.If you have a short torso, a wide leg can draw the eyes downward. You should also think about think about a drop waist, which is where the seam of the jumper is positioned near the hips rather than the waist.
For a longer torso, patterns or prints can help hide your waist. You may want to look at a jumper that comes with a drawstring at the waist. A drawstring can be tied loosely, causing the jumper to sag. This can lessen the appearance of your waist.

, Jumpers do have a tendency to be well-suited for people who are taller. Long garments can actually make the body look shorter and squatter.

While some blazers will look slimming and stylish, others can make a jumper look bulky. You want to make sure you see the outfit in its entirety before committing to a purchase.

, Often, jumpers are sold with belts running through the middle. Cinching a jumper at the waist can make it look slimming. This is especially true if you are female, as a jumper can accentuate your natural curves. Even if a jumper is not sold with a vest, you can buy a midsection belt at a department store. As your belt will be more easily seen than a belt worn around the hips, buying a belt in a cute color or pattern can help add some flare to your jumper.


As with any accessory, you should wear your jumper to the store when choosing a belt. You want to make sure the belt gives you the look you want.
Some jumpers have loops of fabric made for fitting belts. If your jumper does not have loops, you can still use a belt as long as you tighten it enough that it stays in place.

, For men, a touch of denim or a fitted coat can make a jumper look slimming. Layering can also make a jumper look slightly less casual. While denim and loose jackets may not be appropriate for an office setting, they can make it look as if you took the time to assemble an outfit rather than simply throwing on a jumper. If you're going to a social event, like a party, try throwing a loose coat or a denim jacket over a jumper. This can be particularly nice in the fall and winter as the weather gets colder."

You'll feel snugly and warm and look cute.Belt your sweater to give it shape and style. You can either do a skinny belt with the folds of the sweater hanging over it, or a big belt. Keep the belt around your waist to give you shape.
Wear your over-sized sweater with leggings and boots. Leggings and boots make sure great fall and winter choices. Try to avoid wearing patterned leggings with a patterned sweater, because that will be too much patterning!;
, In the grey gloom that can come with autumn and winter, a pair of fun, bright leggings or tights can enliven a sweater outfit. You can pair them with a sweater-dress or a long sweater.Patterned leggings or tights are great to pair with a plain, monochromatic sweater. For example: you might wear a pair of Monet inspired leggings (with overtones of purple, green, and yellow) with a black or grey sweater (you might even go for a long, green sweater if you're feeling a bit daring!).
Solid, bright colored leggings or tights are fantastic ideas for autumn and winter. As an example you might pair solid, lime-green tights with a more subdued, patterned sweater (bonus points if there are hints of lime-green in the patterning of the sweater).

, Jeans are so incredibly versatile and they look fantastic with sweaters. It's the perfect no-fuss autumn or winter look. Different types of sweaters, and different types of jeans will give you a different look.A pair of ragged, holey jeans with rolled up cuffs looks great with an over-sized or big chunky cable-knit sweater. A perfect look for that lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon.
Pair your nice jeans with a lovely, jewel-toned v-neck or a cardigan over your shirt to give you a nicer, more put-together look. Good for an afternoon stroll through the changing autumn leaves.
Different sweaters will create a different look, depending on the jeans. You can wear a nice cardigan over a shirt, or a casual v-neck with your ragged jeans. The possibilities are basically limitless.

, There's nothing classier than pairing a collared shirt with your lovely jewel-toned v-neck sweater. Make sure that the collar is fully outside of the collar of your sweater.


You can tone down the business look with a pair of jeans, or dial it up with a pair of nice, dark slacks.

, You can pair any of your sweaters with a leather jacket and it will look good (a leather jacket is a fantastic accessory!), but a turtleneck sweater looks especially good.Pick a sweater in a darker color and add a long necklace to enhance the look.

, There are lots of things you can add to enhance a sweater outfit. Jewelry is always a great addition: a chunky necklace with your v-neck sweater enhances the line of the outfit while something like a pair of dangling earrings paired with a cable-knit sweater gives you a little sparkle.


Scarves are also great accessories, as well as being good for keeping you warm and cozy in the colder seasons.
Boots are also great pair with sweaters: over-sized sweaters, a nice sweater and jeans, a sweater dress. They give a little bit of class to an outfit and keep your legs warm!

, When you're choosing the best sweater looks for spring and summer you don't want to pick a fabric that's going to be really hot, like cashmere. You need fabric that is light and breathable.As for the fabric go for a nice silk-blend, cotton, or nylon-poly blend. These will breathe more easily, they'll give you a little weight and warmth (especially in air-conditioned offices) without being overwhelmingly hot.
A loose crocheted sweater can be a great idea for a summer or spring look. Wear it over a pale maxi-dress or t-shirt and rolled up jeans.

, Bright colored sweaters, or heavy black sweaters are good for autumn, but they aren't what you want to wear for spring and summer. Pick light colors and prints that have light colors (pastel like pale pink or blue are typical).


Grey is a great color to pair with fun summery prints. This way the focus is on your fun printed skirt, with the grey enhancing it, rather than drawing attention away from it.
Pale, pastel colors are good because they won’t be as hot as black or dark purple.

, Part of cultivating the summer or spring look is to pair your sweater with something more summery. This could be something like a knit sweater with a bright, sporty mini-skirt.


Another good idea is pairing a white button-down sweater with loose trousers (cotton) and white sandals.
You could also pair a light v-neck sweater with floaty, knee-length skirt. You want to balance the floaty, looser bottom with a more fitted sweater.

, Part of the fun of sweaters is having multiple layers. This is necessary in many places in the northern hemisphere where each day can have a succession of different temperatures and weather.


Layer your summer sweater over your tank top so that you're ready from when the sun comes out from behind that cloud.
When wearing a cardigan you want to keep it unbuttoned, or mostly unbuttoned. This shows the layering better and makes it flow more nicely on each side.

, Even though you might think it's a good idea to wear that holiday sweater ironically, or because grandma will be hurt if you don't, holiday sweaters just don't look good on anyone.Really the only reason you should be wearing a holiday sweater is if you're attending a holiday sweater party or an ugly sweater party.

, This one can be hard to follow because it's pretty hard to tell which sweaters are going to pill. There are, however, a few things you can look for to make it less likely that you pick a sweater that's going to pill after a couple wearings.Check the material of a particular sweater. Merino wool, for example, tends to be stronger and less likely to pill that a fussy, fine-gauge cashmere.
You should also pay attention to the length of the fiber used in the sweater, especially when it comes to natural, raw materials like cashmere. Longer fibers can be wound into tighter yarn, which makes it less like that the ends will come loose (which causes pilling).
A good thing to do is let a sweater ""rest"" for 24 hours before wearing it again, because this lets the fibers rest from the stretching that happens when it's being worn.

, Stick to the sweaters that look good on you, ones that you feel confident wearing. Not everyone looks good in turtleneck sweaters, or a cropped top, or an over-sized sweater.


Try to avoid just following the ""fashion trends"" in terms of sweaters. For example, shrugs are not in these days, so hopping on that bandwagon will mean you're now stuck with a bunch of sweaters that you're probably not going to wear.
Be careful with color, as well. That lovely mustard color might look good on the mannequin, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily going to look good on you (not that many people can pull of any version of yellow).

, Tying your sweater around your neck (especially if it's a pastel, button down sweater) is going to make you look like you're off to the country or yacht club. Unless that's the look you're after it's best to stay away from it.

Give an aran sweater a go if you're feeling swarthy and cold.",How to Wear Sweaters (for Men)," Wool is most commonly taken from sheep, while cashmere from goats. Because of the considerable time, effort, and — in the case of the Kashmir goat — rarity involved in manufacturing these fabrics, they're going to cost you more, but they worth it. Wool, although occasionally scratchy, is perhaps the warmest of fabrics, wicking away moisture by being super-absorbent and creating tiny air pockets, or insulation, for warm air to collect in.Cashmere is the gold standard when it comes to incredibly soft and luxurious fabric.;
, It's a lightweight, breathable, and cheaper fabric. Because cotton can be farmed and manufactured with relative ease, it's cheap. Remember though, because nature didn't design cotton to keep an animal warm throughout the chilly winter — unlike wool or cashmere — it's much more breathable, making cotton great for spring and summer months or for exercising on a chilly night. Cotton can be very soft if treated right, making it a great budget item that feels elegant to the touch.

, Synthetic fabrics, like polyester or nylon, can mimic the feel of fabrics like wool or cotton at a much lower price. Blended fabrics contain a blend of at least two fabrics, say 51% cashmere and 49% cotton. Both blended and synthetic fabrics are there to make things easier on your wallet, and sometimes even make sweaters more durable. A blended cotton and spandex sweater will stretch more than its all-cotton counterpart, making it a great sports choice.

, The type of color you select for your sweater is important. Colors like blue, brown, black are considered much more formal, while grey and lighter color usually pass as casual, although they can be dressed up in the spring and summer months.


Avoid wearing extremely bright colored sweaters unless you're trying to make a statement (or poke fun at yourself). Baby blues, burnt oranges, and even subdued yellows can be pulled off with the right amount of finesse, but avoid bright pinks, neons, and other eye-blinding notes.

, Patterns on sweaters are a lot like colors: the more you have, the less formal your sweater will seem. If opting for a sweater with a pattern, go understated with the rest of your outfit. Wear patterned sweaters with a pair of clean jeans and simple, no-frills shoes.


Argyle sweaters, which employ interlocking diamonds, usually of different colors, have become increasingly popular. As with other patterned sweaters, wear them carefully: don't try to do too much with the rest of your wardrobe if you decide to rock this stylish pattern.
Houndstooth, checkered, or other black and white patterns are also becoming increasingly popular. Wear houndstooth, especially, with an otherwise delicate outfit, as this pattern exudes moxie.

, Obviously, if a $300 sweater has sleeves that fall well past your hands, you're not going to look great. Different garment manufacturers will have different fits. The best way to consistently look great in any sweater is to find the brand or brands that fit you best, and then to stick with that brand as you continue to explore different kinds of sweaters.


High-end brands will make sweaters that fit only about 1 in 10 men.This means that for the 10% who do look great in them, the fit is absolutely fantastic. Lower-end brands will make sweaters that fit more types of builds, but only fit those builds poorly.
Although you probably can buy a sweater and then get it altered to truly fit you, it's not likely to produce great results. Finding the expert tailor or seamstress who's able to do a good job is difficult. For your money, you're probably better off getting a bespoke sweater.

, This is probably the most common type of sweater for men, as it's basic, versatile, and doesn't reveal much of what you're wearing underneath. Choose your fabric carefully here; you'll be wearing a crew neck much of the time!


Crew necks are pretty casual, so pair them with a no-frills pair of jeans to go for a modest look, or a more formal pair of jeans for a more sophisticated look.
Crew necks work great with both button-down collared shirts (keep the collar inside the crew) and simple t-shirts.

, V-necks are a bit more fancy than crews, mainly because you're meant to wear them with button-down collared shirts. V-necks actually have a slimming effect, as the bottom of the V draws the viewer's attention downward.


Feel free to wear a crew t-shirt underneath your v-neck to make it more casual, but avoid wearing a v-neck tee underneath a v-neck sweater. Like the infamous popped collar, this trend is best avoided.
The deeper the cut of the V, the more effeminate the sweater looks, in the opinion of some. So opt for a slight cut v-neck if you want to highlight your masculinity, and avoid going for really deep v-necks.

, Your grandpa probably sported a cardigan, whether or not he had a library stocked with scotch and a meerschaum pipe. Cardigans are decidedly old school, but that doesn't mean they can't be pulled off nowadays.


Because cardigans are a bit more formal than crews, they work well when they're dressed down. Fit a cardigan on top of a slim-fit tee and your favorite pair of jeans, and top off the look with some slightly less-than-casual shoes.

, A polo sweater is a sweater than has some sort of collar attached to it, obviating the need for a collared shirt underneath. These cuts are considered quite fashionable, so you need to be confident when wearing them. Just put on your baddest Steve McQueen face and some sunglasses and you're good to go.

, Turtlenecks probably won't make it into your sweater mainstay, but neither should they. Worn every once in a while with a simple tee underneath, these sweaters are good for showing chiseled, lean profiles. Probably best reserved for the fall and winter months.

, Aran sweaters originate from the west coast of Ireland, where inhabitants had to settle with cold, dreary, rainy weather.Traditionally wool sweaters, arans boast nice knitted patterns on top of usually light-colored wool.


Arans give you a homey look, great for nights by the fire or in outdoorsy settings. They probably aren't the best sweaters to wear on a date, or for going out on the town.

To create better cohesion between the black and white colors of your outfit, consider shoes that have a black and white color scheme.

, The shape of your legs and rear will influence the kind of jeans that are most flattering for your figures. You should also keep in mind that where black has a slimming effect, white tends to give the impression greater fullness.Look at the following list and choose the shape that best matches your body:


Straight figured individuals will have a chest and waist that are roughly the same size, with an only slightly tapered waist.Hourglass figured individuals have an equivalent chest and hips with a well defined, smaller waist.Full hips and large thighed individuals will have fuller, more curvaceous lower body., You can accomplish this by choosing a pair of jeans that make use of pocket decorations, like stitching. Flaps and other stylish embellishments to the back pockets will give your bum a perkier appeal.You should try to distance yourself from bell shaped white jeans or pairs that make use of flared designs. These can throw off the natural symmetry of your figure., A straight cut along the waist of your pants can create a gaping appearance or discomfort for your hourglass figure. A contoured waistband will save you from this fashion faux pas. You might also try on a pair of straight-leg jeans. These can bring balance to hourglass figures.Keep away from jeans too wide-legged in cut. These can give a boyish impression to your figure.

, A pair that has both a contoured waist band and a higher rise to its cut in back than in front will contain your curves in the most flattering way.The better fit of this cut will also prevent the jeans from sliding down.


Legs that are tapered can not only be uncomfortable for this body type, but the slimming effect of a taper will make your thighs appear even larger.

, White jeans that rise in front will prevent the appearance of the dreaded ""muffin top."" With this cut of jeans, you can still rock the white jean-style!Pants that are stiff and have little give to the fabric can dig into your stomach and feel uncomfortable. These cuts should be avoided.

, Sometimes even the classiest pair of pants are best suited for the rack and not your closet. Take a good look at every aspect of the jeans before you purchase them. Make sure there is no discomfort when sitting, bending, or in various positions.


You may also notice that the fabric of certain pairs of jeans are more transparent than others. Take this into account also. Jeans that reveal underclothes will require nude or white colors worn beneath.

, Adding a top according to your body type will ensure your jeans and your top bring out your best features and will create cohesion between all parts of the outfit. Tops that make use of ruching or a draping style can give the appearance of greater shapeliness. Tops to consider might have:Boat-necks
Nipped or belted waists
V or U-necks
Ruching or flowing fabric around the bust, Anything that hugs your curves should be prioritized when you're choosing a top to pair with your white jeans. These kind of garments will allow the natural femininity of your body to shine through! Some tops you might try:V-neck shirts
Wrap tops
Tops with belts, If you have full legs and thighs, longer tops will reduce focus on this feature and allow for greater appreciation of the entire outfit. True fashion is a balancing act, after all! Try tops with shirttails for a harmonious balance.Longer tops will draw the eye away from the fullness of your legs and thighs by balancing the disproportion between the two.

Some tops for your consideration:
Sweaters (hip length)
Jackets (hip length)
Puffed/ruched sleeved tops
Tops with padded shoulders, A figure that has a little bit of a tummy can benefit from a top that skim the skin of your body. Large and billowy tops can end up accentuating the belly and be less than flattering. Lightweight garments, including Empire-waist tops, might work well with your white jeans. Ideal tops for those with a tummy include:Asymmetrical tops
Tops with front draping
Tops with front ruching
Long Cardigans
Ponchos, Stains and blemishes show up bright as day on white fabric, but you might be able to lessen these by applying a special protectant, like Scotchgard™. Check the tag of your pants before doing this, as you may be inadvisable to Scotchgard™ some pairs of pants.If there are no warnings on the label about pretreatment to prevent stains, apply your protectant according it its directions to your jeans to defend against stains.

, It is especially easy to overlook a purse or handbag, but over the course of an entire day, the ink from these might rub off on your white jeans. Dark indigo, and colors like it, are potent and transfer easily. This is especially true for new clothing.

, Wearing your white jeans too frequently can cause the fabric to become dull and lose some of its original luster. To prevent this from happening, you should only wear your white jeans once or twice before laundering.


You might also add a whitening product or booster, like baking soda, vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide, to the wash while cleaning your white jeans., Some fabrics are treated with products before being sold to protect the quality and color of the fabric. These pretreated clothes may have special washing instructions that you should follow, but generally, you will want to wash your white jeans with similar colors in warm water.


Don’t overload your washing machine. Doing so prevent your garments from rinsing all the way through. and whatever detergent remains can create yellow spots on your jeans over time.

, Especially if you have a favorite pair that have seen better days, if your jeans are beginning to look less bright than you'd like, try a soak in warm water with some color safe bleach added.Set a timer for about 30 minutes, rinse your jeans when time's up, and then go about drying as you normally would.

Go with slim fit jeans.,
Wear jeans that graze the top of your shoes.,
Roll up the cuffs to expose your shoes.,
Avoid boot cut denim.",How to Wear Jeans with Sneakers1," Slim fit jeans with a straight leg work best with high tops. Avoid super skinny jean styles and aim for a more tailored look. The jeans should provide a slim but comfortable fit. If you’re having a tough time finding the right fit, getting your jeans tailored is always an option.Avoid skinny fits with bulky high tops, which makes for an unflattering and drastic contrast.;
, Try to find a pair of jeans that fall just at the top of your sneakers without covering up your shoes. You don’t want it to look like your pant legs are tucked into the high tops, so make sure the ankle isn’t too tapered. Avoid baggy jean styles, which will bunch up uncomfortably around your ankles and high tops., It can be tough to find jeans that are exactly the right length. Luckily, rolled cuffs are a trendy look! Avoid jeans that have to be rolled numerous times and aim for a pair that you can roll two or three times. Roll the cuffs about one or two inches above the high tops, or roll them so they graze the high point of your sneakers.If you find that your jeans are covering your sneakers, give them a single or double cuff.
Avoid pin rolling with high tops. Pin rolling is a popular denim look with low cut sneakers, but it doesn’t work well with high tops.

, Just as the name suggests, boot cut jeans are made to wear with boots! The wider cut at the bottom will swallow up your high top shoes, covering them almost completely and making showing them off impossible. The flared bottom will also more than likely graze the ground, causing your jeans to become frayed and ripped. The result is a sloppy overall look."
"
Wash your jeans in cold water.,
When they're done being washed have somebody help you gently pull at the sides of the jeans to stretch them out a little bit.

,
When you're pulling, make sure you give an even amount of force on each side so they're not uneven.

,
When you're done with the sides do the same to the bottom if you need them longer.

,
Hang them up outside to dry.

,
Never put them in the dryer after you stretch them because The heat of the dryer will shrink them more.

Make sure your shorts match the rest of your outfit.,
Don't wear too-long t-shirts.,
Pair your shorts with appropriate footwear.,
Get your legs into a shape you like.,
Shave your legs if you want to.,
Keep your legs moisturized.",How to Look Good in Shorts," If you can, always have a shopping buddy. This person can be a friend, family member, or significant other. When you try on different pairs of shorts, ask him or her if you look good in them.


It's important to get someone else's perspective when shopping, since too often people are their own worst critics. Especially if your self-confidence is low, you will see ""flaws"" that nobody else would notice.
Make sure your buddy is someone you can trust to be honest. If a pair of shorts is legitimately unflattering, you want your shopping buddy to be honest and tell you. Many people are afraid of offending people and won't give good advice in these situations.
On the other hand, don't go shopping with someone who is hypercritical. If your buddy never has a good word to say, you may feel too self-conscious to buy shorts at all.;
, This may seem like a given, but it's the most important part of finding shorts that make you look good. Don't worry so much about fashion trends or looking perfect. Dress how you want to dress.


If you have issues with clothing texture, be sure to look for shorts made of materials you find comfortable.
You might find the chicest, most flattering pair of shorts, but if you think they're ugly and uncomfortable it will be difficult to look confident. Self-confidence is essential for looking your best., Shorts are generally for beating the heat, but different types of shorts are best worn in the appropriate situation. Think about what you want to do in your shorts and how you want to look while doing it. Questions you should ask while shopping are:


Do you want to look sexy, casual, or both? There are some shorts that can work as part of a dinner outfit, and there are shorts that are better suited to wear around the house. There are different lengths of shorts from sexy ones meant to show off your butt to modest shorts that reach past your knees.
Are you looking for athletic shorts? If so, for which activities? The best shorts for playing basketball aren't the same as shorts designed for running., Just like other types of clothing, different styles of shorts can exaggerate or draw attention away from certain body features.


To accentuate curves, wear shorts that are longer and/or have an A-line silhouette..
To make your legs look longer or to look taller, wear shorter shortsand/or ones with higher waists.Low-to-midrise cuts will make your torso look longer and your legs shorter.Wear ""skinny"" or fitted-cut shorts if you have thin legs that you would like to look fuller.
Likewise, if you legs are on the thick side, wider cuts will flatter them more., This step is extra important if you didn't bring a shopping buddy. Like all types of clothing, you look best in clothes that fit your body right. A perfect fit is one that doesn't feel restrictive while also not being too baggy. Some fitting issues you should watch out for with shorts include:



Muffin tops. When you wear shorts that have waistband that's too small, your tummy will bulge out in a way that many people find unappealing. Anyone, even thin people, can get a muffin top when wearing too-small shorts.

Sliding off. This is caused by a too-wide waistband. Your shorts should only hang low if that's your style.

Riding up. For a lot of people, especially women, even the best-fitting pair of shorts may ride up over time. However, if you find a pair riding up right after you've put them on, just think how uncomfortable they'll get later in the day. If this happens, look for a looser style with a wider leg., The first garment you'll need to pick out is the most appropriate underwear. In general, you probably want to keep your underwear from showing. Check to see that it's not peeking through by trying on both the underwear and the shorts in front of a mirror.


Which styles and cuts work well will depend on the type of shorts you're wearing.
Of course, if you want to show off your underwear, then go ahead. In that case, make sure your underwear looks just as nice as the rest of your outfit. Most people aren't into tighty whities that are stained and full of holes., To look good in shorts, you'll want your outfit to be a cohesive whole rather than a random collection of items.


Limit the number of patterns in one outfit. If your shorts are made of a patterned fabric, you'll look best if the rest of your clothing and accessories are solid colors.
Use dashes of complementary colors. Complementary colors are pairs that are opposite each other on the color wheel: red and green; yellow and purple; and blue and orange. For example, blue shorts can look great when paired with an orange belt and shoes.
If your shorts are one of the ""neutrals"" in fashion (browns, grays, black, and navy blue), don't mix another neutral into your outfit. For example, if your shorts are black, pick a black jacket to go with them rather than a navy blue one.Try to make sure your shorts just look right with an outfit. Collared shirts generally look out of place when paired with shorts., Avoid t-shirts that are longer than your shorts. If your shorts aren't visible under your shirt, you're likely to look like you're not wearing bottoms at all. Even if both go down to your knees, you may get some stares if you go out in public.

, In addition to matching the color of your shoes to your entire outfit, you'll also need to take the style of your shorts into account.


Sneakers or a flat pair of tennis shoes will work with casual and athletic shorts.
Don't wear dress shoes with athletic shorts.
If you choose to pair sneakers or tennis shoes with a nicer pair of shorts, make sure those shoes are clean and in perfect condition.
For more feminine styles, high heels and/or thigh-high boots will make nicer shorts even sexier., Most styles of shorts will show off your legs to the world. Make sure you feel confident about the way they look.


People of all shapes and sizes can look good in shorts. What's important is that you like how your legs look.
If you want your legs to look more muscular, be sure to do leg exercises regularly throughout the year.
If you want your legs to look thinner, try losing weight through diet and exercises that don't bulk up the legs. You can burn calories with light aerobics or strength training your upper body.
Remember that your genetics plays a major role in how your legs look. It's possible that no amount of diet and exercise will make your legs look like your ideal. If that's the case, learn to love your body., Many men and women choose to shave their legs when wearing shorts. Shaving will make your legs look more well-defined.


Depending on your body hair pattern and the type of shorts you're planning to wear, it may also be a good idea to shave your inner thighs.
Other methods of hair removal like waxing will also make your legs shorts-ready.
Don't be pressured into shaving if you don't want to.

, Visibly dry skin can detract from your legs' looks. Keep them shiny and toned with some moisturizing body lotion of your choice.


Avoid causes of dry skin like harsh soaps, heat, and low humidity.
Always wear sunscreen on your legs when wearing shorts during the day.
Staying well-moisturized can actually make your legs look longer."

Keep your jewelry simple.",How to Wear Jeans to Work1," Light and medium washes often look too casual, even for Casual Friday. The jeans should also have a uniform wash—so no whiskers—and should be free from embellishments.;
, Wide-legged trouser-style jeans may be the easiest to work with, since they mimic the shape of dress trousers. Boot-leg cuts and skinny jeans can also work, but make sure you choose a pair that does not cling too tightly to your body.

, Silk blouses are chic and dressy, and wearing one will give your jeans a touch of class. Choose a solid color or subtle print for a more conservative look, or opt for a bolder pattern in a bright color to make a statement.

, Collared button-down shirts are the trademark of traditional office wear. By matching one with your jeans, you pay homage to this fact. Look for light colors and traditional patterns, like pinstripes.

, This structured jacket adds a hint of professionalism to your outfit and calls to mind images of a formal business suit.

, A fitted cardigan sweater adds a hint of sophistication to your ensemble, which may make your jeans look dressier. Cardigans with elegant detailing, like ruffles or beading, may dress up your outfit even more.

, Heavy biker jackets are a little too gruff for this look, but a fitted, cropped jacket can give your jeans a mature look. Stick with classic colors, like brown, gray, or black, rather than wilder hues.

, A closed-toe pump is the shoe of choice for traditional office attire, and it can make your jeans look much dressier, too. Opt for low and medium heels, but save any super-sexy stiletto heels or strappy varieties for the weekend.

, If heels aren't your thing, don't worry. The right flat can look just as professional and just as fashionable. Stick with formal designs made of leather or suede, and avoid casual flats made of canvas or similar materials.

, This should go without saying, but it is too important not to say. Do not wear jeans that have holes in the knee or frayed hems at the bottom. Your office jeans should be in clean, crisp condition.

, Choose a collared shirt you would usually wear with a suit. By wearing an office appropriate shirt, you make your jeans look more office appropriate, as well. Light colors like white or sky blue are your best bets, but if you feel a little more daring, try a richer hue.

Wear them with plain black or other neutral colored t-shirts.,
Pair slim cut gray jeans with a chunky knit sweater.",How to Wear Gray Jeans1," Gray skinny jeans can certainly be styled casually, but for the ultimate laid-back look, go with a relaxed cut.Jeans with a relaxed cut sit right at the waist and fit comfortably around the hips and thighs. Typically, they feature a slightly tapered leg, but this can certainly vary. Lighter washes tend to complement the looser cut of the jeans better than the darker shades of gray.


For an even more casual look, wear a distressed pair of gray jeans with a strategic rip at the knee.;
, The light gray color adds to the overall casual vibe, and the tightness of the skinny jeans provides balance when wearing them with a loose-fitting top. Choose a simple top, like a racer back tank top or long-sleeved t-shirt, in a neutral or pastel color. Basic prints, like stripes, also work well.Opt for skinny jeans made of stretchy material, which fit more like leggings than jeans.
Vintage-looking sneakers, like Converse, or simple ballet flats are both flattering choices for footwear.

, Keep things simple by choosing your other garments from a neutral color palette.For example, wearing gray jeans with a basic black t-shirt is a classically casual look that tends to flatter almost everyone. Various shades of gray, white, and navy blue are also good options for t-shirt colors. All cuts complement this look, so feel free to choose your favorite jeans fit.


Add a pop of color to a neutral toned outfit with your accessories. For instance, liven up dark gray jeans and a light gray t-shirt with a green bomber jacket or cherry red scarf.

If the weather is too warm for a knit sweater, try a loose-fitting cardigan over a knit tank top.
To keep things monochrome, wear this outfit with simple black boots or ballet flats.

Dress up dark gray jeans with a stylish top and sophisticated shoes.,
Opt for a sleek, monochrome look.,
Try a dark blazer paired with dark gray slim-fitting jeans.",How to Wear Gray Jeans2," Dark grays, like charcoal and graphite, look much more formal than light gray washes. The darker shades of gray tend to flatter most body shapes and provide a much sleeker look overall. You can make dark gray jeans adhere to a business casual dress code when they are slim-fitting. A tapered ankle can work, but a flared leg will look a little more polished.For the most formal effect, look for jeans that have a well-pressed look. To stiffen yours up, try spraying a little starch on the jeans before you iron them.

, Get a polished, casual-Friday look by wearing dark gray jeans with a loose-fitting black or white silk blouse.If blouses aren’t your thing, a long-sleeved button down shirt with a slim-fit can create a similar vibe. Complete the look by adding a fitted black blazer on top.


Choose a nice pair of dress shoes, like patent black heels, wing-tips or loafers, to go along with this outfit.
A stark white blouse worn with a cropped, waist length blazer in black or graphite also pairs well with office-ready gray jeans.

, Pairing dark gray jeans with a dark gray or black top creates an air of sophistication.Sleek silhouettes emphasize this even more. For example, you could wear a pair of charcoal gray skinny jeans with a black, fitted blouse or tank top and create a fairly formal vibe. In cooler weather you could top this off with a well-cut blazer or black pea coat.


Black leather (or faux leather) loafers or boots, along with black accessories, complete this sophisticated look.

, Choose a blazer made with a casual fabric and try to avoid more formal materials. For example, a corduroy blazer would be an appropriate choice, but a wool blazer would not work well. Go for a blazer that has a relaxed cut – you want something with a soft shoulder and only the slightest taper at the waist. Pair the blazer with very dark gray jeans that have a slim-fitting (but not skinny) cut.To mix it up, try a blazer in a bolder color, such as rust.
You could also experiment with bold patterns, like windowpane checks or plaids, as long as the jeans remain dark gray and fit well.

Add a pop of color with a brightly colored scarf or pair of flats.,
Wear heels.,
Complete a sophisticated look with a sleek black clutch or briefcase.",How to Wear Gray Jeans3," Liven up a dark or neutral outfit with something eye-catching, like a scarf in a bold color or pattern. If you are going for a sophisticated look, this can create a fun edge without making your overall look less formal or polished. Choose a chunky knit scarf to create some interesting texture for an otherwise sleek silhouette.A pair of simple ballet flats in a bright color, like cherry red, can create a similar effect.


Feel free to match a bright scarf with ballet flats of the same color – as long as the rest of the outfit is neutral, matching these bright accessories can look really stylish.

, It may sound odd to wear heels with jeans, but they can definitely work with a pair of dark gray skinny jeans. The fit must be snug and the leg needs to be tapered. A cropped pair of jeans looks great, but you could also roll up the bottom hems to create tiny cuffs.Make sure the cuffs graze the top of your ankle – this look doesn’t work if the bottom hems go past your ankles.

, If you’re going for a dressy, office-ready look in your gray jeans, the accessories you choose need to be dark, sleek and classic. A patent leather clutch or high quality briefcase will perfectly compliment the more formal attire and actually add to the overall sophistication of your outfit. Stick to items that have clean lines and basic structures.


To complete this look, make sure your shoes are also sleek and black.

, Apply this over your whole face, but especially around the eyes. This will help the makeup apply more evenly. If your skin is easily irritated, use a special eye moisturizer rather than a face moisturizer.









Don't worry — it's a myth that rubbing your eyes will cause wrinkles, unless it becomes a constant habit., As always, choose a foundation that matches your skin tone and skin type. Don't go overboard; this is a base for the concealer, not a product that will cover the circles on its own.Applying foundation first allows you to use less concealer, making a natural look easier to achieve.









Powder foundations tend to be easier to control, allowing you to target the dark areas more accurately., Orange, salmon, or peach concealer counteract the blue tones prevalent in most under eye circles. Go with a darker orange if the circles are especially dark, or bright blue.A lighter, more yellow-y orange conceals purple tones more effectively, while a redder tone can conceal green circles.If your eyes are puffy, go a little darker. Darker colors create the illusion that the area is recessed, reducing the puffy appearance., Stick concealers use a thicker, creamier formula that covers dark areas more effectively.A matte finish tends to last longer and conceals creases more effectively.Stick concealer may trigger an acne breakout on oily skin. If this is a concern, use a liquid concealer. For liquid concealer around the eyes, satin or shimmer finishes sometimes work better than matte, especially if there are dry or flaky areas of skin.

, Now that you've tackled the complex task of choosing the right concealer, apply it in small dabs to the undereye area. Pat it in using your finger for more effective crease concealment, or a brush for fine control.It's best to start with as little as possible, putting a thin layer over the darkest or most discolored areas.








, Load your puff up with powder and gently press it under your eyes. This will add a little more coverage and help your concealer to last throughout the day.








, Blend in the edges of the concealer until they are no longer visible. If the concealer is still obvious, apply any other desired makeup to the rest of your face and blend again. It may help to use a different shade of concealer on your cheeks and forehead, in between your skin tone and the tone of the eye concealer.








, This will immediately brighten up your eyes and make you look more awake. The brightness also draws attention away from under eye circles. For more staying power, use white eyeliner underneath the shadow.








, Highlighter along the top of your cheekbone can reflect light to nearby shadows, brightening any remaining hint of darkness.








, Yes, your eyelids can get a tan, and the brown cast can make dark morning eyes harder to conceal.Use a moisturizer with SPF 25 or greater, or ordinary sunscreen. Sunscreen which uses only zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as the active ingredient is less likely to irritate the skin around your eyes.







, Getting enough sleep can help you avoid pale skin that makes dark circles stand out. Drinking plenty of water and minimizing salt can prevent water retention, which is one factor in puffy morning eyes., If you have a congested nose or sinuses, your eyes probably appear darker due to swollen blood vessels.Take antihistamines or visit the doctor for other allergy treatments.


These ""allergy shiners"" are more common in children and teens.

, While this won't make your eyes lighter, it can make dark circles less noticeable. Here are a couple treatments:


Chill a pair of spoons in the freezer. Lie down with the bowls of the spoons over your eyes and let the cold reduce the swelling.

Give yourself a facial massage to encourage lymph drainage. If this helps reduce swelling, you may have poor lymph drainage, which you can address with lifestyle changes., While eyelids do change in appearance as you age, this is a very gradual process. If your eyelids have become much darker or more swollen in the past few months, ask your doctor to examine them. There are many conditions that can cause a change in eyelid appearance."

Deal with genetics.",How to Cure Baggy Eyes," If you’re a big consumer of salty foods, this might be contributing to the bags under your eyes. The seasoning causes fluid retention, and the delicate skin around your eyes is very vulnerable. Eating a lot of salt can make your eyes look puffy and swollen.Take notice of when the bags under your eyes are at their worst. What did you eat the day before? If you polished off a large thing of salty fries with dinner and woke up with swollen eyes, you may have found the culprit.;
, When you drink alcohol, you mess with the hormone that helps our body absorb water properly. You may have noticed this if you’ve ever woken up parched after a night of drinking with big, puffy eyes. When the water in your body isn’t being absorbed like normal, it can collect in the delicate skin around your eyes, causing them to swell.If you are going to imbibe, choose shots. Because these don’t have any extra sugar or salt, you’ll minimize the effect it has on your eyes., A major reason for baggy eyes is dehydration. Think of it this way: when your body feels like it isn’t getting enough water, it will cling to the water that it does have. One place where your body will collect and hold onto water is your eyes. Start drinking more water, and you can reduce your body’s fluid retention.The recommended daily intake of water is about 13 cups (three liters) for men and nine cups (2.2 liters) for women.If you have trouble drinking that much water, try flavored water.

, When you have large bags under your eyes, lack of sleep is usually the first suspect, and for good reason. When you don’t give your body enough rest, it will start acting up. Fatigue can cause inflammation, and as you’ve learned, your eyes are easy targets. The blood vessels around your eyes dilate, and your skin looks swollen and puffy.Teens should be getting 8-10 hours of sleep nightly, adults need 7-9 hours, and older adults should get 7-8 hours., Your eyes are only one part of the body that smoking can adversely affect. Not only do cigarettes weaken and dehydrate the skin around your eyes, but it can also lower the quality of sleep you get at night.Both of these things increase your chances of getting bags under your eyes. Kick the habit and your eyes (and lungs and wallet) will thank you.

, It can be tempting to skip the face wash and crawl into bed after a long day. However, sleeping in your makeup can contribute to puffiness around your eyes. Makeup residue can clog pores, cause irritation, and make the skin around your eyes look inflamed. Use a gentle makeup remover and wash your face before bed to help reduce this problem., If you suffer with allergies, you may deal with a whole host of eye issues, from excess watering, itchiness, and redness. Allergies can cause baggy eyes both by the irritant and the consequent rubbing. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for your allergies, or try an over-the-counter medicine to help combat your symptoms., If you’ve fallen asleep crying after a particularly depressing movie or an argument with a significant other, you know this can make your eyes look puffy and irritated the next day.If you can, avoid the nighttime tears! Save your sad movie for another time, or do your best to hold back. If you do cry, rinse your eyes with cold water before bed to calm the inflammation.

, When skin is damaged by the sun, it loses its elasticity. This is why people often warn that excessive sun can cause premature wrinkling. When your fragile skin around your eyes loses elasticity, it can accumulate fluid and puff.Make sure when you apply sunscreen to your face, you do not neglect your delicate eye area. Purchasing sunglasses with high UV protection is also critical., Sometimes under eye bags are simply hereditary. If you utilize these tips and tricks and still have baggy eyes, it may be a natural part of the aging process. That doesn’t mean you’re stuck with them forever, though. Rinse your face with cold water every morning to reduce any extra inflammation, and then grab a great concealer to help reduce the appearance of these bags.


There are certain cosmetic surgery options that help with baggy eyes. While these are obviously more expensive and invasive, they can do wonders for genetic eye bags that just cannot be minimized."

Get enough sleep.,

Get your allergies in check.",How to Conceal Bags Under Your Eyes," To combat the blue and gray color under your eyes, choose an orange or peach colored concealer. Orange is the complementary color to blue, which means when orange is applied to a blue area, the colors ""cancel"" one another out.Pick a color that is only one or two shades darker than your skin – otherwise, the concealer will be visible against the normal color of your skin. Concealers come in liquid, powder, and stick form.


Liquid concealers are good for light coverage, while sticks are great for smaller or narrower areas.
Any type of concealer will work, though remember that liquid makeup may appear glossy, whereas powder makeup can give a matte appearance. Choose a makeup based on your skin type – oily skin is more likely to be “shiny” with certain liquid makeup, for example.;
, Apply an eye cream to both eyes to make sure your under-eye area is well-moisturized. If there's any hint of dryness, the concealer will turn chalky and become very noticeable to others.









Try keeping the eye cream in the fridge prior to application. The cold temperature of the cream contracts the skin, allowing for a tighter appearance.If you wear foundation, put it on before applying concealer. However, any powder-based makeup, including foundation should, go on last, after the concealer., Use either a small nylon concealer brush, sponge, or your fingers to apply concealer below the shadows of your eye bags. Dab the concealer on to provide an even, blended coverage, without smearing. You want to apply just below the crease of your bags and blend downward, toward your cheek bones, in a triangular fashion.Aim for the top of your cheeks, just below the bags and shadows.









Don’t apply makeup directly to the puffiness! The area under your eyes will wrinkle under heavy makeup, causing the bags to stand out even more. Applying the concealer below the bags draws attention to that area, instead of your puffy eyes.When it comes to concealer, less is more – too much can give a “caked” appearance.
If you use powder foundation, remember to apply the concealer before applying the foundation.

, Take a moment to let the concealer set. If there's still darkness under your eye, you may add a bit more concealer, but keep it light. If the concealer is too bright, you will need to blend the makeup out.









If the concealer is too dark, balance it out with a concealer that is one shade lighter than your skin tone. This will help highlight the area below the puffiness., Use a concealer or foundation of your natural skin tone to blend the previous application of concealer with the rest of your skin. This helps create a more natural appearance and remove a “caked” or overly-bright look.








Patting the concealer rather than rubbing help avoid smearing the makeup, and creates a more even blend.
If using your fingers to blend the concealer, use your ring finger. The ring finger tends to be the weakest finger, and provides a gentler touch., Use a pale, pink colored highlighter to add some color to the inner and outer corners of your eyes. This helps draw attention to your eyes, and away from the bags and shadows.








Avoid eye liner or shadow in darker colors. Such colors can draw attention back to the bags you’re trying to hide.
Don't forget the inner area of the eye, near the bridge of the nose. Adding just a small amount of concealer or highlighter here can help brighten your whole face., Use a face powder to set the makeup on your face, keeping it locked in and looking good all day. Take care to apply just a thin layer to avoid too much buildup of makeup.









No need to apply powder to your entire face. Just lightly dab the powder in the areas where you have applied makeup.
You can opt to use a bit more powder in areas prone to shininess – powder provides a matte look., The bags under our eyes are caused by fluid retention. Overconsumption of salt leads to this retention, meaning cutting back on the amount of salt in your food can help reduce the puffiness in your eyes.Lay off the foods that are high in sodium, such as pickles, olives, soup, and fast food.
Eat more foods that are high in potassium, such as bananas, avocados, and celery. These foods help balance the sodium in your body., The body holds on to water when you are dehydrated, leading to fluid retention. Upping your water intake can reduce this retention, reducing the bags under your eyes. Aim for eight glasses of water a day (8 ounces each) to keep a healthy hydration level.


Water is gained through food as well. Try upping the amount of fruit and vegetables you eat to supplement your water intake., A lack of good rest causes fluid retention and dark shadows under our eyes. Make sure you get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night, depending on your individual needs.


Though a lack of sleep contributes to eye bags, sleeping more is not necessarily a cure. If you already get plenty of sleep and still have eye bags, forcing yourself to sleep more will not reduce the puffiness., Leaving face and eye makeup on at night can clog pores, cause acne, and generally prevent your skin from restoring itself overnight. Make sure to wipe off any makeup prior to sleeping for the night to reduce damage to the eyes.


Use a moisturizing eye cream overnight to help remove wrinkles and lines associated with puffy bags., Seasonal allergies and sinus problems cause swelling, which can lead to those pesky eye bags and shadows. Talk to your doctor to discuss your allergies and see if there is a treatment option that can help combat the problem.


Over-the-counter decongestant or neti pots can help keep things moving in your sinuses, without the need for a prescription.
Stay hydrated! Water will keep those dark circles from appearing, but also keeps your nasal passages and sinuses well lubricated."

Drink several glasses of water.,
Apply something cold to your eyes.,
Apply an astringent substance to your eyes.,
Put potatoes over the puffiness.,
Get some exercise.",How to Cure Puffy Eyes1," Eyes tend to get puffy due to water retention, which is caused by a high concentration of salt in the area around the eyes. If you ate a very salty dinner or cried before bed you might notice increased puffiness in the morning. Drinking plenty of water flushes the area and causes the swelling to go down.


On particularly puffy days, keep drinking water all day long to keep yourself hydrated.
Avoid substances that tend to dehydrate you, like caffeine and alcohol.;
, Eye puffiness is a buildup of fluids in the tissues around your eyes, and like other types of swelling, it can be reduced with the application of a cool compress of some kind. Chilled cucumber slices are the perfect size and shape for your eyes, and they work well to temporarily reduce puffiness. Lie back and place them over your closed eyelids for 15 minutes, or until they grow warm..


If you don't have a cucumber on hand, wet some tea bags and place them in the freezer for 15 minutes, then lie back and apply them to your eyes for 15 minutes.
For a less messy alternative, try putting 2 metal tablespoons in the fridge and use them daily by placing the backs against your eyes.

, You can buy astringent creams and tonics that help reduce puffiness by tightening the skin around your eyes. Soak two cotton balls in astringent cream or tonic, lie back and close your eyes, and place the cotton balls over your eyes. Let the astringent soak in for about 10 minutes, then remove the cotton balls and rinse your face.


Sliced strawberries are also said to help tighten and smooth the skin.

, Potatoes are said to have natural astringent properties.Peel raw potatoes. Cut in half. Place the halves over your eyes for 10 minutes. The potato will cool your eyes and any swelling will decrease.
Try grated potato.Simply grate a fresh potato and apply it to your eyes for 15 minutes, then rinse.

Drink less alcohol.,
Determine if you have a condition associated with puffy eyes.",How to Cure Puffy Eyes2," If you have puffy eyes all day, it could be that you're simply not getting enough sleep, or the quality of the sleep you are getting is poor. Puffiness under the eyes is a common symptom of sleep deprivation. Aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep every night.

, It's not unusual to have puffy eyes upon waking. A possible explanation for this may be that when you are lying down for several hours in a horizontal position and then stand up, the fluid that was resting under your eyes is suddenly being pulled down by gravity. To reduce it, you can try using an extra pillow while sleeping so that the fluid is not as drastically drawn down when you get up.If you sleep on your stomach, try to move toward sleeping on your back instead. Stomach sleepers tend to have the puffiest eyes, since this position allows fluid to collect there.
If you're a side sleeper, you might find that one eye gets puffier than the other. Try to switch sides or start sleeping on your back instead.

, The skin around your eyes is fragile, and it can get stretched out and damaged by rough handling and exposure to chemicals. To prevent the skin around your eyes from getting loose and filling with fluid, change your routine so that you're treating your face more gently.


Don't use harsh chemicals to wash your face. Use a light, gentle cleanser instead.
Don't wipe or rub your makeup off your eyes; use a makeup remover so it comes off more easily.
Don't scrub at your eyes with a towel. Gently splash water over your face and pat it dry.
Use moisturizer on your eyelids and around your eyes.

, Puffy eyes are often caused by allergies, which inflame the face and cause water to collect there. You might see a big difference if you treat your seasonal allergies with a good allergy medication.


Try an over-the-counter medication or get a prescription from your doctor.
Be sure your house is free of dust, animal fur, and other allergens. Change the filters on your heating system and wash your linens frequently.

, Do you tend to eat salty dinners frequently? This is a big cause of puffiness around the eyes, since the salt causes you to retain water in the face. If you go to bed almost every night with a lot of salt in your system, it can actually cause the skin in your eyes to stretch out and sag over time from getting filled with fluid. Start these new habits to reduce the chances that this will happen:


Use less salt in your cooking. Try reducing it by half, then go lower if you can.
Don't eat out as often. You can't control how much salt restaurants use in their food, and it's usually more than you think.
Avoid salty foods like chips, salted nuts, pretzels, canned soups, fried foods, and other foods that tend to be high in sodium.
Snack on bananas and raisins, both of which alleviate fluid retention.Consume cabbage or cranberry juice. Both are diuretics, which will help you ""evacuate"" some excess fluid.Don't turn to caffeine as your diuretic of choice, as it can interfere with sleep and bring back the puffiness.

, Alcohol leads to fluid retention in the face, as well as causing dehydration. Limit your alcohol intake to 1 or 2 drinks at a time, 1 or 2 times per week. Drinking more than this will eventually cause the skin around your eyes to loosen.

, Sometimes the swelling is a side effect of another condition. Getting treated for the condition may help cure your puffy eyes. Here are a few conditions that commonly lead to eye puffiness:


Pregnancy
Hormonal variation in the menstrual cycle
Dermatitis (sensitive skin is more likely to swell in response to irritants)
AllergiesMononucleosis (puffy eyes may be an early symptom of infection
Medication (puffiness or water retention could be a side effect)

You may also apply a lightweight under eye cream before you apply your concealer. Look for a cream that is formulated for daytime wear. Nighttime eye creams are too heavy and will not do well under your concealer.Look for an eye cream that promises to plump and strengthen the skin under your eyes.
Your eye cream should have ingredients like vitamin K, alpha hydroxyl acid, or hydroquinone.;
, A concealer with peach or pink undertones will neutralize dark circles with blue, gray, or brown tones. Use a small pointed brush, concealer brush or your fingers to pat the concealer on the dark areas. Be careful not to rub it in. If you rub, you will move the concealer to the side and your dark areas will still be visible.If the concealer does not provide enough coverage, you may need to apply a color corrector first. If you have fair skin, a pink color corrector is best. If you have medium to dark skin, a peach or orange color corrector is best.
Only use the pads of your fingers to blend the concealer into your skin. Make a gentle, rolling motion with your fingers.

, Once your concealer is blended, set it so that it will last throughout the day. You can use a translucent setting powder. Stay away from mineral powders. These powders are shiny and may highlight the creases around your eyes.Use a small eyeshadow brush to apply the setting powder.

, Additional eye makeup will take the attention away from your dark circles. Mascara, eye liner, eye shadow, and a strong eyebrow will help people focus on other parts of your face.

Get plenty of sleep.",How to Conceal Dark Circles Under the Eyes3," The skin around your eyes is very delicate and is much thinner than the other skin on your face. Some extra attention can go a long way. Eye creams can be used day and/or night. These creams work by strengthening the blood vessels around your eye, reducing inflammation, and strengthening the skin.Look for creams that contain retinoids, hydroquinone, arbutin, kojic acid, topical caffeine, or peptides., Cold cucumber slices or cold green tea bags can reduce puffiness and dark circles.

Relax.,
Accept what you can't change.",How to Get Rid of Black Circles Under Your Eyes1," Get plenty of sleep nightly. It’s not completely clear why inadequate sleep results in dark circles under the eyes, but lack of sleep tends to cause the skin to become paler (thus increasing the appearance of darkness under the eyes), and reduces circulation.It’s also believed that too little time lying down is a cause in itself. Before going to bed at night, remove all eye makeup. If you don't, when you get older, your can look much more tired on a continuing basis.


Determine how much sleep you need. (It’s usually 7-9 hours per night, but varies for different people in various periods throughout their lives.) Try to get your target amount regularly for a couple of weeks to see if that helps.
Alcohol and drugs can negatively affect the quality of your sleep. For best results, abstain from these products or use them only in moderation.
Get adequate vitamins that assist sleep. A lack of sleep, coupled with poor vitamin absorption tends to reduce adrenal function. The less adrenal function you have, the less B6 you tend to absorb. The less B6 you absorb, the less your adrenal glands function and you end up in a vicious circle. Sleep, regular vitamins (where needed), good calcium/magnesium support in the form of eating a lot of greens (which are higher in calcium and magnesium than dairy products are) and a good mineral supplement restores adrenal function.;
, Allergies are a common cause of skin discoloration under the eyes. If an allergy is the root of your problem, treat the allergy or remove the allergen. Seasonal allergy problems such as the hay fever can frequently be effectively treated with over-the-counter and prescription medications.


For other allergies, the best course of action is usually avoidance. If your dark circles or puffiness are constant, you may have an undetected food allergy or an allergy to a chemical in your home or workplace. Talk to a dermatologist for help determining what you may be allergic to. People with allergies also tend again to be deficient in B6, folic acid and B12 on occasion. Taking a multivitamin may also help.

Gluten intolerance. Another common allergy that causes dark circles is gluten intolerance, which is an allergy to wheat flour in particular. More severely, you could have celiac disease. To test for celiac disease, have blood tests performed by your doctor. It's important to remember that you can be gluten intolerant, and not have celiac disease.

, A blocked nose can result in dark circles under your eyes because the veins around your sinuses are darkened and dilated., Eat a healthy, balanced diet, take vitamins, and drink plenty of water. A whole host of cosmetic problems can be attributed to vitamin deficiencies. Dark circles and puffiness are often attributed to lack of vitamin K or inadequate antioxidants. Also, a deficiency in B12 (usually anemia-related) can result in dark circles.


Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially cabbage, spinach, and other leafy green vegetables. Take a daily vitamin supplement if necessary. Get adequate fluids to improve circulation.

Reduce salt intake. Excess salt causes the body to retain water in unusual places, and this can result in puffiness under the eyes. Too much salt can also impair your circulation and cause the blood vessels under the skin to appear bluer.

, Smoking causes vascular (blood vessel) problems that can not only threaten your life but also make your blood vessels appear more prominent and bluer.

, Relaxing might help remove sources of stress and anxiety that are preventing you from sleeping, eating and resting properly. In turn, relaxing enough will help the skin beneath your eyes to improve as you feel less stressed and more at ease. Skin tends to reflect a whole host of emotional and physical ailments, so don't dismiss the need to relax lightly.

, There are some causes to under-eye circles you can't do much to reverse, unfortunately. These include:

Expect to experiment some.,
Stay away from shades that are too red.,
Add primer to your eyelids.,
Apply pink eyeshadow to your upper lash lines.,
Add eye shadow to the crease.,
Finish up with eyeliner and mascara.,
Do not apply pink eye shadow to your waterline.,
Apply eyedrops first if your eyes are red.,
Mix pink with other colors if necessary.",How to Wear Pink Eye Shadow," Different shades of pink are more or less flattering depending on your skin tone.

It will fade slightly when applied to your skin, and lighter shades may not show up well. For darker skin, a bolder pink is best. A pink with a purple undertone, for example, can work well.
For lighter skin, cooler pinks are better than bolder shades. Shades that are too bright may be overpowering on lighter skin.;
, Different colors go better with different eye colors. Before choosing a pink, think about what shades of pink would potentially go well with your eyes.If you have brown or hazel eyes, you're lucky as a wide variety of colors will go well with your eyes. You will be able to choose from a variety of shades of pink, from very light to very dark colors.
If you have blue eyes, silver undertones can really bring out the color. Go for a pink eye shadow that has a slightly silvery appearance. You can also go for a lighter pink, as colors with pink undertones tend to go well with brown eyes.
If you have green eyes, more reddish colors might work well. While you don't want to pick something too red, as this can look sickly, a plum pink or grayish pink would probably work well with your eyes.

, Even considering your skin tone and eye color, finding the right shade takes work. The colors of the whites of your eyes, as well as any dark spots or dislocations or blemishes on your face, can also affect how well a shade will look on you. It's a good idea to select a variety of pink shades at a department store and play around until you find something that's flattering on you.To save money, see if you can find small, sample sizes of eye shadow.
You can also buy cheaper eye shadow when you're experimenting. When you find an eye shadow you like, you can buy this color in a more expensive, higher quality eye shadow.

, When choosing a shade for yourself, you want to avoid something that's too red. A reddish shade of pink can make you look sickly. Anything with a reddish undertone should be avoided when selecting the right eye shadow., With any eye shadow regimen, you should always start with primer. This can help hold your eye shadow in place and make it stand out.Use your ring finger to apply a very thin layer of primer to your eyelids.Make sure to use primer sparingly. Too much primer may not dry completely before you apply eye shadow, making your eye shadow look smeared.
If you plan on applying eye shadow near your eyebrows or under your eyelids, apply a light layer of primer here too.

, To start, add your chosen pink eye shadow to your upper lash line. Use a corner brush, which is a think, pointed brush, to run a line of eye shadow all your upper lash line.You're going for roughly the same line you would draw when applying eye liner.
Once the line is in place, use another brush to blend it upward slightly. You want a strong line of pink near the lash line. The color should then move upward, fading slightly as it reaches the brow bone.
As you move the brush, use a motion like a windshield wiper to distribute your eye shadow.

, Your crease is the area between your upper eyelid and your brow bone. Once your lids are covered, you can apply a layer of your chosen eye shadow to your crease. You should use an eye shadow brush to apply. Choose a slightly smaller brush that can comfortably fit in your crease.Start in the center of the eyelid. Dab some eye shadow here, and then blend it out in either direction.
You want the eye shadow to be brightest at the center of your crease and then to fade out towards either corner of your eyes.
Use small, circular motions to apply the eye shadow across the crease.

, Brown or black eyeliner works well with pink eye shadow. Apply a small line of eye shadow running along your lash line.

If you notice bloodshot eyes, use eyedrops before applying pink eye shadow., You do not have to wear pink eye shadow on its own. If you like a particular shade of pink but it clashes with your eye color or skin tone, you can try blending it with different colors.Eyeliner works well as a blending medium. If your choice of pink clashes with your eye color, create a barrier by drawing a stronger, thicker line of eyeliner on your lash line in brown or black. The pink will match well with the brown or black liner, which will match with your eyes.
You can also use a more neutral eye shadow, like brown or black, near your lash line and the corners of your eyes and use pink eyeshadow on the crease.

Select an eyeshadow that is two shades lighter than your skin tone.,
Use your skin’s undertone as a guide.,
Create a dewy glow with a shimmery shade.",How to Use Eyeshadow As Highlighter1," In order for the eyeshadow to truly “highlight,” you have to use a shade that is lighter than what you would typically use on your face. Skip eyeshadows that are similar to your foundation shade and go for something that is two shades lighter than your natural skin tone.If you are naturally very pale and can’t find a shade noticeably lighter than your skin tone, opt for the lightest shade you can find with a pearlescent finish.
If you have a naturally dark skin tone, avoid the icy shades and choose warmer hues, like rose gold or bronze.;
, Opt for pearly pink or frosty champagne shades if you have cool undertones.For warmer undertones, avoid the frosty eyeshadows, since these can give your skin a grayish pallor. Instead, opt for shades that have a little peach or golden shimmer in them. If you have neutral undertones, you can go either way – try both options out to determine what works best for you.

, Eyeshadows come in a wide range shimmery shades, so experimenting with them as highlighters can be particularly fun. A muted pearlescent finish can create a subtle glow, while something with a little more glitter can create a high impact sparkle well-suited for a night out.









In general, you still want a product that’s two shades lighter than your skin tone, but experiment with the amount of shimmer you use to create different effects."

Brush on a powdered formula.,
Try a creamy formula if you have dry skin.,
Create a dramatic sheen with a liquid formula.",How to Use Eyeshadow As Highlighter2," Powdered eyeshadows packaged in compacts and pots are by far the most popular formulas. Because of this, powdered formulas will provide the widest range of shades and colors. If you have oily skin, or if you want to experiment with a lot of different highlighter looks, try a powdered eyeshadow formula first.








, If you have dry skin, the last thing you want to do is make it even drier. Powdered eyeshadow, just like regular face powder, can dry out your skin, emphasize wrinkles and create the least natural-looking results. Creamy eyeshadow formulas will glide onto dry skin easily and provide a natural-looking glow.








Unlike powder, cream formulas won’t collect in wrinkles and folds, which tends to emphasize these imperfections.

, Liquid eyeshadows have a similar consistency to foundation and, in some cases, may be even thinner. These formulas glide on with very little effort. They are often sold in metallic shades that can create a very dramatic highlight. If you want to create an intense glow, opt for a liquid eyeshadow formula.









Look for names that reference metallic substances, or use words like “glow” “moondust” or “glitter” on the packaging."

Use a shimmery shade on your cheekbones.,
Brighten up your eye area.,
Make your nose look smaller.",How to Use Eyeshadow As Highlighter3," Highlighter can alter how your facial structure is perceived, particularly your cheekbones. Applying it near your cheeks also provides a healthy looking glow to your complexion. Apply the eyeshadow along your cheekbones, or slightly above them. Aim for the highest point of your cheeks to add the most dimension to your face.Blend the eyeshadow out toward your temples.








Any formula will do, but a cream or liquid formula is often recommended to create a natural looking glow.
For the most natural looking results, highlight after you’ve applied your foundation, but before you apply blush.

, Highlighter used near the eyes functions in two ways. When applied under your eyes, it can banish dark circles in the same way concealer does. If you apply it to the inner corners, it “opens up” your eyes and gives you a brighter, more refreshed overall look.









Apply it to either or both areas, depending on what you’re going for, and then blend out so that the effect looks natural.Additionally, you can accentuate your eyes and give them a “lift” by applying highlighter right above and right below your brow bones., Highlighter can help you make your nose appear smaller or thinner. Apply a shimmery color down the bridge of your nose. Then use a shade that is one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone along the sides of your nose. Blend everything very well, so that it looks smooth and natural.

Apply your transition color first.,
Begin applying your bold shadow to your lid.,
Add dimension to your lids with the transition color.,
Line your eyes.,
Add mascara.,
Pop on a pair of false lashes.",How to Wear Bold Eyeshadow," You may need multiple shadows to create the perfect look, or you may just need one. Beauty supply stores will have eye shadow palettes or individual colors to meet most of your boldest desires, but you can also shop online if you’re looking for something very specific. You can find anything from retro glitter to opaque, neon shadows.


First, find the main color for your lids. This is the color that is going to steal the show, whether it’s neon purple or an icy silver.
Then, decide if you want any transition colors. For example, you may want to use a light pink or a lighter purple to add dimension to your neon purple shadow, helping to blend it out. However, you may want the ultra-bold look of just having one, stark color on your lids.;
, Eyeshadows typically come in powder form, but there are also cream shadows that work particularly well for bold looks. If you are going to be using a transition color and blending multiple eyeshadows, powder shadows work excellently. With powder, you can layer as much or little as you desire. Cream shadows work best if you want a quicker application, a shimmery finish, and want to eliminate the chance of fall-out., Bold eyeshadow looks great, as long as it isn’t creased and smudged all over your face. Primer will help keep this from happening. Not only does a primer help smooth imperfections and cover discoloration of your eyelids, it gives the eyeshadow a base to stick to. A good foundation sets you up for a successful makeup look., If you are using multiple shadows, the lighter one goes first. Blend this over your entire lid, into the crease, and slightly above the crease. You can start to create the shape of your shadow with the transition color, so that you almost have an outline to follow once you apply the bold, main color.If you’re only working with one color, you can obviously skip this step.
Learn more specific information on eyeshadow shapes and techniques here.

, If you are using a powder shadow, use a soft blending brush. With cream shadows, you can use a brush or even your fingertip. Start in the middle, gradually blending it across the entire lid from outer to inner corner. Blend it upwards so that it goes a bit above your crease, continuously examining your work in the mirror. With bold colors, it’s particularly important that your application is meticulous and even.Once you’ve applied shadow to both eyes, double check that they look symmetrical in shape and color.

, Again, you may or may not choose to use a transition color depending on the look you want to achieve. Add a bit of transition around the edges of your bold color, helping to soften it out. Then, carefully dot the lighter color along the center of your lid. You want to make sure that you don’t remove any of the shadow you just applied, but simply highlight the center of your lid a bit with the transition color.If you want a starker, more intense look, you may want to skip this.
Cream shadows typically have a bit more dimension naturally, so you may not need this step if you’re working with a cream shadow.

, Nothing complements a daring eyeshadow look like bold eyeliner. While you can use whatever eyeliner you feel comfortable using, liquid eyeliner can create a very pigmented, precise line that looks beautiful with a bold shadow. Line the top lash line from inner to outer corner, thickening the line as it moves outwards. Go back and smooth out any unevenness.If you want to line the bottom lash line, you can as well. By lining just the outer half of your bottom lash line, you will open up your eye. Applying the entire lash line will create a more severe look, which may be what you are looking for to complement your bold shadow.

, Bold eyeshadow can overpower your eyelashes, so it’s important to finish your eyes with mascara. This will help open your eye and make it look bright. Begin by holding your mascara wand at the base of your lashes. As you move it down the length of your lashes, wiggle it gently to avoid clumping. After one coat dries, feel free to add another for extra volume.

, If you want even more drama than mascara can provide, glue on a pair of false eyelashes. These are sure to make your bold eyeshadow even more eye-catching. You can purchase a pair of falsies from your local pharmacy or beauty supply store, and make sure to pick up some eyelash glue too, if not included.After trimming your false lashes to fit your eye, dot the glue along the band.
Let the glue dry until it becomes tacky, and carefully press the lashes into your top waterline.
Press and hold your false lashes into your waterline while pressing your fake and natural lashes together so they blend seamlessly.
