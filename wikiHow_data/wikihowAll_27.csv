Make your lashes pop with mascara.",How to Wear Cream Eyeshadow," It’s good to start with a good, clean base before applying any makeup. If you apply an overnight moisturizer before bed, you’ll want to make sure it’s off your lids completely before starting to apply makeup. You can use a gentle facial cleanser or just lukewarm water to rinse off your face and eyelids. Pat your face dry with a clean towel, making sure not to rub and potentially irritate your skin.
, It can be tempting to skip this step and start applying your gorgeous cream shadows, but this part is so important. A make-up primer will help to create a smooth base for your eyeshadow. It gives your cream shadow something to adhere to, which will help prevent smudging and creasing.Gently dab the primer onto your lids with your fingertip. Allow it to soak into your skin for a minute or two before proceeding.

, After you’ve applied your makeup primer, dust your lids with a mineral veil or your favorite matte powder. You don’t want to use much – just enough so that the creamy shadow has a dry base to stick to.You can either brush the powder on very lightly with a small shadow brush, or pat it on with your fingertip., With cream anything, whether it be lip product, blush, or foundation, you should choose a synthetic brush over a natural brush. Natural hair brushes are fluffy, while synthetic brushes are flat and easier to manipulate in cream product.Synthetic brushes will help the cream eyeshadow go on smoothly and evenly.

Choose a synthetic brush over applying the shadow with your fingertips, too. When you apply the cream shadow with your fingers, you are more likely to create unsightly streaking. The oils on your hands can also cause the shadow to crease more easily, as well., To apply the cream eye shadow, begin by brushing the product into the center of your lid. Blend the color across your lid, staying below the crease. Continue reloading your brush with product until you are satisfied with the intensity of your eye shadow. Make sure you’ve covered your entire lid, from the inner to outer corners., Instead of dipping your brush back into the cream shadow, you simply want to blend the product upwards to your crease. You don’t want your crease to have the same intensity as your lid, so it’s not necessary to add any more product. Gently brush the shadow upwards, continuously blending your synthetic brush into your crease., This step is optional, but can help to make your eyes look bigger and brighter. Choose a lighter cream eyeshadow that complements your lid color. White, silver, and gold colors work especially well for this step. Dab a bit into the very inner corners of your eyes.You can use this same color to highlight your brow bone as well.

, No makeup look is complete with out sleek, clean brows. Use a brow powder or a brow gel to carefully fill in any spots on your brows where the hair is sparse or spotty. Come the hair upwards with a spoolie to make sure everything is adequately and evenly filled in.

Learn more about the specifics of filling in your eyebrows here.

, For a cohesive, soft look, you can skip your regular, go-to eyeliner and use your cream shadow for this instead. Using a small brush, lightly blend your cream shadow along your bottom lash line. This only takes a minute, and it can make your eyes look polished and masterfully made-up., The cherry on top of your eye makeup look is long, luscious lashes. Curl your eyelashes first with your eyelash curler. Then, apply your mascara. Start at the base of your eyelashes, wiggling the wand as you apply the product along your lashes. For extra volume, apply a second or even a third coat."

Use an angled eyeliner brush.,
Be sure that the brush you are using is clean, to avoid color transfer from the last time you used the brush.,
Prepare your eye with a primer or a lotion.,
Gently dampen both sides of the brush in water.,
Lightly tap the brush into the eyeshadow.,
Close one eye to start applying the eyeshadow.,
Release your eyelid and keep your eye closed.",How to Use Eyeshadow as Eyeliner," You can use any brush you feel the most comfortable with, but an angled brush will likely be easier and more effective to use.;
,


It may be better to use an unused brush if you are trying to apply eyeliner. Bacteria can easily get in your eye since the brush is so close.

, This will help keep your eye from drying out due to the harshness of the eyeshadow. Eyeshadow is not meant to be used as eyeliner, so it is a good idea to counteract it by using a lotion or primer beforehand.


Take care to not let the primer or lotion touch your eyeball. It will not cause harm, but it will be painful.

, Do not make the brush wet, but just slightly damp. A brush that is too wet will cause the eyeshadow to run and will make it very difficult to apply.


You can also try to use Vaseline. Do not apply so much Vaseline so that the brush is clogged up, but try to make it damp.

, Coat each side of the brush with the eyeshadow. Tap off any excess eyeshadow to avoid fallout when applying the eyeshadow.


Try to use a darker eyeshadow so that it resembles an eyeliner color. Good colors include brown, black, plum or dark green.

, Start at the inside corner of your eye and follow your eyelid to the outside corner using the brush. Depending on the darkness of the eyeshadow, you may need to repeat this step a few times


Try to keep the brush as close to the lash line as possible for an accurate draw.

, Give it a few moments to dry and set before you blink, otherwise you'll get it smudged into your crease.


Try to set it with a translucent powder so that it does not smudge throughout the day.

Be confident!",How to Pull off Wearing Neon Eyeshadow," Skin tones generally have yellow (warm) or pink (cool) undertones. Choose a color that contrasts your undertones to avoid looking sallow or washed out. People with yellow undertones should avoid orange and yellow eyeshadows, while those with pink undertones should steer clear of red and pink shades. In addition, people with deeper skin look gorgeous in bright shades!, To enhance your eye color, choose a neon shadow with a color opposite your own eye color. Electric blues and greens bring out the richness in brown eyes, while vibrant oranges and pinks will make blue eyes shine. If you have green eyes, bright fuchsias and purples will make them stand out., Shimmery shadows are typically easier to pull off than mattes, so beginners may want to start with a shimmery finish. Flat matte shades make a bigger statement, so pack on a matte neon if you’re ready to jump all the way in., The easiest and most subtle way to wear neon eyeshadow is to use it as eyeliner. Dampen a small angled liner or detail brush and dip it into the preferred eyeshadow (dampening the brush intensifies the color). Carefully place the eyeshadow by pressing the brush along the lashline. This can be done on either the upper or lower lashline, or both!To amp up the look, use a different color for the upper and lower lash lines.

, Use a flat, dense eyeshadow brush to pack on your chosen neon shade. Avoid swiping the brush back and forth. Instead, gently pat the eyeshadow onto the mobile lid, being careful not to go past the crease (eye socket). Using a patting motion will make the color go on more smoothly and with greater intensity.Use an eyeshadow primer or base to increase the longevity of your eyeshadow.

, This is certainly the boldest look, but still wearable. Use a brighter neon all over the lid and a deeper color in the outer corner and crease of the eye to create interest. Just be sure not to bring the color up beyond the crease and onto the browbone, as this can create a messy look., Blend neutrals into the crease and add black eyeliner and mascara to help define your eyes and ground the look. Pairing neons with neutrals keeps the look from appearing clownish. Neutral shadows in a shade close to your skintone can also be used to help buff out harsh edges., Neon colors can often highlight the ruddiness and imperfections of the skin, so add some light coverage to your skin with your favorite foundation for a more perfected look. Since the eyeshadow is the star of the show, keep the rest of the look neutral with a muted blush and nude lip color., Avoid looking too matchy-matchy and keep the the look sophisticated with neutral clothes in basic, classic designs. If you really want to tie in some neon, match your shoes, handbag, or jewelry.http://www.thegloss.com/beauty/how-to-wear-bold-bright-eyeshadow/

Go over the area from your lash line to the crease of your eye. When loading your brush with powder, don't forget to tap it over the container first. Removing excess eyeshadow will prevent ""fallout"" on your cheeks.








Use other dark colors besides black if you'd like. Navy blue, royal purple, and charcoal gray work well. Just make sure whatever you pick for the base is the darkest eyeshadow color you plan on using.
Cream eye shadows work best for this step.
You can also use an eyeliner pencil for the base instead. Outline your lid with the pencil and smudge it across your entire eyelid with a brush or smudging tool.;
, Pick a dark gray eyeshadow. This second eyeshadow should be a little lighter than the black eyeshadow while still being fairly dark. Brush it on starting at your crease and stopping about halfway down your eyelid.

You can also dab some shimmery shadow onto the inner corners of your eyes for a brightening effect.. A splash of gold eyeshadow will especially make brown eyes pop.

Apply eyeliner to the outer third of your lower lash line. Connect the upper and lower lines at the outer corner of your eye.
Use a smudging tool to blend your eyeliner.

, Once you've added the mascara, your eye makeup should be complete. Check for eyeshadow fallout on your cheeks. Do your best to brush off any stray eyeshadow powder you may find. If it leaves behind a stain, touch up the area with a little more foundation or concealer. Add lip color to complete your look.








, Before you apply your smoky eye makeup, you want your canvas to be perfect. Use either a cleansing cream or a mild soap. Keep the water lukewarm. Hot water can dry out and irritate your skin, while cold water doesn't cleanse as effectively.








At the end of the day, always remember to remove your makeup. Leaving makeup on overnight can clog your pores, causing acne., Make sure you have a perfect canvas before you begin putting on your makeup.

Brush on a layer of eye primer to your upper eyelids. General makeup primer can also work, but specialty eye primers are more gentle and have better results., Clamp a curling tool to the base of your lashes. Hold it there for five seconds. Curling your eyelashes makes eyes look more open and will especially enhance smoky makeup.








You may also choose to do this step after adding eyeliner. Just make sure to curl before applying mascara to prevent clumping and breakage.

, General skin makeup should be finished before you add eyeshadow. Start with foundation and follow up with concealer, sealing both with a dusting of pressed powder. Apply blush and bronzer after. If you prefer not using all of these products, feel free to skip one or more.


Wait until after you've finished your eye makeup before you put on any lip color.

Cover your work area.,
Open the eye shadow compact and find the notch at the front.,
Stick a pointed tool into the groove to pry the plastic around the shadow out.,
Wiggle the tool back and forth to free the plastic housing from the compact.",How to Depot MAC Eyeshadow1," While the goal is to keep the eye shadows in tact when you depot them, you may sometimes nick the powder and cause dust and particles to come loose. It’s a good idea to cover the table or counter that you’re working on with paper towel, newspaper, or some old towels that you don’t mind getting stained.


Because you’re working with heated items, you should also have a trivet on your work area to protect the surface from the candle or flat iron.;
, At the front of the compact, you’ll notice a small notch where the compact snaps shut. Just above it, you can see a thin line where the pan’s plastic housing fits into the compact. That’s where you’ll need to work to separate the two., When you’ve found the groove between the plastic housing for the shadow and the compact, take a small, thin tool with a pointed tip and work it into the groove. Wedge it in the groove to give yourself some leverage.You can use a pointed kitchen knife, craft knife, or pointed, flexible makeup spatula that you can usually find on beauty supply or cosmetics websites.

, Once your tool is wedged between the eyeshadow pan’s plastic housing and the compact, wiggle it back and forth to loosen it. The more you move the tool, the further you’ll be able to stick it under the plastic housing. When you have enough leverage, you’ll be able to pop the plastic housing and the eyeshadow pan inside it free.Be sure to take your time when you’re prying the eyeshadow’s housing free from the compact to avoid breaking the plastic and damaging the shadow. If you feel strong resistance, continue gently wiggling the tool back and forth until you can feel the housing start to come loose.

Light a small candle and use pliers to hold the shadow above the flame.,
Push against the back of the shadow with a tool to pry it free.,
Allow the eyeshadow pan to cool.",How to Depot MAC Eyeshadow2," After you’ve freed the shadow’s plastic housing from the compact, light a small candle. Use a pair of pliers to allow you to hold the back of the plastic housing over the candle’s flame without burning yourself. Hold the plastic housing over the flame for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until the adhesive holding the pan inside the housing starts to melt.A small tea light is an ideal candle to use for depotting your eyeshadow.
Don’t allow the flame to actually touch the plastic or it may catch fire. Hold it several inches above the flame.

, After 30 seconds or so, take your pointed tool and press it against the back of the plastic housing. The goal is to push the eyeshadow pan out of the housing once the adhesive is weak enough.You don’t want to force the pan out of the housing if the adhesive is still strong or you may break the eyeshadow in the process. If the pan won’t come loose when you press against the back, hold it over the flame again to melt the adhesive further.
When you’re pressing against the back of the housing, it helps to target the center of the plastic.

, After you free the eyeshadow from the plastic housing, the metal pan will likely be hot. Let it cool for several minutes before you label it, place it in a palette, or otherwise handle it.Set the eyeshadow pan on a trivet or potholder to cool so you don’t have to worry about the heat damaging your work surface.

Stick a pointy tool against the center of the back of plastic housing to free the eyeshadow pan.,
Let the eyeshadow pan cool.",How to Depot MAC Eyeshadow3," To generate enough heat to melt the adhesive that holds the eyeshadow pan in the plastic, it’s important for your flat iron to be as hot as possible. Place it on a trivet on your work area so one of its plates is flat against the table or counter. Turn the iron on, and set it to the highest setting.Give the flat iron several minutes to warm up after you turn it on so you know that it’s reached the desired heat setting.

, Take the eyeshadow in the plastic housing and place it on the iron’s plate that’s resting flat against the work surface. Allow the plastic to sit on the iron for 15 to 20 seconds so the adhesive has time to melt before removing it.Use a small pair of tongs or pliers to remove the plastic housing from the hot flat iron or you may burn your fingers.

, Take a tool with a pointy edge and press it against the black of the plastic housing in the center. Push on the plastic until the eyeshadow pan pops free.If possible, wear heat resistant gloves when you’re holding the plastic to press the tool against. That way, you won’t have to worry about the hot plastic burning you. If you don’t have gloves, be sure to hold the plastic around the edges, which weren’t resting against the iron’s plate.
If it feels like the pan is resistant, you may want to place it back on the flat iron for several seconds to further weaken the adhesive.

, The eyeshadow pan will be hot when you press it free from the plastic housing. Make sure to let it cool on a towel or trivet for several minutes before handling it."

Pour some 99% isopropyl alcohol into a small dish.,
Apply the alcohol all around the shadow pan in the compact and let it sit.,
Run a craft knife or other sharp object between the pan and the plastic housing to loosen it.,
Wedge your tool underneath the pan pry it loose.When you feel the pan start to give as you work the craft knife around it, slip your tool under the pan to create leverage.",How to Depot MAC Eyeshadow4," Isopropyl alcohol can help dissolve the adhesive that holds the eyeshadow pan in the plastic housing. Take a small dish, and pour a few tablespoons (45 ml) of 99% isopropyl alcohol into it or enough for all of the shadows you plan to depot.While you can use different percentages of alcohol, such as 70% isopropyl alcohol, the higher the percentage, the more quickly it will dry and dissolve the adhesive.

, Take a medicine dropper and pick up a small amount of the alcohol. Run the medicine dropper all around the eyeshadow pan to dispense the alcohol between the pan and the plastic housing. Allow the alcohol to work on the adhesive for 30 seconds to 1 minute.If you don’t have a medicine dropper, use a cotton swab to absorb some of the alcohol from the bowl. Run the cotton swab around the pan, pressing gently to squeeze the alcohol between the pan and the plastic housing.
Don’t worry if you get alcohol on the eyeshadow itself. It won’t harm the makeup. In fact, isopropyl alcohol is often used to mend shattered eyeshadows, blushes, and powders.

, Take a craft knife or other pointed tool, and press it between the pan and the plastic housing. Run it all along the pan to gently loosen it from the plastic., Press upward with the knife to carefully pry the eyeshadow pan out of the plastic housing.If there is dried adhesive on the back of the eyeshadow pan, run a little more alcohol over it, allow it to sit for a minute, and then use your tool or finger to scrape off the glue.

Place a magnet on the back of the shadow pan.,
Label the back of the shadow with the name.,
Set the shadow in a MAC palette or other magnetic freeform palette.",How to Depot MAC Eyeshadow5," MAC doesn’t place magnets on the back of their eyeshadow pans, but most freeform palettes are magnetized. To fix your Depot shadows so you can place them in a palette, take a magnet sticker that you can find on a variety of beauty supply websites, as well as at craft stores, and place it on the back of your eyeshadow pan.Some freeform palettes include the magnetic stickers, so you don’t have to purchase them separately.

, MAC places the labels with the eyeshadow’s shade name on the back of the compact, so when you depot, there’s no label on the pan itself. If you want to remember the shade names, take a round label that you can find at an office supply store, place it on the back of the pan, and write the shade name with a pen or marker.You can also use a permanent marker to write the shade directly on the back of the magnet sticker that you place on the back of the eyeshadow pan.
If you’re using one of the heated methods to depot your shadow, you can also use the heat to remove the sticker from the back of the compact. Hold the compact over the candle flame or place it on the flat iron for just a few seconds to loosen the sticker’s glue. Use your finger or a spatula to pry up an edge of the sticker and then peel it away. Press it onto the back of the magnet to label the shadow.

, Once your depotted eyeshadow has a magnet and is labeled, you can place it in a palette. Some palettes have specific wells that the shadow pans fit directly into. Others feature a flat, magnetized surface that allows you to place the shadow pans in any configuration that you want.

Bring out the blues or greens in gray eyes by wearing blue or green eye shadow.,
Wear purples or browns to make green eyes more intense.,
Take advantage of the green and gold flecks if you have hazel eyes.",How to Change Your Eye Color1," You cannot use eyeshadow to make blue eyes look brown, and vice versa. You can, however, use eyeshadow to enhance the color you already have. Depending on the eyeshadow color you use, you may be able to make your eyes appear brighter, duller, or more pale in color. Some eye colors, such as hazel and grey, may be able to pick up tints from certain eyeshadow colors. This section will show you how to use eyeshadow to alter your eye color.;
, Orange-tinted colors, such as coral and champagne, work especially well on blue eyes. They will make your eyes appear brighter and bluer than they actually are.Eyeshadow that is already blue may make your eyes appear lighter or paler. Here are some more color combinations for you to try:For daily, casual wear, try neutral tones, such as: brown, taupe, terra-cotta, or anything orange-tinted.
For a special night out, try some metallics, such as gold, copper, or bronze.
Avoid anything too dark, especially if you have fair skin. When choosing eyeliner, go for brown or dark brown instead. It will be less harsh than black.

, People with brown eyes can wear almost any color, but cool colors, such as purple and blue, will really help brighten brown eyes. Here are some options for you to try:For casual days, stick with browns. To make your eyes really stand out, try a silvery-brown or a peachy brown.If you are feeling more adventurous, try wearing blues, grays, greens, or purples.
For a special night out, you can try metallics, such as: bronze, copper, or gold. A green-tinted gold will also work well.If you have dark brown or black eyes, try some jewel shades instead, such as bright blue or violet. You can also get away with silver and chocolate.

, Gray eyes tend to pick up whatever color is around them. This means that you can use eyeshadow to give your gray eyes a blueish or greenish tint. If you want to bring out the gray tones that are already there, stick with sooty, smoky shades, like silver, charcoal, or black.Here are some tips on how to bring out the blues and greens in your eyes:To bring out the blues, stick with eyeshadow in these colors: copper, melon, neutral brown, orange, peach, or salmon. You can help bring the blue out further by adding a touch of blue to the inner corner of your eye.
To bring out the greens, try eyeshadow in these colors: maroon, pink, plum, purple, red-brown, or wine.

For example, you can were purple eyeshadow on a special night out, and shimmery brown or taupe during the day.Here are some more colors for you to try:Any shade of purple will look great on you. If you don't like purple, try some pinks instead.
If you are hesitant about wearing purple, you could try wearing taupe eyeshadow over the eyelid, and use a dash of purple close to the lash line.
Black eyeliners are too harsh for green eyes. Try using charcoal, silver, or deep purple instead.

, Hazel eyes contain flecks of green and gold. This means that you can use different colors of eyeshadow to bring out these flecks. Here are some more options for you to try:Avoid using heavy, smoky colors. They tend to hide the hints of green and gold in hazel eyes, and make them appear murky instead.
To bring out the greens and golds in your eyes, try using eyeshadow in bronze, dusty pink, or eggplant. Army-green especially will bring out the green flecks.

To apply mascara, start at the base of your lashes and wiggle the brush side to side slightly.,
Line your lower lash line.,
Apply black eye shadow just below your lower lash line.,
Blend along the lower lash line.",How to Create a Smoky Eye for Teens," You will need a few different eye shadow colors to achieve a smoky eye look, so you may want to consider getting a special smoky eye palette. You will need:eye shadow primer
a black eyeshadow
a dark brown eye shadow
a cream color eye shadow
an all-over eye shadow brush
a blending brush
an eye liner brush
black eye liner
false lashes and/or black mascara;
, Primer helps to ensure that your eye shadow will last longer and that it will not run or melt off of your eyes as the day wears on. Apply eye shadow primer all over both of your eye lids.








You can apply primer with an all over eye shadow brush or just use your fingertips.

, The first layer of eye shadow that you will need to apply is a cream color. Apply this color over your entire eyelid, from your upper lash line to your brow bones. Make sure that the color looks even.








Use an all-over eye shadow brush to apple the eye shadow to your eyelids.Don’t worry if the edges look a little severe. You will be blending the color later on.

, Next, apply a layer of black eye shadow to your eyelids and creases. The black eye shadow should extend just above and beyond your creases.








Use an all-over brush to apply the black eye shadow to your eyelids and crease., To transition from the black to the cream color, sweep some dark brown eye shadow onto your creases, near the area where the black eye shadow stops.








Use a blending brush to apply eye shadow to your creases.Try using a back and forth sweeping motion, as if the blending brush is a windshield wiper. , Next, you will need to blend the edges of the colors you have applied to ease the transitions among these shades. Use your blending brush again and sweep cream color shadow along the edges of the other colors.]









Continue blending until the edges look soft.

, Use the all-over eye shadow brush again to go over your lids with the black eye shadow color once more. This will help to intensify the color.








Do not apply the color to your creases this time, just focus on deepening the black color on your eyelids.

, Since this is a smoky eye look, there is no need for a dramatic liner look as well. You can simply line your upper lash line with a small amount of black eye liner. Use a kohl eye liner or a liquid liner to create a thin line.Go slowly when you line your eyes. Use small strokes and keep the liner pencil or brush near the edge of your lash line.
To take attention away from your nose and make your eyes look wider, you can make the liner a bit thicker on the outer edges., Then, move the brush up and all the way through the tips of your lashes.
You can also curl your false or real eye lashes before applying mascara for some extra volume and definition., Next, apply a small amount of black eye liner to your lower lash line. This will help to define your eye even more. You can also line your water line if you like. Your water line is the part of your eyelid that is closest to your eyeball. Some women like to line this area, which is a technique known as tight lining.








If you decide to line your water line, use a clean cotton swab to dab away any excess moisture. Then, apply a kohl eye liner, since this kind of eye liner is formulated to stay on even if your eyes get a little wet., To give a smoky effect to the bottom part of your eye, you can apply some black eye shadow to the area just below your lower lash line. Use a liner brush to apply a thin line of black eye shadow to this area of your eye.








Remember to go slowly and use short strokes.

, To complete your look, use your blending brush to apply some cream color eyeshadow to the edges of the black eyeshadow you just applied. Blend until the edges look soft and smoky.








Since you are blending your lower lash line, try using an upside down windshield wiper motion.

Visit an eye doctor to get a prescription.,
Purchase your contact lenses from a legitimate lens retailer.,
Decide how often you will be wearing the contacts.,

Get opaque-tint lenses if you want a drastic change, or if you have dark eyes.,
Be aware of the cosmetic drawbacks.,
Be aware of the visual drawbacks.,
Keep your contacts clean.,
Never wear contacts longer than recommended, and take them out when necessary.",How to Change Your Eye Color2," Even if you have perfect vision, you will need to have your eyes fitted for contacts. There are different eyeball shapes, and wearing contacts with the wrong shape can be painful. Sometimes, your eyes might not be compatible with contacts. Other times, the doctor may prescribe a special type of contacts for you, especially if you have dry eyes., You get what you pay for, especially when it comes to contacts. In this case, it might be better to spend more on a pair of contacts and be safe, rather than buy a cheaper pair and be sorry later. Eyes are delicate, and a badly-made product can permanently damage them.The best place to get contacts is at an eye glass shop or from an optometrist.
Tinted prescription lenses are also available for those who have poor eyesight.

, Some contacts can only be worn once, while others can be worn several times. Because tinted lenses tend to be more expensive than regular ones, this is something you should keep in mind. Here are the different types of lenses that you can get:Disposable lenses can be expensive. Some can only be worn once. If you plan on wearing the contacts for just one or two occasions, keep these in mind.
Daily wear lenses need to be taken out at night. How often you replace them will depend on the manufacturer. Some need to be replaced once a week, while others can last for up to a month, if not longer.
Extended wear lenses can be worn even while you sleep, although this is not recommended. The longer you keep your contacts in, the more likely you are to get an infection. Like daily wear lenses, extended wear lenses need to be replaced depending on the manufacturer. Some can last for only a week while others much longer.

, You can also get these if you just want to enhance your natural eye color (even if you have dark eyes). Because these lenses are translucent, they are not recommended for those who have dark-colored eyes. The color simply won't show.

, Like the name implies, these contact lenses are opaque, and can completely change your eye color. You can get them in natural colors, such as brown, blue, gray, green, and hazel. You can also get them in unnatural colors, such as white, red, cat-eye, and purple.


Some places also offer custom colors and tinting.

, You will be putting lenses on your eyes, which can slide around when you blink. This means that if the lens moves a little on your eye, your natural iris will be visible. People will know right away that you are wearing contact lenses.


This will be most obvious on opaque lenses and less on enhancement lenses.

, Your iris and pupil change sizes naturally as you enter different light conditions. Contact lenses do not change size. This means that when you step into a dark room, and your pupils dilate, part of your vision will be blocked by the colored part of the contact lens. If you step into bright sunlight, your pupils will become smaller, and part of your natural eye color may peek through the clear portion of the contact lens.

, If you do not clean your lenses regularly or properly, you may get an infection. Some eye infections are very serious, and can lead to blindness. You should always keep your contacts in their case whenever you are not wearing them. You should also clean them with the saline solution before you put them back into the case. Be sure to refill the case with fresh saline solution before you put the contacts back in.


Always wash your hands before touching your contacts.
Never use your saliva to moisten the contacts. The human mouth is filled with germs.
Never share contacts with anyone, even if you disinfect them.

, This means that you should always take your contacts out of your eyes before you go to sleep. This included the extended-wear lenses. Even though extended-wear contacts can be worn overnight, leaving them in for so long makes it more likely for you to get an eye infection. You should also take out contacts before you take a bath or shower, or go swimming.Some contacts can be worn several times while others can only be worn once. Never use contacts for longer than the recommended time.
Saline solution can also expire. Never use saline solution past its expiration date.
To prevent bacteria buildup, contact lens cases should be replaced every three to six months.

Squeeze in a few drops of aloe vera.,
Mix everything together.",How to Create an Eyeshadow Primer1," Before you start, you need to find a little container to use for mixing your ingredients. You can clean out an old eye shadow pot and use that, but a Dixie cup, a contacts case, or any small container works fine. Just make sure it is thoroughly cleaned before you begin.;
, If you use powder foundation, you’ll need to invest in a liquid foundation for this recipe. However, you can use it on your face as well, so it’s money well spent! You can add as much of these products as you want, depending on the size of your container and how much you think you’ll use. Just remember to use the same amounts of both, and you will need to add the same amount of body butter as well.It’s best to stick with the foundation and concealer you use regularly, because you know it won’t cause an allergic reaction or a breakout.

, You can use facial lotion, but body butter works particularly well because it is thick and has a bit of staying power on your lids. If you choose to use a facial moisturizer, just look for one that is a bit thicker. Runny, lightweight lotions don’t work quite as well. Use a spoon or a knife to scoop out an amount of body butter equal to the amount of foundation you used. Because your eyelids are sensitive areas, test the lotion on a small patch of skin before using it in your primer.

, Aloe vera is know to decrease oil production in your skin.Excess oil on the eyelids is a major reason for smearing and fading throughout the day. By adding a little bit to your primer, you’ll be combating this problem.Make sure to buy 100% aloe vera gel. You can find this at your local pharmacy.

, You can use a spoon, a toothpick, or anything that fits inside your container. To apply your new homemade primer, simply rub a small amount into each eyelid. You can apply it directly with your fingertips. Seal the container and save the rest of your primer for later!

Get colored irises surgically inserted into your eye.,
Know the risks of getting irises surgically implanted.",How to Change Your Eye Color4," The surgery lasts about 20 seconds. It removes the outer layer of the brown iris and reveals the blue color underneath. Over the course of two to four weeks, the body will remove the rest of the layers. During this time, the eye will become more blue.

, At the time of writing this article, this surgery is still in its testing stages, so the long-term effects are not yet known. It is also not commercially available in the United States.It is also very expensive, and currently costs about $5000.The surgery only works for changing brown eyes to blue and is permanent. Like many eye surgeries, it may also result in blindness

, This surgery takes 15 minutes per eye, and is performed using local anesthesia. A flexible, colored iris is inserted into the eye, right over the natural iris.It is not permanent. The implant can be removed using a similar surgery.
The recovery time is two weeks. During this time, your vision may be blurry, and your eyes may be red.
You cannot drive after the surgery. If this is something you are considering, make sure that you have someone to take you home., Like many surgeries, getting iris implanted into your eyes comes with many risks. Your vision may worsen as a result. In some cases, you may lose your vision altogether. Here are some other complications you may expect:The fake iris will increase the pressure in your eye.

Find the crease of your eye.,
Cover the whole lid in your base color.,
Choose your second color.,
Apply the second color.,
Clean your brush or choose a new one.,
Blend the center of the lid.,
Blend the crease color.,
Continue both blending processes until you're satisfied.,
Check your makeup.,
Always make sure your brushes are clean.This is the most important step for blending eye shadow properly.",How to Blend Eyeshadow1," Depending on the shape of your eyelid, you may have a pronounced crease or a subtle one, but everyone has a crease in their eyelid. To find it, close your eyes half-way, then pull lightly up on your lid.;
, Choose a base color that works well for your eye color and/or skin tone, and dip your brush into it. Swipe the brush across the whole lid, following the crease you found in the previous step for your upper boundary.









Don’t apply color above the crease — it’ll look strange!

, A color that’s slightly darker than your base shade will work best.This is the color that you’ll apply in the crease to create the illusion of shadow and depth.


Rub your brush on a towel or paper towel before dipping it into your second shade to prevent getting the first color into the palette for your second color.

, Beginning at the outer corner of your eye, run the brush along the crease that you found in the first step. Make sure you apply this color evenly along the crease, but don’t bring the color all the way down to the inner corner of your eyelid.









Don’t worry if there’s a stark contrast between the two colors at this point — it should look a little strange at this point.

, Because you want to blend together the makeup that’s already on your eyelid, not add more makeup to the mix, make rub the brush against a clean cloth or paper towel in order to remove any remaining makeup from the bristles. A towel works a little better because of its rough texture, but paper towels don’t require washing.








, Beginning once more at the outer corner of the eyelid, make small circles with your brush, moving inward until you've reached the center of your eyelid. Repeat this process from the inner corner of the eye.









Although you should not be dragging your base color up into the crease color, you should be mixing the two colors gently with your circular brush motions.

, Move your brush back and forth across the crease of your eye like a windshield wiper, blending the color horizontally. Gradually move the brush downward toward the base color, keeping the brush moving in the same back-and-forth motion.









Again, you should be gently drawing the crease color down into your base color, blending them together.

, Switch back and forth between blending the base color up with small, circular motions and blending the crease color down with sweeping back-and-forth motions until you can no longer see a stark distinction between the two colors.









Don’t over-blend, or you’ll end up with overly dark, smudgy eyelids.

, Especially when you’re starting out, you might apply too much makeup and end up looking a little clownish. If you apply too much eye shadow, lightly dab at the excess eye-shadow with a piece of Kleenex or a cotton swab.









If you’re very unhappy and would like to start over, remove the makeup with makeup wipes or with eye makeup remover and a cotton swab, and begin again with a clean canvas.

, While you could use anything from your fingers to a tip to blend your eye shadow, clean brushes will result in a flawless blending effect.









Spritz your brush with a daily cleanser every time you use it. Just spray it onto the brush and let it dry; this will prevent bacteria from growing in the bristles.
Once a week, give your brushes a deep cleaning by using a gentle shampoo on it.Run the brushes under warm water to rinse out leftover makeup.
Fill a bowl with lukewarm water and a gentle shampoo or brush cleaner.
Swirl your brush around in the water, dabbing it against the bottom of the bowl to separate the bristles.
Rinse it under running water, repeating the process until no more makeup-colored water runs off the brush.
Gently pat the bristles dry with a cloth or towel, then let them air dry.

Put some chapstick in a container.,
Add a teaspoon of cornstarch.,
Finish with your liquid foundation.",How to Create an Eyeshadow Primer2," To make this primer, you will need 1/2 a teaspoon. In order to scoop out one teaspoon, run your chapstick under warm water to soften it up a bit. This will also make it easier to mix your chapstick with the other ingredients.The chapstick will help the eye shadow stick to your lid, and it’ll help the color look bright and bold.


Use an all natural chapstick so that it will be gentle on your skin. You can find this at your local pharmacy– just make sure to read the label!

, This probably sounds like a strange thing to add to something that’s going on your face, but it has a purpose.Oil produced by your eyelids can cause your perfectly placed shadow to smear and rub off. Cornstarch helps prevent this by drying up excess oil.In your primer, it acts as a barrier between oil and your shadow, leaving your eye shadow looking impeccable.

, Add 1.5 teaspoons of your favorite liquid foundation. This will help your primer match your skin tone. Mix everything together using a tooth pick, a spoon, or another utensil, and you’re all set. Apply to the entire surface of your eyelids using your fingertips.

Choose your colors.,
Apply the dark brown eye shadow.,
Apply the medium brown eye shadow.,
Apply and blend the highlight color.,
Apply and blend the black shadow.,
Apply the base color.,
Blend the colors one last time.",How to Blend Eyeshadow2," For a dramatic, smoky look, you’ll need four colors that will be blended together to draw attention to your eyes. Though you can choose specific shades to your liking, you’ll need one black shadow, a dark brown shadow, a medium brown, and a highlight color that’s fairly close to your natural skin tone.Beyond that, you’ll need a fifth color that will serve as the base color for your lid.


For the four blending shades, choose matte-finish products that blend more smoothly than shimmery products.

, Using a thin, stiff dome brush that’s good for buffing and blending, create a diagonal line that goes from the outside corner of the eye to the outside corner of the lid’s crease. It should be a very short line.









Begin pulling the shadow inward onto the lid, but not further than a quarter of the way across the lid.
The color should be darker at the outside edges of your eyelids and fade as it moves inward.
You should create a “C” shape on the outside corner of your eyelid — sweeping in a little bit in the crease and at the lash-line.

, Using the same brush, apply the medium brown shadow in a sideways, windshield-wiper motion just above the crease of your eyelid. It should see like you’re brushing the bottom of the bone in your eyebrow.








, The highlight color should not draw a lot of attention to itself, but is used to complement the heavier colors beneath it by providing a contrast. As such, don’t go nuts matting it onto your face.









Using the same brush, apply it to the area between the medium color and your eyebrow.
Use small circular motions to subtly blend it into the medium color below it.
You should not be able to see a distinct line between the medium brown and the highlight color.

, For this color, you need more precision, so use a smaller brush that you used for the three previous shades. Apply the black shadow in exactly the same area and shape as the dark brown shadow you applied first. Because you’re using a smaller brush this time, you should be able to see the dark brown color around the edges of the black shadow.









Switch back to the larger brush to blend the colors together and soften the effect.
Apply more dark brown over top the edges of the black if you need extra help softening the disparity between the colors.
Keep buffing the outer corner of your eye in a “C” shape until the two colors have blended together in a natural way.

, You can use any color you’d like on the center of your eyelid, but apply the product using a flat brush instead of a stiff dome brush for blending, use a flat brush that’s better for packing the powder onto your skin.









Apply the powder to the flat side of the brush.
Press the flat side onto the eyelid to apply the powder.
Don’t cover the darker color you applied earlier to the outer edges of your eyes.

, Switching back to your dome brush for blending, gently buff the darker outside corner of the eye toward the base color, using small circular motions to blend out the distinct line separating them. Keep blending any parts of the eyelid that seem to have sudden changes in color rather than gradual transitions.

Light, cool eyes (blue, gray): use warm colors to contrast against the cool color of your eyes. Don’t apply heavy, saturated colors, though, as they might overwhelm your natural coloring.
Brown eyes: you have a lot of options, because brown is a neutral color that works well with a variety of shades. You can use tan shades to subtly draw out the color of your eyes, or use dark or bright shades for a striking contrast.
Green eyes: purples, pinks, and rusty reds will highlight the beauty of your eye color.

,


If you have dark skin, avoid white and ashy shades, as they often seem to go on invisible over dark skin. If the color coming through from your skin below doesn’t bring out the best in your shadow, it will look dull and lifeless on your eyes.
Opt instead for deep and vibrant shades. Dark skin can hold up to a bold statement like shimmering gold or silver, or deep purple shades.
If you have light skin, avoid grays and silvers, as they can draw out a sallow complexion in your skin. Deep, saturated colors might overwhelm your complexion, so avoid those as well.
Instead, choose sheer colors that go on light and subtly highlight your eyes.

, If you’re going to work or running errands during the day, you might look like you’ve overdone it if you wear dark, heavy colors. During the day, either keep your colors fairly close to your natural skin tone, or use very light applications of colors that draw out your eye color. However, if you’re going to a big party or out to a club, go big! Go for dramatic shades that draw attention to your face.

, Matching your eye shadow to your outfit might look too match-y, and will draw attention away from your face to your clothes. You want your eyes to shine through, not your outfit.

Try to go lighter for blue eyes.,
Try going smoky for gray eyes.,
Try using muted colors for green eyes.,
Experiment with metallics for hazel eyes.,
Try using contrasting colors for brown eyes.",How to Choose Eyeshadow Color1," Using darker shades will distract from your eyes rather than enhance them. Neutral tones like coral, champagne, or a gray-brown will work best. When applying eyeshadow try swiping a champagne hue over your lid and a complementary brown in your crease.


Finish with a black eyeliner to really make your light eyes stand out.;
, Gray eyes are similar to hazel, but rather than containing browns, golds, and greens, they reflect blues, grays, and greens.Using smoky shades like misty grays or silvery blues will help bring out the natural gray of the eye rather than change its color.


Try using a darker eyeliner like black or a deep brown to draw more focus to the gray, too.

, Green eyes generally stand out on their own, so muted colors really help draw attention to their natural sparkle. Colors like a dusty purple/plum or brown will make green eyes appear more vivid.


Try a pale pink on the lid and work upwards with a dusky purple on the crease. Blend the two into a gradient and finish with a plum eyeliner to help make the green pop.

, Similar to gray eyes, hazel eyes can change depending on what color eyeshadow you use. However, to keep the natural hazel color, shades of bronze, gold, or deeper pinks like a dusty rose work best.


Try out a neutral beige on the lids and a green metallic on the crease to enhance the mixed hues without changing them.

, Almost anything works with brown eyes, but colors that are opposite on the color wheel like purple or teal will really help deepen the brown of the eye. However, colors like salmon, a coppery gold, or a reddish brown work as well.


For light brown eyes, try sticking to more neutral tones like a light pink on your lid and a reddish brown in your crease.

Figure out your skin tone.,
Try neutral colors for warm skin tones.,
Try silvery and blue colors for cool skin tones.,
Experiment with everything for neutral skin tones.,
Avoid ashy or pallid colors for darker skin.,
Stay away from grays and dark grays for fairer skin.",How to Choose Eyeshadow Color2," A simple way to determine skin tone is to look at your veins in natural lighting. If they appear blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone, which usually applies to those with fair or pale skin. However, if your veins appear green you have a warm skin tone and may have olive skin. If you can’t determine what color they are you may have a neutral skin tone and a darker complexion. However, keep in mind that those with darker skin can also have a cool or warm skin tone.


If you are still uncertain of your skin tone, question whether you tan easily or burn when in the sun. If you tan easily, you likely have a warm skin tone. However, if you burn, you probably have a cool skin tone. You can also decide based on whether you look best in silver or gold. Warm skin tones look best in gold, while cool skin tones look best in silver. Neutrals, on the other hand, look the same in both. If none of these methods seem to work, or you can’t tell, you are likely in the neutral category. , You want to work with the undertones in your skin, which tend to be yellow or golden. Using colors like bronze, light pink, coral, or light green will help enhance your natural coloring., The natural undertones for cool skin types are blues and pinks, so try colors like silver, teal, lilac, or gray to play up your features., Those with neutral skin tones are fortunate enough to have no clear undertones, which means they can pull off almost any color. To work with natural coloring, however, try taupes or creams. , These colors will fade and wear off throughout the day. Instead, go for richer colors like jewel tones (emerald, violet, ruby, sapphire), which will appear more muted on darker skin and last longer., These colors will not only wash out your skin, but they can also make you look bruised. To avoid this, go for softer pastels like lilac, rose, or baby blue. These colors will still stand out against your skin without being overbearing.

Figure out your hair color.,
Try everything for black and brown hair.,
Try neutral or natural colors for blonde hair.,
Try strong, semi-muted colors for red or auburn hair.,
Try pastels for gray or white hair.,
Try different colors for brightly colored hair.",How to Choose Eyeshadow Color3," Even if your hair is highlighted or colored, try to categorize it into one of the main shades: black, brown, blonde, red/auburn, or gray/white. This will make it easier when it comes to choosing an eyeshadow that works best for you. , Similar to having brown eyes, all colors work with black/brown hair. However, bold colors like black, purple, yellow, green, or brown will really work in contrast to your hair color. On the other hand, if you have fair skin and dark hair, it’s best to stick to neutral colors like gold and beige, or other pastels, so your skin doesn’t look bruised., Those with blonde hair usually have fair or pale skin, so dark eyeshadow colors can be overpowering. Sticking to colors like gray, pink, black, blue, gold, or cream will enhance natural coloring without making you look bruised or tired. , Since red or auburn hair is already bold in coloring, shades like black, pink, gold, olive, or copper will help the hair to stand out more without distracting from it. Shiny or shimmery colors may pull the focus away from the brightness of the hair.

, The lighter coloring will help complement the fairness of the hair color rather than detract from it. Colors like gray, lilac, or blue will help pull out the natural highlights in the hair.

, Anything goes for “unnatural” hair colors like purple, pink, or green, however choosing opposite colors on the color wheel can help make your hair color pop even more.


For example, if you have green hair try pinks and purples to make it pop. Or if your hair is pink, try a lime green or chartreuse.
For multicolored hair, try focusing on the colors that frame your face. For example, if you have blue bangs, a gold or dusky orange would look good.

Smudge eyeliner along your lash lines.,
Sweep a dark shade across your lid.,
Blend the shadow up to the crease.,
Highlight the brow bone and inner corner.,
Curl your lashes and add mascara.",How to Apply Smoky Eyeshadow1," A basic smoky eye usually starts with eyeliner. Use a creamy pencil liner, and run it along your upper and lower lash lines. You should keep the liner thinner on the lower lash line, but you can go a little thicker across the upper lash line. Next, smudge the liner with a small brush, your finger, or a cotton bud to soften it.Jet black liner is traditionally used for smoky eyes, but you can use any dark shade that you like, such as dark brown, charcoal gray, navy blue, forest green, or eggplant.
Using your finger to smudge the liner will give your smoky eye a messier, grungier look if you prefer that type of makeup.;
, The key to a smoky eye is using darker powder eyeshadows that give your eyes a sultry look. Choose a dark shade that contrasts with your skin tone. For example, if you have very fair skin, a mid-tone shadow may be dark enough for a smoky eye with your complexion. On the other hand, if you have ebony skin, you’ll need to use a very deep shade to create a smoky eye. Use a small, flat brush to apply your chosen shade across your entire lid, even over the smudged liner.








As with eyeliner colors, you aren’t confined solely to black and gray shades for your eyeshadow. Warm, rich bronze tones and other brown shades are very flattering, but you can also go bold with jewel tones, such as a deep emerald green, navy blue, or rich purple.
If you’re wearing the smoky eye during the day, you’ll want to go with a dark shadow that’s on the lighter end of the spectrum. For a bold evening look, you can choose a very deep shade.
If you’re worried about the dark shadow looking too harsh, use one that has a slightly shimmery finish. It will reflect light, and your eyes won’t appear quite as dark.
If you don’t have a brush to apply the shadow, you can use the sponge-tip applicator that usually comes with eyeshadow to press the color onto your lid.

, For a traditional smoky eye, the color should be darkest closest to your lash line. That means you want to soften it as moves it up toward the crease of your eye. Use a small, fluffy crease brush to blend the eyeshadow from the lid up into the crease using a windshield wiper motion.








Take your time blending the shadow into your crease. You don’t want any harsh lines or edges.
If you can’t diffuse enough color into the crease from your lid by blending with a bare brush, you can tap the crease brush against the shadow to pick up some additional product. Just be sure to tap off any excess so you don’t apply too much.

, Once you’ve finished blending the dark shadow across your eye, you want to use a light colored shadow to brighten up under your brow bone and the inner corner of your eye near the tear duct. Depending on your skin tone, apply an ivory, cream, or beige shade with a small brush to those areas.








While you can use any light shade that you like to highlight, it’s best to choose a shadow that doesn’t have too much shimmer or glitter. A matte shade is the best bet, but a satin or slight shimmer finish can also work well.

, Because dark shadows can tend to make the eyes look smaller, you want to open them up as much as possible. Start by using an eyelash curler to curl and lift your lashes. Next, apply your favorite mascara to lengthen and thicken the look of your lashes so they can stand out against the dark eye makeup.








You may need more than one coat of mascara to get help your lashes stand out with the darker makeup. Make sure not to apply too much, though, or lashes may start to clump.

Put a bit on your fingertip and dab it along your lids. Rather than stopping there, though, bring it far out along the outer corner and below your eye.








You will be sticking a piece of tape to your skin, so it’s good to create a barrier between the tape and your skin with a bit of primer. This will also make the tape easier to remove.;
, The trick to a perfect cat eye is having a crisp, sharp border where the cat eye extends from your outer corner. When you’re creating a cat eye with eyeshadow, tape is your best friend. Get a piece of tape about the length of your pinky. Stick it on the back of your hand first, so that it loses some of its adhesive and will be more gentle on your facial skin. Then, place it at an angle on the outer corner of your eye, so that it extends at the same angle as your bottom lash line does.








If you’re having trouble with this, just picture normal cat eyeliner. The side of the tape should line where that eyeliner typically runs.

, You can use any light shade that you love, but stay away from shadows with any sort of shimmer. A very light tan color is perfect for this step. Use a fluffy brush, and apply this shade all over your inner corner.









You will be blending your shadows out later, so it doesn’t have to be perfect.

, You will see why the tape is so important. Grab a small shadow brush and load it with a dark gray shadow. Begin running this gray shadow along the tape, beginning as far out as you want your cat eye to extend. Sweep it inwards, stopping about halfway along your lid.







, Grab a fluffy brush and load it with a medium brown shade. Brush it over the gray and softly blend the two together over your lid. The goal with this is to eliminate any harsh lines from the gray shadow, and seamlessly blend it into the brown shade, which will become the lid color.







, Follow the base you created with the gray shadow. Extend the black shadow along the tape, just as you did with the gray. Then, in only the outer corner, extend it up to your crease as well. This will create the really bold cat eye effect on the outer eye.







, After you’ve put the black shadow in the corner, start blending it out over the crease and upwards onto the lid. Don’t add anymore product to your brush – simply smoke, or blend or spread, out the product that you’ve already put on your eye. The tape gives you the sharp edge that you need for the cat eye shape, so blend away without worrying about ruining the precision you need for this look.







, After you’ve blended all of the shadows together, emphasize that cat eye shape one more time by adding a bit more black to the tape line. Because you’ve already blended the black shadow out once, you don’t need to blend it again. You want the shadow to be darkest along the border of the tape, because that will create the boldest cat eye effect.







, Carefully peel away the tape that you placed to reveal the sharp lines that you want. The tape allows you to create that sharp cat eye angle without needing to meticulously apply your eyeshadow. Double check that everything is fully blended and your eyes are symmetrical.








, The cherry on top of your cat eyeshadow are bold lashes. Grab your favorite mascara and start applying it as usual. Put the wand at the base of your lashes, gently wiggling the wand to prevent clumping as you sweep it up the lashes. Once your first coat has dried, however, apply another coat only to your outer lashes. This will make the outer lashes a bit more bold and curled than the rest of your lashes, emphasizing the cat eye shape you created with the shadow.








Set your makeup with a makeup setting spray. This will help ensure everything stays in place all day or night!

Press a medium dark shade over the base of your eyelid.,
Apply the darkest shade to the outer corner and crease.,
Line your upper lashline.,
Add liner to your lower lashline.,
Apply mascara or false lashes.",How to Apply Smoky Eyeshadow2," To begin your smoky eye look, choose a light shade of powdered eyeshadow that flatters your skin tone, such as a white, ivory, cream, beige, or tan. Use a brush or a sponge-tip applicator to apply it over the entire eye lid, from your upper lashline to under your brow. Dab a little in the inner corner of your eyes as well.








It’s best to use a matte shadow as your base shade.

, Start to add depth to your eye look by applying a medium dark tone to your eyelid with a flat shader brush or a sponge-tip applicator. Keep the shadow on the lower ¾’s of the lid, so your brow bone remains brightened by the base shade.








You may want to apply multiple layers of the medium dark shade to get it to the depth and intensity that you prefer.

, To really make your smoky eye look sultry and dramatic, you’ll want to work in an even darker shade. Use a pointed crease brush to work the shade into the outer corner of the eye. Start at the outer edge of the lash line and create a diagonal line toward the end of your brow. When you reach the crease, drag the brush inward to darken up that area. You’ll effectively create a “V” shape at the corner of your eye.








A black shadow would work with virtually any medium dark lid shade, but you can also use a darker tone from the same color family as the lid shade to keep the look monochromatic. For example, if you’ve used a gray shade on the lid, use a dark charcoal shade for the outer corner and crease.
Make sure to blend the dark shadow well, so there are no harsh lines or edges. You may want to switch to a clean, fluffy brush after you’re done applying the shadow to soften it.
If the dark shadow isn’t as dark as you’d like, layer it until you build it up to the intensity that you prefer.

, Use a creamy eyeliner pencil in black or another dark shade to add definition to your upper lashes, moving from the outer corner to the inner corner. Smudge out the liner, and then press a powder shadow in a similar color to the liner over it with a small pencil brush to darken it up further.








You can use a brush or a cotton swab to smudge the liner. It’s best not to use your finger, though, because it’ll give the look a messier feel than you’re going for. If you don’t have a brush or cotton swab, a sponge tip applicator can work.

, With the same pencil that you used on your upper lashline, line your lower lashes. Keep the liner as close to your lashline as possible, though. Next, use a brush or cotton swab to soften the line to give it a smokier look.








If you want a really sultry smoky eye, consider applying the dark eyeliner to your inside rim of your lower lash line, also known as the water line. Pull lightly on your lower lid to expose the area, and gently run the liner over it.

, Finish off your smoky eye by defining your lashes. Use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes, and apply several coats of your favorite black mascara. If you’ve used very dark shadows or just want a bolder look, though, you may want to Apply False Eyelashes to really add drama.








Don't forget to apply a little mascara to your lower lashes too.

Apply your eye makeup first.,
Use an eye primer.,
Keep the rest of your makeup subtle.,
Add color to your cheeks.",How to Apply Smoky Eyeshadow3," Many people start with their face makeup, and move onto the eyes later. However, you often get fallout on your cheeks from the shadows that you’re applying to your eyes. When you’re using really dark shadows, it can be difficult to get rid of the specks on your face without ruining your foundation and concealer. That’s why it’s best to do your eye makeup first and then apply your face products.








If you just prefer to do your face makeup first, apply a generous amount of loose translucent powder beneath your eyes before applying your shadow. The powder will catch any fallout, and you can just sweep it away with a brush when you’re finished with your eyes.

, You always want your makeup to look fresh all day, but it’s especially important with dark eyeshadows that fade and crease more noticeably. Before you apply any shadows to your eyes, dab on an eye primer. It will form a barrier between the oils in your lid and the shadow, so it stays looking fresh. Primer can also help intensify the shadows that you layer over it.








If you don’t have a specific eye primer on hand, apply a little concealer or foundation to your eyelids before using any eye shadows. Next, dust the lids with translucent powder to create a smooth base.

, When you’re wearing a bold, smoky eye, it’s usually best to tone down the rest of your look. That means wearing a bright red lip or super shimmery blush with dramatic black smoky eye isn’t always the best choice. Instead, opt for light, neutral shades, such as a nude lip color and a matte neutral blush, so your eyes are the star of your look.








Keep in mind that they are no rules in makeup. If you feel like wearing a bold red lip with your smoky eye, go for it. However, if you’re new to smoky eye looks, it’s best to start slow with a soft pink or nude lip.

, While you typically don’t want to go too bold with the rest of your makeup, it’s important to add some color to your face with a smoky eye. That’s because the dark eyeshadows can make you look pale and almost sickly. Apply a rosy or peachy blush to the apples of your cheeks and blend it back toward your hairline to liven up your skin.If you’re not a fan of blush, swap it for your favorite bronzer. Dust it over the tops of your cheekbones to add warmth and color to your skin.

Makeup primers smooth the skin and create a soft, even base for the eyeshadow to adhere to. It helps to make sure that your eyeshadow doesn’t smudge or crease throughout the day – two things that would ruin your matte look.








Use your fingertip to apply primer all over your lid, extending up to your brow. Let it absorb for a couple of minutes before moving on.
You can buy makeup primer at your local drugstore or beauty supply store.;
, Once your primer has been absorbed, apply a dot of your favorite concealer to each lid. Use your fingertip or a small brush to blend that over your eyelids and up to your brow. Eyelids can often be slightly discolored or blotchy, and this will help create a smooth, even-toned base for your shadow.







, You don’t want to apply your matte eyeshadow directly on top of your concealer, because that can create a slippery, smudged mess. Instead, set your concealer with face powder. Using a foundation brush or a makeup sponge, dab your foundation over your lids. Don’t rub your skin, or you will smudge the concealer you just applied. Simply press the powder over your lids.







, When you work with matte eyeshadows, it’s best to work with a light, medium, and dark color. The first thing you will do is apply your transition color in your medium shade. This color will go above the crease of your eyelid. In other words, it is the color that you will be able to see when your eye is fully open. Use a fluffy eyeshadow brush to gently apply this from your crease to your eyebrow. You don’t want a heavy coating of color, so use a soft hand.








Whether you’re working with shades of brown, black, pink, blue, or purple, it’s a great rule of thumb to have the light, medium, and dark shades.

, By applying your lightest color to your inner corner, your eye will look large, bright, and open. Use a flat eyeshadow brush to pat it into the inner corner and across your lid. This shade should go up to where your transition color begins.







, Using a clean shadow brush, take your darkest color and begin at the very outer corner of your eye. Sweep the color inwards, so that it meets your lightest shade in the middle of your eyelid. This color shouldn’t extend higher than your crease.







, Use a clean blending brush to blend out any harsh lines that were created between the three shades you used. The goal is to make your eyeshadows blend together seamlessly. Focus on the areas where the shades meet. Use a soft hand, focusing on gently blending rather than moving any of the product.








After you’ve blended your colors, you can add more of each shade if you find it necessary. This will make your colors bolder and more intense. Whenever you apply more shadow, it’s important to blend again.

, Matte eyeshadows are great for a smooth, more natural look, and cleaning up your brows will actually help accentuate your shadow.You don’t want uneven or unruly brows stealing the show. Using a small eyebrow brush, apply a brow powder or gel to any areas of your eyebrows that are sparse or light. You want your eyebrows to look even, full, and polished.


You can learn more about shaping and filling in your eyebrows here.

, When you apply eyeshadow, it’s normal to get some fall-out in your eyelashes. Once your shadow is done, you’ll need to clean up your lashes. Use an eyelash curler first, pressing down at the roots of your lashes to create a big curl. Then, apply your favorite mascara. Applying mascara will add volume and length to your lashes, and darken them so that they stand out against your matte eyeshadow.


Dark, curled lashes also help to make your eyes look bright and big, and they’re a perfect finishing touch for your matte eyes.

, Just like your primer helps to hold your shadow so that it stays put all day, a makeup setting spray seals it all in. Close your eyes, and gently spray it all over your face. It will air dry in a matter of seconds, so don’t disturb your makeup by rubbing or blotting your skin.Throw your setting spray in your purse to use as a refresher throughout the day and you’re all set!

Use pressed eyeshadow if you want to get a softer blending.

, You can use distilled or filtered water, makeup setting spray, or a makeup mixing medium. Avoid using tap water, as it tends to contain harmful bacteria. Also, do not dip the brush into the water, and don't get the eyeshadow itself wet. You want the brush to be damp, not soaking wet.If the brush is too wet, dab it lightly on a clean towel.









If you are using a foam-tipped applicator, lightly mist just one side. Press the wet side against the back of your hand. This will help saturate the brush., Keep your brush moving back and forth in one direction. Don't press too hard. Try to use the damp brush on only one side of the eyeshadow pan. This way, the other side will always stay dry. Even wet-to-dry eyeshadows can harden with too much moisture.








If you are using a loose pigment powder, shake a small amount into a dish or the cap first.This way, you won't pick up too much and end up with a clumpy mess.
If you are using a foam-tipped applicator and loose pigment, press the pigmented side against the back of your hand. This presses the pigment into the foam. It will help keep the foam from shedding loose pigment over your face., Apply it all the way from the lash line to the crease. If you plan on using other colors, such as in the crease and on the brow bone, you will need to let this first color dry.








, If you want, you can even use a different color, such as in the crease. For an even brighter look, you can dust some dry eyeshadow onto the wet one.

",How to Apply Scene Eye Makeup," Before you start on your eye look, you’ll want to create the perfect base. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, and moisturize your skin so that your make up won’t flake. Apply a foundation primer, then put your foundation on all over your face, (or just on troubled skin areas), bringing it slightly down to your neck.









For this look, a matte, full coverage foundation works best.It will make your finished look more stark, flawless, and dramatic.Apply foundation to your preference. If you’re having trouble getting an even look, try using a Beauty Blender or a foundation brush to blend it into your skin.;
, With a small foundation brush or just your finger, use any eye primer of your choice. Simply apply it all over your eyelid to your brow bone.








This step will keep your eye makeup from smearing or fading and help it to stay in place all day.
If you don’t have a primer on hand, try using concealer or a nude cream eye shadow as a base instead.,









If you only have a few stray hairs, simply pluck them with sharpened tweezers.
If your brows are a bit more unruly, take a bit more time to do them right. Use an eyeliner or eyebrow pencil and lightly trace the shape you want your brows to take. Comb your brow hairs straight up with a spoolie brush. Trim them with small nail scissors to fit the shape you have drawn. Then, pluck the stray hairs that fall outside your brow outline.
If your eyebrows are already full, just use a clear eyebrow gel to help tame them.

, Apply a shimmery white eye shadow with an eye shadow brush. Use a sweeping motion to put it underneath your brow bone. Also dab the white shadow into the inner and outer corners of your eye to help brighten them up.









Feel free to substitute. If you want a bit more color to your look, try using a glimmering pale pink or baby blue as a highlight instead of the white.
If you have a darker skin tone, you might want to opt for a warmer highlight like a shimmery champagne or brown.

, Sweep a slate gray over your entire eyelid. Use a lighter hand near the inner corner of your eye. Then, put a more concentrated layer of gray in your eye crease and outer lid so that your eyes will pop.









If you want color instead of a monochrome, substitute a vivid pink, green, or blue for the gray shadow.
Also consider mixing your gray eye shadow to help your eyes pop. Blue eyes are accentuated by blue-gray, and green and brown eyes look great with a hint of purple.

, Put some black eye shadow from the mid-section of your eye to the outer corner, right above your lash line. Also put some in your crease to define it. This will help compliment your eyeliner and make your eyes stand out.









When you do this, use a clean eye shadow brush, and dab on small amounts of shadow at a time. It is easier to add more than to take it away, when it comes to black shadows.

, After you’ve applied your shadows, blend them together to get a flawless look.Use a clean blending brush to do so.








Start in the outer corner of your eye, and move the brush in small, light circles inward. Concentrate on your crease and your lash line, where you applied darker shadows. Do this back and forth across your eye until the shadow blurs and the darker shadow fades seamlessly into the lighter shadow. Remember to always apply the lighter shadows first, then apply the darker ones. Be patient, as this step can take some time and patience.

, Thick, black eyeliner is a hallmark of the scene makeup style.Liquid liner looks best.









Try a liner that has a marker tip instead of a brush. This can make the process of applying your liner much less intimidating.
The tip of your cat eye should form along the angle made by the outer corner of your eye and the end of your eyebrow.
First, start in the middle your lash line and draw short strokes outward and then do the same inward toward your nose. It should be like you are drawing a dotted line.
Draw a small flick where you want the end of your cat eye to be.
Go back and fill in the gaps in this dotted line until it is thick and even.
For the scene look, line your bottom lash line as well, using the same technique. Bring the line up to meet the flick at the end of your cat eye.
If you have trouble with your eyeliner fading, try going back over it with your black eye shadow to set it.
Use a black waterproof eyeliner pencil to line your top and bottom waterlines. These are the inner lines of your eyes below your eyelashes.

, False lashes will add a level of drama to your eyes that is hard to achieve with mascara alone. Most drugstores carry false lashes, which come in various volumes and lengths. Choose some that are fairly thick and long but still natural looking.









Use a lash curler to quickly curl your lashes, and put on one coat of any black mascara. This will give your fake lashes some support.Hold one of the fake lashes up to your eye. If it’s too big, trim it to fit.
Apply a thin layer of eyelash glue to the line of one of the fake eyelashes. Wait about 30 seconds for it to become tacky.
Gently place it as close to your lash line as possible. Start in the inner corner of your eye and press the lashes down moving outwards. Don’t start too close to you tear duct, as this can make your eyes look narrow. A little excess glue is fine, as it will dry clear.

, Finishing your look with your eyebrows will make it feel polished.









Choose an eyebrow pencil that is a close match to your hair color. For this look, it’s all right to go towards a darker shade. When choosing eyebrow colors, unless you are a redhead, gravitate towards ashier shades with less red.
With quick strokes, as though you are drawing little hairs, fill in the sparse places in your eyebrows.
Set your eyebrows with a gel. These come in tubes that look like mascara and simply keep your eyebrow shape in place all day. You can use either a tinted gel or a clear gel.

Consider priming your eyelids, from lash line to brow, using an eyeshadow primer.,
Choose a metallic eyeshadow.,
Apply the eyeshadow like you normally would.,
Choose a gloss.,
Apply the gloss using a synthetic makeup brush.Avoid using natural hair, such as camel or sable.",How to Apply Wet Eyeshadow2," This method will show you how to get that wet, glossy look using eyeshadow and a gloss. The primer will keep your eyelids from soaking in the gloss, and help the ""wet"" look last longer.









Keep in mind that this wet, glossy look may crease over time. You will need to touch it up when this happens., You can use any type of eyeshadow you like, including pressed powder, pigment, wet-to-dry, and cream. The finer the shimmer, the more glossy it will look.


You can use a matte eyeshadow, but the color may change after you apply the gloss.

, This method tends to work best with simpler eyeshadow styles. Consider applying a base color all cover your lid, from lash line to brow bone, and then a second color from lash line to crease. You will be glossing the second color.









To make the color more vibrant, apply a cream shadow first, then a regular, pressed eyeshadow on top.

, This will give your eyeshadow that ""wet,"" glossy look that lasts all day. The best gloss to use is ordinary lip balm, but you can use clear lip gloss if you want something thicker and shinier., You can also tap the gloss on using your finger.








Avoid getting gloss into the crease. Leave a small gap. No one will notice, and it will prevent your lids from getting sticky.Avoid the inner corners of your eyes. This will keep the gloss from getting into your eyes and irritating them.

Primer creates a base for your makeup that helps it stay put and last all day.Because hooded eyes are prone to smudging and smearing, primer can make all the difference.Use your fingertip to apply the primer, and allow it to absorb into your skin for a minute or so before proceeding.;
, There are a variety of different eye shadow brushes that work well for different things. To apply your eye shadow most precisely, you will need a standard eye shadow brush, a tapered blending brush, and a firmer, straight brush. These three brushes will help you to get the most flawless application.You can find these brushes at a drugstore or beauty supply store.

, For hooded eyes, you will use a light shade, a medium shade, and a dark shade, all with a matte finish. You will also need one light shimmer color for highlighting.When it comes to choosing the exact colors, it’s a matter of personal preference. You can create a more natural look using cream and brown colors, with a gold or bronze shimmer. You can create a dramatic smoky eye with grays, blacks, and silver shimmer.

You can learn more about finding your best eye shadow here.

, This will highlight the hood, drawing attention to the extra skin that you want to minimize. Instead, use a shadow brush to apply a medium, matte color to your crease. This will give you dimension without emphasizing the hood., This is another simple trick to make your eye appear larger and more open. After you’ve applied the matte shadow to your crease and blended it, use your shadow brush to softly drag this color upwards to your brow bone only in the inner corners.You don’t want this to be dark or as pigmented as your crease – just a light application of color to open your eyes.

, If you have a beloved, light shimmer shadow, this is your chance to use it. By applying a bright shimmer into the inner corners of your eye, you will make your eyes appear vivid and youthful.Hooded eyes can make you look perpetually drowsy, so this inner corner highlight is a great way to counteract that.

A light gold, a pastel pink, or a pearl color are perfect choices for this step.
Apply it lightly with a shadow brush or even with a fingertip.

, The keyword here is light. You don’t want to use a super pigmented, frosty color, because that will make your highlight look extremely bold and unnatural. Instead, pick a soft, matte color in a color like champagne, baby pink, soft silver, or light brown. Apply it with a light hand, directly under your brow. This will give your brow bone more dimension., Using a tapered blending brush, apply the dark shadow to the outer corner of your eye, focusing on the crease. This will accentuate the crease even more, carving it out to add depth. Blend it thoroughly, so that there are no harsh lines in your shadow., When it comes to hooded eyes, the focus should be on the inner and outer corners, which are most visible. In fact for many people with hooded eyes, the middle of the lid is completely hidden when your eyes are open. Don’t leave it naked though. Apply a light color to the lid, softly blending it into the dark color on the outer corner and the shimmer in the inner corner., Just like eye shadow, a properly filled-in eyebrow can help to enhance the shape of your hooded eye, making it look open and elongated. Use an angled brow brush to fill in the thin, sparse areas of your eyebrow with a powder or gel.

Use small, hair-like strokes as you fill in your brows. Use a spoolie to brush your brow hairs upwards in order to see every spot that needs to be filled in.
For hooded eyes, it’s very important to avoid dragging the tail of the eyebrow downwards. Pay special attention to make sure the tail ends parallel with the outer corner of your eye. Make sure it doesn’t extend past that or swoop downwards dramatically, because this will make your hooded eye seem droopy.

, Rather than lining your entire eye with eyeliner, only apply the product to the outer corner on both the top and bottom lash lines. Use an eyeliner that you can blend, such as a pencil. Start applying the liner in the outer corner, moving inwards so that you’ve lined about 1/3 of your bottom lash line. Then, do the same thing on the top lash line.Use a straight brush to blend the liner. The goal with this step is to soften out the line, helping it blend into your shadow.
Make sure to use a smudge-proof eyeliner.

, Once again, adding a highlight to the inner corners of your eyes will make them look bigger, brighter, and more alert. This liner works with the shimmery shadow in your inner corners to really combat the droopiness of hooded eyes.A shimmery brown, bronze, gold or silver will work well for this step.

, Use your eyelash curler at the roots of your eyelashes, holding for a few seconds on each. Curling your eyelashes upwards will also help to open your eyes up. Then, apply your favorite mascara. For those with hooded eyes, your mascara is prone to rubbing off onto your brow bone. Make sure you choose a smudge-proof mascara to keep your lashes dark and luscious, but your brow bone mascara-free."

If necessary, gently pluck your eyebrows into an arched shape. Strive to straighten out your eyebrows when plucking them, and angle the ends of each brow to form a pointed shape.
Apply brow makeup in slow, steady swipes on the tip of each brow. Draw out the tips so they form a point. Then, take a brow plumper and brow brush. Paint the plumper across the length of your eyebrow. This will make your brows look more natural as you'll be using the plumper to blend your main brow with the drawn on tips.;
, A layer of eyelid primer can really help your color stand out. Dab a makeup brush in your chosen primer. Then, apply to your lids in circular motions. Make tiny circles with the brush as you slide it across your eyelid. Apply to the entirety of your eyelid, as well as to the area between your eyelid and eyebrow.







, It's best to hold off on applying foundation to your face until you're done with eye makeup. Bits of mascara or eyeshadow can spread on your face, contaminating foundation. However, a layer of concealer applied around the eyes is important. This will cover up any shadowy areas and discoloration.








Dab a bit of cover up all around your eye. Then, wash your hands and blend the cover up into your skin using your fingers.
If you'd rather not use your fingers, you can also use a small makeup brush to blend the cover up into your skin.

, Round eyes have a tendency to look somewhat sunken in. Adding a base of neutral eyeshadow to your eye can help correct this problem by making your eyes look brighter and more defined.








Take a larger, fluffier makeup brush and dab it in a neutral shade of eyeshadow. Pick a shade that matches your natural skin tone.
Brush your eyelid with the shade using gently, sideways motion. Continue from your eyelid onto your brown bone. Apply the shade until just under your eyebrow.

, You'll want a somewhat shimmery, bright shade now. Pick something close to your natural skin tone but slightly brighter. You'll be using a corner eyeshadow brush to highlight your tear ducts, as well as under your eyebrows. This can really help in preventing the sunken in look.








Your tear ducts are found on the inner corners of your eyes. Rub your corner eyeshadow brush in some of your chosen eyeshadow.
Turn the eyeshadow brush sideways. Slowly draw a line of the eyeshadow that outlines your tear ducts. Draw one line on the upper lid, and one line on the lower lid. You want a small shape, something like a sideways ""V"", encasing your tear ducts.
You should also apply a thin line of the shimmery shade underneath your eyebrow. Simply draw on a line or your chosen eyeshadow just underneath each eyebrow.

, The type of eyeliner you choose depends on your preference. Some people prefer working with liquids, while others prefer pencils. With round eyes, you want to apply liner to the outer corners of each eye. This can make your eyes pop, and also elongate them slightly.








Start with your upper eyelid. You'll be applying the liner along your lash line. This refers to the portion of your eye just above your eye lashes. You will not be covering your entire lash line. You'll start about half a centimeter away from the outer corner of your eye.
Slowly move your brush or your pencil along the lash line, working towards the outer corner of your eye. Strive for a thin, neat line. When you reach the end of your lash line, add a small wing to the skin just outside the corner of your eye. The wing should be very small, less than a quarter of a centimeter. To make this wing, use your eyeliner to add a small upturned line that points towards the end of your eyebrow.
On the bottom lid, draw another line just below your bottom eye lashes. As with the first line, draw a straight, thin line starting about half a centimeter away from the outer corner of your eye. Keep drawing until the second line merges with the first line.

, In order to brighten your eyes, you want to add some eyeshadow to the outer corners. Once again, you'll be working with your corner brush. Here, you'll want to choose a slightly darker shade. A brown or a gray would work well. This will balance out the lighter eyeshadow covering the inner corners of your eye.








Apply eyeshadow to your corner brush. Then, blend the eyeshadow slightly into the eye liner on the outer corner of your eye. From here, move your brush upward slightly. Create a curved shape outlining the outer corner of your eyelid.
Focus mainly on the outer edges of your eyelid here. Make sure to get into the crease where your eyelid meets the curve of your brow bone.
Then, add a small, thin line of the eyeshadow underneath your eye below your bottom lash line. This will create a sideways ""V"" shape that contains the outermost corner of your eyelid.

, If you're looking for a causal, every day look you should only apply eyeshadow to the corners of your eyes. However, for a night on the town, consider adding a fun, flattering eyeshadow to the remainder of your eyelid. Choose a shade of eyeshadow and use a larger eyeshadow brush to apply this to the remainder of your eyelid, filling in the space between the corners of your eyes. The shade is up to you. You may want to pick something that goes well with your eye color. Brown eyes may look great with a brown or gray shade, for example.








If you want something fun, consider sparkly eyeshadow. This could be great if you're going clubbing.

, Take a large fluff brush. You will use this to blend the eyeshadow on your outer lids into the remainder of your eye. Using sideways motions, swipe your flush brush back and forth from the corner of your eyelid to the center of your eyelid. Keep going until the eyeshadow is more evenly dispersed throughout your eyelid. It should look slightly lighter and more spread out when you're finished.







, Take an eyelash curler and clamp it onto your eyelashes. Hold for a few seconds to give the nails a bit of a curl. With round eyes, curly eyelashes can make your eyes pop and look bigger. Then, take your chosen brand of mascara. Starting at the base of your eyelashes and comb your eyelashes upward in slow, steady motions. Wiggle the brush slightly as you go, as this helps separate your lashes.







, Many people associate round eyes with a cute look. If you want to go for sexy or sophisticated over cute, go for a dark eyeshadow. A shade like gray or black can really help stave off the cute look. Apply the shadow to both corners of your eye.







, Round eyes often look sunken in. A good way to avoid this is to use different types of mascara on your upper and lower eyelashes. Use a lighter shade of mascara on the upper lids, and a darker shade on the lower lids. This will make your eyes pop upward more, making them appear brighter and bigger.







, Round eyes can look somewhat droopy. A good way to counteract this is to make sure you move upward with eyeliner. If you create a wing, always have the tip pointed up. A downward wing can make round eyes look droopier and duller.

eyeshadows in pale nude, white, peachy pink, light brown, and dark red
a champagne colored highlighter or eyeliner
black eyeliner
burgundy eyeliner
a highlighter or liner brush
a large fluffy eye makeup brush
a crease brush;
, Apply some Mac ""Blanc Type"" or a similar pale nude color of eyeshadow to your eyelids. You should apply the eyeshadow to the entire eyelid, from your eyebrow line to your eyelashes. This color will serve as your base for the red eyeshadow look, which will result in a better distribution of color and a more complex shade.








You may also want to apply some primer or foundation to your eyelids before you begin, but that is optional. Primer or foundation can help your eyeshadow to last longer.

, Use your highlighting brush to apply some Mac “Mylar” or a similar white eyeshadow to the areas just below your eyebrows (along the brow bone) and on the inner corners of your eyes. You will not need to apply any other colors to these areas.







, If you have a Manny MUA palette, then use the “Peaches and Cream” color on your eyelids. If not, then you can use a similar peachy pink color. This color will help to transition to the dark red shade that you will be applying over it.








Apply the “Peaches and Cream” eyeshadow to your upper and lower eyelids with your large fluffy eye makeup brush. Keep the color close to your lash line as you apply it.

, Use a crease brush to add another layer of color to your eyelids, but focus on the center of your eyes (the crease) and the area below your eyes.








Don’t extend the color too far past the corners of your eyes. Try to maintain a nice circular shape around your eyes.

, Use the “Mars” color from your Manny MUA palette or a similar deep red eyeshadow. Apply the eyeshadow to the areas below your eyelids first and then apply the red to your upper lids.








As you apply the color to your upper lids, avoid the areas just above your irises. Try to apply the eyeshadow in an arc or halo motion.

, Use this color to blend around the edges of the dark red eyeshadow. This will help to soften the transition from the red color to the color of your skin. Otherwise, the stark contrast between the red eyeshadow and your bare skin may give you a sickly look.








If you prefer, you can also use a darker color, such as “Aphrodite” from the Manny MUA palette or a similar dark brown eyeshadow to blend the edges of the red eyeshadow.

, Apply the highlighter or liner to the areas above your irises only. This area should be free of eyeshadow already, but applying the champagne highlighter or liner will help to enhance this area even more.








You can also apply the champagne highlighter or liner to your waterline, which is the inner area of your lower eyelid. Just make sure that you wipe off the liner tip before touching it to your waterline. You may also want to wipe your waterline with a clean cotton swab first to dry it off., Use a highlighter brush and gently dab this color on the areas of your eyelids just above your irises.








You can also dab a little of this color on your waterline if you like.

, To define your eyes a bit more, you can apply some black eyeliner to your upper waterline and apply some burgundy eyeliner to the edges of your lower waterline. Do not apply the liner to any other parts of your eyelids.








Remember to dry off your waterline with a cotton swab before you apply the eyeliner.
Try using a waterproof eyeliner on your waterline. Waterproof eyeliner is less likely to smear on your waterline than the non-waterproof kind., To complete your look, apply some mascara to your upper and lower lashes. Choose a true back mascara rather than a brown or blue. Black will look best with the red eyeshadow look.








You can also curl your upper lashes with an eyelash curler before applying the mascara if you like. Curling your lashes will give them more volume and definition.For even more lash volume, you can apply some fake eyelashes to your upper eyelids. Just be careful not to smear the eyeshadow.

eyeshadows in white, nude, light brown, brown, black, and champagne
black gel eyeliner
black eyeliner
eye glitter with glitter adhesive
a liner brush
a blending brush
a small flat brush
a small fluffy eyeshadow brush
a crease brush
black mascara
false eyelashes and eyelash adhesive (optional);
, Applying primer will create a good base for your makeup and it will also prevent your makeup from running.You can apply primer to your eyelids using your fingertips or using a small fluffy brush.









Make sure that you apply the primer to your entire eyelid. Start near your lash line and work up to the bottom edges of your eyebrows.

, Use a medium size fluffy brush to apply some nude or white eyeshadow to your eyelids. You can use any pale nude or white eyeshadow that suits you. Just make sure that you apply the eyeshadow evenly to your eyelids.







, Next, use your crease brush to apply some light brown eyeshadow to your creases. This will help to accentuate your eyes and create a soft neutral background for your eyeliner. Sweep the brush back and forth along your creases until they are evenly shaded.








Your creases should just look slightly darker than the rest of your eyelids when you are done.

, After you have applied some light brown to your creases, use the same brush to apply a slightly darker shade of brown to the areas of your eyelids just above your creases. Sweep the brush back and forth over these areas until they are evenly shaded.







, Next, you will need to blend the areas above your creases. Take a clean fluffy brush and sweep it around the outer edges of the brown eyeshadow that you just applied. Use this brush to blend the edges with quick sweeping motions.








Blending will help to prevent the brown eyeshadow from creating a stark contrast with your skin.

, To complete the base, take your small fluffy brush and use it to apply a layer of white eyeshadow to your eyelids. Use gentle sweeping motions to apply the white eyeshadow.








Make sure that you only apply the white color to your eyelids. Do not extend the color into your crease or to the areas above your crease.

, To begin lining your eyes, you will need to apply some gel liner to a liner brush. Then, use the brush to draw wings on the outer edges of your eyes. You may want to start with a small wing and go from there.








Start your first line near the outer edge of your upper eyelid and then extend it out and up. The line should have a noticeable swoop shape when you are done.
Then, start your second line just below the first line, near the outer edge of the lower lash. Draw the line in the direction of the other line so that they meet at the ends.

, After you have finished your wings, take a regular black eyeliner and use it to line your upper and lower waterlines and your upper lash line. Create solid, even lines along these areas.








To make it easier for the eyeliner to stick on your waterline, wipe it off with a clean cotton swab before applying. You may also want to use waterproof eyeliner to make sure that the eyeliner will not run., Next, take a small flat brush and use it to line your lower lashes with black eyeshadow. Try to keep the line as close to your lower lash line as possible, but it is okay if it looks a bit smudged.








If you do not have black eyeshadow, then you can use black eyeliner and smudge the edges a little bit.

, To apply the glitter liner, you will need to use a liner brush or a small fine paintbrush that has never been used. Get some glitter adhesive on the brush first and then dip the liner brush into your eye glitter.








To apply the glitter liner, run the tip of the brush along the upper edge your eyeliner, as if you are outlining your eyeliner. Extend the lines of glitter all the way to the tips of your liner wings.
You do not need to line the outer edges of your lower lashes, but you can if you want to.
Keep in mind that you can use any color of glitter that you want.

, To add some shimmery highlights to your eyes, apply a dab of champagne eyeshadow to the inner corners of your lower eyelids, just below your tear ducts.








Champagne works well with gold glitter, but you can use a different eyeshadow color to accent a different glitter color choice. For example, if you used silver glitter, then a light silver eyeshadow will make a nice accent.

, Curling eyelashes with an eyelash curler before applying mascara adds volume and definition to your eyelashes.Hold the eyelash curler close to your eyelids, so that the entire lash is inside of it and pulse the curler gently.








You can also turn the curler upwards slightly as you pulse.
Make sure that your eyelid is not in the curler or you will injure yourself.

, You can complete your look with some black mascara or another color if you prefer. However, keep in mind that black mascara usually produces the most dramatic effects. Apply a few coats of mascara to your upper and lower lashes.








Make sure that you wipe off any excess mascara to avoid clumps. Use a clean tissue or paper towel to wipe off the mascara wand before you apply it., For an even more dramatic effect, you can apply some false eyelashes.When applying false lashes, make sure that you apply the adhesive to the lash band and not to your eyelids. Then, let the adhesive dry for a few seconds before applying to your eyes.









Make sure that you place the false lashes right against your actual lash line.
Never apply false lashes with tweezers or other tools. Use your fingers to apply them."

It can help keep your eye shadow in place, which is good for metallic eye shadows since they are more likely to come off. Plus, it can really make the color and shimmer pop.Apply the primer across the the top of your eyelid, going all the way up to your eyebrow.;
, If you sweep across the top of your eyelid, you'll end up with glitter all across your face. Instead, gently press down on the eyelid with a padded brush, so you press the eye shadow into the skin, holding it in place.You can also use a flat brush to apply metallics., With your next color, press it along the eye line, moving from where you ended the lighter color to the outer corner of your eye. Press it into this line, keeping towards the eye, then move upward after you've finished adding color in this area., You may take your eye shadow above your crease at times, and that's fine. However, with metallics, it's best to stay down lower, at least with the main color. Covering the crease with a metallic just makes it stand out more., For a more sophisticated look, try a shimmer rather than one that has large pieces of glitter.Of course, for a fun night out on the town, including a funky dance club, you may want to opt for the glittery kind instead.

, For lighter, skins tones, pick a platinum, silver, or rose gold. For more olive-colored skin, try gold, rose gold, or bronze. Darker skin tones can get away with any of these shades.Rose gold goes well with any skin tone.

, Because metallics tend to stand out more, using more than two colors at once can make them seem like too much. Stick to one or two colors to make your metallic eye shadow seem more up-to-date., Using a lighter metallic color, such as a sparkling white, on the inner corner of the eye helps make your eyes look brighter. It also makes them look a bit wider, opening them. Start in the corner, and press it in with a small padded brush. Go a third of the way across the top of your eye.You can also just apply metallics to the corner of your eye, such as a bit of gold in the corner, and leave the rest of your eyelids bare or choose a matte color., Another way to add a bit of metallic pop without going all out is to just add it on top of another color. Once you've added your other color, brush a bit of your metallic color into the middle of your upper lid, blending it in just a bit., Because metallics stand out so much, try using a less glamorous matte shade with it, particularly a more neutral color. You can use the matte shade to help soften the edges by blending the metallic in., You can also make your metallic shadow the dominant color. Start at the base of the eye lid at the lash line, near the inner corner. Press it in along the line, then press it upward until you reach the crease. You can also add a dash on your lower lid.You can also run a highlighter color just under your brow line before adding in your main color up to your crease. The main color should be darker than the highlighter."

Wet your face and pour some cleanser into your hands. Work the cleanser into a lather, and then gently massage it into your face for about 30 seconds using circular motions.Use a gel cleanser if you wear a lot of makeup, and a cream cleanser if your skin needs more hydration.;
, Fill your hands with clean water and rinse the cleanser off your face. When you have removed all traces of the cleanser, pat your face dry with a clean, soft towel. Be sure to leave your skin slightly damp., Before your skin dries completely, apply your favorite after-cleaning facial products. This can include:


Serums
Eye creams
Toners
Moisturizers

, Another important part of making sure your eyeshadow lasts is to provide the shadow with a base to stick to. While eyeshadow may initially stick to your skin, over time it will smear, smudge, and fade. But if you use a base, the eyeshadow will have something else to stick to, meaning it will last longer, and will look more vibrant. Popular eyeshadow bases include:


Primers
Concealers and foundations
Eyeliner

, Just like you can prime a wall before painting it, so too can you prime your skin before applying makeup. Be sure to use an oil-free primer that’s specifically designed for the eyes.Use a pea sized amount for each eye and use your finger or a brush to gently rub a thin layer of primer all over your eyelids and underneath your eyes.Let it dry for a few seconds before moving on and applying your eyeshadow., Oil-free liquid concealer or foundation can be used as a substitute for primer. Apply a light coat of concealer or foundation to your eyelid like you would a primer, and then allow it to set for a few seconds. Then apply a thin layer of face powder over top of the concealer.Using concealer will help cover up redness and veins,which is especially important if you're going to be using a light eyeshadow.
Be sure to use a concealer or foundation that’s a shade lighter than your skin tone to even out your complexion.

, Choose a white eyeliner or an eyeliner that’s a similar shade to the eyeshadow that you'll be applying (this will make the color even more intense).Starting at your lash line, apply the eyeliner to your eyelid all the way up to the crease of your eye.


Blend the eyeliner by gently rubbing it into your eyelid with your finger.When you do apply your eyeshadow, be sure to gently press it into the base you’ve created with the eyeliner.

, To make your eyeshadow last as long as possible, use a combination of cream and powder eyeshadows on top of your base. Start with the cream shadow, applying it with a brush to your eyelid, lash line, and the crease of your eye.If you are using different shades of eyeshadow, experiment with different cream and powder hues to see how they can be mixed and matched to create different effects.

, Dip a clean brush into your powder eyeshadow and tap off the excess. Apply a layer of powder over top of the cream eyeshadow.Once you have applied all your eyeshadow, you can apply your eyeliner, and then your mascara. For the best results and to prevent smearing, use a quick drying eyeliner., As a final, optional step, consider using a makeup setting spray over top of your eyeshadow that will set your makeup and help it last longer.Makeup setting sprays do for makeup what hairspray does for your hairdo: they keep it in place longer. These products go by several names, including:


Fixing mist
Makeup fixer
Set and stay

",How to Apply Eyeshadow for Brown Skin," Depending on whether you have light brown skin or dark brown skin, your color palette will vary for eye liner, eyeshadow and mascara.
,

For those with lighter skin, eyeshadow that falls in the champagne color range may be favorable. Eyeshadow for darker skin can be in the coral family.



 


If you don't have access to a makeup brush, or you don't like the resulting effect, many people choose to apply the eyeshadow with the tip of the index finger.







, Pink accents the natural hues of dark skin. When applying, don't go above the natural crease of the eye.

, When applying, start at the base of the lashes and move up to the lash ends. Move the brush in a slight back and forth motion as you move up. This prevents the mascara from clumping.

Choose your eyeshadow.,
Select the right brushes.,
Know how to apply your eyeshadow.,
Apply your normal face makeup.",How to Apply Eyeshadow1," With entire stores designated just to eyeshadow options, choosing the right texture, hue, and brand can seem incredibly intimidating. Don’t allow the vast variety to scare you though - embrace it! The hundreds of options give you much flexibility in choosing the best eyeshadow for you. Shadows come in every color imaginable and can be found in loose powder, compact powder, and cream forms.


The most highly pigmented eyeshadow is typically sold as a loose powder, but these are also the most difficult to control because of their loose form. Cream shadows are easy to apply but crease more quickly than powder eyeshadows. The best texture to start with as a novice eyeshadow-applier is a compact powder.
Although you don’t need to have dozens of colors to be an eyeshadow artist, it is recommended that you have at least three shades of eyeshadow in the same color palette. Several different looks require a light, medium, and dark eyeshadow.
If you don’t want to look overdone with your eyeshadow, choose three shades that are in neutral tones, such as browns or grays. Otherwise, choose any colors that might appeal to you and your style.;
, Although you can indeed apply your eyeshadow using your fingertips, they will likely be too big and are coated in natural oils which make application difficult. Invest in a few good makeup brushes for the easiest and most attractive eyeshadow application. Avoid using sponge brushes for your eyeshadow, as these do not apply the pigment well at all.


Use a stiff flat brush to apply eyeshadow to your entire lid. This brush is best for picking up lots of pigment and distributing it over your entire eyelid.
A soft or stiff dome brush is used for applying eyeshadow to your crease and blending it outwards. These are a must-have for getting a smooth, even gradation of color from your lash line up to your browbone.
Get a soft pencil brush to apply eyeshadow close to your lash line. These are small and thin enough to work on both your upper and lower lash line, as well as in difficult to reach areas like the inner corner of your eyes.

, One of the most important aspects of applying your eyeshadow is using the correct brush strokes and speed. Rushing through your makeup or using the wrong brush strokes will create a messy, unattractive eyeshadow application.









When you first apply the pigment to your eyelid, pat the eyeshadow on rather than brushing it across your lid. This will help it to stick to your lid better and give a solid rather than patchy appearance.
Instead of sweeping your eyeshadow back and forth across your eye in a fast motion, use short, slow brush strokes going in the same direction to blend colors. You should never be moving your hand quickly as you apply your eyeshadow.
Unless you are using a highlighter color, you should never apply your eyeshadow all the way up to your eyebrows. This is a surefire way to over-dramatize your eyes and make them look much too overdone.

, Doing your eye makeup should be the last step in your makeup application process, so put on your regular makeup first. Apply your concealer, foundation, blush or bronzer, and brow liner before making your way to your eyeshadow.









Apply a shadow primer to help your eyeshadow last all day. If you don’t, the natural oils your skin creates will seep through the shadow and cause it to gather along your crease several hours into wearing it.
Never apply your mascara before putting on your eyeshadow, and unless you are doing a specialized smokey eye your eyeliner should come after you eyeshadow as well.

Get a liquid metal eyeshadow kit.,
Consider applying some basic eyeshadow first.,
Place 1 to 2 drops of the clear, liquid primer into the pan lid.,
Add a dab of the metallic eyeshadow primer into the pan lid.,
Swirl the two together until they are evenly mixed together.,
Use your finger to gently pat the eyeshadow onto your eyelid.,
Add more layers if needed.,
Finish off with some eyeliner and mascara, if desired.",How to Apply Liquid Metal Eyeshadow1," They are often labeled as ""metal foil."" These kits contain a metallic, pressed powder eyeshadow and a clear, liquid primer.;
, Liquid metal eyeshadow is best applied just on the lid or inner corners of your eye. This means that the rest of your eye area (ie: the brow, the crease, etc.) will be bare. You can add some depth to your overall look by applying a matte highlight to your brow bone, a base color to your eyelid, and a darker color to the crease and outer corner. Don't go overboard here, however; you want the liquid metal to be the star.


Match the base color to your liquid metal eyeshadow. It should be matte, so as not to compete with the liquid metal eyeshadow.

, Open up your pan of metallic eyeshadow, then add 1 to 2 drops of the liquid primer onto the lid.If you don't want to dirty up your eyeshadow pan, you can use a clean dish instead.


For a more opaque look, dab the primer directly onto your eyelid.

, Pick up some eyeshadow with a clean finger. You can also use a foam-tipped eyeshadow brush or the end of a makeup brush handle. Place the eyeshadow right into the primer.If you added the primer onto your eyelid, let the primer set for a few seconds. You want it to be somewhat wet and tacky, but not dry.

, You can use your finger to do this, since you will be using your finger to apply the eyeshadow anyway. Alternatively, you can stir the two together with a makeup brush handle.

, If you want, you can try using a foam-tipped eyeshadow brush instead, but many makeup artists find that a clean finger works best. Always pat the eyeshadow on; don't rub it in.If you added the primer onto your eyelid, pick up some eyeshadow with your fingertip, then pat it onto your eyelid.

, If the eyeshadow is not shimmery enough for you, repeat the process to add on more layers. Always pat the eyeshadow on, so as not to disturb the previous layers., For an even more dramatic look, you could pop on some false eyelashes.

Apply your lightest color.,
Add your middle hue.,
Contour your lid with your darkest shade.,
Blend your eyeshadows.",How to Apply Eyeshadow2," Normally called a highlighter shade, this is typically a creamy nude eyeshadow. Use your stiff flat brush to put this on the inner corners of your eyes, sweeping it up and down to gather just slightly on the upper and lower lash line. Apply a light sweep of it as well just below your eyebrows.








, Take your color that is one step darker than your lightest - your medium shade. Use your flat brush to pat this color over the entirety of your lid, from your lash line to your crease. Don’t go too much further above your crease or outwards from the corner of your eye.








, Use your dome brush with your darkest eyeshadow color to contour your eyelid. Start at the outside corner of your eye, and sweep the brush in a half-moon motion up and around to the center of your crease. Keep the shadow the darkest along your lash line, and fade it out as you move up. Feel free to draw the shadow up towards the end of your eyebrow a bit for an angled fan.








, Clean your dome brush with antibacterial brush cleaner or soap and water, and dry it on a clean towel. Use your clean brush to blend along the edges of your shadow so that they fade nicely into your skin tone, as well as along your eyelid so that your three colors blend together. Use soft, sweeping brush strokes to blend the shadows.

Put your middle tone over your eyelid.,
Accentuate your lid with your darkest eyeshadow.,
Blend the shadows.",How to Apply Eyeshadow3," Use your stiff flat brush to add a coat of your middle color eyeshadow to your eyelid, focusing on the center. This look requires only your middle and dark shades, although you can choose to add a highlighter if you would like.








, Use your dome brush to apply your dark shade of eyeshadow to the inner and outer ⅓ of your eyelid. This means that your eyelid will have an application of ‘dark-middle-dark’ across the eyelid. Avoid getting the dark shadow too far inside the corners, as this will create the illusion of sleepy purple circles under your eyes. You can also choose to drag the outer edge of the dark shadow slightly upwards towards the end of your brow for a more dramatic look.








, Clean your dome brush with brush cleaner or soap and water, and dry it completely on a clean cloth. Use it in a soft, brushing motion to blend the two colors together on your eyelid. Avoid bringing the darkest color too close to the center of your lid, as this will muddy the highlighted section you have created. Blend the outer edges of your eyeshadow as well, so there are no harsh colorblocking lines or sections on your lid.

Cover your lid with your middle hue.,
Add your crease color.,
Blend your colors.",How to Apply Eyeshadow4," Create your base color by using a stiff flat brush to pat on your medium color over the entirety of your eyelid. If you want, you can also add a tiny smudge of your highlighter shade to the inner corner of your eyes or just below your brow to brighten up your face a bit.








, Use your pencil brush and your darkest color to darken your crease. Sweep the dark color back and forth across your entire crease to darken it and make your eyes appear more deep set. You can choose to create a regular banana - with the shadow only on the crease - or a closed-crease banana with the shadow running down to meet your lash line. Keep the shadow in a relatively thin line across your lid.








, Clean your pencil brush well with an antibacterial brush cleaner or soap and water, and dry it with a clean cloth. Because you want your crease to stay pretty dark, use this brush to slightly blur the outer edges. Don’t blend the color too much, so your lid is completely highlighted.

",How to Apply Eyeshadow5," Use your firm, flat brush to brush your lightest color onto the inside corner of your eyes and directly under your eyebrows. This will highlight the areas of your face responsible for making your eyes look larger and brighter.








, Use your stiff flat brush to apply your middle color along your entire eyelid. Start from the base of your lash line and your work way to slightly above the crease. Try to avoid brushing it up to meet your highlighter, though.








, Use your domed brush first to apply your darkest color along your upper lash line. Sweep the color across your entire lid, but only on the bottom ⅓. Then, use your pencil brush to apply a darker, more precise line of color along your lash line.








, Use your pencil brush to add a bit of your darkest eye shadow color along your bottom lash line. Start at the outside corner and work your way to the inside corner, making it gradually lighter as you get closer to your inner tear duct.








, Use your dome brush after it has been cleaned well to blend your shadows together. You want to create a smooth graduation of color, so take a few minutes to softly fade your darkest shadow up into the middle hue. Avoid contacting the line of dark shadow near your lash line too much, as you don’t want to make that part look too faded from blending.

Pour a little bit of the adhesive into the bottle's cap, then dip your brush into it.,
Dip the brush into the powder.,
Apply the powder to your eyelid.,
Finish off with some eyeliner and mascara, if desired.",How to Apply Liquid Metal Eyeshadow2," These kits include a metallic loose powder and a clear, liquid adhesive. Some kits include a waterproof adhesive, which would work well if you need something long-lasting., This will smooth out your eyelid, and make applying the eyeshadow a lot easier.

, Choose a color close to your skin tone (or a shade lighter) and apply it to your brow bone and inner eye corners. Next, choose a matte shade that matches your liquid metal eyeshadow, and apply it to your eyelid. Finish off with a darker shade along the crease and outer corner of your eye. Be sure to blend everything well for a smooth look., You can also pour some of the adhesive into a small dish. You only need a few small drops; a little bit goes a long way.Avoid dipping your brush directly into the adhesive. This way, you won't risk transferring any eyeshadow into it. Most importantly, you will keep the adhesive clean and sanitary.


At the end of the method, clean the adhesive out of the cap before putting it back onto the bottle.
For best results, use a small brush, such as a concealer brush., Most kits' powder jars have a perforated insert. Give the jar a few small shakes to get some powder onto the lid, then dip the brush into that powder. Avoid dipping the brush into the entire jar, if you can.

, Use long, smooth strokes, going from the inner corner of your eye to the outer. If the finish is too sheer for you, apply more powder using a light, tapping motion.

, For a more dramatic look, add some false eyelashes.

Try a liquid metal pressed eyeshadow.,
Try liquid-based liquid metal eyeshadow.,
Try a cream-based liquid metal eyeshadow.",How to Apply Liquid Metal Eyeshadow3," Some brands, such as Catrice, make metallic eyeshadows that are labeled as ""liquid metal eyeshadow."" Despite the name, these eyeshadows can be applied just like any other eyeshadow. Here are some more tips on how you can increase the shimmer aspect:


Apply the eyeshadow using a clean finger. For some reason, metallic eyeshadows stick better to fingers than to brushes.
For a more metallic finish, apply the eyeshadow wet. Keep in mind that this largely depends on the brand.Apply the shadow dry first, blend it out, then apply it wet to areas that you want to stand out, such as the center of your eyelid., Some types of metallic eyeshadow come in actual liquid form. They are packaged much like lip gloss: in a plastic tube with a foam-tipped applicator. Simply use the flat part of the applicator to gently pat the eyeshadow all over your eyelid. Use the pointed tip to draw along your lash line at the end; this will give you a cleaner look.For a twist, use the pointed tip of the applicator to draw along your lash line, then sweep it upwards on the outer corner. This will give you an elegant, elongated look., Some brands, such as Illamasqua, make a metallic eyeshadow that they label ""liquid metal."" These types of eyeshadow can be applied like any other cream-based eyeshadow. Here are some pointers to keep in mind when applying cream-based ""liquid metal"" eyeshadow:Pat the eyeshadow onto your eyelid using the tip of your (clean) finger. Regular eyeshadow brushes don't work, because the eyeshadow is too thick. Foam-tipped brushes might work.
Pat on some translucent setting powder after you are one. This will set the look and prevent it from creasing and getting oily.
Avoid wearing cream-based eyeshadow if your eyelids tend to get oily. The cream base won't stick as well and be more likely to run.
Consider using an eyeshadow base or primer first if your eyeshadow tends to crease.

Gather your makeup and tools.,
Create a neutral base.,
Apply some light brown eyeshadow to your crease.,
Begin adding soft black eyeshadow.,
Darken the soft black areas with a true black eyeshadow.,
Add some highlights.,
Pat gold eyeshadow onto the center and lower corner.,
Use a bit of eyeliner.,
Add some black mascara.,
Apply lipstick.",How to Apply Gold Eyeshadow," Creating a gold eyeshadow look is easy if you have the right makeup and tools. To create a gold eyeshadow look, you will need:








eyeshadows in white or nude, light brown, soft black, black, and gold
black eyeliner
a liner brush
a blending brush
a Smith 220 brush or a similar wide flat brush
a Sigma 232 brush or similar small fluffy brush
a crease brush
black mascara
false eyelashes (optional);
, Apply some nude or white eyeshadow to your eyelids. Make sure that you apply the eyeshadow to your entire eyelid and all the way up to your brow line. Applying a base first will help to ensure that your color looks even and stays on longer.








You can also apply primer to your eyelids before you begin for even more eyeshadow staying power.Choose a color that is similar to your skin tone. For example, if you have fair skin, then a white or light nude will work well, but if you have bronze or olive skin, then choose an eyeshadow that it about the same color.

, Use your crease brush to apply a light brown eyeshadow color to the crease of your eyelids. Keep in mind that this color should be a few shades darker than your skin, so you may need to go with a darker brown if you have darker skin.








Blend the light brown eyeshadow into your creases and make sure that you apply enough eyeshadow to provide good coverage.

, Applying a base of soft black before you apply the regular black eyeshadow will help to ensure that you do not have any major mistakes to clean up. However, if you do not have a soft black color or do not want to apply two layers of black, then you can just apply regular black eyeshadow in place of the soft black.








Use your Smith 220 brush or a similar flat brush to apply black eyeshadow to the lower lash lines of your eyes.
After you finish with your lower lash lines, switch to your blending brush and apply soft black to the inner and outer corners of your eyes. Blend the edges well.

, Next, switch to a liner brush to darken the lower lash line with a true black eyeshadow. Then, use a blending brush to darken the areas on the inner and outer corners of your eyes with your true black eyeshadow.








Try to extend the eyeshadow out from the lower lash line a bit to create a slight winged effect. You can use a liner brush to do this.
Keep layering black eyeshadow on your lower lash line and the inner and outer corners of your eyes to deepen the color as much as possible.

, After you have finished deepening and blending the black eyeshadow, you can add some highlights to your brow bone. Take a blending brush and your white eyeshadow and apply it to your brow bone, just below your eyebrows. Focus on the outer edges of your eyebrows.








You can also apply some white eyeshadow to the inner corners of your eyes.
If white eyeshadow looks too dramatic against your skin, then try a champagne or nude color instead.

, Use a Sigma 232 brush or similar small fluffy eyeshadow brush and use it to pat gold eyeshadow in the centers of your eyelids and your lower inner tear duct area. Keep patting gold eyeshadow onto these areas until the color is even and provides good coverage.








If you have two different shades of gold, then you can layer them. For example, you can start with the lighter shade of gold eyeshadow and then apply the darker shade over it.

, To define your eyes a bit more, you can apply some black eyeliner. Apply a thin line of black eyeliner to your upper and lower waterlines and to your upper lash line.








To ensure that the eyeliner will stay on your waterline, dry off your waterline with a cotton swab before you apply the eyeliner.
Use waterproof eyeliner if you have it. Waterproof eyeliner is less likely to smear on your waterline than the non-waterproof kind., To complete your look, apply some mascara to your upper and lower lashes. Make sure that you use black mascara and not brown or some other color. Black will provide the most dramatic effect.








Curl your lashes with an eyelash curler before you apply the mascara. Curling your lashes will add volume and definition.For even more striking lashes, apply some fake lashes to your upper eyelids.

, Lipstick can intensify this look even more or it can ensure that your gold and black eyes will be the center of attention. Decide how you want to wear the look and choose a lipstick to help create the desired effect.








To make your eyes the center of attention, apply some nude lipstick. This will ensure that people will be looking at your eyes more than anything else.
To intensify the look, try wearing some bold black lipstick with a bit of gold eyeshadow pressed into the centers of your upper and lower lips.

",How to Apply Creme Eyeshadow," Crème eyeshadow can be difficult to apply. While you're getting the hang of it, stick to neutral or nude shades, so you can easily blend in mistakes. Avoid waterproof varieties until you've had some practice.;
, Look on the base of the container for the expiration date. Don't use the eyeshadow if it's dried out, or if it's separated from the sides of the container.

, Clean your face if necessary. If you normally apply moisturizer and/or foundation before eyeshadow, follow the same routine for Crème eyeshadow.


Oil-based moisturizer sometimes interferes with the eyeshadow.

, This will greatly reduce smudging. Once you're an experienced Crème user, you can skip this step, since the Crème will stick on its own. Let dry before you continue.


If you don't have eyelid primer, a layer of powdered eyeshadow will work instead. Use the same color as the Crème shadow, in an equal or lighter shade.

, Clean fingertips spread Crème eyeshadow better than most tools. If you use an eyeshadow brush, make sure the bristles are synthetic. Natural fiber brushes soak up the product's moisture, which can prevent a smooth application and even ruin your brushes over time.


A slightly dampened makeup sponge works okay, but it will absorb some of the makeup.

, Apply in a sweeping motion, as though you were spreading butter. Work quickly, or the eyeshadow will dry onto your finger or brush. Keep your eyes closed for a few seconds afterward, while the eyeshadow dries.


Apply additional layers for a more noticeable color. Let each one dry before you apply the next.

, This will warm up the eyeshadow and help it blend seamlessly into the rest of your skin. Blend until there are no harsh edges or jagged lines.

, If you have oily lids or are wearing this makeup for a long time, you my want to cover the Crème with powder eyeshadow of the same shade. This will make it last much longer, but you might lose the satiny appearance and some subtleties of color.

Finish the look with mascara.",How to Apply Rainbow Eyeshadow," You don’t have to wear anything other than eyeshadow, but it is helpful to plan your face makeup out if you do wear it. You could go with a subtle look of matte foundation, light blush, and nude lips. It’s also an option to take the look all the way and use colorful highlighter, contouring, and bright lips. Set out the makeup, but wait to do it until you’ve done your eyeshadow because it tends to fallout as you apply it.Rainbow highlighter is available in most beauty supply stores and online.
Choose a color of your rainbow eyeshadow, like red, for bright lipstick.;
, Use a primer that is specifically made to be underneath eyeshadow. Simply dab the primer on your lids where you will be applying the eyeshadow. If you don’t have a primer, put a little foundation and powder on the eyelids to achieve an even base. These additions will ensure the shadows don't fade too quickly.You can also add a white primer or white eyeshadow to make the rainbow eyeshadow pop even more when it is applied.

, Three brushes are ideal to use for this look. Get out a pencil type brush, a blending or crease brush, and a larger highlight color brush. Set out your eyeshadow after the brushes. Then, put out some cotton swabs, makeup remover, and foundation so you can correct any mistakes you may make.Make sure the brushes are clean because dirty brushes can harbor germs and will make your eyeshadow colors appear muddy
You can still achieve this look if you don’t have all of these brushes, but it may not be as easy.

, A bright pink eye or red shadow is a good option for the first color, but you can start with a different color. Just make sure the next color you apply can fade into the next. Dab the eyeshadow out towards the inner corner of the lid with a highlight brush.Tap your brushes off first before applying each of the next eyeshadows so you don't get fallout on your cheeks.

, Begin to add an orange eye shadow right next to the pink or red. The orange should be applied to the center of your eyelid. Again, use the highlighter brush to do this. Then, begin to blend the two shades together with a blending brush..


If you started with a different color, look at the colors of the rainbow and follow with a color that is close to the color you chose on the spectrum. For example, apply green next if you started with yellow.
Dab the eyeshadow application brush onto a paper towel between the two colors so the colors do not blend on the brush.

, Use the highlighter brush again to apply a yellow eye shadow. Put the yellow on top of where the orange has begun to fade. Fade the yellow slightly further along to the outer edges of your eyelid.If you chose a different color, apply a color that would follow that color on the spectrum. For example, apply blue now if green was your second color.

, For the green and blue part of the rainbow, apply the eyeshadow with a pencil brush. Apply the green eyeshadow just below your waterline and near your bottom eyelashes. Fade the color a little further along the lower eye. It should come to the middle of your bottom eyelashes.An indigo-like color would be the next color if blue was your last color.

, Apply a strip of blue eyeshadow slightly onto the green. Fade that almost to the inner corner of your lower eyelid. It should meet with the pink eyeshadow you started with in the corner of your eye.If indigo or violet was your last color, you could finish with a pop of red or pink.

, Look at the rainbow eye shadow in a mirror. Use your application brush to neatly blend the colors together. Don’t blend all of the colors together—just the colors the outer edges of the colors that are next to each other. To get the most seamless effect possible between colors, use a clean brush, or even a clean finger to lightly mix the colors together. This will create new colors to ease the transition.At this point you can use foundation or cotton swabs to correct any mistakes.
If you think a color does not look bright enough, simply go back and repeat a step until you're satisfied.

, This isn’t necessary, but it can enhance the look. Line the top eyelid, just above the waterline, with black eyeliner.

eyeshadows in white or nude, champagne, light brown, light turquoise blue, and dark turquoise blue
black eyeliner
a liner brush
a blending brush
a medium fluffy eyeshadow brush
black mascara
false eyelashes (optional);
, Applying a base layer of eyeshadow will help to ensure that your color looks even and stays on longer. Use a medium sized fluffy brush to apply an even layer of nude or white eyeshadow onto your eyelids. Start at your lash line and extend the eyeshadow all the way up to your eyebrows.








If you prefer, you can also apply primer before applying the base color. Applying primer to your eyelids before you begin will make your look last even longer and it can also prevent the colors from running., Use a liner brush with a bit of turquoise eyeshadow on it to line your lower lash lines. Start the line a few centimeters away from the inner edges of your eyes, around where your irises begin.








Sweep the brush across your lower lash line keeping the line as close to your lashes as possible.
Then, extend the line out slightly from the corners of your eyes.

, Next, switch to a blending brush and use it to apply some turquoise eyeshadow onto your creases. Make sure that you blend the color into your creases and extend it out past the corners of your eyes.







, After you have finished applying the turquoise eyeshadow, you will need to blend with some light brown eyeshadow. Use a blending brush with some light brown eyeshadow to blend the outer edges of the turquoise eyeshadow.








Blending the edges will help to prevent the turquoise from looking too stark against your skin. It will also add a little more complexity to the look.

, After you have finished blending, you will need to deepen the turquoise eyeshadow by applying a darker shade of turquoise over the light turquoise areas.








Make sure that you follow the lines on your lower lash lines and creases to guide you as you apply the darker turquoise color.

, To brighten up your eyelids and clean up any turquoise shadow that got onto these areas, you will need to apply another layer of white eyeshadow over your eyelids. Use a medium fluffy brush to apply the white eyeshadow to your eyelids and only your eyelids.








Be careful not to cover up the turquoise areas of your crease and outer corners.

, Adding a bit of black eyeliner will help to define your eyes and make this look a bit more dramatic. Apply a thin line of black eyeliner to your upper lash line and extend it out past the outer corners of your eyes. Continue to draw the line downwards and add a slight upturn to the line at the end.








You may want to use waterproof eyeliner to ensure that the eyeliner does not run.

, Next, use a champagne colored eyeshadow to highlight the inner corners of your eyes. You can apply this eyeshadow with a small highlighter brush. Use short, quick strokes to highlight this area.








After you finish with your inner corners, you can apply a little more white eyeshadow to your brow bones.

, To complete your look, apply some mascara to your upper and lower lashes. Use black mascara for the most dramatic effects. Brown may not look as striking.If you have some blue or turquoise mascara, you can experiment with those colors on your upper and/or lower lashes to see how they look.
Curl your eyelashes before you apply mascara. Curling your lashes with an eyelash curler adds volume and definition.For even more dramatic lashes, you can apply some false eyelashes.

, You can use lipstick to enhance your look even more. Just make sure that you choose a lipstick color that will not clash with the blue.









For example, red or orange lipstick might clash with the turquoise blue eyeshadow. However, a pale pink, peachy pink, or nude color will go well with the turquoise blue and white eyeshadows."

Develop a regular cleaning process.,

Repeat the process if there is still product on the brushes.,
Use a good quality extra virgin oil in addition to gentle dish soap.,
Swirl your brush into the oil.,
Add dish soap after you are done with the olive oil treatment (or shampoo).,
Consider investing in a brush cleaner.,
Dry the brushes in the air.,
Avoid anything that will harm your makeup brushes.",How to Clean Makeup Brushes Using Olive Oil and Soap," It’s a good idea to regularly wash your brushes. Some people even suggest you do so every day if you are a heavy makeup user. Once a week can work too.Old makeup, sebum, and general debris in the air create a breeding ground for bacteria inside the nest of bristles of makeup brushes. Not only is this unsanitary and generally unsettling to most people, but it can potentially cause acne and irritation if used on your face again.
Regardless of when you wear makeup, it is advisable that you regularly clean any brushes used to apply creams and liquids or that are used around the lips and rim of the eyes. This also preserves the longevity of your brushes.;
, It will be easier to clean the brushes if you shake or wipe off any obvious makeup clumps from the brushes first.


Take off whatever product you can by hand (maybe flick the bristles or wipe them on something, like a paper towel) before rinsing the brushes thoroughly with warm water. This should remove the bulk of the product from the brushes.
Clean your makeup brush as soon as you get the chance. It will be harder to clean the brushes if you let them dry with the product still on them. Cleaning your brushes is good for your skin.

, A small pea-sized amount in the palm of your hand should do. You could also use baby shampoo.Put the brush into it, and run it back and forth in your palm, allowing the brush to mix with the soap and get into the bristles. Do this until you get it foamy and can see product color in the suds. Rinse with clean water.

, Sometimes, you may need to wash a brush more than one time to get it clean.


Put more soap on the brushes, and wash them again. You could also put a squirt of soap in with some warm water, and leave your brush ends in it.
Do not leave them in the water for more than an hour because it sometimes messes with the shape. If you have wood handled brushes, leaving them in water too long could cause them to split.

, If you really want to clean makeup brushes thoroughly, adding olive oil into the soap can really finish the job. The oil will break down any of the makeup that has built up over time.To clean makeup brushes, you will need a medium to large dinner plate (not paper). Start by adding the dish soap and olive oil to the plate in a 3:1 ratio - roughly 3 teaspoons (15 ml) of soap to 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of oil.
Instead, you could pour a small amount of olive oil into a bowl (a little more than enough to cover the bottom of the bowl). This should be enough oil for two or three brushes depending on their size., Gently swirl your brush around on the plate until the bristles are coated with the mixture. You may find it easier to dampen the bristles slightly with lukewarm water before doing this.


You must use extra virgin olive oil. It contains the most deeply moisturizing properties of suitable oils. Other highly moisturizing oils are too thick and will leave residue on the bristles. Or, dip your makeup brush into the bowl.
Continue to swirl the brush, or sweep side-to-side if it is a flat brush, on the back of your hand until the bulk of the cosmetic residue is gone. Rinse the brush and your hand in lukewarm (not hot) water, and repeat until the bristles are clean, and the suds are pure white.

, Using dish soap is important because it will remove the oils. An alternative method is to mix two parts antibacterial dish soap to one part of the extra-virgin olive oil on a clean plate, and use them at once (again, don't use paper plate, as the oil will seep through).


Squirt a little bit of the dish soap or shampoo into the palm of your hand, and swirl your makeup brush on your palm creating a little bit of lather (shampoo is best for natural bristle makeup brushes). Dish soap is great because it is specially formulated to break down oils, and it is antibacterial (this is great for people with sensitive skin and stubborn acne).
This will leave your brushes feeling squeaky clean. Turn on the tap, and continue scrubbing the brush on your palm under warm running water until you can no longer see any product coming out of your brush. This is a technique commonly used to clean paint brushes, but it works just as well with most makeup brushes.

, Department stores sell cleaners that are specifically made for makeup brushes.


It might be worth investing in one if you wear makeup on a daily basis. Heavy makeup users need to clean their brushes more often.
Makeup brush cleaner is more hygienic and safer for your brushes (and skin) especially if you have expensive brushes.

, Once you've turned off the tap, squeeze as much water out of your brush as you can (while still being gentle to your brush just like before). Spike up the bristles, so they are all going in the correct direction.


Leave the brushes in a glass or container, and let them stand upright with the bristles in the air (make sure no soap is still on them before you do so), and then leave them overnight or for however long it takes them to dry.
Don't put them into cases or let them dry while they are pressed against something as it will bend the shape of the bristles, so air drying is the best.By standing them upright, the water drains down and away, and they can form to their natural shape.
Once dry, just flick the bristles a little to soften them up. You could roll a dish towel like you would a yoga mat, and drape a paper towel over it so that most of the paper towel hangs off (the paper towel should look like a slide coming down from the dish towel). Next, arrange the brush so the top of the handle sits on top of the towel, pitching the rest of the brush down onto the paper towel. This will allow your brushes to dry on a slant.
You could also dry your brushes by either lying them flat on a clean towel or microfiber cloth to dry or, optionally, hanging them straight down from a clothes hanger with clothespins gripping the ends of the handles., You want to take steps that will reduce harm to the brushes while you clean them.


Never rinse your brushes in hot water; it will loosen the glue holding the bristles in place and cause them to shed.
Never lay brushes to dry with the bristles higher than the handle. Water will run back into the barrel (the metal casing connecting the bristles to the handle) and loosen the glue holding the bristles.
For double-ended brushes, lay perfectly flat to dry. For specialty applicators, use specialized cleaners suggested by the manufacturer to preserve the quality of the material.

Lay the brushes flat to dry.",How to Wash Makeup Brushes1," You can place the sponge in a large bowl to make for easier cleanup. You shouldn't need more than a dime-sized amount of shampoo, since a little goes a long way.


Make sure the sponge you use is either brand new or squeaky clean. Don't use a sponge that's already been used to wash your dishes; you'll just transfer the bacteria to your brushes.
You can use a mild body wash or face cleanser in place of baby shampoo. There are also special soaps you can buy for the purpose of cleaning brushes.;
, This will work up a slight lather and help the soap saturate your brushes. Don't press too hard, since you don't want to damage the bristles; just lightly rub the brushes over the sponge in a circular motion.


Try not to get soap into the barrel of the brush, where the bristles are attached to the handle. Getting soap and water in there can cause the glue to loosen and the bristles to fall off.
If you're cleaning a lot of brushes, you might want to start with just two or three, then rinse the sponge and change out the soap.

, Hold them under the faucet to rinse off the soap. Rotate the brushes to make sure all the soap gets rinsed off.

Swirl the two together with a spoon until they’re fully mixed.The antibacterial soap will kill any germs or bacteria on the brushes, while the olive oil will help break down stubborn makeup so the brushes rinse clean.
Don’t use a paper plate for mixing the cleaner. The oil will seep through paper.;
, Take the brushes that you plan to clean and run them under lukewarm water. Run your fingers over the bristles to ensure that they’re all completely wet.Be careful to hold the brushes with the bristles facing down when you wet them. If water gets inside the brushes’ ferrell, the part of the brushes just below the bristles that holds them to the handle, it may loosen the glue so bristles start falling out.

, Coat all of the brushes’ bristles with the soap mixture. Next, run the brushes back and forth over the palm of your hand to work the cleaner in. Keep moving the brushes over your hand until the suds are no longer colored with makeup.For extremely dirty makeup brushes, you may need to wipe off the suds and dip the brushes in the cleaner a second time.

, Once the soapy residue is no longer colored, run the brushes under lukewarm water until no suds come out of the bristles.

That will keep any moisture from seeping into the ferrule.

Lay the brushes flat to dry.",How to Wash Makeup Brushes2," Choose a bar of plain soap without added lotions and other substances that could linger on the brush bristles. Get the bar wet with warm water and set it inside a bowl, so it won't slip away.

, Use a gentle circular motion to work up a lather so that the soap is distributed throughout the brush bristles. Keep going until you've worked up a good lather.Don't press down too hard as you swirl, since this can damage the bristles. Let the soap do the work of cleaning the brushes.

, Turn on the tap and let the water rinse your brushes. Rotate the brushes to make sure all the soap gets removed. Be careful not to get water into the brush barrels.

Make sure that there is enough room at the top of the bottle to mix in the water and oil.For the best results, use 70% isopropyl alcohol in the brush cleaner spray. The alcohol doesn’t just serve as a disinfectant for the brushes; it also helps the cleaner dry more quickly so you can spot clean your brushes and use them right away.
Your spray bottle should hold at least 8 ounces (237 ml).

, With the alcohol in the spray bottle, pour in 2 ounces (59 ml) of distilled water and 10 to 15 drops of your favorite essential oil.

Finish it off with a lip brush for applying color to your lips.",How to Choose Makeup Brushes," Organic or natural fibers are both softer and more effective. They are actual hair. They have cuticles which are better at attaching to and holding the pigment on the brush until you apply it to your face. Find cruelty free items if that's important to you.The softest and most expensive bristles are made from blue squirrel hair.
More affordable and perfectly acceptable options include: goat, pony and sable.
Synthetic brushes are good for applying liquid makeup like base and concealer, because they are easier to clean.
You can find a favorite brand and purchase all of your brushes from the same maker, or mix and match to create a whole set which meets your needs and your budget.;
, Dome shaped bristles roll more evenly over your face. Flat brushes create more drag when applying makeup. The curved shape makes it easier to control the application of the makeup., Natural fiber makeup brushes can get expensive. The retail price, though, reflects the quality of the product. You can spend that extra money for a brush which could last a lifetime, as long as you take good care of it.Clean your natural hair makeup brushes once a month by swishing them in a cup of warm water with a little shampoo. Rinse the brushes and lie them flat on a towel on the counter until they dry.

, There are a lot of brushes made for specific purposes when it comes to makeup brushes. If you are on a budget and just want to cover the basics, you can start with a foundation brush, concealer brush, blush brush, eye shadow brush, and slanted eye shadow brush.Applying foundation with a brush is recommended for keeping the oil from your hands from clogging your pores, which can cause skin irritation and break outs.
Blending concealer with your fingers can actually wipe the concealer away. Using a concealer brush will allow better coverage.

, The foundation brush should have a lot of bristles packed into the tip, making it sturdier and stiffer for wet makeup application. This is a brush you can choose to purchase with synthetic fibers, as it will be easier to clean liquid makeup from the brush., This brush can also be synthetic fiber for applying liquid concealer under your eyes or dabbing concealer in small spots to cover blemishes. This brush should also have tightly packed bristles, as well as a pointed tip to allow you to target small blemishes., A duo fiber brush is useful for multiple purposes. These combine goat and synthetic fibers in a brush with a flat, circular tip to buff or blend.This can be used with liquid blush to blend color into your cheeks.
The duo fiber brush can also work a shimmer powder onto your brows or cheeks.

, This brush should be able to work with bronzer and compact powder. The bristles are less packed and able to gather a good deal of powder and hold not out until you apply it to your skin. Look for a large, soft, rounded tip.A mineral powder brush is a variation on the powder brush. It is similar, but has more tightly packed bristles to buff the mineral powder into your skin.
Another variation is the fan powder brush. It is useful to create a light dusting. The tip of this brush splays out into a flat fan for applying very light coverage. It can also be used to dust off any excess powder from your face.

, The tip should be rounded to allow easy movement across your skin with no drag. The blush brush should have very fine and soft bristles to apply powdered blush to your cheeks., This brush has a rounded tip and also a slight slant to match the angles in your cheekbones. You can use this to add shadow under your cheek bones for a more dramatic look, as well as applying highlights above your cheekbones to help them stand out., Often, a lot of time is spent on the eyes when applying makeup, so there are also several brushes with different uses to help you complete the job. Your main eye shadow brush should have a tip a little smaller than the size of your eyelid. You want lots of soft bristles and a rounded tip. It should move smoothly over your eyelid, applying color without dragging your lid.Shade your eye socket with an angled eye shadow brush. This brush is slightly smaller than your eye shadow brush and has an angled, pointed tip to help you reach into the depth of your sockets to shade your eyelids.
The blending eye shadow brush has slightly looser bristles and a rounded tip useful for blending eye shadow colors or brushing a highlight onto your brow.

, The fine tipped eyeliner brush can help you apply liquid eyeliner in a very precise, fine line and can even apply tiny dots between lashes. If you would like a little more coverage, or a smoky-eyed look, opt for a flat liner brush, which has a flat angled tip., The spiral eyebrow brush has a tip which resembles a mascara applicator. This is used to comb your eyebrows into place when some of them have gone or grown in different directions. You can also use this brush to pull the eyebrow hairs straight up, then trim the ends to control the shape of your eyebrows.Follow up with a slanted eyebrow brush for filling in your brows with powder or cream. This brush should be more rigid and have an angled tip to be able to draw fine lines.

, This brush has a fine tip for precision in adding lip color. The bristles on this brush are very shot and firm.

Apply makeup as usual.",How to Prepare Your Face Before Applying Makeup," It is best to apply makeup to fresh, clean skin. Before applying makeup, wash your skin with a gentle cleanser that will support your skin type.If you have dry skin, look for a cream cleanser, which will help moisturize the skin while cleansing.
Use a gel or foam cleanser if you have oily skin. This will get rid of any dirt and oil on your skin without irritating the skin.
If you have combination skin, it means that some parts of the skin are oily and other parts are normal or dry. In this case, look for cleansers that are designed specifically for combination skin as these cleansers work to treat both oily and dry skin.
If you have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, look for the most gentle cleansers you can find. These will usually be made from plant oils.
If you have skin that is prone to breakouts, look for a cleanser that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil to help keep those pimples at bay.;
, Wet your face with lukewarm water by splashing some water onto your face using your hands. Then, using a dime-sized amount, massage your chosen cleanser gently all over your skin. Do this for around 45 seconds to give the cleanser time to work, and then rinse thoroughly using lukewarm water.Be gentle when cleansing. The skin on your face is thin and sensitive, so there is no need to scrub vigorously. Just use your finger tips to massage gently in a circular motion.
Be sure to rinse thoroughly. There should not be any suds of cleanser left on the skin.
Pat your face dry with a clean towel. You don’t want to rub the skin dry as this may irritate the skin, leaving it red and flaky.
Using warm water will help open the pores and lift dirt and bacteria from the skin, but avoid water that is too hot as it can dry out the skin.

, Many people overlook toner, but it should be an important step of your beauty routine. The purpose of toner is to swipe away any leftover dead skin cells, makeup, or other bacteria that your cleanser might have missed.Try to avoid toners with alcohol as the main ingredient, as these are typically too drying for skin.
Squeeze a bit of toner onto a cotton ball or cotton pad and gently swipe it all over your face. The idea here isn’t to scrub the skin, but instead, to gently wet the face with the toner.
Notice what comes off of your skin. Often times, you will notice some leftover foundation on the cotton ball after applying toner. This is evidence that you didn’t get all of your makeup with the cleanser.

, Once or twice each week, you should exfoliate your skin to get rid of any build up on your skin. If your skin is red and feels raw, you know you’re exfoliating too often. On the other hand, if your skin looks dull and doesn’t feel smooth, you probably need to exfoliate a bit more often.You can exfoliate by using a washcloth during your normal cleansing. Use the cloth instead of your fingertips to gently massage the cleanser into the skin using circular motions. Be sure to wash the cloth after use, though. If you reuse it, you may be rubbing old bacteria all over your face.
You can also use scrubs that you buy at the store. These are cleansers that include an ingredient that exfoliates. You can also make your own scrub with ingredients such as sugar and olive oil.

, You should absolutely be washing your face each night before you go to bed with the gentle cleanser in order to remove impurities that have built up on your skin throughout the day. You should then wash your face again in the morning (which is probably right before you will apply your makeup anyways).


If you wake up late one day, and don’t have time to wash your face, at least splash some cool water on your face to wake up your skin. It will also help you be more alert, and give your skin a refreshed look.

, Ideally, you will have two moisturizers, one for day that is lighter and includes an SPF, and one for night that is a bit heavier. Before applying makeup, you will want to use the lighter moisturizer. Make sure that your day time moisturizer contains at least SPF 15 to protect your skin from the sun.If you struggle with breakouts and/or oily skin look for oil-free moisturizers that are non-comodogenic.
If you have dry skin you can look for creams that are a bit thicker to wear during the day. A thicker cream will also give you a more dewy look.

, If you are prone to dry skin, adding a serum to your routine can help add a little extra moisture to your face. With most facial products, it’s important to remember that a little bit goes a long way, and this is especially true in the case of serums.Look for serums that contain antioxidants, such as Vitamin C; anti-inflammatories, such as Zinc; and hydrators such as amino acids.
Apply this after cleansing and toning, but before applying moisturizer.
If you want to incorporate a serum into your routine, but have oilier skin, try applying the serum at night.
Gently dab a few dots of serum on your cheeks, forehead, and chin and gently pat into the skin.

, Most people think that you should massage the moisturizer into your skin, but for your face this isn’t true. The best way to apply moisturizer is to gently press the moisturizer into your skin using your finger tips. This will ensure that you don’t apply too much moisturizer, which can lead to breakouts and/or oily skin.Pressing the skin will also draw the blood to the top of the skin, giving your skin a rosy glow.

, Before you move on in your face prep routine, you will want to give the moisturizer a chance to sink into the skin. Give it at least 5 minutes, this way your skin will be ready for primer.During this time, you can do something else, like choose your outfit for the day. If it’s morning, you can make yourself a cup of tea or coffee to drink while you apply your makeup.

, This isn’t required, but many makeup artists believe that a splash of rose water is key for getting that glowing skin we all want. If you want to do this, put some rose water in a spray bottle, turn it to mist mode, and mist it all over your face. Let the rose water dry before moving on.Some also suggest misting rose water on your face once you have completely finished your makeup, and it has all had plenty of time to dry.Be sure to close your eyes as you are misting.
Look for all-natural rose water that doesn’t contain added chemicals.

, Before applying any color, you will need to prepare your lips in order to help the color go on smoothly and evenly, and to help it last longer.Exfoliate your lips using a clean, damp washcloth. Using small circular motions, gently massage your lips to remove any dead skin, which will make your lipstick look uneven. If your skin is sensitive, you should do this at night, before going to bed rather than right before applying makeup.
Apply a lip moisturizer. Before applying any color, you will want to make sure your lips are moisturized properly in order to help keep the color from soaking into your lips. Use your lip balm of choice, and smooth it on your lips. Allow it to set for at least 10 minutes in order for the moisturizer to have adequate time to soak into your lips.
If you are short on time, you can apply the lip balm before you apply any of your other makeup. By the time you've finished the rest of your makeup, your lips will be good to go.

, No matter how involved your makeup routine, applying a primer prepares your skin for anything you are going to put on it.There are many, many types of makeup primer available on the market, so choose one that will suit your needs.


For example, if you suffer from acne or redness on your face, a light green primer will work well to counteract the redness.Primers that contain silicone are also a great option as the silicone acts as a barrier. This not only helps makeup go on smoothly and last longer, it also helps keep the oil in your skin from mixing with your makeup.
Makeup primer also helps fill in any lines in your skin so that makeup doesn’t crease in them.

, You can apply primer all over your face or on trouble spots that you have. If you only want to apply it to a few spots, use a concealer brush to gently dab it on the area. If you want to apply it to your whole face, squeeze a bit of primer onto your finger and dab it all over. Then use your finger tips to gently massage it into the skin.If you’re not in the mood to apply foundation, primer can also be worn on its own to give you a more polished look throughout the day.

, Now that you’ve taken care to prepare your skin properly, you can apply your makeup as you normally would. Remember that the better prepared your skin is for makeup, the better your makeup will look in the end, and the better it will last.


If you are consistent in your routine, your skin will look great even without makeup, which means you won’t need to use much makeup in the first place.

, Dry skin can be dull and flaky, so it’s important to moisturize regularly. Moisturize in the morning and at night, and after you take a shower.Look for lotions marketed specifically for the face.


Hydration is key for your entire body, so make sure you are drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Men should aim for about three liters, and women should aim for a little over two., Before you start applying any makeup, it’s crucial to prime your face. A makeup primer is a base for your makeup, helping it last longer. It holds everything into place, preventing creasing and smudging. Face primers will also smooth out the skin to create a flawless base for your glowing look. It’s frustrating to put on makeup perfectly in the morning only for it to be worn off by lunch, so combat this problem by using a great face primer.







, Depending on whom you ask, “BB” means anything from “blemish balm” to “beauty balm” to “beauty benefit,” but all BB creams work toward the same goal. These creams are skin perfectors that will even out your skin tone and minimize your pores. Look for a BB cream that is light reflecting for extra glow power.BB creams are light coverage, so this will not look thick or cakey underneath your favorite foundation.
While many BB creams do contain primers and moisturizers, using them in conjunction with other products will ensure all of your bases are covered.

, In order to accentuate the glow you’re going to create on your cheeks, it’s important to have smooth, even-toned skin. While the BB cream will work as a color corrector, foundation will provide more coverage. Use a Beauty Blender or foundation brush to apply your favorite foundation over your entire face.







, If you have dark, tired looking circles or bags under your eyes, it will distract from the shimmery glow of your cheeks. Apply a concealer underneath your eyes using a concealer brush, sponge, or your fingertips. Pat gently to blend the product in thoroughly. Once you’ve covered the area, set your entire face with a pressed powder.







, By applying a dark contour to the hollows of your cheeks, you’ll add dimension to your face that will make your highlighted glow appear more natural. Use a blending brush to apply the bronzer in the hollows and up to your temple, building up the color gradually. When you are finished, your cheeks should look more defined and prominent.If you have trouble determining where the bronzer should go, try this trick. Pucker your lips into a ""fish face"" and touch your hands to your cheeks. You will feel indentations where your cheeks are sucked in, underneath your cheekbones. That is where your bronzer should go!

, Glowing cheeks should be a bit rosy, so apply a soft, natural color to your cheeks.If you’re not sure where to apply it, smile into your mirror. Apply blush to the raised parts of your cheeks. Use a light hand while applying the blush, adding color without over-doing it.









You can learn more about blush application here.

, Now that you’ve perfected your skin and added gorgeous color to your cheeks, it’s time to add the final, and most important, touch. You can purchase a light, shimmery highlighter at your local drugstore or beauty supply store. Use your fingertip to apply the highlight along the natural curve of your cheekbones, gently patting it into your skin. This should go on the highest point of your cheekbones, where the light hits as you smile.








This highlight, along with the bronzer and blush, will make your cheeks appear prominent, rosy, and positively glowing.

, If your diet is filled with junk food, your skin can suffer. An easy rule of thumb is to make sure that your plate is colorful at every meal. In other words, try to get some leafy greens, some fruits and vegetables, and so on. Greens help to brighten the skin, and fruits and vegetables are packed with micronutrients that keep your skin (and the rest of your body) functioning properly. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like fatty fish, are also fantastic for making the skin look hydrated and vibrant.Replace your sodas, coffees, and sugary juices with tall glasses of water at meal times. Dehydration will show in your skin!

, And when you exercise, get your heart pumping with some cardio. Sweating helps create a natural glow by ridding the skin of impurities and clearing out your pores. Not only will the endorphins from a great workout boost your mood, but the skin benefits will too.While working up a sweat can be beneficial to your skin, don't let that sweat stay on your face for a long time. Once you're finished at the gym, make sure to wash your face. The junk from your pores comes to the surface of your skin through sweat, and then it's your job to get rid of it for good with a thorough cleansing.

, This might be the easiest beauty tip around. When you are asleep, your body goes into recovery mode. The amount of blood flowing to your skin actually increases, and that results in healthy, bright skin. If you've ever pulled an all-nighter studying or stayed up late with friends, you know how puffy and dull your skin can look the following day. Do your face a favor, and try to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night., Confident, happy people seem to have a natural glow about them. Take a note from them, and give yourself a pep talk whenever you're feeling down. Do something you love to do, spend time with uplifting people, remind yourself of all the reasons you are unique and wonderful, or put on your favorite mood-boosting song. It may sound strange, but there's nothing quite like that natural, organic glow that only comes from joy.

Contour your cheeks.,
Blend the contour line.,
Apply bronzer to your face.,
Add blush.,
Add highlights.,
Change your hairstyle (Optional).",How to Thin Your Cheeks1," Select a contour color and/or matte bronzer that is one or two shades deeper than your skin tone. For the highlighter, choose a color that is slightly lighter than your natural complexion.


Cream and powder are both acceptable choices for contouring your face.
Cream provides a glossier texture on your face, while powder provides a matte look.
A makeup blending brush is recommended for applying the makeup. Effective brushing ensures proper blending and avoids streaky makeup.;
, Apply the contour color in a diagonal line just underneath your cheek bone, from the center of your cheek toward your ear.


Elongate your face when applying the contour. This can be done by puckering your lips together (like making a fish or duck face). Your cheekbones become more visible and can guide where you place the contour.
Place the contour higher on your cheeks if you want to go for a sharper look.

, Blend the contour line diagonally from near your ear, along the cheek bone, down toward the corner of your mouth. Use the blending brush to avoid harsh streaks and mask the overall appearance of makeup.

, Place the bronzer below the initial contour line and lightly blend into your cheeks if desired. Brush evenly and gently to get a proper blend.


Bronzer may not be necessary if you already have a darker complexion or the contour makeup was sufficient in creating the illusion of shadows under the cheekbone.

, Apply a blush of your choice above the contour line to draw attention to your eyes and cheekbones. Blend in the same direction as you blended the contour line.

, Apply your highlighter under your eyes and down the bridge of your nose to brighten those areas. This will make the contoured and bronzed area of your face stand out more in contrast to the highlights – dark colors recede and light colors “pop.”If you chose to use cream contour and bronzer, you will need to set the makeup with a setting powder to keep the cream long-lasting and from smearing too easily.

, Alter your hairstyle to better accentuate your cheeks, or to give your face an overall thinner appearance. Pulling your hair back into a ponytail, parting your hair on the side instead of the middle and adding volume to the crown of your head all help your face appear thinner.

Talk to your health care provider.,
Change your diet.,
Exercise.",How to Thin Your Cheeks3," There is no way of targeting your weight loss so that you only lose weight in specific sections of your body, such as your cheeks. To actually slim those cheeks down, you must lose overall bodily weight. Talk to your health care provider prior to dieting or exercising and let them know of what you are trying to accomplish. If you have chronic conditions, are overweight or even if you are weight appropriate, you may need to take on a tailored exercise regiment under advisement from your provider to avoid injury or health issues.Let your health care provider know of the diet or exercise methods you are interested in to see if they're a good fit for you.

, Eating healthier is one of the most effective ways of cutting down on weight. Note that your face is often one of the last areas to slim out when losing weight.



Count calories. Keep track of how many calories you've consumed versus your targeted goal. Apps are available to help you determine how many calories are featured in common foods.
Keep a lot of tempting foods, such as those high in sugars or carbs, out of the house. You're less likely to eat unhealthy foods if they are not easily accessible.
Eat plenty of vegetables. Vegetables help you feel full throughout the day, in addition to housing plenty of important vitamins and nutrients.Drink plenty of water. Like eating vegetables, water helps you feel full and keeps your hunger in check.
Keep a food journal. Writing down what you eat can help you keep your healthy eating habits on track and help you understand your eating habits as a whole.Food journals also help identify which foods are particularly high in calories.
Avoid fad diets and supplements. Fad diets are ineffective and lack scientific evidence to back up their claims. At worst, they can cause you to alter your diet in a negative fashion by cutting out essential food groups., Burning 500 more calories than you eat every day will prevent weight gain and slowly burn the pounds. If you want to lose weight faster, you will have to make space in your schedule for more regular exercise.


Aim for cardio and strength training. Cardio, such as jogging, biking or swimming, burns the most calories. Supplement with strength training, such as weights to keep your body healthy."

When you apply the concealer in a triangle beneath your eye, make sure to blend it out across your cheekbone where you’ll apply the highlighter.
If you have imperfections that you want to cover, you’ll need a second concealer that matches your skin tone exactly.

, Because the pumpkin spice highlight is a powder, it’s important to set your foundation and concealer before you apply it or it may go on unevenly. Choose a translucent powder that won’t add any color or coverage to your face, and apply it with a large, fluffy powder brush all over.








You can use either a pressed or loose translucent powder. A pressed formula is easier to carry around for touch-ups, but a loose powder usually has a lighter texture so it’s less likely to look cakey.

, Once your foundation and concealer are set with powder, you can apply the pumpkin spice highlighter. The cheekbones are the most common spot for highlighting, so use a fan brush to lightly dust the powder over the tops of your cheekbones.








When you’re applying the highlighter to your cheekbones, sweep it up onto the temples, creating a “C” shape to illuminate that area as well.
Using a fan brush helps diffuse the color so you achieve a more natural glow with the highlighter. If you want a more concentrated highlight, you can use a smaller, denser brush, such as a fluffy eyeshadow blending brush.
Because the pumpkin spice highlighter is a loose powder, it’s important to tap the brush on the side of the container before applying it to knock off any excess. That way, you won’t wind up with pumpkin spice highlighter all over your face.  

, The bridge of the nose is another high point of the face that is usually highlighted. Use the fan brush to lightly sweep the pumpkin spice down the center of your nose, taking care not to apply it all over the nose.








Be careful not to apply the highlighter all the way down to the tip of your nose. That area tends to get oily so you don’t want to make it look any shinier.
Highlighting your nose is going to draw attention to it, so if it’s not one of your favorite features, you can skip it.

, The final area of the face where you should apply the highlight is just above the center of your upper lip. This area is commonly known as the Cupid’s bow, and by adding highlight there, you’ll make your lips appear fuller. Use a small brush to dab the pumpkin spice powder to the groove above your lip.








You can use a fan brush to apply the highlighter above your lip, but if you find that it’s not precise enough, try using a small pencil brush with just a small amount of the pumpkin spice highlighter on it. Make sure to blend well, though, so the highlighter doesn’t look like a mustache.

, Before using the pumpkin spice highlighter to accent your eyes, you should do the rest of your eye makeup. Use a light, shimmery shade on your lid, and a matte deeper tone in the crease to contour. Next, apply your favorite type of eyeliner in a corresponding shade and use your favorite mascara to thicken and lengthen your lashes.While you can use whatever eyeshadow shades you like, keep in mind that the pumpkin spice highlighter is a golden peachy color, so it works best with other warm-toned makeup shades. For example, you might use a peach, gold, or copper shade on the lids and a matte reddish brown in the crease.
You don’t necessarily have to apply eyeshadow and/or liner if you don’t want to. You can just use mascara and the pumpkin spice highlighter on and around your eyes for a subtle look.

, Because the highlighter will draw attention to your eyes, it’s important to make sure that your brows frame them nicely. Use a powder, pencil, or wax brow product to fill in any gaps in your brows, and a brow comb to make sure that they look neat.It’s a good idea to apply a clear brow gel over the colored product that you use to fill them in. That will keep your brows in place all day.  

, Start highlighting your eye by applying the pumpkin spice powder below your eyebrow. Use a fluffy shadow brush to sweep the highlighter across your brow bone to help diffuse the color for a natural look.








Make sure to blend the highlighter and your crease shade together if you’re wearing eyeshadow to get rid of any harsh lines between the two colors. Use a clean blending brush so the colors don’t become muddy.

, You can brighten up your eyes and make them appear larger by applying the pumpkin spice highlighter to the inner corners of your eyes. Use a pencil brush or other small detail brush to press a little of the powder around the tear duct at the inner corner of the eye.Make sure to tap off any excess highlighter powder from your brush before applying it to your inner corner so you don’t get any of the product in your eye.

, You can give your eyes an instant lift by applying a little of the pumpkin spice highlighter above your eyebrows. Use a fan brush to lightly sweep some of the powder directly over each brow.








Make sure to apply the highlighter over your brows with a light hand to keep the effect subtle.

, Because the pumpkin spice highlighter has such a lovely golden peach color, it can double as an eyeshadow. Use a flat shader brush to press the highlighter across your eyelids for a pretty brightening effect.If the highlighter isn’t as opaque on your lid as you’d like, considering using it wet. Lightly mist your shadow brush with water or a makeup setting spray and then press it into the highlighter powder. It will intensify the color so it has a foiled look on the lid.

, If the pumpkin spice highlighter is too dark for your skintone or you want to get more use out of your makeup, use the powder as a blush topper. Apply a matte blush in a peach, orange, or coral shade to your cheeks, and dust the highlighter over the apples of your cheeks with a fluffy brush for a pretty glow.You may want to use a duo-fiber brush to apply the pumpkin spice highlighter as a blush topper. It helps diffuse the product so your cheeks don’t look too shiny or metallic.

, If you want your lips to appear fuller, you can use your pumpkin spice highlighter with your favorite lip products. Apply a peachy nude, peach, orange, coral, or other warm-toned lipstick or gloss, and then pat a small amount of the highlighter to the center of your bottom lip to make it look fuller."

Pick the right colors.,
Add the darker color across your forehead.,
Apply the darker color under your cheekbones.,
Highlight your cheekbones.,
Add blush.,
Blend your makeup well.,
Set your makeup with powder.",How to Define Your Cheekbones1," You will need at least two different shades of makeup: one that is significantly darker than your natural skin tone for the shadows and one that is just a little lighter than your skin for the highlights. Depending on your skin tone and preference, these can be any combination of foundations, bronzers, highlighters, and blushes.


Use creams rather than powders for better blending.If you're putting on a full face of makeup, contour after the foundation and concealer.
Keep in mind that products labeled as ""highlighters"" often contain light-reflecting compounds. Even if you find a highlighter that looks dark enough, it will likely be ineffective for shading.
For darker skin tones, pick bronze or coppery gold tones for the lighter color. Avoid highlighters not specifically made with darker skin in mind, which may make your skin look too shiny.Pick a second bronze shade that is just a little darker than your natural skin tone. You may also want to consider a translucent contouring gel, which is a product that creates shadow while allowing your skin's texture to show through.A very wide range of colors work well for medium or tan skin. You can usually use a bronzer of your choice for your shadows. However, be sure to find a lighter color that matches your skin tone well, albeit just slightly brighter.
If you have fair or pale skin, go with taupe for the shadows and a light foundation or illuminator for the highlights.;
, Make a line that's roughly parallel with your hairline on your forehead. When you reach your temples, bring the line forward. Stop just above your cheekbones., Make a ""fish face"" in the mirror and add shadow to where your natural hollow forms. This will create a much more realistic contour than shaping without a guide. Gradually add more pigment until you start to see definition.However, if you want extreme, dramatic cheekbones, draw a line with your darker tone from your ears to your mid-cheek. Try to make one continuous line that goes directly underneath your cheekbones., Apply your highlighter along the natural curve of your cheekbones.Remember that the highlighter is used to create the illusion that light is hitting the parts of the skin where it is applied. By adding it to your cheekbones, they appear more prominent.

, Dab just a pop of color to the apples of your cheeks. Using a cream blush will make blending easier and give you results that look more natural. Use light pink tones for fair skin and mauve tones for darker skin., Blending is the most important part of creating a look that seems natural. Use a makeup brush, a sponge, or even your fingertips. Buff your makeup with small circular motions, paying more attention to the outer edges. Blend until your makeup appears even and natural.


If you've used makeup powders, you may find blending difficult due to dryness. Spritz on a facial mist to make blending easier., This final step is important when using cream makeup. Use a thick brush to lightly dust on some translucent powder. Try to brush the powder evenly over your skin, but be especially sure to hit any areas where you've used creams. This will help keep your makeup, including your contours, from smudging as you go about your day.If you've only used powdered makeup to create your look, setting powder is unnecessary.

Find the right self-tanner.,
Apply the lighter tanner to your entire face.,
Apply the darker shade to your forehead first.,
Add shadow under your cheekbones.,
Blend using your fingers.,
Allow your tanner to develop.",How to Define Your Cheekbones2," Similar to makeup contouring, tontouring works best with two different shades of tanner.


Use a gradual tanning moisturizer. This will create a much more natural look compared to other types of self-tanner.
Contouring typically lasts for about a week.If you're using a self-tanner for the first time, be sure to spot test it on a normally unexposed patch of skin. That way, if your skin turns out to be sensitive to one or more ingredient, any reaction will be hidden from view rather than all over your face.

, Use your fingers to evenly massage the tanner all over your face. By starting with this base, you'll give your skin a gentle glow.If you've decided to use only one shade of tanner, skip this step., Use a stippling foundation brush to brush the tanner on slightly under your hairline.Focus on your temples and the top of your forehead. Stop just above your cheekbones., Use a sharply-angled contouring brush to apply tanner below your cheekbones. Under each cheekbone, draw on a line from your ear to your mid-cheek. Try doing this with a single stroke., Like conventional makeup, to blend your self-tanner you need to buff it in. Use your fingertips to make circular motions, focusing on the edges of your darker tanner. Buff until your makeup looks even and natural.Keep in mind that your tontouring will likely look much more harsh just after application compared to the rest of your week., Follow the instructions on your self-tanner's bottle. In general, this step takes a few hours.A good rule of thumb is to wait eight hours after applying tanner before swimming or bathing.

",How to Define Your Cheekbones3," If you don't want to bother sculpting a full face of makeup, consider just using blush. However, instead of applying it to the apples of your cheeks, dab it on directly under your cheekbones. Also, stick to blushes with warm tones and brown bases. Bright pinks don't work to create shadows and will instead make your face look flushed.


Applying bronzer without blush in the same fashion works equally well., Giving yourself a gentle glow will help to define your cheekbones and make your skin look healthier. Mix a little illuminating serum or skin brightener into your foundation. If you don't generally wear face makeup, these products can also be worn on their own., Hairstyles can dramatically enhance cheekbones. Which style will best define yours will depend on your overall face shape.


Shorter hair paired with longer bangs tends to define cheekbones for faces of all shapes.
If you have a heart-shaped face, style your hair with blunt bangs.Mid-length bobs and deep side parts also work well.
Off-center parts will make round faces look more angular. Uneven, side-swept bangs will also have the same effect. Pixie cuts and hair layering are also good choices.For oval faces, the best way to define cheekbones is through hair volume. You may choose to achieve this through curls, layering, or light teasing.

, Just keep in mind that surgical options are expensive and that surgery always carries some amount of risk. They are much more permanent than a tan or a haircut, and sometimes the results don't look natural. The three major procedures for higher cheekbones are:


A ""facelift"" to tighten up the skin in your face, potentially making your cheekbones more prominent. If you had more defined cheekbones when you were younger, this is a likely option.
Plumping of the cheeks using injections of ""filler"" materials.
Facial implants custom made to enhance your cheekbones., While some say face exercises can give you higher cheekbones, evidence of their effectiveness is slim.Additionally, dermatologists have pointed out that such repetitive motion can actually contribute to the appearance of wrinkles.Although facial exercises won't give you higher cheekbones or remove wrinkles, they are effective for certain other issues. Exercises are used to treat facial paralysisand can liven up sallow skin caused by poor circulation.,"

If you use a facial oil, simply dab some on a cotton ball as you would nail polish remover and swipe across your face. Facial oils break up the dirt particles instantly and clean out your pores. Once the oil is on, rinse.
If you use a facial cleanser, gently massage the cleanser onto your face and neck in small circular motions with your fingertips. Once applied, rinse with warm water.;
, If you have not done so within the past 24 hours, exfoliate your skin to remove dead skin particles and reveal the new, smooth skin beneath.


Avoid exfoliates with microbeads or large particles, as these will only cause micro-tears in your skin. Applying your facial cleanser to a warm washcloth and massaging the washcloth on your face is enough exfoliation.
A facial toner is a great addition to the exfoliation process. If you exfoliate at night, apply the toner before going to bed. If you exfoliate in the morning, apply the toner before applying your makeup., Facial serums help seal in the moisture that may have been lost during exfoliation, and prevent your face from drying out and getting dry skin patches. It is important that you do not skip this step, as the pores have just had a deep clean and need to be closed and sealed before applying makeup.


For oily skin, use a serum that contains glycolic acid or retinol to help smooth your skin's texture, accelerate cellular turnover, and prevent clogged pores. Vitamin C is a bonus ingredient, as it provides antioxidant protection while reducing redness and inflammation.
For combination skin, opt for a serum that targets your specific skin concerns. From reducing dark spots to scarring to smoothing out your skin, there are serums on the market that do it all.
If you have dry skin, look for a serum that contains hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, or opt for one with added vitamins., Moisturizer serves a number of purposes, from protecting your face from the sun to improving the texture, tone, and general appearance of your skin. Moisturizer also provides an even surface for makeup application.


Aim for a moisturizer with at least 30 SPF, as anything less will not adequately protect your skin from the sun's rays.Always moisturize after washing your face, as facial cleansers tend to dry out the skin.
Let the moisturizer absorb into your skin for a full 1-2 minutes before moving on to the next step.

, Too many people skip the primer, but this is a mistake. Primer helps smooth the surface of your skin, fill unwanted pores, evens your skin tone, and gives your makeup something to adhere to throughout the day. Use a primer that contains silicone, as this will act as a protective barrier between your skin and makeup.


Take a small amount of primer and start in the center of your face, then work your way outward. Aim for a light coverage—nothing too heavy.
Apply only with your fingertips or a sponge—never a brush.
Avoid applying primer to beneath or around your eyes.

, Using your fingertips or a foundation brush, apply your regular, everyday foundation all over your face. This is just the base, and should be the same color as your skin tone. Be sure to apply foundation from the top of your forehead to beneath your chin, and around your neck. This will ensure that there is not an unnatural looking line separating your head from your neck.


If you notice any blemishes such as under-eye circles, now is the time to cover them with concealer.
If you will be using a gel blush to finish off the look, do not apply your foundation until after you have applied your blush.

, Swirl your contour brush around in your bronzer approximately five times. Tap the brush on the back of your hand to remove any loose powder. Double-check the brush one last time to make sure it is not overloaded with product. The key to contouring is to go light.

, Make sure your mirror has plenty of light around it, and that it is tilted back so that when you suck in your cheekbones you can see the shadow beneath them very clearly. That is where your bronzer is going to go.

, Point your brush at the shadowy spot, suck in your cheekbones, and gently spread your bronzer in the shadowy area. Sweep up in a crescent shape, up towards the top of your ears. Be sure to not get any bronzer on your cheekbones.


If you have an oblong or square face, contour the corners of your face to make them appear less angular and to give your face a softer edge.
If you have a triangular face, contour along the jaw line to give your face a more proportionate look.
If you have a round face, contour at the temples, cheekbones, and the sides of the jaw line, giving your face more definition.
If you have an oval face, contour similar to the round face shape: at the temples, cheekbones, and sides of the jawline.

, Take a step away from the mirror and give your face a good long study. Is that naturally shadowy area now filled with bronzer? If so, success! If not, go over the area a few more times until the area is clearly defined.


If you have applied too much bronzer, do not worry; simply grab some tissue, scrunch it into a ball, and gently use circular motions to wipe off the excess bronzer.

, If you’re using a liquid highlighter, apply a small dab to the center of your hand. Pat your index or middle finger into it. Look straight into the mirror and apply the highlighter above the bronzer line. Blend the highlighter on top of your cheekbones.


If you need to, suck in your cheeks to get the bones to stick out.
If using a highlighting powder, grab a blush brush and pat some product onto it. Apply the same as if applying a liquid highlighter.
Blend onto the cheekbones, being sure to focus more on the top and outermost areas so that it gives your cheeks a soft glow.
To highlight an oblong or square face, add highlight to your forehead and chin to give your face more dimension.
For a heart shaped face, highlight under the eyes to bring your cheekbones forward. Highlight your forehead and chin to give your face more dimension.
For a triangular shaped face, highlight along the temples and under the eyes to give your face the illusion of cheekbones.
If you have a round face, use the highlighter on your chin and forehead to bring these areas forward and create the illusion of angles on your face.

, Choose a blush that matches or compliments your skin tone, and that pairs well with your eye and lip makeup. The wrong blush can make you look like a clown, or as if you are wearing stage makeup—neither of which is a good daytime or nighttime look.


If you are fair-skinned, opt for pinks and rosy hues.
If your complexion is more olive-toned, choose a peach or other tawny color.
If your skin is darker colored, use colors with a slightly orange undertone or hints of red., Each form of blush is created to highlight your cheeks a certain way, so choose a form that achieves the effect you’re going for. Cream blushes lend a dewy, sun-kissed look to the wearer and are good for daytime use. Powders are also good for everyday wear, while gels have a long-lasting effect, and can be used to transition from day to night.


If you are using gel blush, apply your foundation and other make only after you have applied the blush.

, To apply the blush, dab a large, soft blush brush into the powder. If you are using cream or gel, dab your fingers into the makeup. Smile! Your cheek’s apple should show up. Apply the blush to the top part of the apple in short, rounded, swooping motions.


Do not use long swooping motions, as doing so will give your face a sharp, severe look.
Brush outward toward the cheekbone.

, Once you have applied the blush to the apples of your cheeks, blend upwards along your cheekbones. For the most natural look, always concentrate the color on the apples of your cheeks and blend well. Before blending outwards, dust off the excess blush to avoid looking overly rosy.


Blend with your brush inwards towards your nose, then outwards, towards your ears. Make the motions half-moon like, and not angular, as this will make you look clownish.
Always use a clean brush for blending.
Once you’re done blending, brush downwards to smooth the natural peach fuzz along your cheeks.

, To set the look and ensure that your makeup doesn’t run or smear throughout the day, tap a small powder brush into your setting powder. Get a very light amount on the brush, so light that you can barely see it. Tap lightly along your cheeks, T-zone and chin.


You can also use setting spray, which you apply by misting onto your entire face. Setting spray is easier to apply than setting powder and offers a more natural, finished look.

But if it’s applied incorrectly, it could turn into a makeup disaster. It’s important to pick a blush that works with your skin tone and skin type.For dry skin, try a cream based blush.
For normal or oily skin, try a powder or gel blush.
Try to pick a blush color that is closest to your natural flush. Think about how your cheeks look when you’re naturally blushing and try to find a color that matches your natural blush.;
, A highlighter is a makeup product that will bring some light to your face. It comes in several formulas: powder, liquid, and cream. A highlighter should also look dewy and not too shiny or sparkly.


Before you buy a highlighter, try some on the back of your hand and blend it well. If the product gives your skin a light sheen, you’ve got the right look.Match the texture of your highlighter to your foundation. So if you wear liquid or cream foundation, go for a creamy highlighter.Look for a product that offers a number of different pearl shades, like Guerlian’s Meteorites ($57). This product combines six different colors for a perfect, balanced glow.If you are new to using a highlighter, try a highlighter stick, like NARS’ The Multiple ($39). A highlighter stick is easy to apply, and many of the shades are also pigmented with color. This will keep you from applying the product all over your face and only on the spots needed for contouring.Don’t use highlighter as a cover up, especially in areas with pigmentation or redness. The shimmering tones will only draw attention to the area, rather than conceal it.

, While a highlighter is made to light up your skin, bronzer is made to deepen and shade your skin.


Avoid products that look too muddy or too orange in the package. A good bronzer should make your face look like it has a natural glow.
Go for products like MAC Bronzer, Bobbi Brown Bronzer, or Benefit Hoola Bronzer.They all come in a variety of tones, so you can choose the one that best suits your skin tone.

, This is one of the most important tools for contouring your face correctly. Look for a brush that has angled bristles and a long handle. There are several brushes made especially for contouring, including:


The MAC Large Angled Contour Brush #168.An industry favorite and one of the best brushes available.
Sephora Pro Angled Contour Brush #75.The in-house brand of Sephora. Go to your local Sephora to see if they have this one in stock.
e.l.f. Angled Contour Brush.An affordable brush that works well for contouring. Especially good for beginners who don’t want to splurge on a higher end brush.

, A mirror that is tilted slightly forward will allow you to see exactly what you are doing.

, Swirl the brush in the bronzer powder a few times. Then, tap the brush on the back of your hand to let any excess powder fall off.

, Suck your cheeks in. Notice the two shadowed lines that appear on your cheeks? That is where you want to apply the bronzer.


Point your brush on the shadow on your cheek. Gently sweep the bronzer in a moon shape or crescent shape towards your ear.
Don’t apply bronzer any lower than your cheekbones. And don’t apply any bronzer on the sides of your mouth, this will make the bronzer look more like warpaint than a nice contour!

, Suck your cheeks in again and make sure the natural shadow area is now filled with bronzer. If it appears too light, go over it a few more times with more bronzer.


If you have put on too much bronzer (it happens), take some tissue, scrunch it up into a ball and use circular motions to wipe off the excess bronzer.

, Don’t forget to make a fish face and fill in the shadowy area.


Some makeup artists recommend applying bronzer on your temples as well as your cheeks to create a more glowing look. Load the contour brush and move carefully from the edge of your eyebrows upward. Blend well. Check in the mirror to make sure there is an even amount of bronzer on your temples., The highlighter should go right along the top edge of your cheekbones, just under your eyes.If you are using a liquid highlighter, squeeze a few drops on the back of your hand. Press your index and middle finger into the highlighter. Wipe off any excess. Then, dab outward and up along your cheekbone, starting just past the center of your eye and ending at the outer corner of your eye.
If you are using a powder highlighter, grab a clean blush brush. Pat some of the highlighter underneath your eyes, along your cheekbones.

, If you are using liquid highlighter, its important to blend it well so it looks natural and not stripey or sloppy. Use your index finger to dab away at the outer edges of the highlighter until it is completely blended.If you are using powder highlighter, it will likely blend as you apply it. But make sure it is blended well, using a blush brush.

, Make sure there are no lines or stripes on your face. If there are any lines, blend them so your cheekbones look natural and full.

, You are already contouring your cheeks quite a bit with the bronzer and the highlighter, so blush may not be necessary. But if you are looking for a rosy glow to complement your cheekbones, apply your chosen blush color to your face now.Your face shape will dictate where blush will look best on your face. If you have an oval face or a round face, apply blush directly to the apples of your cheeks. Then, blend the blush outwards towards your temples with a blush brush.
If you have a strong jawline or square shaped face, apply blush towards the upper part of your cheeks. Start a few inches away from your nose and swipe your blush brush in a linear motion towards your temples.
Blush on its own is also a good way to highlight your cheekbones for a more casual look, like a day in the office or a casual night out. But if you’re looking for something more dramatic, highlighting and contouring are the way to go.

, Don’t worry if your face ends up looking a little so stripey or full of product on your first few tries. Practice this contouring technique until you feel comfortable with the shading and highlighting on your cheekbones. Over time, this will be become your go to technique for amazing looking cheekbones.

",How to Treat Dry Lips," The most immediate way to bring relief is to apply a lip balm with ingredients that lock in moisture, like petroleum jelly (Vaseline). Other hydrating ingredients include beeswax and shea butter.Avoid heavy matte lipsticks as these can dry out your lips.;
, Your lip balm or ointment should also include at least an SPF 30. Be sure to especially protect your bottom lip because it tends to be a little more exposed than your upper lip., If you find that your lip balm or cream is not improving your chapped lips, take a look at what ingredients are included in the formulation. You might be allergic to elements in the sunscreen, like avobenzone.


Fragrances and dyes can also cause allergies. Be sure to pick a lip balm that is a non-tinted, unfragranced petroleum jelly formulation.
Some other common allergens in lip balms include menthol, eucalyptus, and camphor.
Be aware that using lip gloss can lead to cheilitis, an acute or chronic inflammation of the lips. This is most likely due to a contact/allergen dermatitis or atopic dermatitis. Excessive use of lip gloss can cause this condition.

, If your lips have very flaky patches of skin, exfoliating with a brush or lip scrub will help you slough off the dead skin and regain your smooth, beautiful lips. You can buy a lip exfoliator from most beauty stores, but you can also follow this really easy recipe to make your own.Combine 2 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp honey, and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract in a small bowl. Apply the scrub to your lips and then rub your lips together, working the scrub into the skin. Wipe off with a clean towel. Immediately apply a petroleum jelly lip balm to moisturize the lips.
Be sure not to over-exfoliate; once or twice a week at most is all you need.

, Because your lips produce so little moisture on their own, they are very sensitive to changes in moisture in the air. Chilly, wintry air is a common culprit, but air that is dried out from indoor heating or air conditioning can also hurt your lips.

, While you can't control the air outdoors, you can add a humidifier to your home. It will be most effective if you use the humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep and while your lips are left untended for the longest.

, You can keep your lips plump and moisturized by drinking 8-12 glasses of water a day.

, In addition to wearing sunscreen on your lips (try a chapstick with SPF 30), you should also use a scarf to cover your lips, especially if you will be walking outside in very cold air. Always apply lip balm before you go outside in the winter.

, If you normally breathe through your mouth, this might be drying out your lips. Instead, take deep breaths through your nose to prevent chapped lips.

, One of the biggest causes of dry, chapped lips is when you lick your lips. Saliva is designed to digest food; it has an acidic enzyme which eats away at the top layer of skin on your lips.While it might feel like licking brings some temporary relief to your skin, remember that it is actually doing more damage to your lips.

, Your lips have some of the thinnest skin on your body. To make matters worse, they are also constantly exposed to the elements. Therefore, your lips are in a vulnerable position simply by their composition and location on your face.


They also have fewer natural oil glands to help keep the skin hydrated. This means you will need to supply additional hydration when they lose moisture.

, Often when we think of sunburns, we tend to overlook the impact of on our lips, but they can also become burnt and dried out from harmful UVA/UVB rays.


Skin cancer can also occur on your lips.

, Sometimes dry lips can be caused by a Vitamin B2 deficiency; if you have tried multiple treatments for hydrating your lips and they haven't worked, you should talk to your doctor about checking for a vitamin deficiency., Some medications — like Accutane, commonly used for the treatment of acne — can lead to very dry, flaky lips. If you are taking these medicines, you should plan to take extra care of your lips.,"

Start with a base of arrowroot powder.,
Add beetroot powder and hibiscus powder.,
Mix your blush.,
Test your blush.",How to Make Mineral Blush1," Add your arrowroot powder to a small clean makeup container, or any other small container that you will be able to mix and store your powder in. You can likely find arrowroot powder at your local grocery store, but it is also available online if you have difficulty. Arrowroot powder works as a great base for your mineral blush because it adheres nicely to the skin and works as a great medium for mixing colors.This makes one small batch of mineral blush. You can always start with more arrowroot powder to create one larger batch, or to create several batches at once.;
, You can find both of these powders at many natural food stores, as well as from various vendors online. Deciding how much of each powder to add is completely up to you! Beetroot powder is a much darker burgundy color, while hibiscus powder is more pink. People with dark skin may want to add more beetroot powder, while those with lighter complexions may prefer ore hibiscus powder. Your proportions might also change with the seasons!Make sure you’re only adding a tiny bit of each powder at a time. You can always add more powder and tweak your ratios, but you can’t take any powder out.

, After you’ve added your powders, carefully stir them so that they blend thoroughly with the arrowroot powder. You can also pop the cap on your container and shake your powders to mix them.As you blend your blush more and more, you will be able to see if you need to add more of anything.


If your powder accidentally ends up a bit too dark, you can add more arrowroot powder to lighten it up.

, Once you’ve mixed your powders thoroughly and you think your blush is ready, make sure to test it out. Using a blush brush, apply a bit to the apples of your cheeks. Use a mirror to examine how it looks on your face. Make sure to look at your face in natural light too – sometimes blush may look okay indoors but look a bit discolored in the sunshine. Tweak your blush as needed, and enjoy!

Look for ingredients like cocoa butter, Vitamins A and E, petrolatum, and dimethicone. Products without these ingredients might not do much to heal lips and could even make symptoms worse.Balms that include alpha-hydroxy acid can soothe and exfoliate chapped lips. This is an especially good ingredient to look for if you want something you can apply as a rub. Apply by gently adding the products to the lips, brushing the lips with a toothbrush to remove flakes, and then wiping off the balm.Petroleum and beeswax are also good ingredients to look for when seeking out lip balm. Responses to such products tend to vary from person-to-person, however, so you might have to try a few different products before you find one that works for you.Any lip balm you choose should always be re-applied before you head out into harsh weather.;
, Sunscreen can help protect lips that are already dried and cracked from further damage outside.


Look for a sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher for optimal protection. You should be able to find such a product in most drugstores and supermarkets.Always apply a lip balm as protection underneath sunscreen.Apply sunscreen that has broad spectrum cover for UVA and UVB that is water resistant.

, If you're looking for a more natural route, there are a variety of home remedies you can try that may improve your cracked, dry lips.


Natural oils, like coconut oil and mustard oil, can moisturize dry lips. Natural oils tend to work best when cracked lips are the result of poor weather conditions.
Cucumbers can cool and soothe lips. Simply eating cucumber, and applying the juices to the lips, can help.
Aloe vera, which can be purchased in cream or gel form from most drug stores, is a great option for cracked lips. You can also purchase an aloe vera plant and apply the juice from the leaves to your lips. Be aware that the taste of aloe vera is sometimes unpleasant. Make sure not to get any in your mouth while applying it to your lips.

Inflammation is usually benign and the result of mild irritation, but it can also be a sign of a bacterial infection.Antifungal and antibiotic creams, such as hydrocortisone creams, can be used to treat cracked lips in the event of an infection. Your doctor will prescribe you a cream if she thinks it is necessary. Always ask a doctor about potential side effects and proper use before starting a new medication.Steroid creams are not designed for long-term use, as this can cause thinning of the skin, discoloration, and other adverse side effects.

Some allergens, like pollen in the air, cause congestion. This leads to mouth-breathing, which can dry out and crack lips. If you're prone to allergies at certain times of the year, try to stay inside when possible and invest in over-the-counter allergy meds that can reduce symptoms.Your cracked lips themselves might be an allergic response. If you've recently started using a new shampoo, conditioner, lip balm, lipstick, or toothpaste, such products could be irritating your mouth. If you have just started using a new product, try ceasing use for a week and see if symptoms improve. If they do, you could very well have an allergy to that product.In addition, a common cause of cracked lips is the chronic use of lip balm. Be careful not to overuse lip balm or can develop a condition call cheilosis.

Anything you apply to your lips while they're cracked or dry can cause irritation and worsen or prolong symptoms., If your lips are really bothering you, you might want to pick at them to try and remove dead skin flakes. While this might seem like a good way to quicken the healing process, it actually makes it worse.

UVB rays are present in midday even during colder months and your lips need to be protected from the sun.

, Flaxseed oil boasts a number of positive health benefits and incorporating the heart-healthy oil into your diet can prevent cracked and dry lips.


Flaxseed oil can be applied directly on your lips, and this can be a good idea if you're lips are already chapped and incorporating the oil into your everyday dietary routine can stop cracked lips before they happen.Flaxseed oil can be added to smoothies, oatmeal, dips, dressings, and sauces. If it has contact with your mouth on a daily basis, it can help strengthen your lips and protect them against cracking and drying.Flaxseed oil does go bad quickly, so pay close attention to the expiration date.

, When you feel the urge to bite, do something else that makes it impossible. Lick your lips, or rub a finger across them. Lightly bite a pencil or small cushion, or do something that makes it impossible to bite, such as breathing with your mouth open, speaking, or singing. This technique is used to treat deeply engrained compulsions, along with relaxation techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy.Try this routine: when you want to bite, breathe deeply from your diaphragm for 60 seconds, relax your muscles one by one, then use your competing response for 60 seconds.Substitute other movements, such as pursing your lips, chewing gum, whistling, or yawning. Remember not to touch your lips or face, as this can be unsanitary and cause later problems, such as pesky acne!

Serious chewing and biting that causes bleeding, scarring or another damage to your lip or mouth requires medical attention. Lip biting is often a symptom of anxiety, but it can also be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRB).


Lip biting can be a tic. These are most common in young men and often disappear without treatment after a few months. A doctor can help you eliminate other possible causes.Ask your dentist about acquiring a mouth guard for help with lip biting, chewing, and clenching. If you tend to bite at night or during sedentary activities such as reading, watching television, or studying, these can be extremely helpful.

, Whether you bite your lips due to anxiety or a severe compulsion, getting therapy is more effective than medication. Your therapist will likely train you in habit reversal. This will involve mindfulness techniques, relaxation techniques, and competing response techniques. Ask for a referral for a therapist with experience treating compulsions and anxiety.


Ask your therapist about cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on the relationships between thoughts and behaviors.Support groups can also be helpful, especially if you don't know other people who understand what you're going through., If nothing seems to be helping, you may have an anxiety disorder that could be mitigated with medication.

, You might accidentally bite yourself if you eat quickly or have a misaligned jaw. Like another accidental biting, one bite can put you at risk for repeated and increasingly painful bites. If you bite your lip or cheek while chewing, give your mouth time to heal. Eat soft foods like yogurt, applesauce, and soup for a few days until the swelling goes down.

Practice deep breathing.,
Practice progressive muscle relaxation.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Stop Biting Your Lips4," Deep breathing, also called diaphragmatic breathing, helps you relax both physically and mentally.

When you feel the urge to bite your lips, try doing this instead:Sit up straight so that your torso is perpendicular to the ground.
Take slow, controlled breaths that fill your abdomen. You should feel your stomach moving in and out. If your chest is moving up and down, you're breathing is too shallow. Focus on breathing deeper.
Continue deep breathing until you feel relaxed and no longer want to bite your lips.

Exhale and release the tension at the same time. Stay completely relaxed for 15 seconds.
Choose another muscle group to tense for five seconds. Try your legs, torso, buttocks or jaw. Continue alternating between tensing and relaxing until you've gotten to all the main muscle groups.
Keep going until the urge to bite your lips passes. You may need to rotate between muscle groups for up to fifteen minutes.

, Mindfulness is the act of being fully in the present. When you pay more attention to your body and how it feels, you'll be less likely to bite your lips absent-mindedly. Mindfulness takes a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it you can use this technique anytime, anywhere to great effect.When you feel anxious, immediately focus on your five senses. What do you see in front of you? What do you taste in your mouth? What do you hear around you? What do you feel with your hands? What do you smell in the air?
Keep focusing on your physical state until you ride out the anxious thoughts.
If you're having trouble focusing, try the quick trick of looking at your hands while you clasp them together. This will help to ground you in your body immediately.

Hydrate and protect.",How to Help Chapped Lips," Opt for a plain beeswax balm, or one that contains sunscreen. Lip balm shields your lips against the weather, so don't forget it on dry, sunny, or windy days. Lip balm also seals cracks in your lips, preventing infection. Apply before going out, after eating or drinking, or whenever you notice it has worn off.


Avoid flavored lip balms if you have a habit of licking your lips. Opt for a nasty-tasting balm with SPF.
Avoid lip balms in pots, as repeatedly dipping your finger into the balm can breed bacteria that you may spread into your cracked lips.Wrap a scarf or hood across your mouth on a windy day. Avoid irritating it as it heals.;
, Scratching, peeling off flakes of dry skin, and biting chapped lips are all tempting, but equally bad for your mouth as it heals. Picking at chapped lips can irritate them and cause bleeding, which will slow the healing process and may invite an infection. It can also trigger cold sores if you are prone to them.Do not exfoliate your chapped lips! Your skin should be treated gently as it heals. Exfoliating can lead to infection.

, Dehydration is a common cause of chapped lips. Drink water and apply moisturizer to your skin. You can heal a mild case of chapped lips in a few hours by drinking water. A more severe case will take longer: drink water with every meal, before and after you exercise, and whenever you feel thirsty.Dehydration is especially common in the winter. Avoid heating your house with dry heat, or invest in a humidifier.

, If your lips become red, sore, and inflamed, you may have cheilitis. Cheilitis is caused by irritation, or by an infection. If your lips get so chapped they crack, bacteria can enter that causes cheilitis. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic or antifungal cream for you to apply until the cheilitis subsides.Lip licking is a common cause of cheilitis, especially in children.


Cheilitis can be a symptom of contact dermatitis. If you are prone to rashes, talk to your doctor about the possibility of a contact dermatitis diagnosis.
Cheilitis can be acute or chronic.
Certain drugs, medications, and supplements can increase your risk of contracting cheilitis. The most common are retinoids. Others are lithium, high doses of vitamin A, d-penicillamine, isoniazid, phenothiazine, and chemotherapeutic agents busulfan and actinomycin.Chapped lips are a symptom of many medical conditions, including autoimmune disease (such as lupus, and Crohn's disease), thyroid disease, and psoriasis.People with Down syndrome often have chapped lips.

, You might unconsciously lick your lips to hydrate them when they begin to feel dry. Unfortunately, lip licking has the opposite effect, since it washes the natural oils off your lips, causing dehydration and chapping. If you notice yourself licking, put on a lip balm. If you lick your lips compulsively, consult a doctor, and ask for a reference for a therapist or counselor. Compulsive lip licking, biting, and chewing can be symptomatic of many disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and body-focussed repetitive behavior (BFRB).


Apply a lip balm frequently to remind you not to lick, chew, or bite your lips. Opt for an unpleasant flavor with SPF.
Children between the ages of seven and 15 are prone to developing lip licking cheilitis.

, Breathing through your mouth can dehydrate your lips. If you tend to breathe through your mouth, practice nose-breathing to get in the habit. Sit for a few minutes each day and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try sleeping with a nasal dilator strip to encourage your nasal passages to open., Keep allergens and dyes off your mouth. Even a mild allergy or intolerance to a food can cause chapped lips. If you are not diagnosed with any allergies but have other symptoms, such as digestive issues or rashes, along with your chapped lips, consult with your doctor. Ask for a referral to an allergist if the problem is difficult to diagnose.Check the ingredients of your lip balm. Avoid anything you may be allergic to, such as a red dye.
Some people are allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid, which is found in many lip balms with SPF. If you experience swelling of the throat or shortness of breath, discontinue use of the lip balm and call 911., To best protect against chapped lips? Act like you already have them. Drink water with every meal, and keep a glass nearby for whenever you're thirsty. Apply lip balm when you're headed outside or when the heater is on. Cover your face on windy winter days, and use a lip balm with SPF on sunny days.


Unless you are training yourself not to lick your lips, you probably don't have to wear lip balm every day. Wear it on windy and sunny days if you don't want to wear it all the time.

Maintain good oral health.",How to Heal Sore Lips," The most popular name-brand petrolatum product is Vaseline, though off-brand products are often just as effective. Though there were concerns about the safety of some petrolatum products on the European market, those issues have been resolved, and petrolatum products score well in safety ratings. Petrolatum creates a protective seal over the skin that locks in moisture to prevent lips from drying out, reducing soreness., Dimethicone is a moisturizing agent that can treat peeling and irritation in dehydrated skin, and heal the issues that result in soreness.Be careful when using dimethicone products on your lips, though, as swallowing too much of it can be dangerous. Though it’s highly unlikely that would happen, frequent lip-lickers should take note.

, It may feel good to apply lip balms that feel cool to the touch, but these products often contribute to dryness and leave your lips even more sore. If a product lists eucalyptus, menthol, or camphor in its ingredients list, look for an alternative., This will allow the balm to moisturize your lips overnight and you will wake up with softer and less chapped lips. This is especially effective for frequent lipstick wearers, as the appearance of cracks and peeling skin through your lipstick will be less visible when you apply your lipstick in the morning.

, If your lips are sore on a regular basis despite regular use of lip balms, you may actually be suffering from an allergic reaction.It may be something you’re eating, like peanuts, or it may be a product you’re putting on your lips. Common allergens in lip products include beeswax, shea butter, castor oil, and soybean oil.If this is the case, switch from these plant-based moisturizers to a petroleum-based product.


You may need treatment with corticosteroid cream which can be applied with the fingers to the lips to relieve irritant or allergic contact dermatitis of the lips known as cheilitis.

, Keeping your body hydrated helps in virtually all of its functions and improves overall health. If your body is dehydrated, then its largest organ — the skin — will also be dry, and this can lead to lip soreness.The Institute of Medicine recommends that adult women drink at least nine cups of liquid per day, and that adult men drink at least 13 cups per day.This includes all liquids, including coffee, juices, and so on, and even includes the fluids contained in food.

, Taking steps to heal and hydrate your sore lips isn’t enough. You also have to make sure you’re avoiding behaviors that will prevent your lips from healing quickly. Common behaviors that contribute to lip soreness include peeling or biting on flaky skin and trying to exfoliate your lips while they’re sore., If your lips do not respond to the treatments listed above, there may be an underlying condition that needs to be treated. For example, swollen lips can be a symptom of Crohn’s disease, which inflames lymph ducts throughout the body.Consult a dermatologist, who can provide expert medical analysis of your condition.

, Don’t wait until your lips are swollen and sore to begin treating them. Even when your lips are healthy, take care of them with moisturizing, hydration-sealing lip balms and ointments to ensure you’ll never have sore lips again.

, You can buy lip exfoliants in most places where makeup is sold; they look like a tube of lipstick, but slough off the dead skin cells in the top layer of your lips. You can also use simple household products to exfoliate healthy lips, though. Simply mix some sugar and olive oil together, then rub the mixture lightly over your lips with your fingertips.


Do not scrub aggressively at your lips, as this can cause damage that will lead to soreness and inflammation.
Moisturize your lips with a hydrating lip balm immediately after exfoliating.

, Some people lick their lips frequently without even thinking about it. You might think it harmless — after all, shouldn’t it hydrate your lips from the outside in? In fact, the opposite is true: when the saliva evaporates it dries out your lips, and you’re also licking away the natural oils that keep your lips healthy.Make a concerted effort to stop your lip-licking habit.

, Lips have very little melanin (the pigment that protects against harmful UV rays) compared to the rest of the skin on your body. As such, your lips are in danger of sun damage every time you step outdoors, resulting in dryness, cracking, soreness, or — in severe cases — cancerous growth. Sun exposure can also result in an outbreak of cold sores. To avoid these and other issues, make sure to coat your lips in SPF products. Most sun-protecting lip products have a fairly low SPF of 15 — these are fine for regular, daily wear; however, if you’re going to spend the day at the beach or working outside, make sure to coat your lips in a product with a higher SPF, just as you would the rest of your skin.

, Ensure that your lips, teeth, gums, and mouth are healthy by following guidelines for good oral health. This includes brushing your teeth twice daily or after meals, using a fluoride toothpaste. Rinse your toothbrush after use and keep it somewhere it can air dry to prevent bacteria growth.Remember to floss and visit your dentist every six to 12 months for cleaning. Maintaining good dental hygiene can decrease your risk of infection and may prevent and/or heal your sore lips faster.

, You'd think any lip balm would work, since it's designed for this exact problem. Unfortunately, products that contain menthol, camphor, or peppermint are particularly harsh on damaged lips. Avoid purchasing products with these items listed as ingredients.Many dermatologists recommend petroleum jelly (Vaseline), but some disagree, stating that it may cause harm.

, Unlike lip balms, which seal in moisture to prevent drying, lip moisturizers try to rehydrate directly. Some dermatologists recommend moisturizers that contain vitamins A, B, and E, or dimethicone. It's best when used right after a shower, as water, shampoo, and soap can dry out already damaged lips., All-natural lip balms and moisturizers can be effective, but many claims are not supported by evidence. In general, waxes and fats are likely to help seal in moisture, including beeswax, shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter, and vegetable oils. However, essential oils and fragrances are more likely to irritate your lips than soothe them, and can even cause a major reaction., If you're not interested in buying products from a store, you can use items housed in your kitchen for relief. Keep in mind that most of these recipes are not vetted by professionals. It's best to stick to simple ingredients and avoid essential oils, or dilute them to 2% strength or less.


To make a simple lip balm, take a cup of shaved beeswax, 3 tablespoons of coconut oil, and a teaspoon of vitamin E oil and boil them together over the stove. Remove from heat and let the concoction dry and solidify overnight.

, A gentle exfoliant may help your lips, but too much can easily cause harm.Try applying a mixture of olive oil, honey, and sugar to your lips for 10 minutes and then washing it off. This should moisturize and soften your lips, but stop if you notice further damage.

, Some websites claim flaxseed oil helps heal chapped lips by restoring essential fatty acids.This may or may not work, but be aware that flax can have dangerous effects if you have certain medical conditions, or an allergic reaction.If you decide to use it, you may apply a small dab of flaxseed oil directly to your lips.


Flaxseed oil can also be used as an ingredient in dressings, salsa, and dips. You can also add a drop to foods like cottage cheese, baked potatoes, and popcorn.Be careful. Flaxseed oil does not last long, so make sure to use it within the first three months of purchase."

Make final adjustments.",How to Define Cheekbones," As always, wash your face before you apply makeup. Cover blemishes with concealer if necessary, then apply foundation.






;
, Peach works well for warm skin tones, while earthy tones complement cool skin tones.Cream bronzer is easier to apply than powder, but don't mix cream and power makeup products.To find your skin tone, hold the underside of your wrist up to natural light. If the veins look green, you have a warm skin tone. Blue or purple veins mean a cool skin tone, while blue-green means a neutral skin tone.

, Suck in your cheeks to find your cheek hollows, or ""shadow zone."" Start just above the corner of your mouth, and sweep a small amount of bronzer all along the top of this zone, just underneath your cheekbones. Continue in a smooth, crescent pattern until you reach your hairline just above your ear.








A special bronzer blush provides the most control.In a pinch, you can use a blush brush or clean fingers (for a cream bronzer), but don't use the brush for other products.When using powder, tap the brush to shake off the excess before applying.

, Use clean fingertips or a clean brush to blend in the bronzer. You shouldn't see any sharp lines or stripes, but don't spread the bronzer into the apple of your cheek (the rounded center). If the shade is too light, add another layer of bronzer.








, To further accent your bone structure, apply bronzer along the outside edge of your temples, curving down along your jaw line.








Now that you see the overall effect, you can experiment a little in future. Applying bronzer at a straighter, less severe angle makes your face look wider, while a slightly sharper angle makes your face look longer.If you follow your cheekbones exactly, it may add even more length.

, Without blush, the bronzer may make your cheeks look gaunt. Brush your favorite blush onto the center of your cheek (the apple). If your cheekbone looks too harsh, gently blend a little extra blush directly onto the cheekbone.It's easy to overdo blush, so be careful.









If you're not sure which color to choose, pinch your cheeks and try to match that flushed color.In general, fair skin calls for peach or pink blush; olive skin calls for blush with blue undertones; and dark skin can pull off bright pinks or oranges., Pick a highlighter slightly lighter than your skin, with no glitter. A golden highlighter works well on dark skin, while people with fair skin may prefer a light, pearly color.If you don't have a highlighter, you can improvise with a pearly nude eyeshadow.

, Tap the highlighter right along the top of your cheekbone, where it's most visible. Extend this up to the lower edge of your eye, reaching near the outer corner.Blend the highlighter in with small circular motions as you apply it. The highlighter should look like a reflection of light, contrasting with the dark bronze.









Powder highlighters are best applied with a small blush brush. You can use a sponge for liquid highlighter, but for best results, put a few drops on the back of your hand and dab it on with your fingers.
Dab a little highlighter above your brow bone or to the inner corners of your eyes to add even more light to your face., Blend in all makeup thoroughly to avoid sharp lines and other artificial effects. If you used liquid highlighter, keep it in place with a light layer of translucent powder.









If you can't get the makeup to blend with your fingertips, softly brush your cheeks in a circular motion using a clean, fluffy brush.To blend liquid products, use a makeup sponge.
If you need to remove some of your makeup, use a scrunched up tissue to lightly buff your cheeks.

Eliminate lip biting.,
Limit your exposure to allergens.,
Do not lick or pick at your lips.,
Stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet.",How to Heal Peeling Lips2," Sometimes, the cause of peeling lips is the result of our own actions. Oftentimes, people bite their lips somewhat unconsciously when feeling anxious, bored, or stressed. If you notice your lips are peeling or cracked, try to figure out if you've been biting your lip. If you have, take measures to stop the habit.


Try to figure out what situations lead to lip biting. Do you bite your lips when you're feeling anxious or engaging in certain social situations, like meeting new people or interacting with co-workers? Do you simply bite your lips when you're bored, like when watching TV or waiting for a bus?After identifying what situations lead to lip biting, engage in anxiety and boredom reducing behaviors that do not have a negative effect on your body. You could try deep breathing, relaxing your muscles, or what is called a competing response. This is a behavior you engage in that makes it impossible to bite your lip. You could, for example, chew gum to occupy your teeth with an alternative activity., If your lip peeling occurs after exposure to a certain food, cosmetic product, or season it may be allergy-related.


Cosmetic products, lip balms, toothpastes, dyes, and fragrances often contain material which irritates the lips, eyes, and mouth. If you notice your lips peel after using a particular product, you might want to ditch that item and opt for an alternative.Even if you don't believe your peeled lips are a result of cosmetic products, it's best to ditch the lipstick and lip balm until peeled lips heal. Such products can carry germs and peeled lips are more susceptible to infection.Certain seasons, like early spring, can trigger allergic responses due to the increase of pollen in the air. If you're sensitive to seasonal change, try spending more time indoors or purchasing over-the-counter allergy medications.
Allergen exposure can also lead to mouth breathing, which puts strain on the lips by exposing them to more air and debris. This can cause peeling and chapping.

, When our lips are dry and chapped, it's tempting to lick them and peel them to relieve symptoms. These habits do harm longterm, however, and can prolong the healing time for peeled lips.


Do not pull at peeling skin. While it might be tempting, it does not actually provide relief. It usually causes pain and leads to bleeding, which increases the likelihood of infection and prolongs the healing process., Dryness is one of the most common causes of dry, peeled lips. Making hydration a habit can prevent lip peeling from occurring long-term.


Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day. Roughly 1.5 liters of water are needed for the average person, but depending on your lifestyle that number may change. If you exercise frequently or have a physically demanding job, for example, you may need more. In general, you should drink enough water that you rarely feel thirsty. If your urine is colorless or light yellow, you are probably in the right range.Eating a balanced and healthy diet can help keep lips healthy. Food can provide about 20 percent of your total water intake. Watermelon and spinach are two examples of foods that are 90 percent or more water by weight.If the air in your home feels dry or if you live in a region prone to pollution and dry air, invest in a humidifier. This will keep the air moist in your home and make peeled lips less likely."

Before you start putting any of the colors on, decide how big you want the bruise to be. You can input into a search engine ""fake black eye"" or ""fake eyelid contusion"" to see the finished works other people have done to get more inspiration.


You can also look up ""black eye"" and ""eyelid contusion,"" but be forewarned that some of the images that are likely to show up in your search may be incredibly graphic in nature.;
, There are two ways that you can give your skin the appearance of swelling. Most people opt to create a swollen look at the end through illusions with colors and the application of a gloss. However, for extra drama, you can use a flesh colored putty or theatrical nose and scar wax to create a fake bump on your face.Make sure your skin is clean and dry first, and pull out a small piece to lightly mold with your fingers into an approximate desired shape. Paste it to the forward and blend the wax or putty downward with your fingers to make a smooth transition into your skin.
You must apply this wax or putty before you begin applying any colors.
You can buy a 1 oz tub of this product for about $5 on Ebay, Amazon, or at a local costume shop, and they come in a variety of skin tones.

, Using a red or warm violet color, create the general size and shape of the bruise that you want to make. It should be somewhat irregular in shape, since real bruises are not usually perfectly shaped. Keep the application light and transparent and generally larger than the impact site.Specifically for a black eye, this could be anywhere from your undereye to your browline, the side of your face, and your nose., When a bruise is at its most fresh it will be red, swollen, and tender. As it heals, it cycles through a number of colors until eventually, around 2 to 4 weeks after sustaining the injury, it will disappear entirely. You can choose to leave your bruise primarily red, blue, and purple, or you can add green and yellow, which will give it the appearance of age, and also tends to look more sickly to many people.Using the same stippling method you used to apply the basic bruise shape, apply the yellow and/or green colors. They should be focused towards the edges of your bruise, and the larger they are, the larger they indicate the initial bruise was.
You can use your finger to help smudge and blend the bruise's colors together to create a more natural look.
Green colors appear and dominate between days 5 and 7, and yellow appears between days 7 and 10. Only the oldest bruises will have yellow.

, Using the same color you used for the bruise, create a more concentrated and pigmented portion (or portions) within the bruise. This will be the impact site, where the assailant's fist struck, and it should be significantly smaller than the rest of the bruise. It ought to be located somewhere a fist or knuckle would likely connect, like along the cheekbone, ridge of the eye socket, the bridge of the nose, or all three.


You can also use a smaller layer of blue in the impact area for a more dramatic look.
Create a small ""hole"" in the center of the impact site by faintly dabbing on some alcohol or makeup remover in the middle of the impact area to help create an illusion of swelling. This creates a high contrast contour that will really make it pop., Because of the shape of the eye socket and surrounding bone structures, blood pools in specific places around the eye. To create this effect, you'll want to apply first a dark red, then a dark purple, and then blue.Start from the inside corner of your eye and move out along the waterline.
From the inside corner of your eye follow the area just above the ridge of your eye socket under your eye.
From the inside of your eye, go up along the upper crease of your eye.
Dab along the outside V of your eye.
Use the blue color the most sparingly for the areas of deepest bruising, particularly at the very inner corner of the eye.

, Especially if you have used home makeup or cream based makeup, you'll want to brush on some setting powder before continuing to make sure that your makeup stays. Alcohol-based makeup should not need this, however, as only alcohol will make it move.Brush or pat on a translucent setting powder all over the bruise area.

, Where the skin swells, it gets a shiny, swollen effect. Instead of using glittery makeup to achieve this look, since it will not give you the right kind of depth, you will want to apply either a clear lip balm, a thin layer of vaseline, or transparent jelly over the areas you have painted. This will give you the look of having been freshly punched., If someone has been hit in the eye, there is a chance they've been hit in other places on their face too. Don't feel like you have to keep the bruising relegated to just the eye-socket area. A person's mouth and nose are other prominent, vulnerable areas that might get damaged in a fight., There are specially made ""bruise pallets"" and face makeups designed to depicting gore; you can find these online and in Halloween or costuming stores. Some of these will be alcohol or water based, and they'll likely last much longer on your face than daily fashion makeup will. However, you do not have to go out and spend more money on separate pallets for effects makeup if you have pallets of normal makeup with lots of colors already.The advantage of alcohol-based FX makeup is that it has a more natural look and won't go anywhere once it's been applied and dried. It's also designed to show up well no matter what your skin color is.
If you use alcohol-based makeup, you will need to use 99% alcohol in order to activate your paint (that is, make it wet and applicable for use). For some people, alcohol can make their eyes tear up and water, so be careful.
Cream based paints and makeup from home are a more affordable solution, but they will look like they're sitting on top of your skin as opposed to beneath your skin like alcohol based colors will.You can also use regular eyeshadow and water for a wet application if they are marked as dry-or-wet or are baked eyeshadow.

, If you're not using a pre-determined bruise palette then you'll need to create your own. The colors you will need for sure are red, purple, and blue. If you want a more aged look, you will also need yellow and a bright green.


If you're using fashion makeup, try to use matte colors as much as possible. Shimmer makeup will look more obviously fake than matte makeup with a gloss applied on top.
Avoid using black products. Although it's called a ""black eye,"" black eyes are not actually black in color; using black will create a more unnatural look.

, You can opt to only use makeup brushes to apply the makeup for your bruise, particularly if you are just going to use household makeup. However, for a more realistic look that will create the illusion of broken capillaries, you will want to use a stippling sponge. You can buy these at Walmart or your local craft store, or you can make one yourself by taking a beauty sponge wedge and picking pieces from it to create an uneven surface.It is also possible to stipple with a brush by repeatedly dotting the makeup on, but it's very time consuming. If you want a more realistic look, you're better off using a sponge for stippling.

, The first step before you can put anything on your face, particularly traditional makeup, is to make sure that it's clean. Your skin produces natural oils that, combined with dirt, sweat, and other particles it picks up throughout the day, will prevent makeup from spreading evenly and staying a long time.Use lukewarm water and a cream cleanser to get the dirt off your skin.
Pat dry with a towel instead of rubbing, which stretches the skin., After you've cleaned away the natural oils, you need to replace the moisture you've lost. The areas around your eyes have the thinnest skin which needs moisture the most, so it's best to use a specially formulated eye cream. Massage or pat into your skin a very small amount (pea-sized or smaller) of cream from the brow bone to your under eye.Wait a few minutes for the moisturizer to sink in before proceeding.

, Because there is a chance that your makeup for your black eye may extend as far as your cheek or your nose, you'll want to prime your face with foundation and concealer first. These items will hide redness, discoloration, and other blemishes and give your skin an even, solid tone that will make the bruise stand out better.Foundation will usually provide you with a more natural, lighter look, so use foundation more than concealer.
Apply foundation with a foundation brush, beginning at the center of your face and moving outward. Blend it into your skin with a fingertip or a sponge to make it look more natural.
On blemishes like acne, dark undereye circles, or other particular trouble areas, tap on concealer with a fingertip, blending outward., Eyeshadow primer will help make the makeup you use for your bruise pop more, apply more evenly, and stay in place throughout the day. It can also be used directly underneath your eyes to help your concealer last longer and prevents makeup from pooling inappropriately in the creases and wrinkles underneath your eyes.Apply your eyeshadow primer the same way you applied your eye cream.

, You don't want your makeup to come off during the day, so make sure it stays put by using a translucent powder. You only need to use this over areas that tend to develop shininess. These would be:Between your eyebrows.
Down and around your nose.
Under your eyes.
On your chin.

, A thin contour line across your hairline will make your forehead look slightly smaller. Use a thin makeup brush to apply a contour line there to start.Contour lines can be created using bronzer or a foundation slightly darker than your regular skin tone.


For best results, invest in a makeup brush specifically designed to do contour lines.

, Start at the ears and end in the middle of your cheeks. On each cheek, make a line that runs just below your natural cheekbone. This will slim down your face by making your cheekbones more noticeable., Add a small vertical line to your chin roughly in the center. Then, blend the line backward into your neck. This will narrow your chin slightly., To brighten your face, use concealer or highlight to draw two upside down triangles under your eyes. This will brighten up your eyes and eliminate any dark circles.You can use your fingers or a makeup brush to draw your triangles.
If you have a pencil concealer or highlighter, use this to draw your triangles.

, To further draw out your cheekbones, add a line of highlighter or concealer near the contour lines you drew. Add a small line of concealer beside the contour line on the top of each cheekbone. It is not necessary to run the line along the full scope of your cheekbone like you did with the contour line., Draw one line going down the bridge of your nose. This should slim down your nose slightly, making it look smaller., Get a beauty blender or similar tool, like a makeup sponge, slightly damp. Tap the blender across your face in small, circular motions. Use the rounded edge of the sponge for areas like your cheeks and forehead. For areas like your nose, squeeze the brush between your hands to flatten it as you tap the makeup to blend.Do not rush the process. It can take awhile to blend contour lines so they look natural. Going too fast may obscure your lines, undoing your work.

, A translucent powder or foundation can help your contour lines stay intact for the rest of the day. After everything is blended, dip a fluffy brush in a small amount of powder. Gently dust a light layer of the powder across your face to set your look., Apply a small amount of blush to each cheek using a makeup brush. Only apply brush to the roundest portions of your cheeks as this is most flattering if you have an oblong face.Avoid shimmery blushes, as this can distract from your highlighting.

Glitter tears are essentially an extension of your regular eye makeup. Pick a colour for your eyeshadow that will match with the glitter you are using to create tears. This will pull your eye makeup together creating a dramatic look.






;
, Before adding the glitter, you can draw faint lines under your eyes using eyeshadow. You can also put a bit of eyeshadow immediately under your eye. These lines should be situated where the glitter will be placed. Try using one of the lighter colours that you used for your eyeshadow. This will help give the glitter a light background colour and will allow them to stand out even more.







, You can create subtle glitter tears, by placing a fine glitter directly under your eyes. Use a glitter eyeliner, such as Urban Decay Heavy Metal Glitter Eyeliner or Burberry’s Shimmer Dust. This is a very fine glitter that does not require an adhesive and comes in a variety of colours. Depending on the look you are going for you can apply a thin line of fine glitter under your entire eye or just in certain areas.








The glitter immediately under your eye is meant to look like the pool of wetness that often develops when you are crying.
Pair these subtle tears with smudged black eye makeup to make it appear as though you have actually been crying.

, For a more dramatic look you can actually apply glitter in small tear spots running down your face. Always put more glitter closer to your eye and less glitter as you move down your cheek. This will mimic more closely the look of real tears. Glitter tears can be applied in a variety of different shapes.








For instance, you can create long streaks of glitter tears that run down the entire face or put a few tears that drip down the face, stopping at the cheek.
Be creative and don’t be too precise with the glitter. In order to achieve the look, you want to be slightly haphazard with the application of glitter., For a dramatic effect, you can use different sizes and colours of glitter. For example, begin with fine pieces of glitter and then add larger pieces, and then finally you can add small gems. You can also use a variety of colours. For instance, you may want to use silver and white glitter as the dominant base and then add some pink and purple. Alternatively, you could stick to one colour like gold and just provide a light dusting.









If you want to apply a few gems or a heavier glitter, you may need to use a makeup adhesive first. These can be purchased anywhere makeup is sold.Apply glitter using your finger or a small makeup brush.

, There are many different types of glitter tear looks that you can achieve. In order to create a custom look that works with your personality, style or costume, search online. You can complete an online image search for “glitter tears”, or you can follow the glitter tears hashtag on Instagram for examples.Some different glitter tear looks include bold and thick tears or a subtle sparkle under the eye.

, Once you have finished applying the glitter tears, you can put on mascara or false eyelashes. False eyelashes are often much darker and thicker than your regular eyelashes and they will likely stand out more fully. Because you are wearing so much dramatic eye makeup, false eyelashes are likely preferable, but a dark mascara can also work.







, Glitter can be difficult to work with and often gets all over the place. While applying glitter tears you may accidentally get some on your forehead, chin, or anywhere that you don’t want the glitter to be. In order to remove unwanted glitter or fallout from your face, take a small piece of tape and tap the glitter. It will stick to the tape and be easily removed from your face, without disturbing the rest of your makeup.







, When creating glitter tears, you want your eyes to be the focal point of your look. As a result, you should use a light pink or nude lip colour. A light lip colour will help your eyes stand out even more.







, At the end of the night it is very important that you remove all makeup, including glitter tears, before going to bed. This will help reduce your chances of developing unwanted acne and will keep your face clean and fresh. In order to remove glitter from your skin, use a natural oil, such as coconut oil.








Dip your fingers in the coconut oil and rub in a gentle circular motion over the area with glitter.

, Once you have applied a natural oil to the glitter, wipe your entire face using a water-soaked cotton pad. This will help to remove the adhesives and any excess glitter. Lightly rub the pad across your face, so that you do not irritate your skin.







, Finally, you should wash your entire face using warm water and a gentle cleanser. This can be the same as your regular cleansing routine and will help to remove the rest of the makeup from your face, including your eye makeup.









Pat your face dry using a towel.

Then, apply concealer to the dark circles on your face and any blemishes, dabbing the concealer in with your middle finger until it is blended in with your skin., Choose a natural looking foundation, and apply it to your face with a brush, sponge or your fingers. Make sure you choose a foundation that is similar to your skin tone, and blend it in with your fingers or a beauty blender. Use a damp beauty blender sponge so it doesn't remove any of the foundation from your face.


At this point, you can apply another layer of concealer for any blemishes that are really stubborn, but make sure you don't cake on your makeup., Apply a bronzer to your face to help even out your skin tone. Use a regular makeup brush or bronzer brush and sweep the bronzer across your forehead, cheeks, chin, and your neck. Then, blend it into your skin with the brush until your face has an even color.Make sure when you apply your bronzer that the color of your face is the same color as the rest of your skin. Take a step back from the mirror and check to make sure your neck color matches your face color and that your collarbone matches your neck color. If your face stands out from the rest of your body, you may need to blend the bronzer in a little more.
If you have paler skin, you may want to skip this step. However, you can apply a light bronzer one or two shades darker than your skin if you have first applied a foundation that matches your skin tone. You don't necessarily want to go for a ""bronze"" look, but choose a bronzer with a base of beige or gold. Only use a tiny bit, dipping your brush in the bronzer only once or twice and tapping it afterwards to remove excess bronzer. Then, if using a matte bronzer, make the number 3 on your face, starting at your forehead, moving to your cheeks, and then finishing at your chin. Then, blend it in very well., If you apply a cream blush after you have applied powder to your face, the blush will not blend in well to your cheeks. Instead of applying powder to your face before you apply blush, apply your blush first and then finish with a small dusting of loose powder. This will help your blush cling to your face, as well as create a more matte finish on your face, which will remove some of the dewy look.If you have a naturally dry face, and don't want to remove any of the glow or dew from the cream blush, then don't apply a powder finish. Powder can be skipped in the makeup process -- it's really a personal preference.

, There are several different ways to apply cream blush. Any of them can be used to apply the blush effectively, so it just depends on your preference. You can apply cream blush in three ways:Cheek highlighter brush: This brush has soft, flat bristles and you can apply blush by dabbing the brush into your cream blush, and then tapping it onto the apple of your cheeks.
Beauty blender sponge: You can apply your blush with this tool by gently swiping it in an upward motion on the apple of your cheeks. A sponge can also be used to blend your blush into the skin.
Your fingers: This may be the easiest way to apply your blush as you will dip your fingers in the blush and then swipe it onto your cheeks.

, You can choose to apply blush to any of these two areas. To locate the apples of your cheeks, first smile. The area of your cheeks that is raised while you are smiling is the apple of your cheek. To find your cheekbones, suck in your cheeks, making somewhat of a fish face. The area on your cheekbones where it experiences the indentation is where you will apply your blush.Most people tend to apply blush to the apples of their cheeks, but you can apply to your cheekbones instead if you desire a different look.
If you have high cheekbones and a hollow in your cheeks, applying to the apple of your cheeks can help soften your features and make your face look less angular.If you have a rounder face, applying blush to your cheekbones instead of the apples in your cheeks can help your face look slimmer. Make sure you stay on the high part of the indentation, where you can feel the lower part of your cheekbone -- you don't want your blush to rest too low on your face.

, You can choose between the apple of your cheeks or your cheekbones, but in both areas make sure you don't apply your blush too far back. You want your blush to rest in the middle of your cheeks, not all the way up to your ear, as this can look unnatural and outdated.

, Dip your middle and ring finger into your blush, making sure they are clean first. Gently dab your fingers onto the apples of your cheeks or your cheekbones. If you feel your blush is too bright, continuing tapping it and blending it in with your fingers until you have your desired color.If your blush is still too bright after you have blended it in with your fingers, you can use the beauty blender sponge to smooth it out even more. Take the sponge and gently tap it onto your cheeks, until you have blended in your blush as much as you want.

, Tap your brush into your cream blush for a few seconds until you have enough blush on your brush. Then, stipple the blush onto your cheekbones or apples of your cheeks. Blend out any excess blush with your beauty blender or your fingers.


If you feel you have picked up too much blush, you can tap the brush on the back of your hand to remove some of the product.Stippling your brush just means you are creating a pattern of small dots, that when formed together look like a solid color or shading.

, Take the side of your sponge, and dip it in your cream blush. Then, apply your blush to your cheekbones or apples by swiping the sponge onto your cheeks. You can then flip your sponge to the clean side and smooth out your blush by blending (in a circular motion) or dabbing it in with your sponge.

, The two different types of blushes will help you achieve different looks, so it's really a personal preference which one you use. A powder blush will give you a more finished look, and can be applied with a large makeup brush. A cream blush gives you a more dewy, outdoorsy finish and is applied with a brush or your fingers.When applying cream blush, always use a smaller amount at first. You can go back and add more blush to your cheeks, but it's harder to remove excess blush than it is to add more. If you have accidentally added to much blush to your cheeks, you can blend it in or you can apply a light layer of foundation on top of it to conceal some of the color.

, If you want your blush to look natural, you'll need to choose the right shade of blush. If you really want your cheeks to pop, then you can choose a blush in any color. To find the most natural blush color, pinch your cheeks and try to match the color created on your cheeks with a blush color. If you are having trouble choosing the right blush color, you can follow this general guide for skin tones:Fair/ivory skin: Choose a baby pink or pale pink for your blush color. This is the most natural look for very fair skin as other shades can look orangey. For fair skin that is a little bit darker you can use a peach blush in a satin or sheer texture. If you want to go a little more dramatic for a night out, you can use a plum colored blush in a translucent shade. Choose a plum colored blush that is a shade or two darker than your lip color.
Medium skin: Wear a blush that is an apricot shade, as this will bring out the natural warm colors in your skin. You can also wear a pinky-berry color; because a pale pink looks good on fair skin, a medium pink will look good on medium skin. For a more dramatic look, choose a muted mauve (pale purple) color that has a hint of plum.
Olive skin: Look for warm tones like an orangey-peach, that will hide the green undertones in the skin. Wear a rose or bronze colored blush for a more dramatic look that will add warmth to your skin and help boost the olive color. If you have fair olive skin you can use these same colors, just don't apply as much blush.
Dark skin: Go for bold, highly pigmented shades like raisin, brick, and cranberry. For a dramatic look, choose a bright tangerine that will be pretty and subtle on dark skin.

, Cream blush differs from powder blush in that it is good for dry skin as powder blush can enhance your dryness. If you have aging skin, cream blush will give you a more youthful look and adds dewiness to your skin that people tend to lose as they age. In cold climates or during cold seasons, cream blush adds moisture to your cheeks that is drawn out with the cold air so it keeps your face from looking as dry.Using cream blush in a very humid environment can be difficult because it can make your face look even more oily. If you live in an area where you experience lots of humidity or you tend to sweat a lot during the day, using a powder blush might be better because you won't need the extra moisture added to your skin.

Blend your blush adequately.,
Do not blend towards the nose if you have a round face.",How to Apply Blush for Your Face Shape," Look at your face in the mirror. Scan your face to figure out what portion is the widest. This will give you insight into your face shape.If your forehead, cheeks, and jaws are roughly equal in length, you may have a square, round, or oval face.
Your face may be heart-shaped if your forehead is widest.
Wide cheekbones may indicate a diamond-shaped face.
A wide jaw can indicate a triangular or pear-shaped face.;
, After determining the widest part of your face, look at your jaw. How round your jaw is indicates your precise face shape.








Round and oval faces have very round jaws.
Square jaws are found on square or diamond-shaped faces.
A pointy jaw indicates you have a heart-shaped face.

, Think about how long your face is. Is it longer than it is wide? Draw an imaginary line below your eyes running from ear to ear. Then, draw an imaginary line from the top of your nose to your chin. Compare the lengths to get a sense of your face shape.








Round shaped faces are generally equally as long as they are wide.
If your face is longer than it is wide, you may fall into any categories other than a round-shaped face. Most faces are slightly longer than they are wide.

, Think about the various factors affecting face shape. Which category does your face most often fall under? This should give you a sense of your personal face shape.For example, the widest part of your face is your forehead. You have a pointier jaw and your face is a little longer than it is wide.
Based on this information, you most closely fall into the heart-shaped category. Apply blush according to guidelines for a heart-shaped face.

, With heart-shaped faces, apply blush from the top of the temple down your cheekbone. Make a c-shape that follows the natural line of your cheekbone. You should have more blush near your cheekbone and have it fade out as it makes its way up to the temple.







, Smiling can help you figure out where the apples of your cheeks fall. Focusing on the apples of your cheeks works for a square-shaped face. You should make small circles on the apples of each cheek.For a long face, make small circles on your apples, but then blend them out slightly towards your temples.







, If you have a round face, slight slimming is key. Apply blush at the apples of the cheeks. Then, draw an angle moving to the temples. Blend the line out as you move into your temples.







,, Depending on your face shape, you may apply blush on or above your cheekbones. You should never apply blush below your cheekbones. You should draw contour lines rather than blush under your cheekbones.







, You want your blush to blend into your natural skin tone and any foundation you're wearing. You want your cheeks to look rosy and natural without harsh lines. After applying your blush, make sure to use a separate makeup brush to blend your blush out into your existing skin and makeup.







, Always blend upward towards the temples if you have a round face. Do not blend your blush towards your nose. This can make your face look rounder rather than creating the slimming effect.

Remember that draping may require a different shade.,
Start with a clean face.,
Use a good moisturizer.,
Apply a primer.,
Be sure to use clean makeup brushes.",How to Apply Draping Blush," The kind of brush depends on where you are going to apply the blush. Since you will be applying blush to more than just the apples of your cheeks, you will want to use a smaller brush for smaller areas. For the cheeks, you can use a regular blush brush.Some suggest using a setting brush for the smaller areas of your face. For example, on your brow bones. This will make it easier to control where the color goes.;
, If you are planning to apply foundation to your skin, you should do this before you start draping your blush on. If you use a full coverage foundation, applying blush will be especially important to help give your skin a more dimensional look.









Be sure that your concealer and foundation are well-blended before moving on. This will keep you from having that line around the neck area that shows where the foundation stops.
If you are applying concealer, this should also be applied before the blush.

, Just below your cheek bones, dust some darker blush on. Doing this will help give your face a more contoured look. Don’t worry if it looks harsh at first. You can use a lighter shade to blend later.








Don’t go too crazy with the darker blush. The idea is just to apply a light layer to help contour your face. You don’t need to look as though you are actually blushing. Rather, the idea is to give your face a healthy looking glow.

, Now you should lightly dust a more neutral blush color on any of the high points of your face that you want to emphasize. When applying the blush, use a very light touch along with circular motions. You want to create a natural look, so make sure that you blend any rough edges into your skin to avoid a harsh look.








Places that you can apply the foundation include your temples, brow bone, across the bridge of your nose, and even the tip of your chin., Choosing a blush that is too dark for your skin can make you look like a clown. On the other hand, choosing a blush that is too light for your skin can leave you looking washed out and ashen.Thus, it is important that you choose a blush that is ideal for your skin. For draping, some experts recommend using a more neutral and natural looking color than you might normally choose, so keep that in mind if you are buying blush specifically for this technique.


If you have very fair skin, you should choose the lightest blush shades you can find. When draping, you can choose a very slightly darker color to apply under the cheekbones, and use a very light blush everywhere else.
For medium skin, look for blush that is rosy or peach colored, and that are slightly darker than the lightest shades. For draping, choose one of the slightly darker colors, and then look for a complementary shade that is just a bit lighter and more natural looking.
For dark skin, it is especially important not to choose a color that is too light in order to avoid looking ashen. The color you choose will depend on how dark your skin is. If it is very dark, you can opt for deep rose or orange colors, and if your skin is a bit lighter then choose a slightly less deep color.

, For a night out on the town, you might want a more bold look than you might choose for a day at the office, or for a more formal occasion such as a wedding. Thus, you might consider owning a few different blushes that are bolder for evening looks, and a few more natural tones that you wear for occasions wear a bold look is less appropriate.


Alternatively, you can also apply a bit more blush for an evening look and a bit less for everyday if you can’t or don’t want to have different shades.

, Draping is different from applying blush as usual in that you will be applying more color to more of your face. Thus, you may need a more natural shade than what you currently use.


Some companies even make blushes that allow you to blend them together specifically for draping.Applying a color that is too deep and bold will make you look clownish. Instead, look for neutral shades that will make you look healthy and glowing.

, When applying makeup, it is important that you start with a clean face. Makeup will go on better and stay on better, and it will also keep your skin healthier. This is because applying makeup to a dirty face can spread bacteria all over your skin, which may lead to breakouts.If you don’t have time to wash your face correctly, you can use a skin refresher such as micellar water., It is important not to underestimate the value of a good moisturizer. Not only does it help makeup go on more smoothly, but it can also help prevent breakouts and prevent wrinkles and lines. If you have dry skin, applying moisturizer will also keep your skin from getting flaky and itchy.Allow your moisturizer to soak into your skin for a few minutes before moving on in your makeup routine.

, Before you begin applying your makeup, it is always a good idea to apply a good primer to your skin. It absorbs excess oil and creates a smooth layer for your makeup to go on. It also helps makeup last longer by providing a layer of makeup that foundation and powder can stick to.If you have a lot of redness skin, you can even find primers that are green in color. Green helps wash out the red so you get a more even skin tone.

, It can be easy to put off cleaning your makeup brushes, but it is a task that should not be neglected. Using dirty makeup brushes means that you are spreading the bacteria in your brushes all over your face. This can lead to breakouts. In addition to that, using dirty brushes makes it more difficult to get a clean, polished look.In some cases, using a dirty brush can even lead to infections such as pink eye.

, Apply your blush directly to the apples of your cheeks in a circular motion to soften angular features and also draw attention to the most round part of your face.







, Light pink and peach tend to be the best on lighter skin because they are the most natural-looking blush colors. Anything sheer, especially plum, also works well on fair skin because it’s on the translucent side and not so overwhelming in contrast., Apricot is great for adding a subtle warming effect to those with medium skin tones while mauve provides a more bold sense of depth., Rose provides just the right delicate, natural flush for olive skin. Bronze blush adds a little warmth while also brightening., Bold colors like raisin or brick highlight darker skin tones the best without looking too over-the-top. For a neutral look, try a bright tangerine blush., Powder blush is a good go-to because it works well on nearly all skin types, goes on silky, and leaves a matte finish. Also, powder blush is very likely to stay on and not need reapplication over longer periods of time., Cream blush can hydrate your skin to keep it from looking too dry. It tends to look a little dewy when applied and feels very lightweight, which helps in providing a more authentic blush look."

, When your lips are chapped, avoid the temptation to lick them constantly or pick at them. These two common habits just make the situation worse. Licking your lips may bring temporary relief, but as the saliva on your lips evaporates, it dries out your lips. Picking at the skin on your lips may lead to bleeding, an infection, or a cold sore.

If you feel the urge to lick or pick at your lips, immediately apply a lip balm instead.
Reapply lip balm or ointment after drinking or rinsing out your mouth.







, Before applying any sort of ointment, remove the dead skin using an exfoliation method. This will expose the fresh skin and help your lips start to heal. Don't rub your lips too harshly - that could make things worse. Gently massage them. You can exfoliate your lips using the same items you use to exfoliate other areas on your body. Try one of the following:


Use a salt or sugar scrub. Apply the scrub to your lips and massage them in a circular motion, rubbing away the dead skin (you can also try using sugar added to a little olive oil as an exfoliant). Your lips should feel soft and renewed.
Use an exfoliating brush. The easiest brush to use in this case might be your toothbrush! Just make sure it's clean. Any other small, soft-bristle brush will also do. Rub it over your lips in a circular motion to remove dead skin.
Don't use a soap-based exfoliant. Face wash with scrubbing beads and other soap-based exfoliants will dry out your lips further.

, Be careful which over-the-counter ointment or lip balm (e.g. Chapstick) you use to heal your cracked lips. Many contain ingredients (e.g. camphor or petroleum jelly) that make lips feel better temporarily, but which may actually dry out your lips even more, forcing you to reapply them again and again.


Look for a lip balm that contains beeswax, shea butter, coconut butter, almond oil, or other natural moisturizers - and not much else. Don't choose a lip balm with an extra-long list of ingredients you can't pronounce.
A vitamin E or glycerin-based ointment containing other natural ingredients could also be helpful.Avoid using lipstick to moisturize your lips. Lipstick can be drying - you need a protective ointment underneath.

, For an ultra-moisturizing lip treatment, rub a little oil on your lips. It will sooth and moisturize your lips while also protecting them from further damage. Use natural moisturizers made from nut oils and seed butters. Here are some examples:


Coconut oil
Almond oil
Jojoba oil
Olive oil
Cocoa or shea butter
Rosehip oil

, If your lips are so cracked that it hurts to smile, try soothing them with a home remedy that will make them feel better. Here are a few suggestions:


Rubbing a cucumber slice on your lips daily for about 10 minutes is also known to be effective.
Rubbing some aloe vera gel on your lips can be soothing.
Rubbing a little honey on your lips will moisturize them and make them feel better.

, These include cosmetics and heavily flavored lip balms. They can dry out your skin.

, Some people have an allergy to fluoride that not only affects their lips but can also cause other irritations in the mouth. Switch up your toothpaste and see if you notice a difference.

, Heating indoor spaces in the winter causes the air to dry out. Try installing a humidifier. This moistens up air in a room and ultimately moistens up your lips.

, Increase the amount of needed vitamins in your diet by eating better or taking supplements like vitamin pills.


Refrain from eating salty foods, which increase the urge to lick your lips.

, If you wake up in the morning with dry, cracked lips, it might be because your mouth was open while you slept. The air circulating in and out of your mouth all night can dry out your lips. See if changing your sleeping position helps.


Dry, chapped lips can also be caused by breathing through your mouth when you have a stuffy nose. Try to clear your nasal passages so you can breathe through your nose as much as possible.
Wearing a mouth guard, retainer or another device that causes your mouth to stay open could also be the culprit.
If you can't avoid sleeping with your mouth open, apply a good ointment before bed.

, Leaving your lips unprotected in a strong wind can cause damage. Spending time in a very dry place can cause your lips to dry out and crack. If your environment is the culprit, you'll need to take extra care to protect your lips when you go out.

, Just as the rest of your skin can be damaged by the sun, so can your lips. Yes, you can have sunburned lips, and they hurt! Treat sun damaged lips by applying aloe to help the burned skin heal more quickly. Use a lip balm with an SPF of at least 15.

, Anything you regularly put in contact with your lips can affect their condition. The chemicals in cigarettes, gum and processed snacks can cause your lips to become dry and cracked.

, Certain vitamins are critical to maintaining healthy skin and lips. These include Vitamins A, B, C, B2 (Riboflavin deficiency) and E. Make sure you're getting plenty of these vitamins to avoid cracked lips.

, Many cracked and dry lips are the result of negative reactions to ingredients in cosmetics and skin care products. Overusing some products can aggravate the very condition they are meant to alleviate.

Switch to a toothpaste that doesn't contain sodium lauryl sulphate. Sodium lauryl sulfate is the foaming agent found in most toothpastes; it can also aggravate mouth sores or ulcers and chapped lips.







, Certain medications cause dry or cracked lips as a side effect. If your condition coincides with beginning a new medication regimen, consult your doctor about this possibility.

, If none of the above seems to be the cause of your painful lips, they could also be a symptom of far more serious problems. Consult a doctor if you suspect that your lip pain originates with a seemingly unrelated ailment. Some possible illnesses could be:



Diabetes. If you have diabetes or a history of the condition in your family, this may be a cause of your lip pain.

Kawasaki Disease. A serious, but rare, blood disorder that is a cause of chronic dry lips.

Sjogren's Syndrome. A kind of autoimmune disease which can damage the tear ducts and similar glands is also a common cause of seriously cracked lips.

Macrocytosis. A blood condition where the average red blood cell size is increased to dangerous levels.

Sexually transmitted diseases. STD's, including HIV and other diseases, can be an underlying cause of chronic cracked lips.

For instance, you won’t use the same brush to achieve a heavier and more noticeable blush job than if you want to go for a soft and natural look.


Choose a precision brush if you want to apply more color and a heavier coat.Choose and angled brush for a lighter and softer coat.
Choose a fan brush to apply an ultra-lightweight dusting that requires minimal blending and allows for maximum coverage.;
, Swirl the tip of the brush around in the blush, then blow off the excess. When you have an oval face, the key to blush is a light and natural look that highlights the cheekbones.You can always apply more blush later if you want a bolder look, so start with a small amount.

, Hold the brush at the end to ensure that you only apply light pressure. Apply the blush to the apple of your cheek by making two circles with the brush.The apple of your cheek is the round part of your cheeks that form when you smile. Smile at yourself in the mirror to locate your apples.Don’t smile when your applying the blush, otherwise you may accentuate wrinkles or apply blush to the wrong spot.

, After you make the circles at your apples, continue with the brush to extend the line of blush along your cheekbones. Brush the blush onto your cheekbones at an angle, connecting the apples of your cheek with your temple.Make sure you apply the blush to the upper part of your cheekbone, rather than the bottom.Once you’ve swept the brush up to your temples, repeat the same path with the brush going back down to the apple of your cheek, so that you make two passes with the brush on your cheekbone.

, Without adding more blush to your brush, continue to make circles at your apples and then sweep up to your temples and back down again. This will blend the blush into your skin and your hairline.The trick with blush is not being able to tell where the color begins and ends, so proper blending is key. This will ensure a natural look that highlights your natural features and the shape of your face.

, Blush should always match your undertone, which is the natural color of your skin below the surface layer. Undertones can be warm, cool, or neutral, and you can pick the most flattering blush colors by finding ones that complement yours.Cool people burn easily in the sun, have blue veins on the inside of the wrist, and have green, grey, or blue eyes with black, brown, or blond hair.
Warm people tan in the sun, have green veins on the inside of the wrist, and have hazel, brown, or amber eyes with black, auburn, or strawberry blond hair.
Neutral people look good in both gold and silver, and have bluish-green veins on the inside of the wrist., Cool, warm, and neutral undertones refer to the colors below your surface skin, so different blush colors will either complement or clash with your undertone.


Cool undertones indicate pink, red, or bluish skin, so blush colors that will complement you include light pinks and reds.Warm undertones indicate peach, yellow, or golden skin, so opt for golden and peachy shades of blush.
Neutral undertones can have any skin shade below the surface, so choose blush based on yours.

, There are three different types of blush, and they are suitable for different skin types and textures. The three blush types are powders, creams, and gels or stains.


Choose powder blush if you have oily skin, because the powder will help to absorb oil and won’t add extra liquid to your face.
Opt for cream blush if you have dry skin, because the cream will add some extra moisture to your face and won’t dry your skin out further.
Gel blushes can be used by people with any skin type.
For people who don’t have smooth skin and have lots of texture from things like scarring or acne, opt for matte blush types rather than shimmery ones., There are multiple face shapes out there, and knowing what yours is can help you determine the hair cuts, eyebrow shapes, and makeup styles that will be most flattering.


To figure out the shape of your face, you will need a ruler and calculator.
The most common face shapes include oval, heart, long, round, square, diamond, and pear., In a mirror, hold a ruler in front of your face to measure the basic length and width of your face, without taking into account the additional measurements added by protruding features like your nose. Take the basic measurements of your:Forehead, from one eyebrow arch to the other
Jawline, from the tip of your chin to the edge of your jaw (times two)
Face length, from the tip of your chin to the start of your hairline
Cheekbones, from the outside corner of one eye to the other (across the bridge of the nose)

, One of the easiest ways to determine the shape of your face is to look at the parts that are widest and longest.If your measurements are roughly equal, your face is likely square, round, or oval.
If your forehead is widest, you likely have a heart-shaped, or inverted triangle face.
When cheekbones are the widest, this generally indicates a diamond-shaped face.
A wider jaw often means a pear- or triangle-shaped face.
If the length measurement of our face was the largest, this is oblong.

, The shape of your jaw plays into the overall shape of your face, so you must consider this when determining the shape of your face.Rounded jaws mean a round or oval face
Strong and well-defined jaws often mean square, diamond, or triangle faces
Pointed chins indicate a diamond-shaped face

",How to Wear Blush," When choosing a blush color, it's important to pick one that matches your natural skin tone.


This means that the color you pick should be as close as possible to the color your cheeks turn when you're naturally flushed. Picking a color that doesn't match your skin tone can cause your blush to look unnatural and even garish.
A good tip for identifying your natural coloring is to make a tight fist with your hand for about ten seconds. The color that develops across your knuckles is the ideal color for your blush!
In general, pale skin tones will work best with light pink which mimics their natural flush. For a more dramatic look, peaches and mochas can work well.
Sallower skin tones will do best with orange or reddish-pink blushes which brighten the skin, adding a healthy glow.
Dark skin tones can get away with vivid oranges, pinks and reds which add a pop of life and color.;
, There are many different blush formulas on the market, including powder, cream, gel and liquid. The best option for you will depend on your skin type and personal preference.


Powder blush is good for oily to normal skin. It is also good for warmer temperatures, as it will not slide off the face.
Cream blush is good for drier skin as it is more hydrating. It also good for older skin, as it will not catch in fine lines and wrinkles like a powder.
Liquids and gels are great if you want to achieve a very exact and long-lasting application. Often these products can double up as a matching lip stain!

, You don't have to use a brush/sponge if you want you can use your fingers(but a brush would make it neater).Applying your blush will depend on the type of blush you're using:


Powder blushes are best applied with an angled blush brush or with a wide-headed loose powder brush.
Cream blushes are best applied with your fingers or with a medium-sized flat-topped brush.
Liquids and gels are best applied with your fingers or with a synthetic make-up wedge., It is important to apply your blush in a well-lit location, otherwise you might underestimate how much you've applied. Natural light is best, however a well-lit bathroom or a lighted make-up mirror will do just fine.

, Your blush should only be applied after primer and foundation. The primer helps to neutralize any redness and will keep your make-up looking fresh for longer, while the foundation evens out skin tone, providing a flawless finish.

, Although traditional blush application involves applying blush only to the apples of the cheeks, this advice does not work for everyone. Instead, you should take the shape of your face into account when you apply blush:



Round faces: To slim a round face, apply blush to your cheekbones (which you can find by sucking your cheeks in like a fish) and blend outwards and upwards towards the temple.

Long faces: To soften a long face, apply blush slightly below the apples of your cheeks (the roundest parts) but don't extend the blush any further.

Heart-shaped faces: To balance heart-shaped faces, apply blush beneath the apples of the cheeks and taper off towards the hairline.

Square faces: To soften a square-shaped face, apply the blush straight across your cheeks, beginning about an inch away from either side of your nose.

Oval faces: Oval faces can get away with just applying blush on the apples of their cheeks, and blending well around the edges. To find the apples of your cheeks, just smile!, The technique you use to apply your blush will vary according to the type of blush and application tool you're using.



Powder blush: To apply powder blush, lightly pound the brush into the powder, then tap the handle to remove any excess. Use a swirling motion to lightly apply the powder to your cheeks,

Cream blush: To apply cream blush, dab your flat-bottomed brush or fingers into the blush and lightly apply to the areas of your cheeks you wish to color. Then use a swirling motion to blend in the cream, working from the outside towards the center of your cheeks.

Liquid or gel: Use your fingers to apply two dots (no more) of the liquid or gel high on your cheek bones, then use your ring finger or a synthetic sponge to work the product into your cheeks using a dabbing motion., Most people are afraid of going overboard with their blush, so they tend to apply too little.


However, you want your blush to be somewhat obvious - it shouldn't just blend into your skin like foundation.
Just keep in mind that it's easier to add more blush than it is to take it away. Therefore, you should apply your blush little by little, adding additional layers until the color is just a shade or two past what you think looks natural.
If you accidentally apply too much, use a dry washcloth to buff away any excess color.

, To finish the look, get your hands on a translucent powder with a slight sheen.


Use a small brush to apply a little of the powder beneath the outer corners of your eyes, then use a swirling motion to blend it into the top edge of the blush.
This will highlight your cheekbones and help the blush to appear more natural. , Some people are confused about the difference between blush and bronzer and how each of them should be used.


Blush is used to add a pop of color and life to your cheeks, mimicking a natural blush, whereas bronzer is used to give a healthy, sun-kissed glow to the entire face.
To apply bronzer, use a powder brush to sweep a light layer over all the areas of the face that the sun would naturally touch - the forehead, the cheeks, the chin and the bridge of the nose.,"

Dry air is especially a problem in the winter, so set up one in your bedroom to keep your skin and lips moisturized., Some people have luck using a cucumber to help rehydrate their lips. Simply cut up a cucumber. Use the slices to hydrate your lips by holding them on for 5 to to 10 minutes. , When your lips are chapped, you end up with minor cracks, and aloe vera can help heal those. In addition, it can help soothe the pain of chapped lips.

Lip balms not only moisturize, they also protect your lips against the elements.Don't over-apply lip balm. This can cause a condition called perioral dermatitis, a facial rash that occurs around your lips.Limit yourself to once or twice a day.

If you frequently get chapped lips, use only products on them that have no fragrances or dyes.Toothpaste is another common culprit. If your lips itch, feel dry or painful, or blister after brushing your teeth, you may be allergic to the ingredients in your toothpaste.

Make some fake blood.,
Apply the blood below and around your nose.Dip the tip of a cosmetic sponge wand into your fake blood.,
Intensify the nosebleed.,
Dry the blood with a hair dryer, if desired.",How to Fake a Nose Bleed1," For this particular technique, you'll make a chocolate syrup based blood. By tinting the syrup with red dye and laundry detergent, you can create a brownish-red solution that mimics the appearance of real blood that has been out of the body and exposed to air for an extended period of time. The consistency of this blood also makes it easy to smear.In a small bowl, mix 2/3 cup (150 ml) chocolate syrup with 1/3 cup (75 ml) concentrated liquid laundry detergent until well combined.
Pour in 4 to 6 tsp (20 to 30 ml) of red food coloring, adding as much or as little as needed to create your desired hue.;
, Brush the blood onto your face, focusing on the area between your nose and your mouth. Cover the entire area, but make sure that the blood fans out from the nose toward the sides of your mouth. You should also apply blood to the bottom of the nose, directly along the sides of the nostrils.


A small, clean paintbrush could be used instead of a cosmetic sponge wand, if necessary.
Stand in front of a mirror as you apply the fake blood.
Play around with it a bit. There is no one pattern to use when creating a fake nosebleed, so you'll have to test a few looks out before deciding how you want the nosebleed to look.
Do not use straight lines. A real nosebleed is messy, so your fake blood needs to be applied accordingly.
You can also apply a little blood to the sides and tip of your nose if you want to create a more extreme nosebleed. Focus on the nostril area, though, and avoid getting blood higher up on the bridge.

, Since real nosebleeds are often so messy, you may need to extend the fake blood past the area of your nose in order to make it more believable. You can do so by applying a smear to one side of your mouth and a few drops to your neck.


Gauge which side of your nosebleed currently looks heavier. Brush on more fake blood around your mouth on that side of the face only, leaving the other side of your mouth untouched.
The blood should cover the corner of your mouth and just below your bottom lip.
Smear more blood downward and slanted off toward the side of your face, stopping at the base of your neck.
Apply a few dabs of blood to the base of your neck on the same side of your face. These dabs need to look like dried drips of blood that fell off from the trail of blood already along the side of your face.

, If you want the blood smears to look fresh, you can wear them as they already are. If you want to create the appearance of a nosebleed that has already dried, however, use a hair dryer set to low heat to dry the fake blood until it no longer feel wet to the touch.


Hold the hair dryer from a distance and point the stream of air directly against the blood smear. Avoid drying the smear from an angle since doing so could change the appearance of the smear.
Your fake nosebleed should be complete at the conclusion of this step.

Make some fake blood.,
Fill an eye dropper with the blood.,
Squeeze the blood out at the base of your nostril.",How to Fake a Nose Bleed2," Dripping blood is fresh and oxygenated, so you need a fake blood recipe that is more watery and a bit brighter than the fake blood used for dried smears. Light corn syrup can accomplish this effect. Adding corn starch thickens the mixture to the right consistency, and the addition of laundry soap makes the blood less likely to stain.


In a small bowl, mix together 2/3 cup (150 ml) light corn syrup, 1/3 cup (75 ml) warm water, 3 to 5 tsp (15 to 25 ml) red food coloring, 2 to 3 drops blue or green food coloring, 5 Tbsp (75 ml) cornstarch, and a squirt of liquid laundry soap. Continue mixing until evenly combined into a smooth mixture.
Note that you can adjust the amount of red food coloring as needed to achieve your desired shade.
If the blood seems too thin, add more cornstarch. If it seems too thick, add more water.

, Squeeze the tip of a clean, empty eye dropper and dunk the mouth of the dropper into your fake blood. Release the tip to draw the blood into the body of the dropper.


A syringe without a needle could also work if you do not have an eye dropper. Essentially, you just need a tool that you can use to control the application of fake blood. That tool must have a mouth that is small enough to fit into one nostril, however.

, Hold your heat straight and place the mouth of the dropper at the base of one nostril. Slowly squeeze the bulb so that fake blood comes out in a mild trickle. The blood should pour down from the base of your nostril to your mouth in an even stream.


To make the process easier, use a mirror when applying the blood.
Note that you may not use all of the fake blood inside the dropper. You only need to use enough fake blood to create one steady trail.
Do not squirt the blood directly into your nostril. The tip of the dropper should be on the outside of your nostril, at its very base. The body of the dropper should be pointed up and slanted off the one side.
Only apply the fake blood to one side of your nose for a more convincing nosebleed.
The conclusion of this step marks the end of this method.

Make some fake blood.,
Fill an eye dropper with the blood.,
Tilt your head back and squeeze the blood into your nose.,
Slowly draw air into your nose.Take slow, shallow inhales through your nose.,
Exhale through the nose.,
Use tropical fruit punch.,
Create fake blood using coffee.",How to Fake a Nose Bleed3," The fake blood you'll need to use for this technique is similar to the blood you might make for a standard running nosebleed, but you need to skip the addition of laundry detergent since this blood will be going directly inside your nose.


In a small bowl, thoroughly whisk or mix together 1 cup (250 ml) light corn syrup, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) water, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) red food coloring, 2 to 3 drops of green or blue food coloring, and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of cornstarch. Continue mixing until the cornstarch dissolves.Add more cornstarch for thicker blood and more water for thinner blood. Note that slightly thickened blood might be easier to hold in your nose, but it still needs to be watery enough to drip down naturally.
If the blood looks a little too red to be realistic, add a few more drops of blue or green food coloring to create a subtle brown tint.

, Squeeze the bulb of the dropper to expel all the air in the tube and dip the tip into your fake blood. Release the bulb so that fake blood is drawn into the body of dropper.


A syringe or similar tool could be used instead of the dropper, but the tip must be small enough to fit into one of your nostrils.

, Stand in front of a mirror and tilt your head back slightly, just enough to make your nostrils visible in the mirror. Insert the tip of the dropper into your nostril and slowly squeeze the bulb, releasing the fake blood into your nose.


This step should be done simultaneously with the following step.
Do not inhale sharply as you squeeze the fake blood into your nose.

, Sniff enough to draw the blood into the upper part of your nostril without inhaling too sharply and drawing it further into your sinus cavities.


This part will likely take some practice to master. A little too much sniffling makes it look like you have a runny nose. Sniffing too much too quickly can cause the fake blood to escape into your sinus passages, which could cause a harsh stinging sensation. Not sniffling enough will cause the blood to release from your nose prematurely.
You will need to continually breath in to keep the fake blood in place, so even if you master the technique, you can only hold it there for a minute or so.

, When you are ready to create your nosebleed, stop inhaling and gently exhale through the nose. Without the suction provided from your inhale, the blood should be released and should come trickling out of your nostril in a steady, believable stream.


Do not exhale with too much force since doing so could cause the fake blood to gush out of your nose too quickly.
The completion of this step marks the completion of this method.

, Select a fruit punch with a deep red hue. As is, this recipe works well for any dripping nosebleed technique, but you can also add a little more cornstarch if you want to make it thick enough for smears or dried blood.

Combine 1/2 cup (125 ml) tropical fruit punch with 1 cup (250 ml) corn syrup, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) red food coloring, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chocolate syrup, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cornstarch, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) powdered cocoa. Blend the ingredients in a blender for about 10 seconds, or until evenly mixed.
Note that every fruit punch varies slightly in shade, so you may need to adjust the color. Add more red food coloring to brighten the blood or more chocolate syrup to dull the blood.

, Brewed coffee provides a strong enough brown tint to realistically dull the shade of your fake blood. This recipe is best used for dripping nosebleeds, but if you add more cornstarch, you can thicken it enough to use for smears.

In a blender, combine 1/2 cup (125 ml) brewed coffee, 1 cup (250 ml) light corn syrup, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) red food coloring, and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cornstarch. Blend for 10 seconds or until evenly mixed.

Look for a career services department that can help you with job placement upon completion. In addition, they can help with an apprenticeship that allows you to work and gain on-the-job training while still in school.Makeup schools are typically privately owned and cost anywhere from $7,000 to $17,000. Ask about government financial aid options or loan programs offered directly by the school.Courses can take anywhere from 1 month to 8 months depending on the curriculum and licensing requirements.;
, Every state has different requirements to become a licensed makeup artist. Some states have specialized licenses for a specific field, while others require a full cosmetology certification. Some states don’t regulate the cosmetics field at all. Visit your state’s cosmetology board to determine license requirements.Makeup licensing programs can run anywhere from 300-600 hours (less than 6 months). Cosmetology programs require 1500-2000 hours and take anywhere from 12 to 24 months to complete.

, Learning about what happens on set will give you an air of professionalism and experience. Learn about where to stand, whether or not you’re allowed to talk to the director, and to whom you report. In addition, you should learn about each department, different crew members, and who does what.You can learn production basics from a variety of sources including searching the web, downloading PDFs, signing up for local film making workshops, or taking film making classes (especially if this is one of your hobbies)., Practice applying makeup as often as you can. Try out new techniques on your friends and family, or draw out looks on paper to improve speed, accuracy and detail. Anytime you have free time, try creating new looks or try newly learned skills to continue building your repertoire. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect..

, While makeup artists are needed in every state, the best career opportunities for film makeup artists are in California. Not only is this where the majority of films are made or produced, but some makeup schools guarantee job placement upon graduation.Not only does moving afford you more job opportunities, but it also gives you the ability to network with people within the movie industry.

, Landing a job in the entertainment industry isn’t always about talent, it’s also about who you know. It takes a lot of patience to build up your contact list one person at a time, but it is worth it. Try hanging out at places where industry people often go, send emails to important people, use your social media to build contacts, and always keep a business card with you.Film crews usually like using the same people for all of their projects, so it’s important to always put your best foot forward anytime you are around industry people, whether you’re working or just networking.There are also various unions, groups, and associations for professional makeup artists that will help with networking and meeting the right people.

, A portfolio is a collection of photos that demonstrate your skill level and abilities to your client. You should always keep a physical book with still shots for interviews, but you can also create digital portfolios as slideshows, YouTube videos, and more.Always include your best pieces that demonstrate a wide range of abilities and techniques.


You can always ask photographers on set for still shots to add to your portfolio.
Also keep digital copies of all photos in your portfolio. This will allow you to share your photos with directors and producers who show interest in your portfolio.

, Film makeup artists are required to work with a lot of people and a lot of personalities, so it’s important to be cordial, levelheaded, patient, and adaptable.Focus on interpersonal skills such as listening and understanding others’ perspectives, being cooperative, and having a keenness towards others’ personalities.


Be quiet and listen. Instead of thinking about your response, be present in the moment and genuinely focus on what the other person is telling you.
Watch your tone. Sometimes it’s not about what you say but how you say it. For example, “I can’t believe you did that” expresses surprise or praise, whereas “I can’t believe you did that” (emphasis on you) has a condescending tone.

, Making it in the film industry guarantees that you’ll be working with some of the biggest directors, producers, and actors/actresses in the industry. Your clients need to know that you can be trusted with confidential information. A lot can take place on set and in makeup trailers so avoid the urge to share every tidbit of information with friends, family, or media., Being thorough, meticulous, and careful is a must. As a self-employed individual, you must learn how to manage yourself as a business. Skills needed include time management, computer abilities, creating and managing budgets, organizational skills, and logistics.


For example, as a self-employed individual you have to make sure to manage your time well by keeping up with appointments, scheduling time for networking, and making sure you return phone calls and emails in a timely manner.Makeup artists also have to be extremely self-motivated, especially when gigs don’t seem to be pouring in. The reality is that you don’t get paid unless you work, so always motivate yourself to strive for excellence and remind yourself that you’re lucky enough to be doing what you love to do.

, Blacklisted means that a makeup artist is denied work or shut out of the industry due to their negative reputation. This could stem from a number of reasons including shoddy work, unprofessionalism, lack of discretion, or burning bridges. The most common reason for blacklisting is “walking” during filming, or leaving the set before production is complete. Always remain professional on set and see the job through to completion.Avoid behaviors such as being under the influence of substances, sleeping with the crew or actors, and having a bad attitude.
Arrive to set on time every time so you don’t waste anyone’s time. For example, in a 5 minute period, a director can squeeze in at least 10 extra takes. If you’re late, you can cost the director more than just time.Always be willing to learn. Admitting that you don’t know everything will keep you from appearing smug or arrogant.

Select a shade that matches your skin tone, but look for an option with yellow or gray undertones. That will give your complexion a sallow look, which can help you appear older.If you can’t tell whether a foundation has yellow or gray undertones, try holding it up against a white piece of paper or fabric to look for any yellow or gray tones. If you still can’t tell, ask a sales clerk at the store for help.;
, Dip a brush or damp makeup sponge into the foundation, but instead of blending it over your face, use a stippling motion, which involves bouncing the brush or sponge over the skin to apply it. That will emphasize your skin’s pores and natural texture, so it appears rougher and older./images/thumb/6/6c/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-2-Version-2.jpg

, Choose a cream foundation that’s one to two shades darker than your skintone to create depth for the creases that you’ll create. Use a small brush to smooth the dark foundation over areas that you want to add wrinkles, such as your forehead, beside your eyes, or the creases from the sides of your nose to your mouth./images/thumb/7/7f/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-3-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/7/7f/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-3-Version-2.jpg









Keep your skin flat as you apply the darker foundation.
Use a clean finger to blend the edges of the foundation in well so the transition is seamless.

, Use a loose translucent powder to set the darker foundation in the areas that you’ve applied it. Press it lightly over the spots with a small powder brush to lock the makeup in place./images/thumb/9/97/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-4-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/97/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-4-Version-2.jpg








, With the dark makeup set on your face, smile in an exaggerated fashion to create creases around your eyes, across your forehead, any anywhere else you applied the dark base. Use a small makeup sponge to pat a cream foundation that’s one to two shades lighter than the your skin tone over the dark foundation in the creases that form when you smile./images/thumb/a/a3/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-5-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/a/a3/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-5-Version-2.jpg









For the best results, be sure to use a clean sponge to pat on the makeup. Don’t rub it on either, or you won’t get the proper effect.
If you need the effect to be very dramatic for a performance in a large theater, use dark and light foundation shades that are more than a couple of shades darker or lighter than your skin tone.

, After you’ve applied the light foundation to highlight the creases and wrinkles, dust the same translucent powder you used to set the darker foundation over your entire face to lock all of the makeup in place. Don’t worry about applying too much powder; it will only give your face more texture so it appears rough and old./images/thumb/1/17/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-6-Version-2.jpg

, The small indentation between your eyebrows at the top of your nose is known as the superciliary arch, and it tends to get darker as your age. Use a small shadow brush to dust a brown shadow over the arch, and dust a light highlight shade down the center of the nose to create the narrowing that usually occurs as you get older./images/thumb/3/3c/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-7-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3c/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-7-Version-2.jpg









For shading and highlighting your face to appear older, always use matte powders. Shimmery shades won’t look natural.
Choose a brown powder for shading that has gray undertones to create the most natural look.

, As you get older, you usually use volume in the face so your cheeks take on a sunken appearance. To mimic the look, use a small contour brush to apply the same brown powder you used on the arch of your nose beneath your cheekbones to make your face look more angular./images/thumb/4/46/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-8-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/4/46/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-8-Version-2.jpg









While you should blend out the edges of the contour line so it doesn’t just look like a stripe on your cheek, you should apply it more heavily than you would if you were contouring for every day. That will help it stand out when you’re on stage.

, As you age, the loss of volume in your face makes the creases that run from either side of the nose down to the mouth, or the nasolabial folds, become much more pronounced. Use a small fluffy brush to dust the brown contour powder through them so they look deeper. /images/thumb/c/c8/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-9-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/c/c8/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-9-Version-2.jpg









As with the cheek contour, you should blend the edges of the nasolabial fold lines well but still leave the shading dark and pronounced.
You can make the nasolabial fold lines appear even deeper by using the matte highlight shade over the top lip and blending it out to the creases.
You may also want to add a little of the brown powder to the corners of your mouth, so it looks like it’s starting to droop.

, The chin is another area that usually gets more angular as you age. Mimic the look by using a small fluffy brush to dust the brown contour powder through the groove or crease in the center of your chin fold added shadow./images/thumb/8/89/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-10-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/8/89/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-10-Version-2.jpg









Applying a dusting of the light highlight shade to the bottom part of your chin can help make it look even more angular.

, With a fluffy eyeshadow brush, apply some of the brown powder beneath your eyes. Start at the inner corner and blend the powder into the natural groove there. That will help your eyes appear more sunken, emphasize fine lines, and give you a more tired look./images/thumb/0/01/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-11-Version-2.jpg

While you can use the same matte brown contour powder that you used on the rest of the face, you may want to opt for a brown with reddish undertones beneath the eye. The skin around the eyes -- and the corners of the nose -- often gets red as you age so that can help you appear older.

, To emphasize the cracks and dryness in your lips, it helps to add a little foundation over them. Dot a small amount of the foundation you use on your face on a clean finger and gently it pat it over your lips. Blot with a tissue afterward to ensure that your lips appear dry./images/thumb/b/b4/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-12-Version-2.jpg

, While a gray wig can help make you appear older, you’ll need to do some work on your eyebrows. Use an angled brow brush to apply a gray powder to your brows so the color appears faded. You can use a gray brow pencil or pomade if you prefer./images/thumb/e/ef/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-13-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/ef/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-13-Version-2.jpg









A white brow powder, pencil, or pomade can also work well.
If you don’t have a wig to wear, you can also brush some of the powder through your roots to make yourself appear older.

, Depending on the character that you’re playing, you may look more convincing as an older person if you fake one or more missing teeth. Use black tooth makeup wax to cover a couple of your front teeth so it appears that they’ve been lost due to old age./images/thumb/2/24/Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Stage-Makeup-to-Look-Old-Step-14-Version-2.jpg

Finished.",How to Do Stage Makeup for Ballet," Foundation evens out your complexion and reduces the shadows caused by the lights. Be sure to blend it under the chin, on the neck, around the ears, and on the top of your lips.


Choose the right kind of foundation. You could wear a self-setting pancake foundation, or a cream foundation that has to be set with powder. Do not wear liquid ––it isn't strong enough for performing. If you use pancake, don't use cream blushes and shadows, but powders.
Choose the right color. If your director is going for a specific look––pale and ethereal Swan Lake for example––follow that. If not, experiment to figure out what works for your skin type.;
, If you are a guy, shave at least 60 minutes before applying makeup, preferably in the morning for an evening show. If you are a woman, get your hair out of your face. You can choose whether to do your hair before or after--would you rather try to do your makeup without messing up your hair, or your hair without messing up your makeup? It's a matter of preference., Wash your face to be sure the makeup will go on smoothly and evenly. Remove excess dirt and oil, and apply a moisturizer suited to your skin type., Use one a shade or two lighter than your foundation. Also use it as a shadow base on lids and set with powder.

, Use a dark eyebrow pencil to highlight the natural line with small strokes. Concentrate on the upper brow, and remember that a solid line looks fake.

, Start with a base shadow over the entire eyelid, darker near the eyelash line. If you use two or more colors, the darkest should go near the eye, medium just above the crease, and lightest underneath the brow. Then line the top of your lashes, beginning at the inner corner, and line the bottom, gently pressing along the lash line. Liner should start and end where the lashes begin and end; avoid making harsh solid lines. Make sure that the top and bottom lines meet in the outer corners.

, If you have to wear false eyelashes, put them on now. If you don't have to, use an eyelash curler and then apply clear mascara and at least two coats of black mascara.


Apply a thin strip of eyelash adhesive to the band of your false eyelashes and press gently onto eyes, as close to natural line as possible. Press against closed eyes for at least 20 seconds. If needed, trim the lashes at the band, not the lashes. Then use an eyelash curler, starting at the root of the lashes. Squeeze and hold for 15 seconds, then repeat, working toward the ends. Finish with a coat of black mascara.

, Begin by exfoliating the lips with a washcloth rubbed in a circular motion. Start with a clear lip balm. If you are a man, apply a lip color close to your natural shade. For women, line the outside of the lips, color in with the same liner, and use your brush to apply lipstick over it. Press down with a tissue placed between the lips to blot away excess, Smile and apply blush to the apples of the cheeks. Sweep upward and outward towards the hairline.

",How to Apply Makeup on Yourself for a Show," Make sure you have a good well-lit mirror, cotton wool pads, make-up brushes, make-up sponges and make-up remover, just in case you make a mistake. While you're working, remember to sit back and judge the effects of your work at a distance from time to time: your audience won't be looking at you from two feet away.;
, Bear in mind that stage lighting tends to shine right through make-up and make the skin underneath visible despite your make-up application. You will probably have to use far more make-up than usual. If necessary for the role, contouring to change face shape should be done at this stage--highlighting cheekbones, increasing eye depth, narrowing or attaching little importance the nose, highlighting a weak chin, emphasizing less on a lantern jaw, adding age lines.

, The variety of effects possible are too numerous to mention here but, in general, dark colors around the eye increase the perceived depth of the eye socket and light colors have the reverse effect.

, Paint on lipstick using a lip brush. Blot to remove excess but leave the stain, then reapply the lipstick and blot lightly once more. This ensures thorough and longer-lasting coverage.

, It may sound a little bit odd applying this last but waiting until all your other make-up is done can help you judge how much you need.

, This is powder without color, used just for setting make-up. Some actors even recommend a light misting of aerosol hairspray to set your make-up but if you'll be sweating, this can lead to skin issues.

, Letting heavy theatrical make-up sit on your face for hours is bad for your skin. A good start for getting most of your make-up off is boxed baby wipes--handy and effective. But follow that with a make-up remover specifically for eyes and a thorough cleansing of the entire face. Finish with a toner/astringent and a moisturizer.

This is easiest if you already have vision problems and need corrective lenses, but you can also order non-prescription contacts from specialty shops and online stores.;
, Most versions of the Alexandria's Genesis story do not say what color the hair should be but some say that dark (black or brown) hair is most common. If you want to, you can dye your hair a darker color. You should also take excellent care of it so it looks beautiful. Frizzy black hair that looks like it hasn't been brushed is a no no. Use good shampoo and conditioner, brush your hair with the right kind of comb or brush for your hair type, and maintain your hair to avoid the appearance of split ends.

, First, take very good care of your skin to reduce acne. Wash, exfoliate, and moisturize daily. Then you can use lemon juice or a mild bleach intended for use on the face to lighten your skin. You can also buy creams at a local drug store which are intended to lighten your skin.


You can also get some lotion or body spray with a little very fine glitter (or ""shimmer"") in it to give your skin the sparkle look described for those with Alexandria's Genesis.

, One of the ""symptoms"" of Alexandria's Genesis is that people who have it cannot become overweight. Eat healthy and exercise to keep your own weight down. A balanced diet (rich in vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, and low in fats and sugar) can help a lot, plus it keeps you actually healthy and feeling great!

, Those with Alexandria's Genesis are supposed to be free of hair everywhere except for their head. Reduce the appearance of shaving by using a salt or sugar scrub before, after, and periodically in between shaving sessions. You can also wax if you prefer, although this is painful. Use lotions which heal the skin, like Bag Balm, to keep it healthy as shaving is very harsh on your skin.

, Try to make your menstrual cycle less noticeable by being discreet when you need to change a pad or tampon. You can also actually get rid of your menstrual cycle by getting a hormonal IUD or taking birth control pills and skipping the placebos.

, Being healthy in general strengthens your immune system. Get your shots and stay germ free so you don't ever get sick. Eat lots of fruit or take supplements to get your vitamin C, get vitamin D to help your body absorb the C, use zinc drops if you feel a cold coming on, and use hand sanitizer when you're out in public to avoid contracting illnesses.

, Stay healthy, safe, in shape, get checkups, treat illnesses, anything to make you live longer. Try to live past 100. If in the future they come up with a miracle pill that extends your life and is proven to work, take it!

, You can also lie about your age, making it seem as if you're much older than you really are. Learn about history and culture from the recent years past and talk about it as if you were there. You can listen to music, learn about fashion...even buy antiques which you can swear you bought new!

, Although you can't really not produce waste, just don't do it in public. Only in the privacy of your home may you fart, poop, or pee. Of course, if you really need to go, don't strain yourself. Just excuse yourself to ""touch up your lipstick"" or something else that requires a bathroom.

, Now, the legend explains that Alexandria's Genesis began with a light shining in the sky over Egypt a thousand years ago. In reality, Alexandria's Genesis was created when a young woman named Cameron Miquelon wrote a fanfiction (fan-written story for an existing media) for a 1990s MTV television show called ""Daria"".

, The symptoms include:


White skin that doesn't tan or burn
Purple eyes
Sometimes dark hair, but certainly no hair anywhere but the head
No menstruation but preserved fertility
Lifespans over 150 years and immunity from disease
No weight gain
No digestive waste

, Supposedly Alexandria's Genesis is a genetic mutation. However, the genes which affect these various parts of the body are not located in the same area. Only a number of mutations could result in so many symptoms, some of which are not even possible. Though it is possible to be fertile without menstruation (as some animals completely re-absorb their uterine lining instead), no lifetime over 150 years has ever been recorded and digestive waste would always be produced.


As for reports that people, such as Elizabeth Taylor, have been born with purple eyes, this is not true. There are many photographs and films that show Elizabeth's eyes to be blue. It is possible to have purple eyes in the case of incomplete albinism, but it is extremely rare.

, There are many ways to lighten your skin. You aren't limited to bleaching if you want to take a more natural, safe approach.

, Even if it is just to pretend to have this condition, getting in better shape is a great life choice. However, it's not totally intuitive. You can learn how to exercise properly to protect your body and achieve the results you want, however.

, Shaving is more complex than it seems. If you've never really shaved before, especially in really delicate areas, it may be a good idea to get some help.

Step back from the mirror and look at yourself.",How to Apply Stage Makeup," Clean and moisturized skin provides a smooth base for your makeup and helps it last longer during a performance. Wash your face thoroughly, then pat your skin dry with a soft towel. Apply a good moisturizer all over your face and neck, followed by a light, colorless balm on your lips.









For dry skin, try an exfoliating cleanser to smooth out flaky areas.
If you have oily skin, use a an alcohol-free toner after you wash, then apply moisturizer.;
, Use a sponge or brush to apply foundation to your entire face. Choose a shade that matches your skin tone or, if you’re very pale, you may want to go one shade darker. Use makeup with a warm, yellowish undertone, since stage lights tend to be cool in tone. Blend well around your hairline, temples and jaw so that everything looks even.








Oil-free foundation will keep your skin looking matte onstage.
Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to slather on the foundation. Apply just enough to even out your skin tone.Opt for waterproof cream foundations, which do well under stage lights.You can also use cake makeup, which is formulated for the stage., Apply blush from the middle of your cheeks (just outside the center of your eyes) to your ears with a fluffy brush. Aim for the area just below your cheekbone, which is the “hollow” of your cheek. This contours your cheekbones and makes them stand out onstage. Blend the blush in well.








In general, women should go with a rosy shade. For men, go with a shade or two lighter than that.
If you're concerned about your blush running under the stage lights, use a cream formula., Select a neutral eyeshadow that is 1-2 shades paler than your skin tone. Use an eyeshadow brush to apply the palest color just beneath your eyebrows. You can use the same color on your lids, or you can use an eyeshadow that is one shade darker. Blend both areas well.








Cream formulas work well for eye makeup, especially under hot stage lights., Use an eyeshadow brush to apply a dark neutral color, like brown, to the area between the brow and lid, where the skin creases. Be sure to blend the eyeshadow well so there are no hard lines.








Depending on the performance, you may be asked to use a brighter color in the crease. If nothing is specified, a neutral brown shade works well.

, Pencil and liquid liners both work, as long as they're waterproof. Start at the inner corner and draw a firm, thin line along your upper lash line to the outer edge of your eye. Don’t make the line too thick, unless your role calls for a dramatic look. Make sure the lines are even and both eyes match.








Brown and black both work, but black liner will give you more definition. For a more natural look, men may want to go with brown.Optionally, you can apply a white eyeliner pencil to your lower waterline, which makes the eyes look brighter and whiter.

, Aim for 1-2 coats of mascara on the upper lashes and a single light coat on the bottom lashes.Put the wand at the base of your lashes, press lightly, then move it along the lashes to the tips.









You can use brown or black mascara, but black provides more definition. Brown works best for men, since it defines the eyes without being too drastic.Make sure you use waterproof mascara, or it could run once you start to sweat beneath the bright stage lights.

, For more dramatic roles, you may want to opt for black, but dark brown is a good neutral choice for everyone. Fill in any patchy areas so that your eyebrows appear firm and full. Use the pencil to enhance the natural arch of your brow, which will help to frame your face.







, Lip liner helps your lipstick stay in place and can prevent it from bleeding outside the lip line. It also gives your mouth a lot more definition than lipstick alone. Draw a firm, dark line that follows the natural shape of your lips – you don’t need to go outside the lip line unless your role calls for an emphasized mouth.








Avoid doing a nude lip onstage, or your mouth will look non-existent.
Lip color requirements usually vary, depending on your role. Most men use a more natural shade. Check with your director if you’re unsure.

, Follow the natural shape of your lips and fill them in with a lipstick that matches your lip liner. Choose a long-lasting formula, such as a liquid lipstick or a lip stain, since you probably won’t get an opportunity to reapply during your performance.









Try to avoid creamy formulas, since they don’t have a lot of staying power. These can fade fast, leaving you with dark lip liner and pale lips., Use a fluffy kabuki brush for this, which will give you an even dusting. Dip the brush into the container of powder, then tap it on the edge of the sink or counter to get rid of the excess. Apply one layer of the powder all over your face and neck. This will “set” your makeup, and help it stay in place during your performance.








If you're involved in a vigorous performance and worried about keeping your makeup in place, try misting your face with a setting spray before you apply the powder., Your makeup should have an exaggerated look to combat the bright stage lighting. The audience will see you from different distances and angles. The people in the front will see you very clearly, so you want to look natural to them. The people who are in the nosebleeds must be able to see your expressions, so stage makeup will help you to accomplish this.

Keep your skin clear.",How to Look Like You Are Wearing Makeup," Instead of mascara, take a bit of lip balm (flavoured works best) on your index finger and thumb and run it through your eyelashes. This will darken and lengthen your eyelashes, and over time, it will increase their actual length. You can use petroleum jelly instead of lip balm.;
, This will create a shiny, shimmery effect. You can also make the eyes themselves look bigger and brighter by wearing circle contact lenses.


Do not use fragrant or colored lotion, only plain lotion suitable for sensitive skin. Discontinue if it causes any problems. Do not get in your eyes.

, Instead of eyeshadow, you can apply baby powder to your lids. Most baby powders are white, so if you think white eye shadow will look good on you, then you can give it a shot! Subtly apply it, and it will look like eyeshadow.


The powder's effect may start through fade throughout the day.

, Lip balm works just as well as most lip glosses and will leave your lips moisturized. Make sure you don't apply too much though, as it can cause acne or irritation on the skin surrounding your lips. (If you are allowed to wear a bit of lip gloss, apply it over a thin coat of lip balm. This will cause it to stay shiny for longer)

, Instead of having to use a concealer to hide skin irritation, ask your dermatologist or a pharmacist at a local drugstore about different medications or cleansers that will help keep your skin clear. Make sure that the kind of cleanser you use is for your skin type (oily, dry, sensitive), keep a consistent skin care routine, and remember to moisturize every night

That will help your makeup go on more smoothly so it looks naturally flawless. Pre-teen and teen skin is usually oily, so choose an oil-free product and apply it approximately 5 minutes before you do your makeup.It’s important to protect your skin from sun damage too, so you may want to use a moisturizer that has an SPF of at least 15. You can also use a separate sunscreen product if you prefer. Apply it after the moisturizer and give it 5 minutes to sink into your skin before applying any makeup.
If your skin looks too shiny after applying your moisturizer, use a tissue to blot your face before moving onto your makeup.;
, It’s common for pre-teens and teens to have breakouts, so you may have some spots that you want to conceal. Dab concealer just on those spots, and blend it with a clean finger or concealer brush.Make sure to choose a concealer that matches your skin tone as closely as possible. Otherwise, you’ll only wind up drawing attention to the areas that you’re trying to hide.
As with your moisturizer, choose a concealer that’s oil-free. If you have acne, you may also want to look for one that contains acne-fighting ingredients, such as salicylic acid, to help fight the breakout while concealing it.
If you’re using a stick concealer or one that features an applicator that is stored inside the tube, don’t apply the concealer directly from the container to your face. Dab some on your finger or a brush, so you don’t spread bacteria from your acne to the concealer itself.

, When you’re going for a natural makeup look that you can wear to school, heavy foundation is a big no-no. If you feel like your skin still needs some more coverage after using concealer, use a light tinted moisturizer or BB cream to even out your skin tone. Apply it with clean fingers to keep the coverage light.Make sure that your tinted moisturizer or BB cream is oil-free so it’s less likely to clog your pores.
If your skin is extremely oily, you may want to skip a general moisturizer and just use a tinted version so you can moisturize and even out your complexion in one step.
While tinted moisturizers and BB creams are usually more sheer than traditional foundations, it’s still important to choose a shade that matches your skin tone. Test it by blending a small amount across your cheek, and checking it in natural light to see if it’s a match.
Even if you’re using a sheer tinted moisturizer or BB cream, make sure to blend it over your jawline and down onto your neck. You don’t want to wind up with a line across your jaw where your makeup ends.

, Because your skin is probably on the oily side, you should set your concealer and other face products with an oil-absorbing powder. Apply it over any areas where you used concealer, tinted moisturizer, and/or BB cream to set it, as well as over your forehead, nose, and chin, also known as the t-zone, where your skin tends to be most oily.Opt for a translucent powder that won’t add much color and coverage to your face so your look stays natural.
Apply the powder with a fluffy brush. That will diffuse the product so your face doesn’t look cakey or powdery.
If your skin is relatively even, you may want to skip a tinted moisturizer or BB cream and use a powder foundation to set your concealer. It offers more coverage than a translucent powder, but is still light enough to look natural.

, When you want a natural makeup look, there’s no need to fill in your brows with a pencil or powder. Instead, just brush a clear brow gel through your brows so they look neat and trim. The gel will also help keep them in place all day.If you feel like your brows need some filling in, you can swap your clear brow gel for a tinted version that matches your brow color. It will look more natural than a brow pencil or powder.

, Eye shadow isn’t really necessary for a natural look, but if you want to add a little color to your lids, keep it soft. Choose a shadow that is close in color to your skin tone, but has a slightly shimmery finish so it will catch the light. Apply it across your lid, staying below your crease.You can use the sponge-tip applicator that comes with your eyeshadow, a brush, or even your fingertip to apply it. However, for the most natural look, use a fluffy shadow brush to apply it. The color will appear more sheer, so your eyes look soft and subtle.

, When you’re young and trying to achieve a natural look, eyeliner is usually too much. That’s especially true if you use harsh black liquid or pencil liner, which can actually make your eyes look smaller. Instead, ditch the eyeliner so your eyes look fresh and bright.If you feel like your eyes really need some extra definition, try using powdered eyeshadow as liner for a much softer, more natural look. Dip an angled brush into a brown, gray, or navy shadow, and run it as close to your upper lash line as possible.

, Even if you don’t wear any shadow, you can draw attention to your eyes by using a little mascara. Black mascara is the traditional choice, but you might prefer brown for a softer look. You can even use clear mascara if you just want to define your lashes without darkening them.A single layer of mascara is all you need for some definition. If you apply too much, your lashes may start to clump together and ruin the natural look.
It’s a good idea to choose a waterproof mascara, particularly if you’re wearing makeup to school. That way, if you start to sweat in gym class or at soccer practice, your mascara won’t run under your eyes.

, Everyone looks a little healthier with some color in their cheeks. If your cheeks aren’t naturally flushed, dust a little blush on the apples of your cheeks. Choose a sheer, matte shade that complements your skin tone for a natural look.To find the apples of your cheeks, smile -- apply the blush to the fleshy part of your cheek, blending up toward your hairline.
For fair skin, choose a light pink blush.
For medium skin, go with a rose gold blush.
For dark skin, opt for a hot pink blush.
Peach blushes tend to be flattering on all skin tones.
Using an angled blush brush usually makes for an easier application. That’s because the shape deposits the most color on the apple of your cheek and fades it out across your cheekbone.

, If you aren’t a fan of blush or just want a sun kissed look, you can add some bronzer to your face. However, you shouldn’t apply it everywhere or it won’t look natural. Instead, dust it on your skin with a fluffy bronzer brush in the places where sun would naturally hit you, such as your temples, cheekbones, jawline, and nose.Don’t go more than one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone with your bronzer.
Choose a matte formula that isn’t too orange, so it looks natural.
If you’re having trouble figuring out where to apply your bronzer, use the “3/E” shape method. Starting at the top of your forehead, dust it over your face in “3” shape on the right side of your face, so you cover the temple, cheekbone, and jawline, and an “E” shape on the left side of your face to cover the same areas on the other side.

, For a natural look, you shouldn’t wear a very dark, saturated lipstick. You want to keep your lips looking soft, so opt for a sheer lip gloss or even a tinted lip balm. Choose a shade that’s similar to your natural lip color so you know it coordinates with your skin tone.Avoid lip glosses that have a lot of glitter or shimmer in them. They usually don’t look natural.
If you want to go a little bolder with your lip color, opt for sheer pinks and peach shades.

Determine your skin type.,
Clean your face at least twice a day.,
Get rid of any red or puffy skin when you first wake up.,
Wear moisturizer daily.,
Exfoliate your skin once a week.,
Try using toner.,
Try all-natural skin care techniques.,
Remove your makeup whenever you do wear it.,
Take care of any pimples.,
Wear sunscreen whenever you go outside.,
Stop touching your face.",How to Look Hot Without Make Up1," When taking care of your skin, it is important to consider what kind of skin type you have so that you can do everything you can to take care of it properly. Different types of skin include: normal, dry, oily, and sensitive. Keep in mind that you can have certain spots of skin that are oilier than others, and that your skin type can change. To figure out what kind of skin you have, consider the main characteristics of each type of skin:


People with normal skin have small pores, few imperfections (like pimples or blotchiness), relatively insensitive skin, and a shining complexion.
People with dry skin have tiny pores that are very hard to see, red patches or blotches on different parts of their skin, a rough complexion, and lines that are more easy to see than on people with other skin types. People with dry skin often deal with flaky or irritated skin.
People with oily skin have very large pores, a shiny complexion, and generally have a few imperfections (like pimples) on the oiliest parts of their skin.
Sensitive skin means that your skin is often irritated, itchy, red, or dry and cracked.;
, Taking care of your skin is a large part of looking great without makeup. Wash your face with a facial wash that is suited for your skin type. In general, try to wash your face once in the morning, and once at night. You should also try to wash your face after you have sweated a lot, such as when you exercise.


Keep in mind that over-washing your face can make your skin dry and irritated.
If you are having trouble finding a face wash that works well for you, set up an appointment with a dermatologist to discuss your skin type and facial washes that will nourish your skin.

, Once you have washed your face, look at your skin for a moment. If parts of your face are looking puffy from sleep, or red, consider rubbing an ice cube on the area. The coldness of the ice cube can help to constrict the blood vessels, making your face less red and puffy.

, Every time you wash your face, follow it up with an application of facial moisturizer. Pick a quality daily moisturizer (preferably one with SPF in it) and apply it every day after washing. Opt for a slightly richer moisturizer to wear at night.


Again, remember to choose a moisturizer that's suited to your skin type. If you have sensitive skin, go for something gentle and unscented. If you are prone to pimples, try something light that specifically says it is not oily.
Drier skin types should go for heavier moisturizers with soothing, nourishing ingredients like shea butter or aloe vera. You can also try using honey as a moisturizer.


, Exfoliating your skin involves scrubbing away dead skin cells so that your face looks fresh and radiant. This is particularly helpful if you are going makeup free, as exfoliating your skin can help to give it a glow that you would otherwise create with bronzer and foundation. Look for facial washes that have exfoliating particles in them.


Alternatively, you can exfoliate your skin using a clean washcloth soaked in warm water. Rub your face gently with the washcloth, in slow circular motions. This option is good for people with sensitive skin.
Never scrub your face too hard with the exfoliator or use it too often. Doing this may dry out your skin and leave it feeling irritated.

, Toner is a skin care product that has often been overlooked, but can do wonders when it comes to improving the appearance of your skin. Toner restores your skin's natural pH balance, which in turn can make your skin look even and radiant. Look for toners that are alcohol-free—these will generally dry your skin out less and can help to even out your skin tone.


Toners that are designed for oily or acne-prone skin can help to remove excess oil and tighten pores, while toners for dry skin can help to soothe irritation and lock in extra moisture.
Most toners can be used everyday, after cleansing and before moisturizing.

, If you would rather not purchase chemical-based facial wash products, you can try natural products that may help to give you face a fresh look. Try using aloe vera soap or neem soap to clean your face naturally.


You can also create a natural face mask by combining turmeric, two teaspoons of lemon juice, honey, milk, tomato puree, and half a cup of besan flour (which is also known as chic pea flour). Apply the mask to your skin, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wash it off.

, Even though this article is a guide on how to look good without make up, chances are you will still want to get dolled up and wear makeup from time to time. This is absolutely fine, but just make sure that when you do wear makeup, you remember to take it off completely before bed. Make-up that is left on overnight can clog the pores and lead to pimples.


Use a specific makeup removing product, like a foaming cleanser or cream to remove the make-up, rather than your regular face wash. Use a special eye makeup remover to clean off mascara, eyeshadow and eyeliner.

, The thought of going barefaced while also having pimples can be a scary one. Because of this, getting rid of the pimples can help to give you the confidence to give up your makeup. The previous steps will all help to clear up pimples and other blemishes you may have. Try to use washes and moisturizers that are targeted at oily or acne-prone skin, and look for other products, like sunblocks, that will not block up your pores (this is referred to as being non comedogenic).


Look for over-the-counter spot creams and gels which contain ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, both of which are extremely effective when it comes to getting rid of acne.
If you are having troubles clearing up your skin, seek the help of a dermatologist. Your dermatologist may be able to recommend medical creams and cleansers, or antibiotics that may help to remove any remaining blemishes.

, You should try to wear sunscreen every day, even if it's cold, cloudy or snowy, as the UVA/UVB rays can still damage your skin. Sun damage may cause your skin to age prematurely, and in extreme cases can lead to skin cancer and other skin conditions.


Try to use SPF 30 or higher and, if possible, find a sunscreen which doubles up as a moisturizer. This will make sunscreen application easy to remember as it can become a part of your morning regimen.

, This is a habit many people are guilty of, which can seriously affect the quality of the skin. Picking at spots, rubbing your forehead, or simply resting your chin on your hand are all things that can add oil and bacteria to your skin, causing it to break out and look greasy.


Also keep in mind that rubbing at your face can loosen the skin, causing premature wrinkles.

Take showers regularly.,
Wash your hair every other day.,
Pluck or wax your eyebrows.,
Combat body odors.,
Pay attention to dental hygiene.",How to Look Hot Without Make Up2," Keeping your body clean is a necessary part of being attractive. Walking around with dirt on your arms and greasy hair may project an image other than the hotness you are going for. In general, try to take a shower once a day, and wash yourself with a body soap that is specifically tailored for your skin type.


If you have dry or sensitive skin, use warm water rather than hot water, as hot water can irritate your skin and cause it to become even more dry.

, While it is important to wash your body regularly, you should try to limit yourself to washing your hair every other day at the most. While it is important to wash your hair frequently to prevent your hair and skin from becoming greasy, unless you have extremely oily hair, it is probably unnecessary to wash your hair every day. When you wash your hair everyday, your hair can become dried out and will feel brittle to the touch.


Use a shampoo and conditioner that are suited to your type of hair. In general, try to use a grape-sized dollop of conditioner when you wash your hair.
Some people find that rinsing their hair with cool water can help to make their hair shinier and softer.

, Keep your eyebrows looking tidy by removing any stray hairs. Having perfectly shaped brows can do wonders for your face by framing your eyes, therefore making them the center of attention, even without makeup. Well manicured eyebrows can be very striking and add definition to your features. Pluck from the bottom of the brow, close to its root, rather than trying to pull it out from the top of the hair.


If you're nervous about plucking and aren't sure which eyebrow shape would best suit your face, go to a beautician to have them plucked or waxed for the first time. Ask your beautician about maintaining your eyebrow shape at home and invest in a good pair of tweezers.

, While taking showers regularly will definitely help you to smell good, it is still important to try to vanquish body odors such as those that might develop under your armpits. Invest in a quality deodorant and consider purchasing some perfume that you can carry around with you to help your smell stay fresh and lovely.

, A white, healthy smile can work wonders for your overall appearance, so make sure you give your teeth the care and attention they deserve. Brush your teeth least twice a day, for a minimum of two minutes, using gentle circular motions. Focus on each tooth individually and don't neglect the hard to reach teeth at the back.


Try to floss daily once you have brushed your teeth. Flossing removes built-up bacteria, food particles and plaque from between the teeth, thus preventing cavities from forming.
You should also try to brush your tongue every time you brush your tooth. Once you have brushed and flossed, rinse your mouth out with mouthwash to remove any lingering bacteria and to help your breath smell great.

Use eyedrops to keep your eyes looking white and healthy.,
Add some color to your cheeks.",How to Look Hot Without Make Up3," Long, curling eyelashes can make you feel very feminine, but you don't need pounds of mascara to achieve this look. Instead, try using an eyelash curler to pump up the volume of your eyelashes. To use an eyelash curler:


Clamp the curler around your eyelashes and hold the contraption in place for 10 to 20 seconds.
Alternatively, you can make your eyelashes appear thicker by applying a coat of Vaseline to your lashes, and then using an eyelash brush to comb them.
You can also try using the back of a spoon to curl your eyelashes if you don’t have a curler.

, Smooth, full lips are much more attractive than dry, cracked ones, so make sure to look after yours using a combination of exfoliation and moisturization. Exfoliate your lips by gently rubbing a dampened toothbrush or washcloth against them, then hydrate them with your favorite lip balm.


Protect lips from extreme weather conditions by wearing a lip balm with an SPF in the sun, or a protective chapstick in the winter.
Alternatively, you can use Vaseline to keep your lips healthy and crack-free.

, To brighten up your eyes and give an overall impression of health and alertness, use some redness-reducing eye drops. These are readily available at your local pharmacy and are a quick and easy way to improve your appearance. Simply add a drop or two to each eye every morning for brightness and clarity.

, Adding a hint of rosy color to your cheeks can give you a healthy, radiant look. However, you don’t need blush to attain this color; you can gently pinch or tap your cheeks to bring some color to them.


Your cheeks will also naturally look for rosy if you spend time out in the sun and exercise frequently.

, Picking out a hairstyle that will flatter your face can help you to feel confident about not wearing makeup. Certain hairstyles can even draw attention to certain parts of your face, making makeup even less necessary (for example, fringe bangs will help to draw attention to your eyes).


Keep your face shape in mind when choosing a hairstyle. For more information on how to do this, click here.
Don’t panic if you have a bad hair day; messy hair can be covered up with a fashionable scarf or a stylish hat. You can also use dry shampoo to make your hair look less greasy if you don’t have time to wash it before you head out of the house.

, If you don’t have the best vision, chances are you will need to wear glasses or contacts. When you make the switch to a makeup-less lifestyle, spend some time trying on glasses or wearing contacts to see which look you like the best.


If you decide on glasses, pick a pair that will frame your face and make your facial features (particularly your eyes) pop.

, If you don’t want to wear makeup, you can still add some colors to your style without colorful mascara or lipstick. Paint your fingernails and toenails in bright, funky colors that catch people’s attention.


If you don’t want to paint your own nails, head to a salon for a manicure and pedicure.

Smiling also gives an impression of happiness and confidence, while also making your seem more approachable. Smiling often will help you to look your best, regardless of whether or not you are wearing makeup.

, If you are not happy, your unhappiness will certainly show, whether or not you are wearing makeup. Smiling is one part of projecting your happiness. Other ways to show your inner happiness are to spend time with people that make you laugh, do things that you love, and maintain a positive attitude.



Being positive can be a very attractive feature. A pleasant attitude and positive outlook on life and bring good things to your life.

, True beauty shines from within, so try to stop believing that you need your mascara to feel confident and start believing in you. Stand up tall, with your shoulders back and your chin up. Make eye contact with people and smile frequently.


Remember that makeup is simply a tool used to emphasize certain features—your natural beauty has been there all along.

, Getting plenty of sleep can help to improve your overall appearance and make it easier for you to maintain a positive attitude. While everyone needs a different amount of sleep, in general, kids in middle and high school generally need 9 to 11 hours of sleep, while adults over the age of 18 generally need 7 to 8 hours of sleep.If you are unable to get a full night’s sleep for some reason, and wake up with bags under you’re eyes, don’t fret. Put two metal spoons in the freezer for ten minutes. Once the ten minutes are up, press one spoon under each of your eyes, over your under-eye bags. This will help to reduce the puffiness.

, Drinking plenty of water each day can help to flush out toxins in your body, which in turn can help to keep your skin glowing and radiant. In general, the amount of water you need each day depends on how active you are.


Girls that are 9 to 13 years old generally need 2.1 liters (0.6 US gal) of water, while boys of the same age need 2.3.Girls that are 14 to 18 years old generally need 2.3 liters (0.6 US gal) of water, while boys that are the same age need 3.3 liters (0.9 US gal)., Looking and feeling healthy has a lot to do with what you put into your body. Skin, especially, can be affected by a poor diet. Try to cut out as many greasy, fatty, sugary foods as possible and load up on fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats instead.


Take a vitamin supplement if you feel you are not getting all of your daily requirements from your diet alone. Vitamins A, C and E are all particularly beneficial for the skin.

, When you are dealing with stress on a daily basis, you are more likely to form blemishes on your skin. Try to reduce the amount of stress you deal with each day. Some ways to reduce the stress you feel include:

Next, put on your preferred foundation and blend it in. Apply concealer under your eyes and on top of any blemishes.








You can swap out the primer for facial lotion or a light moisturizer.
If you have naturally good skin, you can skip this step and only apply the primer.
To select the right foundation for your skin, dip a Q-tip into a container of foundation, then run the Q-tip over your jawline.
If you can't see where your skin ends and the foundation begins, this is the right shade for you.;
, Start with the eye shadow; apply a tan color across the lid of your eye, making sure to go from the base of the eye to the brow-bone. Rub a darker brown shade of eye shadow across the crease of the eye to define it.








Run the same shade of brown across the bottom lash line to darken it.
Curl your eyelashes with the help of a lash curler, then run your mascara wand over the lashes on both eyes.
Make sure to run the brush from the root of the lash to the tip of the lash.
Avoid eye-liner. Eye-liner is a great way of making your eyes stand out, but during the day it can look a little aggressive.If you don't like brown, look for eye shadow tones in bright pink, champagne, purple or peach.
Pair your eye shadow with a dark mascara to make your eyes stand out.

, Find an eyebrow pencil that is a similar shade to your hair color. If you don’t have a pencil, you can also substitute an eye shadow that matches your hair color and apply it by using a thin slanted makeup brush.








Outline and fill in the brow using the pencil.
Check your work to make sure the eyebrows are as even as possible.

, Start by smiling; the fullest, fleshiest part of your cheeks when you smile is called the apple of your cheeks and this is where you will be applying the blush.








Run your blush brush up the apples of your cheeks, towards your temples.
Use a cotton swab or some tissue to blend the color in.
Keep a light touch - it's easier to add more blush on later than it is to remove it.
If you do over-apply, don't worry! Instead, place some powder or liquid foundation on a sponge and use this to help blend the excess blush.

, Start with a lip color that is very similar to the natural color of your lips. Forgo lip liner and instead use the lip brush or tube to apply the lip color directly to your lips.








If you’re not a fan of lip color, try substituting Chapstick or a clear lip gloss instead.
Make sure to reapply the lip color periodically throughout the day.
If you're going to do a red lip in daytime, keep the rest of your makeup minimal.Don't feel like you have to stick to a matte lip - glossy is also fine.

When wearing a clip or sliding buckle, you can usually fasten your pants tightly in the position you need to keep your pants from falling down. Traditional pin buckle belts aren't as variable, which will result in a looser fit due to the spacing between belt holes., There are various kinds of pants suited for sagging. You can choose the style that meets your taste best, or you could invest in a few different pairs to add variety to your sag-style. Try on different pants with different cuts to find out what look works best for you. Don't be afraid to try out uncommon pants. You might discover a whole new style for yourself.

, Regular cut pants should work fine for sagging, but if you're after the classic sag look, you'll want a baggy cut of pants. If you want a fresher style, try some drop crotch pants.


Relaxed fit pants work best if you want a casual everyday outfit. They're the most versatile choice of pants. You can sag them just a few inches to create a smooth sagging-look or you can wear them below your buttocks to get a pronounced sag.
Baggy pants are the traditional choice for sagging  and the kinds of pants that created the sagging-style. They have a slightly lower and wider cut crotch plus wide legs. Be aware that baggy pants are designed to be worn lower than regular pants to allow their intended style to show. Never wear them too high on your waist or you'll defeat their purpose, like wearing some sneakers on your hands would defeat the purpose of shoes.
Drop crotch pants or harem pants already have a crotch that's cut lower than normal while maintaining tighter cut legs. They will create an impression that you're wearing your pants lower than you actually are. Drop crotch pants have become more popular in the last years, especially sweat pants with low cut crotches. But since not many people have adopted this style yet, they're still fresh and will work for you if you're looking for something distinctive.Shorts can be sagged as well. You have to put extra care in how low you sag them. If you wear them so low that your shorts' legs are almost touching your shoes, you'll look like wearing normal pants, which defeats the purpose of wearing shorts.

, Depending on your body type the size you need will vary, but generally you should wear pants that are at least one size bigger than your normal size. For a baggier, saggier look, you can also wear pants that are 2 or 3 sizes larger than your normal. For example, if your normal waist is size 34, you might wear pants ranging in size between 35 and 38.


The brand of pants you purchase will also affect the size that's best for you. Sizes can differ widely in the inseam, hip, and leg between brands.
Different brands of pants will also have different cuts, like longer or shorter cut crotches or wider or tighter legs. This will also affect the way your sag looks.
If you have slender hips, it's likely you'll need a smaller size of baggy pants to prevent them from falling off. Stockier individuals thicker in the thigh, however, might want to invest in pants a few sizes normal than their average., If your baggy pants are worn too high, you'll miss the mark and simply appear like you're wearing overlarge clothes instead of sagging. Pants that are worn too low can fall easily off your body and/or make it difficult for you to walk. Generally, you'll want the crotch of your pants to lie lower than normal and the fit to be as relaxed as possible.

,


A minor sag is when you simply wear your pants slightly lower on your hips. This creates a subtler, more casual sag-style. It can be a less offensive alternative if you're out with your parents or in polite company while still staying true to your sense of style. It is also the easiest way to sag, because your pants won't slide off your buttocks on their own. The downside of this style is that depending on the pants you wear, your sag won't be as noticeable as you might want it to be. Sometimes this style is called ""shy sagging"" and amongst saggers has the stigma of being worn by people who lack confidence in their own style.
A medium sag is when you wear your pants right in the middle of your buttocks, which creates a more pronounced sag-style. This is a good alternative if you want to let other people clearly see that you're sagging. It is also comparatively easy to maintain in comparison to more extreme styles. This way of wearing your pants might be most appropriate when out with your friends.
A major sag is a more extreme sag-style. It means wearing your pants below your buttocks and sometimes even below your genitals. It might take you some time to get used to it and it takes some experience to know how to keep your pants up and how to walk properly. Be aware that this style is more show-offy than the aforementioned, but it will create an aura of complete confidence if your style. You'll not only appear as someone who goes against traditional conventions and dress codes while staying true to yourself, but it might also earn you respect from other saggers.
An extreme sag is when you wear your pants around your thighs. This is perhaps the most noticeable version of sagging and is also the most prone to slippage. It takes a lot of experience to wear. You might want to give this style a test run before you try it in public! This style works best if you combine it with long shirts or tall tees. Proficient extreme saggers rock this style casually as if they don't even care, and with this make people wonder how their pants stay up., Try a few different positions on your body and use a full length mirror to see how the different sag-styles look on you. Some body types might not work with certain styles of sag. For example, if you have a relatively flat butt, even if you want your pants to rest there, you may find your pants slide lower even with a tightly fastened belt.


You should fasten your pants with a belt by bringing your legs together while tightening your belt. You'll want your belt to be tight against your body to keep your pants up while standing and walking.
After firmly fastening your belt, you may want to readjust the way your pants are positioned. Cinching your belt can sometimes raise your pants higher than you desire. Tug your pants back into the position you prefer and check your look in a mirror.
You might even wear your pants so low that the back pockets reach to the backs of your knees. This will create a visible, iconic sag-style, especially while walking.

, When wearing your sag-style, especially for extreme saggers, you'll want to keep your legs at least slightly spread apart when standing and walking. This widened stance will help keep your pants from sliding down your legs.

, Under layers will add width to your frame, and much like your widened stance, more width to your body will prevent your pants for sagging farther than you intend. Most saggers recommend and prefer boxer shorts when sagging to keep their backside fully covered, although you might want to avoid smooth fabric like satin or silk. Smooth fabric underwear will make it easier for your pants to slide down and off your body. You can add another sub-layer over your boxers by wearing a pair of athletic shorts.


If you find that your boxers don't offer enough coverage, you could wear two pairs of shorts. These can also be worn fashionably, with the pair closest to your body hiked a little bit higher on your waist than the other. This can create interesting patterns between your shorts, boxers, and pants.

, Sagger style doesn't just use baggy pants! You'll want to combine your choice of pants similarly baggy clothing, like tall tees, over sized t-shirts, and/or long, loose fitting shirt. If you are uncomfortable showing off your underwear, stick to longer shirts that hide your under garments.


Normal size t-shirts work well if you want to show off your underwear/shorts. Normal tees that reveal your sub-layers can create interesting, fashionable patterns between your outer and inner layers.
Hoodies, being a baggier article of clothing, naturally match the sagger style. However, if you've chosen a sag-style that is especially low on your body, you might need to buy a hoodie that's longer than usual or is a size or two bigger than what you normally wear.If you've decided on wearing drop crotch pants, the thinner legs will likely match well with thinner clothing on your upper body as well. Experiment to see what works best for you!

, Since your pants will be slung lower on your body than intended by the manufacturer, it's almost certain that the bottom cuffs of your pants will drag on the ground. This can fray or wear out the material of your pants, severely decreasing the amount of wear-time you get from them. This can also trip you up when you're walking, which can be dangerous. To ensure this doesn't happen to you, you might want to take the extra fabric around your feet, collect it together, and tuck the back of it into the back of your shoes.


You may have to reposition the bottom cuff of your pants for the most natural look, but since you've only tucked the back of your pants into your shoes, the extra fabric should pool around your ankles. This should cover up the tucking, keeping it from looking weird.

, Another reason a canvas or fabric belt is preferred among saggers is that these are less rigid. This means that while you're sitting, it's less likely your belt will dig into your uncomfortably. Sitting with baggy pants can create bunching that becomes uncomfortable over time. Get into the habit of noticing bunching quickly and pulling the fabric smooth.If you find that your belt still causes discomfort when sitting, you may want to pull your pants up a little bit when you sit down. This will likely place your belt on a higher, narrower part of your body, where the belt will be more relaxed.
Another way of avoiding discomfort is pulling your pants down a bit until you're no longer sitting on the belt. But be aware that this will create a much more extreme sag when standing up.

, Especially if you've had to pull up or smooth bunched fabric while sitting down, your sag-style might have shifted. You should tug the legs of your pants downward to return them to the sag-style you prefer. This also will keep unattractive creases from forming in your pants. Failure to keep your pants smoothed can result in permanent folds that harsh your cool sag style.

Sorry ladies, but if you are shorter with a wider build then it may best to avoid this style of pants or go with a pair that has a very subtle flare. Start about knee height to avoid adding the appearance of width.

Remember to wear these pants with a belt to keep definition at your waist., Go with dark blue, black or brown, Definitely, you will need heels, pumps or boots to add height.

Pair your short shorts with a blazer or vest.,
Be confident.",How to Wear Short Shorts1," The most important part of wearing any type of clothing is its fitting. However, you should pay extra attention to fit when looking for short shorts.A few common problems you want to avoid:



Muffin tops. Make sure your short shorts are wide enough at the waist. They shouldn't pinch your stomach.

Sliding off. The opposite problem of the muffin top is when your short shorts are too wide at the waist, causing them to sag or slip off. Watch out for this problem if you have narrow hips.

Riding up. The wrong pair of short shorts is one that rides up along the thigh. Not only can this be painful, but you may find your butt cheeks hanging out of your shorts.;
, Pay close attention to the underwear you put on underneath your short shorts. If your shorts are extremely short, your underwear may peak through. Additionally, if your short shorts are made of a tight material, they will highlight bagginess.


Styles you may want to avoid are boxers and boyshorts.
On the other hand, briefs (especially high-cut briefs), bikini, and thong underwear styles are the safest.
Always double-check in a mirror that your underwear is out of sight.

, For the most part, you can treat your short shorts like any other type of bottom. If your short shorts have a print, don't wear a patterned top. It's also a bad idea to mix dark neutrals. For example, if your short shorts are navy blue, don't wear a top that's black or dark brown.

, Pairing short shorts with oversized T-shirts and tunics is generally a bad idea. This combination can make it seem like you aren't wearing anything underneath your top. You'll be more likely to draw the wrong type of attention if people think you're going around with no pants in public.

, You can wear any type of shoes with short shorts. However, there are a few shoe types that work better than others:



Simple flat tennis shoes. Short shorts and tennis shoes are a classic summer look.

Stiletto heels. Short shorts will draw attention to your legs, so you want them looking their best. Ultra-high heels will make your legs look longer and more toned.Thigh high boots. This is an extra sexy, on-trend look. Pick boots that are made from a thin material that could pass for stockings., Since you'll be baring your legs with short shorts, an extra layer up top will help to balance your outfit. Matching your jacket with your short shorts is extra chic and on trend. This will go a long way towards making your short shorts look more fashionable and less childish or sloppy., Confidence can make even the most unconventional fashion choice look great. Act like short shorts are something you wear every day. Don't let other people's negative comments get you down.

Get into the shape you're most comfortable with.,
Shave or wax your legs.,
Keep your legs moisturized.",How to Wear Short Shorts2," When you're wearing short shorts, you're showing off your legs to the world. Make sure yours look how you want them to. If you want skinny or muscular thighs, you may need to do some aerobics or strength training to tone them.


While it's perfectly fine to want to change how you look, do your best to love yourself as you are. Legs of all shapes and sizes are beautiful.

, While the choice between hairy and smooth legs is yours to make, keep in mind that hairless legs tend to look longer and more toned.Depending on your body hair pattern, it may also be prudent to wax your inner thighs and/or bikini area. Visible pubic hair can be an embarrassing problem when wearing short shorts.

, Although winter may be the most famous season for dry skin, many people deal with this issue well into the summer. When accentuating your legs, remember to spend as much time on them as you do your face. Moisturize daily and after each shave to avoid embarrassing flaky skin.


Remember that highly-chlorinated pool water can dry out your skin. If you find yourself having this problem, be sure to rinse your skin with normal tap water and a mild soap after every swim."

, Find one that brightens for under your eyes. You can either use a brush or your finger. If you're using a brush, put a little concealer on your hand then dab the brush in it and use light feathery strokes to apply it under your eyes, around your nose and on any blemishes. If you are using your finger do the exact same thing but try to pat it in as that will give better coverage.

, Pressed powder usually gives a bit more coverage than loose powder. Use a big fluffy brush and apply just a little on your face to set your make-up.

, Blusher gives you a rosy glow on your cheeks. Bronzer gives you defined cheekbones and a sun-kissed glow. Apply it with a fluffy angled brush; either apply it where the sun would normally hit (your cheeks, forehead, and nose) or apply it in the hollows of your cheekbones to give yourself a more sculptured face. For blush, you can either apply it on the apples of your cheeks or just below your cheekbones all the way up to your hairline.

, Any color of eyeshadow that is flattering for your skin and eyes will do. If you choose a shimmery champagne colour and use a fluffy eyeshadow brush, make sure to sweep it all over the lid. If you want to add some more depth, apply a darker brown colour in the outer corner and crease.

, Eyeliner is optional, but for school, a brown eyeliner is a more natural choice. You could apply it on your water line and tight line, or you could just apply it on your lid close to your lash line.

, For mascara, a waterproof one is a good choice if you have sports or PE (Physical Education/Exercise) and want to keep your makeup fresh. Comb the brush through your lashes and wiggle it every now and then. You could apply it on the bottom lashes also.

, If you want to, you can accentuate your eyebrows as well. You could use a brow gel, pencil or powder to do this. For pencil, use light feathery strokes and brush through your lashes afterwards for a more natural look. For powder, use a little angled brush and again use light feathery strokes and brush through after.

, For lips, keep it very natural. Apply a lipbalm for soft kissable lips and you leave it as that, or apply either a clear or light coloured lipgloss.

In particular, they work best on shapes with a defined waist, such as an hourglass or pear.You may want to avoid paperbag waist pants if you carry most of your weight in your midsection or lack a defined waist. For example, apple and rectangle body shapes may find the style less flattering.;
, If you are on the short side, paperbag waist pants can sometimes overwhelm your frame because of their extra volume. To ensure that they flatter your figure, choose a cropped pair that hits no further down than your ankle.Capri pants with a paperbag waist can be very flattering if you are petite.
For the most flattering look, choose paperbag waist cropped pants or capris that feature a tapered leg so they follow the natural line of the leg.
If you are short and aren’t a fan of cropped pants, you may prefer to wear shorts or a skirt with a paperbag waist rather than a pair of pants. That can create a more flattering silhouette for your figure.

, If you’re plus size or worried about the paperbag waist making your midsection appear larger, opt for a wide-legged pair of pants. The extra volume in the legs helps balance your frame so the added material at your waist doesn’t stand out.When you’re wearing wide-legged paperbag waist pants, it’s especially important to wear shoes with heels to help elongate your frame.
If you are petite, wide-legged paperbag waist pants aren’t the best option. A straight leg option is usually more flattering.

, Because paperbag waist pants tend to be baggier and add more volume to your figure, it’s best to wear them with a fitted top. That will help balance the proportions in your outfit for the most flattering look.For a casual look, a fitted tee shirt or tank top work best with your paperbag waist pants.
For a dressed up look, wear the pants with a fitted button-down blouse for an office-appropriate outfit.
A fitted sweater can work for a casual or an office look depending on the style of the pants.

, Even if your top is fitted, it can have an unflattering look if it sits over the paperbag waist of your pants. That’s why it’s best to tuck your top into the pants so the waist detail is highlighted and you don’t add any more bulk to your midsection.If you aren’t a fan of tucking in tops, consider pairing the paperbag waist pants with a bodysuit that naturally rests beneath the waistline.

, Cropped tops are another option when you’re wearing paperbag waist pants. Because they typically end above the waistline, they allow you to show off the paperbag waist and don’t add any bulk to the area.You can opt for a looser fitting top if you’re wearing a cropped style because the extra fabric won’t compete with the pants’ waistband given the higher hemline.

, You can wear jackets, cardigans, and blazers with paperbag waist pants, but choose slim styles that won’t add too much bulk to your look. Avoid boyfriend style blazers or cardigans, which are too loose to work with the pants.Consider the length of the your layering pieces too. It’s best to choose either a cropped style or a longer piece that hits at mid-thigh, so it doesn’t hit right at the waist where it will compete with the pants’ waistband.

, Some paperbag waist pants feature a built-in belt. If yours don’t, you can add a belt to help give some definition to your waist. However, it’s best to use a thin style so the waist detail still stands out.Aim for a belt that’s approximately 1- to 1.5-inches (2.5- to 4-cm) wide.
A rope, ribbon, or chain style belt is a good option with paperbag waist pants.

, The extra volume that paperbag waist pants add to your figure can sometimes make you appear shorter. It’s best to wear the pants with shoes that have a heel or add height to elongate the line of your legs.Pumps, heeled boots, and wedges all work well to add height to your figure when you’re wearing paperbag waist pants.
If you are tall, you can usually get away with pairing the pants with flats.

, The paperbag waist pants will draw attention to your waist. To help bring attention up to your face, it helps to accessorize with a pair of statement earrings that will pull the eye upward.A large pair of dangling, drop, or hoop earrings can make a large statement. Choose styles with colorful beads, stones, or other materials.
If you don’t wear earrings, a bold statement necklace, such as a fringe, bib, or layered style, can create a similar effect.

",How to Apply Simple Every Day Makeup," Before applying makeup in the morning, wash your face so you'll be able to start with a fresh canvas. Use a cleanser or simply splash lukewarm water on your face a few times to wash away any debris on your skin. Pat it dry gently with a soft towel.









Avoid washing your face with hot water. This will dry it out and leave it prone to irritation. Lukewarm water is best when you're washing your face.
Don't scrub your face dry. This causes fragile facial skin to loosen over time.;
, It's not necessary to exfoliate every day, but doing so every few days is essential to keeping your skin looking fresh. Putting makeup on over dry, flaky skin defeats the purpose! Exfoliate your skin using either a small facial brush, an exfoliating scrub, or another exfoliating tool designed for use on the face. Focus on areas that tend to get dry and flaky.









Using a face mask from time to time is another good way to keep your facial skin in good shape. Choose a clay mask, which will cleanse your pores and help pull off dry skin when you wash it away.

, The last step before applying makeup is putting on some moisturizing lotion. This will help your makeup go on more easily and create a better final look. Choose a good face moisturizer that works with your skin type. Massage it gently all over your face. Don't forget your eyelids, lips, and nose.









Let the moisturizer absorb into your skin for a few minutes before you move on to applying makeup. Putting makeup on while your face is still wet or sticky will result in a mess!

, Choose a foundation that works with your skin type and matches your coloring. Liquid foundation is a fine choice for many types of skin. You can also use tinted moisturizer or BB cream. If your skin is on the oily side, you might want to consider compact or powder foundation. In the store, test your foundation to make sure it matches your face by dabbing a little on your jaw bone. Never apply it on the back of your hand as the skin colour is different from your face .









Apply the foundation evenly over your face using a foundation brush, pad or your finger. Make sure it doesn't cake or clump anywhere.
Avoid putting extra layers of foundation over blemishes. It'll only make them stand out more.
Blend the foundation around the edges of your face and where it meets the bottom of your chin.

, Choose a concealer that matches your skin tone - or, if you have dark under-eye circles, go one shade lighter. Apply a light amount of concealer using either a concealer brush or your finger by dabbing it under your eyes and gently blending it in. This will make your eyes look bright instead of sleepy.









If you're trying to pare down your makeup routine, you can skip the concealer. It all depends on which features you want to play down and which you want to highlight.
Use a little extra concealer on blemishes if necessary (making sure to use a color that matches your skin tone).

, Choose a powder that matches your skin tone. Use a powder brush (a large, fluffy brush that will apply the powder evenly) to apply the powder to your face in a circular motion. This will give your face a natural-looking finish and help set your foundation so that it stays in place all day.









On days when you have more time to spend applying makeup, you can also apply bronzer and highlighter to contour your face. Bronzer helps create flattering shadows, while highlighter brightens areas you want to have pop.

, Choose a pink-toned blush that brings out the best in your facial coloring. Swirl a blush brush in the container, smile, and apply it to the apples of your cheeks in a circular motion.








, Choose a neutral shadow pallet for a simple, everyday look. Brown, gold, grey, and blue tones are all good choices, depending on your eye color. Avoid bright colors, ""smokey eye"" pallets, and other bold jewel tones, as they'll look out of place during the day. Here's how to apply eyeshadow to make it look natural and pretty:









Start by applying a base shadow in a color close to your skin tone. Use your finger or an eyeshadow brush to apply it on your lid and all the way up to your eyebrow.
Apply a medium-dark color to your lid, working your way from your eyelashes up to the crease.
Use a fluffy brush to blend the colors at the crease.

, Choose a charcoal, navy, or brown eyeliner to use during the day - save your back eyeliner for nighttime wear. Apply it just above your eyelashes, taking care to make sure it goes on smooth and straight. Use your eye shadow brush to blend it lightly so that the line looks less harsh.









You can use a pencil liner or a liquid liner. Either one is great for daytime use.
If the line gets smudged, use a cotton swab to gently remove it, then reapply.
For an everyday look, don't use liner on your lower lids.

, Apply one coat of mascara on both your upper and lower lashes. Insert the brush at the base of your lashes and sweep outward. After you're finished with one eye, dip the brush in the bottle again before applying mascara to the other eye. Either black or brown mascara is fine for everyday wear.









If you don't want to apply mascara, you can use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes for a natural, pretty look.

, Use a pink or neutral-colored lipstick or lip gloss to finish your everyday look. Avoid using heavy lipliner and bright, bold colors during the day. Dab a tissue on your lips to remove excess lipstick or gloss.









If you want to use a bright color, you can mute it for daytime wear by applying it to your bottom lip, rubbing your lips together to coat both of them in color, then applying a clear gloss.

",How to Apply Subtle Daytime Makeup," For the health of your skin and the sake of longer lasting makeup, start each morning by washing your face.Be sure to use a gentle cream or gel cleanser designed for the face.


Massage the cleanser into your skin for about 30 seconds, using a circular motion,and rinse well using lukewarm water. Gently pat your face dry with a soft towel to remove most, but not all, of the moisture.;
, To give your makeup a soft, smooth surface over which to be applied, make sure your face is moisturized. You can use toners, serums, eye creams, or just a basic moisturizing facial lotion. Be sure to apply it when your skin is still slightly damp.


To prevent dryness, moisturize your face after every time you wash it.

, This is especially important in the summer months, but you should actually wear sunscreen year-round.Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, and apply it liberally to your face, neck, and ears.


Sunscreen and proper sun-protection habits will help protect your skin from skin cancer, freckles, wrinkles, and premature aging.

, Basic daytime makeup can be as simple and easy as applying a little foundation, concealer, and blush, or it can be as complicated as doing your eyes, lips, and brows as well. Primer isn't strictly necessary, but it will help make your cosmetics last longer if you plan to wear more than just basic daytime makeup.


The purpose of primer is to give your makeup something to stick to, fill in small wrinkles and creases, and control oil.To apply primer, put a small amount onto your index finger and gently rub a thin layer all over your face., Use a lightweight foundation that matches your skin tone as closely as possible. Use your finger or a sponge to apply a thin layer all over your face.Foundation will help even out your skin tone, create a smooth surface, and cover discoloration,and because it serves such a similar purpose to primer, the primer isn't always necessary.


Go for a matte or oil-free finish if you have oily skin, try a moisturizing or cream foundation if you have dry skin, and opt for hypoallergenic and scent-free if your skin is sensitive.You can also use your undertones to choose a foundation. Go for a reddish or bluish foundation if you have cool skin, a golden or yellowish foundation if your undertone is warm, and try ivory or praline foundation shades if you have neutral undertones., Concealer is similar to foundation, but it’s even more capable of covering redness, flaws, and blemishes. Apply small amounts of concealer under your eyes and on all blemishes, and then use your fingers to delicately blend it in.You can also use the concealer to provide some contouring to your face, by applying some down the bridge of the nose and above the eyebrows. Use your fingers to blend it in.
Use the same criteria to choose concealer that you used for foundation, and try to match the color of your concealer to the color of your foundation. If you want to brighten your under-eye area, you can try a concealer that’s up to two shades lighter than your skin tone., This is another optional step, but if you want to help set your foundation and concealer for the day, use a sponge or brush to apply a thin layer of loose or pressed powder on your face, especially areas that are prone to oiliness.


Loose powder will provide a lighter look, while pressed powder is heavier, and will provide more coverage, especially if your skin is oily.
For an even easier and more natural look, you can simply apply a thin layer of powder on your face instead of using foundation., Once you’ve prepared your face, you'll be ready to head out the door with a perfect complexion and smooth skin if that’s all you want to do. But if you want to add a bit of color to your cheeks and lips and highlight your eyes, you can do so by adding some basic cosmetics. With a brush, apply a small dab of blush along your cheek bones, then use the brush to blend the blush into your skin.Try light pink, peach, or plum shade for fair skin.
Go for mauve, apricot, or berry for medium skin.
Give rose, bronze, or an orangey-peach a try if you have olive skin.
Try raisin, brick, or tangerine if you have dark skin., You don’t necessarily have to choose natural glossy or sheer color for daytime makeup (but you certainly can), and if you want to go a little bolder, try a cream lipstick without the lip liner. After applying, use your finger to blend the lipstick.To choose a lipstick color for daytime makeup, stick to something that’s a similar shade to your natural lip color, but with an extra bit of color and brightness. When in doubt, you can always opt for a soft pink shade., If you want to make your eyes pop a little as well, consider adding a bit of mascara to the top and bottom lashes. Starting with the top lashes, place the mascara want at the base of your lashes and move the wand back and forth as you work your way to the lash tips. While that coat is still wet, repeat the process, then do the same on the bottom lashes.Try a black mascara to draw attention to your eyes, unless you have very pale skin, in which case you may want to try brown instead.
If you’re going to be applying eyeshadow and liner as well, hold off on the mascara until after you apply those two items.

, More eye makeup isn't necessary for daytime (or anytime), but if you do want to wear daytime eye makeup, applying a primer will help it last longer.


Apply a cream primer or flesh-colored eyeshadowto your entire eyelid, from the base of the eyelid right to the brow line., Apply a layer of light purple or brown eyeshadow to your eyelid from the inner corner to the center. Add depth to your eye by applying a medium brown eyeshadow to the crease of your eye and the outer bottom corner of the eyelid (not up toward the brow line). Use a clean brush to blend these colors together.Apply a thin line of medium brown eyeshadow to the outer corner of your bottom lash line as well., To add definition to your eyes, apply a thin line of your favourite browneyeliner to the upper lash line.At the outer corners of your eyes, you can extend the liner out slightly toward your temple to make your eyes look larger.Once your eyeshadow and liner are complete, you can add mascara to the top and bottom lash lines.

, For daytime makeup, choose a thin brush to apply some eyeshadow to your eyebrows. Use a brush or eyebrow comb to work the color through. Try to find an eyeshadow that matches your natural hair color.,"

",How to Apply Makeup for a Natural Look," Put makeup remover or water on a cotton ball. Dab or rub the cotton ball in small circles to remove old makeup. Determine your skin type and cleanse, tone and moisturize with suitable products twice daily. If you have skin problems like spots/blackheads, exfoliate your skin.;
, Using a small dab the size of a pea, gently rub in an unscented, oil free lotion. Scented lotions can aggravate your skin and cause breakouts or an allergic reaction, and oily lotions will encourage acne.









For a more natural look, instead of using foundation, use a tinted moisturizer. Tinted moisturizers blend in while evening out your skin tone and commonly contain SPF. Those lucky girls with clearer skin will look best using tinted moisturizer.

, Applying your concealer before foundation helps keep foundation to a minimal amount. Make sure this is the exact same color as your skin. When you apply the concealer, do so directly on the spot and not around it. This is to avoid a halo effect and emphasis of the spot. Optionally set with beige powder.








Be careful not to overdo it on the concealer; you only need enough to cover the spot.

, Before you start, it’s best to determine whether or not you’re using the right foundation color. Get in a natural light and test the foundation to make sure it's the right color for your skin. Dab a few marks on your cheek and angle your face different ways to see if the color matches.








Take your finger or a sponge dab in the foundation, and dab it on your face, blending it until it looks like your skin tone. Be sure to go underneath your jaw line; if you stop at the edge of your face, there will be a clear line where the foundation ends, making it look like you’re wearing a mask.
If you have bags or discoloration under your eyes, make 3 dots on the line of the circles under your eyes. Blend it gently using your ring finger.

, Some people wait until after they have applied makeup to their eyes to add bronzer or blush. Bronzer is a great way to give yourself a natural glow. Lightly brush bronzer all over your face (or just along your cheekbones and T-Zone for a natural suntan appearance). However, bronzer can look silly on people with pale skin if applied incorrectly. Practice at home with bronzer to see if it looks good on you before going out with it on. If you don't like the way it looks, skip this step.








, If you were not happy with bronzer, you can apply blush instead. Crème blush generally works better than powder because it gives you a dewy look and lasts longer. Using a champagne-tinted crème blush, rub a little on your ring finger and blend onto your cheekbones. Note that you should not apply both blush and bronzer; choose one.








, Some women prefer not to do this, as eyeliner looks a little less natural than an eye with just mascara. Other beauty specialists say to line your eyes with a roasted-colored gel liner. Pencil looks less natural than liquid or gel liner and gel is easier to blend. Line two thirds of your top lashline and one third of your bottom lashline. Smudge the line with a cotton bud.








, Line the inside corners of your eyes with either white eyeliner or white eyeshadow to give your eyes a brighter look.









Some people also like to add a bit of white eyeliner or shadow under the brow bone to make their eyes appear brighter and more awake.

, Use two shades of eyeshadow for a professional look. The colors you choose should be golds, browns or silvers, depending on your skin tone and coloring. Apply a light, neutral tone all over your lid and just above your crease and use slightly darker to softly line the top lid and outline your crease. For a natural look, remember to blend the colors.








, Curling your eyelashes will give you a bright, awake look. If you want to make your eyelashes stand out against you skin, put on one layer of your favorite mascara.








If you use mascara, avoid clumping by using a de-clumping brush or an eyebrow brush.

, Avoid using chalky lipsticks or shiny lip glosses. Lip stain is generally best because it looks natural and lasts all day. Use a color that's close to your natural lip color.

, Test this step out at home before going out with it on--some people do not like the look of blush in the center of your lips. Do what feels (and looks) best to you!

To remove dirt and oils, thoroughly cleanse your skin with a gentle facial wash product. Dab your face dry with a clean towel.If there are any traces of makeup remaining, scrub your face in small circles with a cotton ball or swab dipped in makeup remover.Avoid face washes that contain exfoliants. Exfoliants cause your skin to redden.;
, Moisturizers soften and hydrated your skin. Evenly spread a pea-sized amount of moisturizer over the contours of your face.Allow the moisturizer to dry for approximately five minutes.If you are prone to skin irritation, avoid scented moisturizers.
If your skin is naturally oily, avoid moisturizers that contain additional oils. Moisturizers with oils can cause acne., Primer is formulated to provide a smooth base for foundation, combat shine, and keep your makeup in place throughout the day.Dab a pea-sized amount of primer onto your fingertip. Dab the primer along your cheekbones, above your brows, and along the bridge of your nose. Use your fingers to evenly spread the primer out to the edges. Allow the primer to set on your face for a few minutes. This application method produces a light, even layer of primer that will help your foundation appear to rest naturally on your face.Primer, like all of the products listed, is optional.

, Uneven skin tone is caused by hyper pigmentation. Uneven skin tone is characterized by isolated dark spots, blotches, and freckles. The presence of scars, especially acne scars, and sun spots are also markers of uneven skin tone. Note the areas of your complexion that are uneven.When applying foundation and concealer, take extra measures to cover these problem areas.

, Foundation is designed to even out the areas of your complexion that are overly pigmented, red, or contain imperfections. To achieve a natural, light look, apply foundation only to the areas of your face that need the coverage. Use a foundation brush, makeup sponge, or your fingers to blend the foundation seamlessly with your natural complexion., Concealer is meant to cover the problem areas that your foundation could not even out. Use a brush to apply a sparse amount of concealer to blemishes and around the edges of your nose. Apply a generous amount of concealer under your eyes to mask dark circles. Pat the application areas with your fingers to blend the concealer.For a natural look, use a concealer that is one shade lighter than your skin tone., Powders help to combat oil and set your foundation. You may use a translucent powder or a tinted powder that perfectly matches your skin tone. Apply the powder to your face with a large brush. With the brush, create a “W” pattern on your face. Begin at the top left corner of your hairline, bring the brush down to your cheekbone, to the bridge of your nose, down to the opposite cheekbone, and up to the top right corner of your hairline.Translucent powders are universal and may be used on any skin tone.They reflect light, which enhances your skin’s a natural glow., When striving for a natural look, opt for blush over bronzer. Choose a blush that is subtle, soft, and as close to your natural flush as possible. Apply the blush to the apples of your cheeks. Blend the product until it subtly falls where your natural flush occurs., Keep your eye makeup simple and clean. Prior to applying mascara, curl your lashes. Apply up to two coats of mascara to each set of eyelashes with a thin-wand mascara comb.If you have naturally dark lashes, skip this step or simply curl your lashes., Complete your simple look with a lipstick and or gloss that intensifies the natural pigment of your lips. Select a light pink, peach, or sand colored lipstick.Lightly dab the lipstick on your bottom lip and rub your lips together.

Don't wear leggings that are too tight or too loose.,
Leggings are pants, essentially.,
Don't wear your leggings with the wrong shoes.,
Make sure your leggings are long enough.,
Don't confuse leggings with jeggings.",How to Wear Leggings1," Your leggings should be tight enough to snugly cover your legs, but not so tight that people can see every dimple in your legs. Make sure that they aren't so loose that they start to bunch over your legs, because that isn't very flattering either. You'll find ones that fit well not only look better, but feel more comfortable.


Though anyone can wear leather leggings, they tend to be unforgiving and can bunch and cause unflattering lines on some body types.;
, Some believe this not to be the case, and they are entitled to their opinion. You can comfortably step out of the house wearing pants and a shirt, as you can do the same with leggings, if you like. As long as you won't be revealing too much, wear what you wish.


Pair leggings with a longer top or jacket. Even if the shirt hits below your butt, you'll still look like you stepped out of the house without putting everything on.
Wear your leggings with a dress, a skirt, or even shorts.

, Leggings look great with knee-high boots, sandals, flip-flops, or even low-cut boots. If you wear your leggings with heels or pumps, make sure that they match your shirt and that you don't look too trashy.


Leggings can also look good with ballet flats or moccasins, as long as the shoes go with the rest of the outfit.

, You may have looked great in your perfect black leggings once upon a time, but after you've run them through the wash about a hundred times, you may notice that they rise a few inches above your ankles or they've gone saggy at the knee.


When you notice this unpleasant phenomenon, it's time to save those leggings for days when you won't be stepping out of the house, or for wearing under trousers or pants on very cold days

, Jeggings are jean leggings, which is a cross between jeans usually, or other pants and leggings. Tight, sleek jeggings can help spice up an ordinary outfit, and you can wear them as you could wear pants. Denim blue ones with a 'boyfriend' cream sweater and loafers is a classic look.


While leggings and a top that falls to your waist is a big no-no in many people's opinions, you can pair a short shirt with jeggings.
Just make sure you can rock the jeggings. They're really tight and not for everybody.

Rock the patterned leggings.",How to Wear Leggings2," Put on a short summer or springy dress and pair it with cotton leggings that complement the color of the dress. The dress and leggings shouldn't be the same color, obviously, but they should coordinate. For example, if the dress has five different colors on it, just pick leggings that match at least one of the colors.


If your dress is busy with designs, go for solid-colored leggings.
Or do the reverse, you can even wear a solid-colored dress with a pair of patterned leggings and top your dress with a solid colored scarf.

, Pick a skirt that looks good with the leggings. Make sure the color of the skirt and the material don't clash with the leggings. If you're wearing a lose skirt, wear a tight shirt so you don't have too much flouncy material going on.


If your skirt has a pattern, wear plain leggings. If the skirt is plain, wear patterned leggings or leggings that are of a distinct enough color so they don't blend in with the skirt.

, This can be a cute and casual look. Just put on a plain-colored pair of leggings and throw on some denim, white, or black shorts, and you're good to go. The shorts shouldn't be so tight that they blend in with the leggings.


Wear casual shoes with this look. Flats, low boots, sandals, or even sneakers will do.
Wear a long jacket or top and a tight tank top or t-shirt with this look.
Remember that you already have a lot going on when you wear shorts with leggings, so either own it and wear lots of layers, or keep it simple, but don't go for something in between.
If the sweater and boots are a simple, solid color, try some patterned leggings.

, Leggings that are zebra or leopard striped or covered with hypnotic can give you a fun and flashy look. Make sure you wear them with an understated top, skirt, dress, pants or shoes. Let your leggings steal the show and avoid clashing by not having other patterns get in the way of your style. If you're wearing loud leggings and an understated top, pair them with some loud jewelry.

, Stick to mostly black or at least solid-colored leggings in the workplace. If you wear patterned lacy black leggings, you may look too trashy for the workplace. Funky-patterned leggings can be fun for after work, but they are too playful for a work environment.


If your leggings have subtle tiny polka dots running over dark material and they almost look solid, that can be an exception.

, If you wear a fancy top, it can help play up your leggings and make them look more fancy and appropriate for work. Here are some tops that you can wear over the leggings:


Wear a tailored jacket over a simple shift dress and pair it with cotton leggings.
Wear a loose top and a solid-color skirt with your leggings. Make sure the skirt doesn't fall too high above your knee to avoid looking too provocative. The loose top should be fancy enough to tie the whole look together.

, If you have a long, thick sweater that falls below your fingertips, you may be able to pull it off with leggings. Wear a belt around the sweater and high boots that match the sweater.


To pull this look off at work, the sweater has to look really nice.

, Sandals look great with leggings but aren't acceptable for most work places. Avoid sandals in a professional work environment, especially with leggings, which will look even more casual.


Pair the leggings with low or high black boots.
Pair them with close-toed shoes with a little bit of a heel.

, You can pair a flowing tunic top with denim leggings and ballet flats. To dress it up more for work, add a couple of long chain necklaces or a decorative scarf. You'll look trendy and casual at the same time.


Avoid wearing leggings with shorts to work. Though this may be a cute look if you're out with your friends, avoid the look in the workplace even if it's a casual day. You wouldn't wear shorts to work on casual Friday, and the same goes for shorts with leggings, unless, they are properly tailored shorts.

",How to Apply Makeup for a Fresh and Clean Look," Wash the brushes and applicators with warm water and dish soap, and your face with warm water and cleanser. Apply lotion to your face.;
, Apply it evenly on the affected area, but not around it. Doing so will create a ""halo effect."" Remember to choose a concealer that either matches your skin color or is a shade lighter.

, Foundation will look fake and silly otherwise, and will not help with the fresh and clean look. If you are using it, apply as little as possible and blend very well. If there is a clear distinction between where there is foundation and is not, you're using the wrong shade. Don't test it on the back of your hand, the skin there is always darker than on the face. Go to a makeup counter and get their help, or ask an older friend or relative to help you.

, Apply only a small amount, and only to the areas that really need it - typically the T-zone, the forehead, nose, and chin. Applying it underneath the eye or on the cheeks can remove the natural glow of these areas and make the skin look aged. Brush it on gently but thoroughly, you don't want to be able to see specks of powder still on. Again, if there is distinction between where it is applied and where it isn't you're using the wrong colour. Some people prefer to use a powder-puff or sponge applicator to apply powder. It's a personal choice and you should experiment until you find what works best for you.

, For the clean look, stick to light browns, ivories, and pinks and very VERY pale purples. Anything a shade or two darker than your skin tone will look nice as well. For the clean look, try to avoid anything bright or too colorful, such as greens or blues. A little bit of shimmer will brighten the eyes, but don't go for anything glittery during the day. Eyeshadow should be applied with a brush or the sponge-tip applicators they often come with. Close one eye and touch the brush or applicator to the shadow. If you are using a brush gently tap it against the inside lid of the shadow container to get rid of excess. Lightly sweep it across the lid. Repeat with the other eye. Once over is enough, it should not appear completely opaque.

, A tip often given is to gently pinch the back of your hand or your wrist and match the colour of the blush to the colour your skin turns. When in doubt, ask for help at a makeup counter or from an older friend. Remember not to use too much blush when applying! Sweep the brush across the blush, and smile at yourself in the mirror. Apply the blush to the ""apples,"" the part of your cheek that appears round when you smile, and sweep gently up and back, towards your hairline. For a healthy look, do not apply elsewhere and keep well blended.

, For the clean look it is best to go with lip-gloss in clear, light pink, or brown or bronze. The shade of brown or bronze should not be more than two shades darker than your skin tone. Lipstick may be worn in light pink, brown, or bronze if you desire, but will look much more made up.

, Use a large, fluffy brush and apply it all over your face in a soft, circular motion.

It's even more important to make sure your face is clean at the end of the day. Always be sure to remove your makeup before you go to bed. Leaving it on overnight can clog your pores and cause acne. Many dermatologists recommend using disposable exfoliating wipes to remove makeup.;
, If you plan on spending time in the sun, be sure to start with some sunblock. Use a product made especially for faces, as these are less likely to leave goopy residue that makes applying makeup difficult. If your skin is prone to dryness and flaking, be sure to massage in a dollop of moisturizer. Makeup can temporarily disguise flakey skin, but will be obvious and look even worse by the end of the day. If you need both, apply your sunscreen first.







, Primer helps makeup go on easier and last longer. Simply dab some onto your fingertips to apply it. Work the primer into your skin wherever you plan on wearing makeup. If you'll be wearing foundation, this means your forehead, nose, chin, and cheeks.









If you'll be wearing eyeliner or eyeshadow, add some primer to your eyelids and the space underneath your eyebrows. General makeup primer usually works fine in these areas. However, more gentle primers designed especially for eyelids are also available., Foundations come in many varieties, each offering different benefits and drawbacks. While some use solid foundation sticks, liquid foundations tend to be the more popular option.


Finding the right foundation can be a challenge. You want one that best matches your natural skin tone.
If your skin is prone to irritation, you'll need to look for foundations that are advertised as ""gentle"" and ""for sensitive skin.""
Additionally, quality foundation is expensive, so you may not be able to afford trial and error. When choosing a new foundation, try talking to beauticians at a makeup counter in a department store or cosmetics shop. They will most likely offer to do your makeup for free. They'll pick out the perfect shade to match your skin tone, and you can get an idea of how different products feel on your skin. Don't feel obligated to buy anything that day.

, A thin, even layer of foundation will work to smooth out your skin and give it a uniform appearance. How you apply your foundation will be determined by the type you've chosen.









For liquid or cream foundations, start by adding a very small dollop close to the center of your face (such as the side of your nose) and apply it outward. You may use your fingertips, a foundation brush, or a makeup sponge. Add more as needed. Don't massage the foundation into your skin. Instead, use light, stroking movements as if you were painting on a canvas.Most solid foundations come as a tube or stick. For these, you can either use your fingers to pick up some product and apply as you would a liquid, or you can use the stick directly on your skin. Applying directly from the stick to your skin will give you better coverage but will result in a thicker layer.
No matter which type of foundation you use, it's important to blend your makeup well to make it look natural. Use small circular motions with your applicator of choice until it looks seamless on your skin., If you have any uneven areas that show through your foundation, such as pimples or dark circles under your eyes, you can cover them up with a little concealer. Dab a tiny amount to these areas and blend the concealer using the same technique you used for your foundation.









Choose a concealer the same way you would a foundation. Unlike foundation, however, it's good to pick a concealer that is one or two shades lighter than your natural skin tone. Because it doesn't have to be exact, testing concealer on your hand can help you narrow down your choices.

, When using foundation, you should always finish with a powder. This will help your makeup to set, making it last longer and keeping it from rubbing off. Use a brush to lightly dust on some translucent powder to your forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin.







, For bronzer, choose a relatively neutral shade that is just a little darker than your natural skin tone. For blush, try to match the color your skin turns when it's flushed. For lighter skin tones, go for pinks and peaches. Good blush colors for medium skin are a muted mauve, rose, apricot, or berry. On dark skin, dramatic colors like raisin, brick red, and bright tangerine work best. They may seem too bold for an everyday makeup, but these colors will end up looking subtle and neutral when applied to darker skin tones.Some people use bronzer to contour their cheekbones. If you're going this route, you'll need at least two shades of bronzer: one a little lighter than your natural skin color and one a little darker. Use a clean makeup brush to add the lighter shade first to your cheekbones. Then follow up with the darker shade underneath. Use a brush to blend both together with the rest of your makeup for a natural look.

, If you haven't primed your eye area, make sure to do so before you begin putting on your eyeshadow. Use your fingertips to massage in a small amount of primer onto your eyelids and the area just above your eye crease. You can use either the same primer you used for the rest of your face or a specialty eye primer. When using a face primer, check its packaging to make sure it's safe for eyes.







, You'll need at least two colors to start, with one darker than the other.Think about the look you want to have. When it comes to eyeshadow, you have three general options:


The natural look. With this look, many people won't even notice you're wearing eye makeup. Pick colors that are close to your skin tone. Use a neutral eyeshadow palette made up of peaches, olives, tans, and/or browns.
The smoky look. For smoky eyes, you'll definitely look like you're wearing makeup. However, this is a very popular look right now with many people incorporating it into their everyday makeup. Use a palette of dark grays and charcoals. Avoid true black eyeshadow, as it's difficult to create depth when working with black.The colorful look. For this, anything goes. Pick your favorite color or one that compliments your eyes. For shadows, use either a darker version of this color or a smoky charcoal.

, This will serve as your base color. Depending on the look you want, apply your base to just your eyelid or from your eyelid to your eyebrows. Use either a thin makeup brush or an eyeshadow applicator.







, Cover the entire eyelid but stop at your eye crease. Start from your lash line and brush the eyeshadow up to your eye crease. Blend it well with your base color using the same circular ""buffing"" motions you used for your foundation.







, You can use an eyeliner pencil, brush on liquid eyeliner, or layer the liquid over the solid.Use black or dark brown. If you're going for a colorful look, you may choose to use a darker version of your eyeshadow's shade instead.









Begin by marking your lashline. Start from the outside corner of your eye and work inwards towards your nose.Even out the line with the smudging tool on the other side of your eyeliner. Simply go back over the pigment until you have one continuous, gapless line of dark color. If your eyeliner doesn't have a smudger, use a cotton swab instead.Many people apply eyeliner to just their upper lid. However, if you choose to do both lids, make sure the liner connects at the outer corners of your eyes., When doing your eye makeup, you'll want to focus on your lashes last. Curling your lashes will make them look much longer. Be sure to position your curler at the base of your lashes near the lashline for the best effect. Add a swipe of mascara afterwards.You can always skip the curler and wear mascara on uncurled lashes.








, Just like your eyeshadow, you will have to choose between natural-looking lip colors and ones that are obviously makeup. For everyday makeup, most people like to go with neutral pinks and browns that are closest to their natural lip color. Others like to add classic red or plum lipstick. Still others eschew color altogether and simply apply some clear lip gloss or lip balm. It's up to you to decide what look is right for you.









Regardless, you should add your lip color last when all of your other makeup has dried. Bring your product with you in case you need to refresh it later in the day.
Many people simply apply their lip color of choice and blot their lips. However, there are a few tricks you can use to make application easier and look more professional.
Start by adding foundation or lip balm to your lips to act as a primer for your lip color.
Sketch out your lip line with a neutral pencil before adding your color. This will help you define your lips and avoid sloppy application."

Be both bold and balanced.",How to Wear Leather Leggings," Most leather leggings are actually made with faux leather instead of the real deal, but you can go with either option.Most faux leather is made from stretchy fabric, like spandex, coated with some form of black polyurethane.
Faux leather is generally cheaper and easier to care for. You can usually wash faux leather in your washing machine without damaging the material, but real leather tends to be more temperamental.;
, Leather leggings are available in both matte and glossy finishes, so it helps to know which type you're interested in before shopping.


Matte leggings are more subtle, which may make them more versatile additions to your wardrobe. They're a good choice if you want to ease your way into the style rather than jumping in head first.
Gloss leggings, also called ""liquid"" leggings, are shiny and loud, so you'll undoubtedly attract plenty of attention when you wear them. The extra attention can be great if you have the shape and style to live up to it, but if not, gloss leggings might not be the best choice.
Snake print leggings are another option. The texture gives the material more visual interest without making it as loud as a high-gloss finish, making it a good choice when you want something bolder than matte leggings yet more subtle than gloss leggings.

, Black leather leggings and dark brown leather leggings are the easiest to find, and with good reason. These two options are the most versatile and easiest to style well.


That being said, you can find leather leggings in white, red, and a range of other colors. Like glossy leggings, though, brightly colored leggings tend to be loud and may even seem obnoxious if you don't pair them with the exact right pieces.

, It should go without saying, but it is absolutely crucial that your leather leggings actually fit your body well. When in doubt, go with a size larger rather than a size that feels a little snug.


Leather and faux leather are both pretty unforgiving fabrics with regards to body shape. If the material stretches taut over your legs and waist, expect to see every fold highlighted in an unappealing manner.

, Leather leggings are more structured than many other types of leggings, but ultimately, they're still leggings. As such, they look best when worn with slightly longer tops that cover the waist and crotch.


Avoid cropped tops and tops that must be tucked into your bottoms. If you absolutely must wear these types of pieces with leather bottoms, leather pants would be a much better option than leather leggings.

, On its own, leather can look tough or seductive. Pairing it with soft materials and loose shapes can cut down some of this inherent edginess. Your casual top will look more chic, and your leather leggings will look more practical.Try wearing a fluffy sweater during colder weather or a printed t-shirt during slightly warmer weather. Tunics and casual blouses can also work.
Balance the color as well as the shape. Soft pastel colors create a feminine tone, while muted colors can look simple and urban-chic.

, If you want to create something more sophisticated, try pairing your leather leggings with well-cut classic pieces. These bottoms may never be fit for the office, but pairing them with ""business casual"" tops can give your weekend look a major style boost.


Try wearing a long button-down shirt or collared blouse. Throw on a structured blazer to give the look a firmer touch, or slip on a cardigan to soften it up a bit.
Some sweaters can also look more formal than others, so while they won't work for the ""cozy"" look, they might work for the ""classy"" look. The right black sweater, in particular, can make your ensemble slightly sultrier without getting too carried away.

, Pairing leather leggings with a leather top or leather coat can easily overwhelm your ensemble. As a general rule, other materials and textures usually look much better.


If you do decide to wear leather with leather, make sure that you break up the look in some other way. Choose two different colors of leather—for instance, black leather leggings and a beige leather coat. Break it up further by mixing other materials into the the look, too.

, Since leather leggings are quite bold and sexy, you need to avoid tops that are equally bold and seductive since they'll likely compete with the leather instead of complementing it. Too much of a good thing can become very bad, very quickly.


There's nothing wrong with showing off the curves of your body, but you should generally avoid tops that are severely tight-fitting. Adding different shapes and layers will create a much better sense of balance.
Similarly, you should probably avoid bold prints or other loud textures. While those clothes may look fantastic when paired with other bottoms, they'll probably make your ensemble seem too busy when matched with leather leggings.

, Know what sort of style you're going for before picking out shoes to wear with your leather leggings. The right shoe can give your look an entirely new tone; likewise, the wrong shoe can throw everything off.It's usually easier to pick your top first and your shoes second, but do what works for you. Either way, the two pieces should coordinate with one another.
Most shoes will give this outfit the same tone they'd give any other outfit. In other words, casual shoes will make your leggings look more casual and sophisticated shoes will make your leggings look more sophisticated.

, Most shoe styles can work well with leather leggings, but there are a few that tend to clash.


Flip-flop sandals and cork wedges tend to clash. These shoe styles scream ""summer,"" but leather leggings are generally restricted to the autumn, winter, and spring months.
Strappy high-heel dress shoes only work if they look relatively plain. Ones that are decorated with glitter, rhinestones, or other loud elements will likely compete for attention and throw off your style.

, Both stiletto heels and chunky heels can work well with leather leggings, but try to avoid heavy platforms and strappy numbers.


Closed-toe pumps and open-toe pumps are both classy enough options. Strappy stilettos can take the ""sexiness"" of leather leggings over the top, though, and not in a good way.
Thin stiletto heels can make your outfit look chic and sophisticated. Chunky heels, on the other hand, will amp up the ""rock n' roll"" overtones of your leather leggings.

, Ballet flats and sneakers are your best options when you want to tone down your look while still appearing chic and trendy.


Ballet flats are the easier option to pull off. Most flat styles have a simple, classy appeal that can keep your ensemble looking polished without becoming too formal.
Sneakers can look great if the rest of your style matches, but it's easy to go wrong. The right sneakers can create a sporty-chic style, but the sneakers themselves must be in ""like new"" condition and should be fairly stylish on their own.

, Ankle boots are the easiest to pair with leather leggings, but knee to thigh high boots can also work. Tall boots need to look classy, though.


In other words, avoid tall boots with thin stick heels and severely pointed toes. These boots tend to look a little too ""sexy,"" and when paired with leather leggings, they could make your outfit look trashier instead of trendier.
Consider choosing a boot color that matches your legging color. Doing so can give your leg a seamless look, which may make you look taller and leaner.

, Like your top and shoes, your makeup should complement the leather leggings instead of competing with it. Light, natural makeup usually works best.


If you want to try using bolder makeup, focus on one facial feature and opt for bright colors rather than dark or glitzy cosmetics. For instance, red lipstick can work under some circumstances, but deep burgundy shades are more likely to make you look goth. Similarly, a sweep of bright eyeshadow can bring out your eyes, but heavy eyeliner will only weigh your appearance down.

, Leather leggings are so bold that they'll usually act as the focal point of your outfit. You can wear accessories, but these accessories should balance out your bottoms instead of competing for the spotlight.


Stick with accessories that draw attention to the upper half of your body and avoid those that create more weight on the bottom. Belts, bracelets, and rings will sit too close to the leggings and may end up clashing as a result. On the other hand, the right hat, scarf, earrings, or necklace can add a little visual interest to the top of your outfit without overwhelming the bottom half.

, Look in the mirror and do a style check after putting your entire outfit together. Leather leggings are naturally bold, so you'll need to wear them with confidence. As with any clothing item, though, you need to wear this piece in a balanced way that accentuates your natural beauty instead of burying it.

, Shorts made of linen are great for summer or hot spring days. Linen is a great breathable fabric for when it is hot outside. Look for high-waisted linen shorts with a drawstring for a casual, relaxed look. You can also get linen shorts with a zipper and top button for a more put together look., Tucking your shirt into the waistband of your high waisted shorts will show off the high waist of the shorts. Tuck in a t-shirt for a casual look or try tucking in a button up shirt for a more dressy look. Get a pattern silk or cotton button up for the shorts and tuck it in.


When you tuck your shirt in, make sure that the fabric left out is straight and even. Check the shorts from the back and the front to make sure the shirt is tucked in evenly.

, A cropped top stops just above the narrowest part of your waist. Look for a cropped top that hits just above the top button of your high-waisted shorts. Get cropped tops in cotton, silk, or linen for a fun spring or summer look.


Be especially bold with a bralette top. A bralette top is a vintage-inspired piece that is very form fitting and usually stops just above the belly button. The outline of your bra area shows through the top, making it very daring.

, If you're interested in wearing your shorts for a casual-dressy affair, you can pair them with a loose blouse. Loose fitting blouses tend to pair well with tighter high waisted shorts, while slim fitting blouses tend to work better with shorts that are looser in the legs.

This further accentuates the skinniest part of your figure and can be very flattering.

, A belt can be one of the best, most natural style accessories to match with high waisted shorts. Make sure the shorts have belt loops if you plan to wear them with a belt. Choose a skinny belt in a neutral color to accentuate your waist. Or go for a thick leather belt with high-waisted jean shorts to keep the shorts up., When you are putting together an outfit with the high-waisted shorts, strive for a balance between color and pattern on the top and bottom. You can wear all neutrals or incorporate a classic pattern like a pinstripe or a texture like lace on either the top or bottom. Keep the details to one or the other, though, and do not wear pattern or texture on both your top and bottom.The other alternative is to use color. You can stick to simple patterns or all solids if you include a little color, but adding color to the top will generally look dressier if your shorts are in a neutral color.

, Flat sandals or basic flats work especially well for a casual summer look with the high-waisted shorts. Pair the shorts with a casual top and sandals or flats for a day out.You can also try sandals or flats made of leather for a dressier look.

, This will determine whether or not you can wear these as a pair of pants, or if you should layer other clothes over them. Tuck your hand inside the leg and pull the fabric taught. If you can see your skin, you will need to layer the leggings with other clothes. If you can't see your skin, then the leggings are safe to be worn as pants.

, Tight pants may be in fashion, but too-tight pants will never look good or feel comfortable. When buying leggings, try to do a few squats; you should be able to move around easily.

Use a measuring tape.,
Use a pair of pants that fit you well.,
Lay your pants flat on the floor.,
Measure the waist of your pants.,
Measure your actual waist.,
Measure the hips.,
Measure your inseam.,
Measure your front rise.",How to Measure Your Pants," Tailors, seamstresses, clothiers, and other garment makers generally use tape measures to get the correct measurements of a person when fitting for clothes or altering items. These portable, flexible tools are your best friend when it comes to measuring your pants.


When measuring with a tape measure, pull the tape taut, but don't stretch it. Clothing tape measures are often made of a soft synthetic material that can distort if stretched, resulting in inaccurate measurements.
You can also use a plastic measuring tape that you might find in your toolkit. This type of tape measure isn’t as easy to use, but it will still bend, allowing you to measure curves.;
, If you’re measuring your pants to figure out which style and size is right for you, it’s best to use a pair of pants that fit you properly. Ideally these pants will not be too worn out or stretched. The legs of the pants should also extend roughly to your ankle bone, or a little lower depending on preference.


Not all types of pants will have the same measurements. Grab a few different kinds of pants that fit you well. Dress pants will be slightly different than chinos, or jeans.

, The easiest way to measure pants is to lay the pants on a flat surface. If you try to measure a pair of pants that you are wearing, you may not get the right measurements as you shift your body to see the measurements.


Your pants shouldn’t be too worn in so that you can get a realistic measurement.
If the pants you are measuring are wrinkled, quickly smooth the fabric out with an iron.
Measuring your pants is mostly the same for both men and women. However, sizing for men is typically represented by the length of the measurement in inches, whereas women’s sizes are typically represented by another number.

, To get the most accurate measurement of your pant’s waist lay the pants flat on the floor. Smooth the pants out so there is no bunching. Don’t stretch the pants, though. Measure flat across the back waistband from one corner to the other. Double the number to get the actual waist size.








Make sure your pants are also facing up, with the front pockets facing the ceiling.
If your pants are lying correctly, the front part of the waistband will be resting slightly below the back.

, You may want to measure your actual waist, but also the waist of your pants to get an accurate size. To measure your waist, wear underwear or similar clothing that is well fitting. Make your measurement at your natural waist. This is at the thinnest portion of your body, between your ribs and your belly button. You can find your natural waist by bending to the side and seeing where your body creases. Wrap the measuring tape around your waist and record the measurement where the tape meets itself. Look at your measurement without bending. Use a mirror to help you.








Keep one finger between the tape and your body as you measure. This keeps you from drawing the tape too tightly.
Resist the urge to draw your stomach in. Try to stand as you normally would, while still having proper posture.
Keep the measuring tape parallel to the floor for an accurate measurement.
If you are having a hard time finding where your waist is, wrap your hands around your stomach and squeeze slightly. Then, move your hands down until you feel the top of your hip bone.
By measuring your waist and the waist of your pants separately, you can learn what your actual waist size is, and the actual size of your pant’s waistline as the two might be slightly different.

, Measure across your pants at the base of the zipper. Make sure that you go to the edge of each seam. Once you’ve measured the front, double the number to get the whole measurement.









When measuring your pants on the floor, make sure to measure from the outer stitching of each seam.

, Starting from the crotch, where the pieces of fabric in your pants intersect, draw the measuring tape down the inside of one leg and to the very bottom of the pant leg where it would naturally hang around your shoe. You can also wear a pair of pants and stand straight with your back against the wall to get another measurement for accuracy. However, this method works best if you have a friend to measure for you.








Note that inseams are usually measured to the nearest half-inch.Use a pair of pants that fit you well to get the most accurate measurement on your inseam.
If you are measuring alone, tape the measuring tape to the inside of your heel, or the bottom of your pants (whichever you prefer) and then measure upwards.
If the leg of your pants doesn't sit where you'd like it to (if you cuff your pants), measure to where you'd like your pair of pants to end.

, To measure the front rise of your pants, start at the bottom center of the crotch seam and measure up to the top of the waistband. Rises usually range from 7 inches (180 mm) to 12 inches (300 mm).








Pants typically come in a regular rise, low rise, and high rise. Low sits below the waist, regular at the waist, and high above the waist.
Note that the definition of the rise measurement varies. Some define the ""rise"" as the measurement extending from the back of the waistband down between the legs and up to the front of the waistband.

Tuck in your shirt.",How to Wear Harem Pants2," Cropped jackets and tops with harem pants look great because they allow the pants to be the obvious feature.

To help define your waist, stick with a crop top, or try wearing a belt around the smallest parts of your waist., If you do not want to wear a crop top, or your harem pants are not high waisted enough for one, wear a shirt that cuts off just below the top of the pants. This way, your shirt will give you the coverage that you need without covering so much of the pants that it looks sloppy. The top can be slightly lose or fitted, just not baggy.

, If you are wearing a longer shirt with your harem pants, it is important to tuck it in to avoid looking sloppy. A proper tuck is one that is slightly lose, but not billowy or coming undone.Watch out for shirts that are shorter in the front than in the back. These shirts do not tuck as well in the front, and you may be better off not tucking this style.

, Black yoga pants fit right into many fashionable outfits. You might be able to pull of a neutral, solid-color shade, but the pants should not be the focal point.

The waist should be snug enough to fit without the help of a belt. Basically, find a waist that is not too tight or loose and does not sag., The seat, or the butt area, of your pants should be snug. That area should not sag or be so tight that you can’t comfortably sit down. Sometimes, the rest of the pants will fit comfortably, but the seat will be too loose. If this is the case, take your pants to the tailor for an alteration., You should be able to pinch 1/2” to 1” (1.3 to 2.5 cm)of fabric around your thighs. The pants are too tight if you can’t pinch any loose fabric at all. If there is a lot of extra fabric, the pants are too big. It’s okay, however, if there is slightly more fabric than an inch., The pants should get narrower towards the calf if you have a thin or regular build. The calves should be fitted, but still have about ½” (1.3 cm) of excess fabric that could be pinched. The ankles should be the narrowest part of the pants., A tapered look is not the ideal style for a person with a wider or heavier build. Instead, opt for a straight cut. A straight cut will balance out your proportions."

Make your choice based on the style that looks the best with your body shape and what you feel most comfortable in.For example, high-waisted pants tend to flatter most body shapes. Choose mid-rise if you want to play down the size of your lower half. Low-rise pants work best on athletic frames.The majority of lace-up pants will be black and have the slim fit of skinny jeans. Choose a stretchy material for the most comfortable fit.;
, Black leather lace-ups are the most daring option. They can be styled in a variety of ways, so you can play up or tone down their raciness according to your personal tastes. Most of the leather versions lace-up either along the side seam or down the front of the legs, so be aware that your skin will peek through the lace holes all the way up to your thighs.Wear a longer top if you want to minimize the amount of skin you show around the thigh-area.
Wear a crop or waist-length top for a more daring look.

, These pants are more accessible, easier to style and more comfortable than the leather lace-ups. They usually lace up along the side seam of the pant legs, from the ankle all the way up to the waistband. Because of this, the jeans are still somewhat revealing. However, you do have some control over how much skin you show.For example, if you want to show a little less skin, wear a pair of eye-catching tights under the pants. You can also tighten the laces at the hips, which will narrow the peek-a-boo gap around the thigh area.

, These pants lace up in the front, and the laces hold the pants closed instead of the traditional zipper and button closures. They are casual and easy to wear while still being on-trend. Choose a black pair with a high waist for a laidback look. For the most comfort, look for stretchy denim or velvet versions.These typically come in a wider range of colors than the other lace-ups, but stick to black or dark wash for the most flattering and fashionable results.

, Because they are quite revealing, lace-up pants shouldn’t be worn just anywhere. Never where them to school or work, for example. Save your lace-up pants for appropriate occasions like attending a party, hanging out with friends or going out on the town.


Leather lace-ups are probably the most inappropriate pair for wearing in public during the day.
Tightening the laces and/or wearing colorful tights underneath the pants are two ways you can tone down their revealing nature.

Go out in your sporty new hakama pants and wow them!

",How to Make Hakama Pants," Traditional male hakama pants are made from a stiff silk material, but a more modern style can be made from a medium weight cotton fabric (about the weight of bed sheeting).
, Iron smooth if the laundering process produces a wrinkled material.,, These strips will become the straps that secure the samurai pants.

Each fabric strip should be long enough to go around the intended wearer's waist with 8-10"" (20-25 cm) to spare.

, Sew two of the strips together along the short edges, leaving the third strip at its original length— half the length of the long strip., Fold each strip in half lengthwise and pin, then sew a seam along the unfinished edges to create two tubes. Turn both tubes inside out so the seam is on the inside with the unfinished edges no longer visible, then set the tubes aside., Fold the remaining fabric in half lengthwise and carefully cut along the fold. These two pieces will form the legs of your samurai pants., Then, set one on top of the other so the folded edges are facing you and the unfinished edges away from you., Cut a half ""U"" on the folded side of both leg pieces, starting approximately 1/3 of the way down the pants. Start perpendicular to the fold and curve smoothly to form the bottom of the ""U"". When you come parallel to the fold, run along the parallel line up to the top fabric edge.

The inner or middle part of the ""U"" should be facing you.
Make sure to cut both leg pieces equally.

, When you unfold them, each should have a full ""U"" through the middle of the top third of each of the pant pieces. Lay the two unfolded pant pieces on top of each other. The ""U"" shapes should match. If not, make the necessary adjustments.,

Place the leg pieces on top of each other with the ""U"" in the middle.
Pin and sew the pieces together along the ""U"" shape to fasten the crotch area.
For security, you probably want to use a double seam here.

, The newly sewn crotch should be in the middle with the sewn edge up and the pant legs on either side of the seam., Pinning first, begin approximately 6-8"" (15-20 cm) from the top of the pant and continue all the way to the bottom., Use closely spaced stitches and a double line of stitching., The sewn portions will now be on the inside of the pants., Fold and pin four evenly spaced pleats on the front top of the hakama pants with all folds facing the middle of the pants - i.e., the two folds on each side will face each other., Sew a straight line across only the top front of the samurai pants, approximately 2-3"" (5-7.5 cm) from the top. Reinforce the pants by sewing a second line to make them more sturdy., Fold two pleats on the backside of the pants with both folds facing the middle of the pants, then pin the pleats in place., Sew two straight lines along the top backside of the pants, just as you did in the front. They should be approximately 2-3"" (5-7.5 cm) from the top— the same as in the front., Iron both the tubes so that the seams run fairly straight down the middle of one side of each tube so that they become strips., This can be done with a sewing machine or by hand., Take the longer tube and place it along the front of the hakama pants, aligning the finished end of the strip with the crotch seam. This strip will be the tie that wraps around your back and continues on around to the front where you tie the pants., Pin the tube/strip along the top edge of the pants with the seam down, then sew along the bottom edge of the strip. Start at the front, then continue along the backside of the hakama pants. For extra durability, sew the top length of the strip to the pants as well.


Note: The seam of the tube should be hidden on the underside, against the pant fabric.

Terminate the stitching with a rectangle (long edge across the width of the tie). You can stitch an ""X"" within the rectangle to build in long term durability at this strain point.

, Take the shorter tube and lay it against the backside of the hakama pants, again positioning the finished end of the tube on the crotch seam. This strip will only wrap around to the front as a tie. Sew it in place along the top and bottom edge, stopping on the side or continuing a bit onto the front. Again, terminate the stitching with an ""X""ed rectangle.,

Remove all pins from the hakama pants and try them on.
Cut the tie strips so that each extends beyond the belly button about 9-11"" (23-28 cm).

, Again, this can be done by hand or with a sewing machine., Try the pants on in order to fit them to your specific leg length, making sure to secure them where they will be worn.

Secure the the pants by tying the tie strips in front, making sure the fit is comfortable.
The ideal pant length is with the bottom hem at the malleolus, or big part of the ankle bone.
Cut excess fabric from the bottom cuffs of each leg and hem them to finish your samurai hakama pant look.

Choose your pants.,
Decide if you'd like to bleach the entire garment or tie dye.,
Put on a pair of latex gloves to protect yourself from the bleach.,
Make the bleach solution.,
Place the pants in the bleach solution.,
Leave to soak for several hours.,
Rinse them out.,
Dry the pants.,
Try them on!",How to Bleach Pants1," Before you decide to go ahead and bleach any pair of pants in your wardrobe, take some time to consider the fabric and quality of the pants.


Bleaching works best on fabrics like denim, cotton, rayon, linen and polyester. The pants should also be of fairly good quality, as bleaching can disintegrate thin or weak fabrics.
Before you decide to bleach your favorite pair of jeans, it may be a good idea to test the bleaching process out with an older pair first. Good quality, second-hand jeans from a thrift store are perfect for this.
Just make sure that the pants you are bleaching have no holes or tears, as the bleach can eat away at the edges and cause them to widen.;
, Depending on what kind of look you are trying to achieve, you can either bleach the pants so they are uniformly lightened all over or you can tie them to achieve a funky tie dyed look.









If you want them bleached evenly, you don't need to do anything, but if you want to create a tie dye effect, you will need to ball the pants up in your hands, then use two large rubber bands to hold the pants in the ball shape.

, Bleach is corrosive and can damage your skin, so it is best to protect your hands with a pair of latex or rubber gloves.


You may also want to change into an old pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt, as any splashes could bleach your clothing.

, To make the bleach solution, you will need to mix one part bleach with either four parts or three parts water, depending on how light you want the pants to be and how quickly you need to bleach them. Any kind of bleach can be used; even generic brands will work just fine.









Mix the solution in a large plastic tub or basin, or a sink that you will not be using for several hours.
New, fresh bleach will work better than old bleach and will be more effective when mixed with warm water, rather than cold.
The volume of solution does not matter as long as there is enough to completely submerge the pants.

, Place the pants - either loose or tied with rubber bands - into the bleach solution. Mix them around for a minute or two to ensure that they are completely submerged in the bleach and water.









Bleach will process better on damp material, so it is a good idea to rinse the jeans in some warm water to dampen them before placing them in the bleach solution.

, Once you are happy that your pants are completely soaked in the bleach solution, all you need to do it sit back and let it process. The time this takes will vary completely, depending on the fabric and level of bleaching you wish to achieve.


If you just want to lighten the pants very slightly, you may only need to soak them for under an hour. On the other hand, if you wish to lighten very dark jeans, it may take several hour or overnight.
Check on the pants every hour or so to see if they've reached the desired level of bleaching. Keep in mind that they will be a shade or two once they're dry.

, Once you are happy that the pants have been bleached to your liking, you will need to remove them from the bleach solution and rinse them thoroughly. The best way to do this is to use the spin cycle on your washing machine.


Make sure to put the pants in the washing machine on their own, otherwise the excess bleach could stain your other clothes!
If you went with the tie dye option, remember to remove the rubber bands before rinsing.

, Hang your pants in a well-ventilated or outdoor area until dry, or put them in your dryer.








, Try on your newly bleached pants and decide if you'd like to repeat the process to lighten them further. Some colors may require additional soaking to achieve the desired color or texture.

Rinse and dry the pants.",How to Bleach Pants2," In a clean plastic spray bottle, mix one part bleach with three parts water.








, Lay the pants you wish to bleach out flat on a plastic tarp or sheets of newspaper. This will prevent your flooring from becoming stained by the bleach.









If you only want to bleach one side of the jeans, stuff the legs full of balled-up newspaper to prevent the bleach from soaking through.

, As you will be spraying the bleach, it is a good idea to wear safety goggles to protect your eyes.

, Start spraying your jeans with the bleach. If you have a plastic bottle with an adjustable nozzle, you can decide whether you want to spray the jeans with a concentrated blast of bleach (for an all-over bleached effect) or lightly mist the jeans with bleach (for more of a weathered look).








, The great thing about this bleaching method is that you can be more precise in terms of the details you wish to add. Use masking tape to create a stencil on the pants (stars, stripes, crosses) and spray inside the stencil to create funky bleached designs.









Dip a paint brush into the bleach solution and, wearing latex gloves, flick the bristles backwards onto the pants to create a cool splatter effect with the bleach. Just be very careful to flick the bleach onto the pants and not onto your face.
Dip a sponge into the bleach mixture and dab it onto specific areas of the pants. Try dabbing it along the seams, around the pockets and along the belt line for a designer effect.
Use a bleach pen to draw more intricate designs onto the pants .

, Once you are happy with your designs, you should leave the bleach to sit on the pants for about five to ten minutes to soak in.

, Put the pants through a normal wash cycle in your washing machine, without adding detergent. Dry thoroughly.

, Remove the pants from the bleach solution and add them to your washing machine. If you have any white towels you wish to freshen up with a little bleach, you can add them to the washing machine too.








, Add the regular amount of your usual laundry detergent to the washer, then add about 3/4 cup of bleach.

, Let the washing machine complete a regular cycle, then dry the pants thoroughly in the dryer, or drip dry outdoors.

Fold the hemmed portion back.,
Iron the hem.",How to Alter Pants1," Determine how short you want to make your pants, and therefore how much length you need to hem. Use a measuring tape to decide how much of the length should be removed (while you’re wearing the pants). Typically, the bottom of the pants should be about ½ an inch from the floor, although this is dependent largely on personal preference.;
, Take the pants off and lay them out flat on a smooth surface. Use a measuring tape to measure the distance from the current hem to the bottom of the pant leg. This is typically about ½ an inch, but will vary between styles of pants.

, Use a series of straight pins to pin across the leg of the pant at the point you want your alteration to be made; this is the place you will hem the pants to. Then, add a second row of straight pins above the new-hem-line in the measurement you just took from the original hem to the bottom of the pants (normally ½ an inch). The original hem will remain intact through the process, so the second row of pins compensates for the small amount of added length that the original hem adds.

, Remove the first row of pins nearer to the bottom of the pant leg. These were used to give you the proper location for the folded pant leg - with the added measurement for the original hem. Save the pins though, as they will be needed for holding the leg in place in the next step.

, Turn the bottom of the pant leg inside out, and fold the bottom of the leg up to the row of pins that are still in place. Smooth out the fabric of the pants to remove any wrinkles and folds, making sure that the fold is even on both sides of the leg. Use the pins you just removed to pin the fold in place ½ an inch below the original hem.

, Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew across the folded portion of the pant leg. Sew just below the original hem on the leg (it should be folded upwards and located near the top of the fold). Keep your stitching straight and even all the way around the leg, then tie off the sewing and cut the threads.

, There now should be a loop of fabric located on the bottom of the pants that you have just hemmed. Turn the leg of the pants right-side-out by folding this small looped section back to the inside of the pant leg. You have successfully hemmed your pant leg!

, Although you can cut off the loop of excess fabric from the hem, it is easier (and more practical) to simply iron the portion of the pant leg. Adjust your iron settings for the type of fabric you’re working with, and run it across the hem to flatten out the loop of fabric. Use plenty of steam in this process to make pressing the hem flat easier."

Wear shorts that are reasonably short.,
Tuck in your shirt for high-wasted shorts.,
Color-block.",How to Wear Shorts1," There are all kinds of stylish options for women of all shapes and sizes. Consider your proportions to select the right style for your body type.


Consider your height: Longer shorts create the impression of shorter legs, while short shorts lengthen the leg, giving the impression of height. Play it safe. Women of most heights can find stylish and flattering shorts that hit around the mid-thigh.
Consider the fit: Shorts that flare out toward the bottom, rather than hugging the thigh, are flattering for petite girls and curvy women alike. Long styles like mid-thigh shorts or Bermudas are best, while taller women might find longer shorts more appropriate.;
, The large pockets on cargo pockets tend to draw attention to your hips and thighs. Instead, opt for shorts in fun bright colors, or with floral patterns. Dark-colored shorts are also slimming and can look both casual and sophisticated paired with the right shoes., Floral or tropical print shorts can be a fun and flashy addition to your wardrobe, especially in the summer months. Pick out prints that take up most of the fabric, letting the smallest amount of background color show between the prints to make them as flattering to your figure as possible.

, Increasingly stylish, popular, and flattering, high-wasted shorts are making a big come back. Experiment with fitted and looser styles to get a feel for what's the most slimming. If you've got a shorter torso or are especially busty, you might consider buying shorter waist-style shorts that will look similar on your body.Buy shorts that extend past the hip, but not quite up to the narrowest part of your waist. These are sometimes called ""mid-rise"" shorts and can be more flattering.

, Many women's styles feature bottoms that are quite short. While wearing short-shorts will elongate your legs and make them look longer, it's not always the most appropriate look for all occasions and is sometimes smarter to opt for a more conservative approach to the length of the shorts.


Rule of thumb regarding length: Nothing but your legs should be sticking out from the bottom of your shorts. This goes for the pockets of jean shorts, underwear, and anything else your shorts cover.






For a professional look, select high-waisted shorts that fit in with the fingertip rule. With the shorts on, let your arms fall loosely to your sides. The bottom of the shorts should be below your fingertips.

, When wearing high-wasted shorts, tuck your shirt in to elongate your stomach and raise your waist. With lower-cut shorts, it's usually best to leave your shirt untucked to avoid creating a dimple at the belt-line that can be somewhat unflattering.

, Pair brightly colored shorts with contrasting brightly colored tops to create a stylish look. Work within the same intensity palate, pairing pastels or neutral colors, say, and create a simple elegant look with shorts, appropriate especially for the summer.

Gather your supplies.,
Move the tub to a well-ventilated area.,
Put on the rubber gloves.,
Fill the tub with bleach and water.,
Put the shorts in the bleach solution.,
Let the shorts bleach.,
Pull the shorts out of the bleach solution.,
Wash the shorts with soap and cool water.,
Dry the shorts.",How to Bleach Shorts1," For this project, you will need: a pair of shorts, rubber gloves, some water, bleach, and a little bit of soap. You will also need a plastic bucket or tub large enough to comfortably fit your shorts. If you do not have any shorts, you can make your own by cutting the legs off of an old pair of jeans.;
, Bleach gives off a strong odor and could make you feel light-headed. The best place to work would be outside, but if this is not possible, make sure that you have at least a window open. Keeping a fan on in the room will give you even more ventilation.

, Although you will be working with diluted bleach, you will still want to protect your skin. Bleach is caustic, and can irritate or burn your skin.

, You will need one part liquid bleach and three to four parts water.How much bleach and water you use will depend on the size of your tub and the shorts. You want the water-bleach solution to be deep enough so that the shorts end up completely submerged once you put them in the tub.

, Make sure that they are completely submerged. If they keep floating to the top, you can pin them down with a heavy object, such as a glass vase or a couple of rocks.

, You can do this by taking the shorts out of the bleach solution and leaving them out in the sun on a bleach resistant surface,or you can simply leave them in the solution for several hours.How long you leave the shorts in the sun or bleach solution depends on how dark the original color was, and how light you want them to become. This can take anywhere between a few hours to over 24 hours.


Consider checking on the shorts every few hours. Bleach is caustic, and it can eat away at the fabric of your shorts. To prevent over-bleaching or ruining your shorts, plan on checking on them every four hours, if possible. The longer you leave your shorts in the bleach solution, the weaker the fibers will become.

, Once the shorts have achieved the lightness you desire, pull them out of the bleach solution and squeeze them to get rid of the extra moisture. If you have left them out in the sun, simply take them out of the sun.

, Gently work some soap into the shorts, and rinse them with cool water until you cannot smell the bleach anymore. The soap will help prevent the bleach from yellowing the fabric., You can do this by setting them out in the sun, or tossing them into the dryer for a few minutes.

Remove the original hem and take your measurements.,
Cut fabric to line the new hem.,
Sew the lining.,
Sew the lining into the pant leg.,
Iron the lining.,
Adjust the fabric for the hem.,
Sew the hem.,
Iron the hem.",How to Alter Pants2," Use a seam ripper to go along the bottom of each pant leg and remove the hem. Pull out all of the thread from the hem and unfold it, exposing the excess fabric. Then, use a measuring tape to measure the width of the pant leg.

, The process involved in lengthening pants is essentially adding lining to the un-hemmed edge, and then creating a very thin hem to allow for more length. Therefore, choose a neutral fabric (it won’t be seen on the outside) which matches your pants and measure it to be the width of the pant leg. Cut 4 strips that are the width of the pant leg +1-inch for the seam allowance, making them 1.5–2 inches (3.8–5.1 cm) high.

, Lay two pieces of the cut fabric face-to-face, and sew the ends together ½-inch from the edge of the fabric. Do this for all 4 pieces of fabric, so that you are left with 2 loops which should fit snugly into the bottom of the pant leg. Turn each loop right-side out so that the finished side of the fabric is facing outwards.

, Turn your pants inside out, and place one of the lining loops into the bottom edge of the pant leg (still with the fabric right-side out). Line up the edges of the two pieces of fabric, and then use a straight stitch to sew along the bottom of the leg, about ¼-inch from the bottom edge. It’s OK if the fabric of the pant leg is uneven or crooked along the edge, as this will be remedied in later steps.

, Remove your pants from the sewing machine, and unfold the lining that you’ve just sewn to the pants, so that the excess fabric sticks out from the end of each pant leg. Use an iron to press and smooth the fabric. Then fold the exposed fabric, bringing the ends to the center of the lining and press the fold with the iron. This should leave a stretch of fabric about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide with a fold/crease extending from the bottom of the pant leg.

, Fold the exposed bit of lining up and over the edge of the bottom of the pant leg. Fold the pant leg just high enough so that all of the lining is exposed, as well as a very small portion of the bottom of the pant leg (about 1/16 of an inch). Then, turn the pants right-side out again. You should not be able to see the lining that you’ve added because of the fold, but if necessary fold the edge of the pants up a bit more to hide it.

, Sew your new hem along the folded pant leg. The hem should be about ½ an inch from the bottom of the pant leg, but can be adjusted depending on the appearance you’re going for. Sew all the way around, being sure that the lining is flat and smooth on the inside of the hem. Once you’ve done this for both legs, you’re done!

, Make a solution of 3 parts vinegar and 1 part water and use it to press the fabric. The solution will remove the wrinkles/fold from the original hem, and make the new hem appear to be the only one the pants have ever had. If you’re out of vinegar, just use your iron with plenty of steam to flatten out the hem."

Take your own measurements.,
Create your pattern.,
Mark your alteration lines.,
Alter the hips/waist of the pants.,
Alter the width of the pants.,
Alter the inseam/crotch.,
Make any final adjustments.",How to Alter Pants3," To determine how much fabric will need to be removed, you’ll need to take accurate measurements of your own figure. Keep in mind that it is easiest to make alterations using even numbers (2 inches difference means you can reduce 1 inch of fabric on each side, for example). Use a soft measuring tape and take and record the following measurements:


The center of your waist to the center of your crotch.
The center of your lower back (wear the waistband sits) to the center of your crotch.
The side seam from your waist to your ankle.
The inseam from the center of your crotch to the ankle.
The distance around your waist.
The distance around your hips.

, Lay a large piece of dressmakers paper out on a flat surface, and then place your pants on top of this. Smooth them out, and then use a pencil to outline them all the way around to form the pattern; if you’re not sure of your tracing skills, measure the pants and your outline to make sure they match up. Then, create your new pattern by overlaying your measurements onto this outline. Draw a new outline of the pants inside the old outline using your measurements. Cut out this pattern when completed.

, Place your pattern on top of the pants, and pin it in place. Use a piece of dressmakers chalk to trace the outline of the altered pattern onto the pants. If necessary, use your measuring tape to match your tracing to the measurements you took of your own body.

, Use a seam ripper to deconstruct the waist of the pants; cut out the waistband on the back of the pants above the bum. Then, cut out the necessary difference in the elastic waistband, and sew it back together. Take in the excess fabric that you’re left with by adding two darts in the center of each buttocks. Measure a ‘V’ shaped dart that goes down 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the waistband and is 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide at the widest point.


If you’re still left with lots of excess fabric, you can add matching darts to the front of the pants.

, Starting at the waist of the pants, you’ll sew downwards along the outside leg seam to make a smaller waist/thigh. The new seam you create won’t go all the way to the hem of the pant leg, but will rather taper into the current pant leg somewhere near the knee. Turn the pants inside out and use a straight stitch to sew from the waistband down to the outer leg seam. You can use an iron to press this seam flat when you’re finished, or you can cut out the excess fabric if you would like.

, If the crotch of your pants hangs too low or is too loose, you can fix it by sewing in a line parallel to the original crotch/inseam. Turn the pants inside out, and starting at the inner thigh sew deeper into the fabric parallel to the seam all the way around. Press the excess fabric to flatten it, or cut it out for a permanent alteration.

, With the aforementioned alterations made, try on your pants and see how they fit! Make note of any further changes/adjustments that need to be made, and fix these now. Otherwise, your pants should be successfully taken in a few sizes.

Wear the right cut.,
Wear the same waist size as your trousers and use a belt.,
Leave your weekend shorts to the weekend.,
Let khaki trump cargo.,
Pair shorts with the appropriate kind of shoes and socks.",How to Wear Shorts2," Shorts should be neither too long nor too short. The hem of appropriately-cut shorts should fall just above the knee when you're standing up straight, and should be no more than an inch or two higher when you're seated.In some zones (read: hipster) short jean shorts, also known as jorts, are increasingly popular, while elsewhere extra-long baggy shorts that hang below the knee are stylish. If you're curious about whether or not you can pull off either of these styles, it's probably a safe bet to go traditional and leave the experiments to the trend-setters.

, Shorts should sit on your hips normally, like jeans or trousers. Always wear an appropriate belt when you wear shorts. Other than looking professional, shorts have a tendency to sag that you want to avoid. Keep your underwear under your shorts and make sure you've got a belt on.

, There's nothing wrong with wearing those old soccer shorts while you're sitting around the house watching the game, or keeping on the ratty old cargo shorts you've had since high school while you do the laundry. No shame. But even if you're in the middle of a heat wave, don't wear them out to work on Monday.If you work somewhere it would be appropriate to wear shorts, get the appropriate cut and and style and use the same judgment you'd use in your regular work attire. They should be clean, pressed, and professional.

, Khaki shorts come in many colors and look good on almost all men. Unless you live in the Bahamas, trying to rock cargo shorts, board shorts, or jean shorts past the age of your early 20s won't make you look younger, it'll make you look like you can't dress yourself. Khaki shorts pair well with casual styles and more professional looks, as well. It's a good investment and more recommended than other styles.


When in doubt, go for mute colors. Beige, gray, navy, and black shorts will always be in style. The bright pink pair you picked up for the yacht trip might spend a lot of time at the back of the closet.
If you wear cargo shorts, aim for the smallest possible pocket, in inverse proportion to your age. If you're in your 50s, that pocket needs to be incredibly small. If you're 15, you can get away with larger pockets.

, Wear shorts with low-top loafers and low-cut socks to get the right kind of stylish look. Wearing pulled-up white socks looks goofy, even if you're a German tourist, and high-top shoes have a tendency to make your legs look stubby and short. Unless you're on the basketball court, opt for low-tops.

Wear them up on your hips.,
Get the right size.,
To stay safe, go dark.,
Save them for the gym.",How to Wear Shorts3," Slip the shorts over the waistline about two to three inches and pull the drawstring to tighten them. The elastic waist should sit comfortably above the hips, while the hem should sit just above the knee.

If you want to sag, do it carefully. Slip on the shorts up to your pubic line. Make sure the back of the waistband is just below the ""fault line,"" so to speak, but tight to your body, using the drawstring to secure the shorts as you walk. To get them to stay, combine fairly large boxer shorts with a tight drawstring to get them to stay without having to constantly tug at them and pull them up.

, If shorts are the perfect size, you don't really have to mess with the drawstring. They should stay on comfortably without much effort, not too tight and not too loose. Jump around a bit to make sure they're secure when you're trying on a pair at the store. Make sure they don't snag against your knee so you'll be ready to hit the field, regardless of what sport your athletic shorts are for.

, Since you're going to be wearing athletic shorts to sweat in, white varieties are often a bad choice. They'll show the sweat more quickly, sometimes even becoming a bit translucent as you work out. You don't want to end up halfway through a 10 mile (16 km) jog to find out your hiddens are not so hidden.

, Wearing booty jogging shorts or bike shorts around is not recommended. You wouldn't wear a bathing suit to the ball and you shouldn't wear your exercise gear either. What looks normal at the gym doesn't look normal in public. Regardless of how comfortable and cool they are, and regardless of how sick your jump shot is, save the work out shorts for workouts and opt for more professional wear in public.

You will also need a plastic bucket or tub that is large enough to comfortably fit the shorts. If you do not have any shorts, you can make your own by cutting the legs off of a pair of pants.


For a more dramatic ombre effect, consider using darker denim.
A pants hanger is not necessary, but it could help weigh the shorts down as you are dipping them into the bleach.

, Make a mark on the fabric using a washable fabric marking pen.

, The best place to work would be outside, but if this is not possible, you can work indoors with a window open. Having a fan on in the room would also aid ventilation.

, Although you will be working with diluted bleach, you still want to protect your hands. Bleach is caustic and can burn your skin if you are not careful.

, You will need one part liquid bleach and one part water. How much bleach and water you use will depend on the size of your tub and the shorts.

, Dip the shorts 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) below the mark you have made. The bleach will eventually creep up the shorts the rest of the way and reach the mark.Consider folding the shorts in half and clipping them onto a pants hanger. This will allow you to pull them out of the bleach solution more easily. The weight of the hanger will also prevent the shorts from falling into the bleach solution., You should start to see some fading during this time. If you are working with a darker-colored pair of shorts, then you may leave them in the bleach solution for a few more minutes.

, After about ten minutes, take the shorts out of the water and rinse them using fresh, cool water. This will make the fading smoother.If you wish to make dip-dyed shorts, do not take them out of the bleach solution. Simply leave them in the bleach solution until you have achieved the lightness you want. Dip-dyed shorts have a more defined line than ombre shorts.

, For a more dramatic ombre effect, put the shorts back into the bleach solution, but only partway. Do not dip them as deeply as you did the first time. This way, you are lightening the bottom portion of the shorts even more, thus creating the ombre effect.

, Squeeze the shorts to get the extra moisture out, and rinse them using soap and cool water until you cannot smell the bleach anymore. The soap will help prevent the bleach from making yellow stains.

, You can do this by leaving them out in the sun, or by tossing them into the dryer.

If you do not own a pair of denim shorts, you can make your own by cutting the legs off of a pair of jeans.

, Outside is the best location because there is plenty of fresh air and you are less likely to feel light-headed. If it is not possible to work outside, then make sure that you have a window open; turning a fan on in your work space will give you additional ventilation.

, Although you will be working with diluted bleach, you still want to protect your skin. Bleach can irritate or burn your skin.

, You will need one part liquid bleach and one part cool water. How much bleach and water you use will depend on the size of your tub and the shorts. You want the water-bleach solution to be deep enough so that the shorts end up completely submerged.

, Take a few rubber bands and start tying off small parts of your shorts. You can tie the bands randomly around your shorts in little nibs for a starburst effect. You can also scrunch the shorts into a rope, and wrap rubber bands around the ""rope"" in 3 to 4 inch (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) intervals.

, Press down on them so that they are completely submerged in the bleach and water solution. If they keep floating to the top, you can weigh them down by putting a heavy object, such as a glass vase or a few rocks, on top of them.

, The longer you leave them in the bleach and water solution, the lighter they will become. In general, you will start seeing some results after about 20 minutes. Do not leave the shorts in the bleach solution for too long, however, or you will risk damaging the fabric.

, Once the shorts have reached the level of lightness you want, pull them out of the tub. Squeeze them to get the excess moisture out.

, Using a pair of scissors, snip the rubber bands off. Be careful not to cut the fabric of the shorts.

, Gently work some soap into the shorts and rinse them using cool water until you can no longer smell the bleach. The soap will help prevent the bleach from staining the fabric yellow.

, You can either hang them to dry in the sun, or you can toss them into the dryer for a few minutes.

Set the tone with your jean color.,
Wear a coordinating neutral top.,
Opt for a trendy yet neutral shoe.,
Select an appropriate jacket or sweater.,
Accessorize with boldness.,
Stick with light make-up.",How to Wear Colored Jeans1," Wearing neutrals with your colored jeans allows you to wear jeans in both bright and subtle shades, so the color you choose will be what sets the tone of your outfit.


For the most subtle look possible, choose a jean in a pastel hue or a deep tone. For instance, you could go for a light mint green jean or a deep olive green jean.
For a bolder look, go with a bright color. A lime green jean, for example, is a bold fashion choice no matter what top you choose to wear with it. Wearing lime green jeans with neutral colors is a safe way to be a little loud, though.;
, Choose a neutral top in a style that matches the tone set by your color choice.


Pastel jeans and deep tones work best with conservative blouses or a button-down shirt. A light mint green jean will pair well with a traditional denim button-down shirt, or a deep olive green might look nice with lacy off-white blouse.
A bold jean color matches well with a bolder style. A lime green jean can work with a black tank top accented with silver sequins. Funky necklines, peplum tops, and other embellishments also work well for bold colored jeans.Also consider the underlying color tone of your jeans when choosing a neutral. Blue-toned colors tend to work best with cool-toned neutrals like black, gray, silver, and white. Red-toned colors tend to work best with warm-toned neutrals like brown, gold, and cream. Classic denim works well with nearly all jean colors.

, Since this look is fairly safe to begin with, you can get away with an elaborate shoe style as long as the color is still neutral. Think brown, black, or white.


Wedge sandals are an especially trendy choice, but decorative flats, flat sandals, kitten heels, and stilettos all work, as well.
For colder weather, think knee-high riding boots or ankle boots with a wedge heel.

, Some styles work best for with bold colored jeans while others work better for pastels and deep shades.


For pastel jeans or deep shades, consider a cardigan sweater or structured blazer in a neutral color. A deep olive jean paired with a cream blouse would work well with a chocolate brown blazer. For bolder colors, think leather.
Of course, a jacket or sweater is only optional.

, A snakeskin purse or bold ring could work well with this otherwise safe style.


Stick with two or three key accessories. Having too many accessories can still make the outfit look too busy. Additionally, the more accessories you have, the less bold they should be.
A lime green jean and black tank top can be accented with a leopard print scarf and bulky brown bangle bracelet.

, You can introduce a little color into your make-up with eye shadow, nail polish, or lipstick, but choose one feature of your face to highlight while minimizing the rest.


As a general rule, wear everyday make-up with this style.
A deep olive jean with a cream blouse could be matched with light green eye shadow and a pale pink lip gloss.
A bright lime green jean with a black tank top could be paired with a smoky eye and deep red lipstick.

Wear lightly distressed jeans.,
Choose ripped jeans.,
Put on bleached jeans.,
Wear tie-dyed jeans.",How to Wear Distressed Jeans1," Jeans don’t have to have large rips or sections of bleach to be considered distressed. The jeans only need to have a few small rips or areas of discoloration to be considered distressed. Do not combine rips or discoloration if you want your jeans to be only slightly distressed—you should only choose one.Lightly distressed jeans work well if you are wearing them to school, work, or a casual event—like a party.;
, Ripped jeans are the classic and popular type of distressed jeans. Ripped jeans can be found already distressed at many clothing stores. Or, you can take scissors to a regular pair of jeans to create your own rips. You can choose to wear jeans with large rips, or jeans that only have a few, small rips.The knees and thighs are common places to add rips to jeans. The rips should be fairly small on your thighs if you don’t want the jeans to be too revealing.

, Bleached jeans are another popular form of distressed jeans. You can wear jeans that have small splotches of bleach. Or, you can choose jeans that are bleach almost entirely, except for the top of the jeans., Tie-dyed jeans are the modern and stylish alternative to acid-washed jeans. Tie-dyed jeans typically have been bleached in areas, but the bleach marks look like an intentional pattern. Tie-dyed jeans are available at many clothing stores, but you can do a quick search online to find places to purchase them if you can’t find them in a store."

Choose a worn pair of jeans.,
Choose a pair of women's pants.,
Consider the cut of the jeans.,
Consider the wash of the jeans.,
Choose a pair of high-quality jeans.,
Consider cuffing the jeans.,
Consider a belt.",How to Wear Boyfriend Jeans1," If you want to be true to the name ""boyfriend jeans,"" then you want to wear a pair of jeans that look like they could have been borrowed from your boyfriend -- which means they probably weren't his newest, shiniest-looking pair. Whether they're frayed, faded, or have a few tears, the jeans should look a bit worn, even if you just bought them an hour ago.Don't go overboard with this. Your jeans can look slightly worn without appearing messy, really old, or just generally looking like they need to be donated or thrown out ASAP.;
, Though the boyfriend jeans are meant to look a bit big and like they could have belonged to a man, they shouldn't actually be made to fit a man's body. If you buy a pair of men's pants, they'll be too baggy, too big around the waist, and they won't have the same flattering cut around the front and back.


Make sure to resist the temptation to actually wear a pair of men's pants and to invest in -- or borrow -- a pair of women's boyfriend jeans instead.

, Though boyfriend jeans are usually low-waisted, you can also buy a mid-to-high waisted version of these jeans. The kind of cut that is best for you depends on your body type. If you carry extra weight around your middle, then you should stick to mid- or high- waisted jeans to avoid getting a ""muffin top"" look. But if your figure is relatively straight and you're on the thin side, then low-waisted jeans can help give your body the appearance of more curves and definition.Though the pants are made to look a bit big and worn, that does not mean that they shouldn't fit you correctly. The right pair of boyfriend jeans should fit you around the waist, whether it's low-cut, mid-cut, or high-cut.
The jeans should be loose around your legs, but not so baggy that your figure is lost in them.

, You can find boyfriend jeans in a variety of washes, from very light blue to very dark denim. Most often, a darker wash is dressier and a bit more formal than a lighter wash. Darker jeans are better for more formal events, and may suit older women a bit better as well.


Darker jeans also call less attention to themselves and bring more attention to your upper body.
But if you want to have fun with a light pair of jeans, more power to you.

, You won't be able to spot a high-quality pair of boyfriend jeans just by their price tag. Unfortunately, a lot of trendy or more expensive brands can slap a high price tag on a pair of trendy jeans of inferior quality. So how do you spot a good pair of boyfriend jeans? Try these methods:


Check out the strength of the stitching. The stitching on a good pair of jeans is done with sturdy and thick thread.
Check out the texture of the fabric. High-quality denim is heavy and strong. Though you may love a pair of jeans with light fabric, chances are, the jeans are not made of high-quality material.

, Some boyfriend jeans can be bought cuffed, or you can cuff your own jeans. You can cuff a pair of long jeans so they are the length of normal jeans, or you can cuff a pair of normal jeans so that they fall 3/4 down your calf, exposing your ankle and the area above it. The cuffed jeans make for a fun and exciting look.

, Boyfriend jeans are popularly worn with a belt. Though they should fit you around the waist, a belt can help secure the jeans and can also help tie your look together. Though there's no one wrong or right type of belt to wear with the jeans, here are some things to keep in mind:


Your belt should match your shoes. It doesn't have to be the same exact color of the shows, but it shouldn't clash with them, either. If you have brown shoes, for example, your belt should be in the spectrum of brown, not black.
A brown belt is a go-to with this type of jeans. Opt for a thinner belt for a dressier look or wear a thicker belt for a more fun look.
If your belly will be exposed, wearing a belt will draw more attention to your midriff.

Select a style.,
Go casual or business casual.,
Get ripped jeans to add edge.",How to Wear Black Jeans1," Find jeans that compliment your body type. Factors to consider are the jeans’ shape, length, rise and pocket placement. The most universally flattering style of jeans is boot cut, which as a slight flare at the bottom of the leg., Skinny jeans are predominantly casual, as are jeans with a faded wash. Straight and tailored black jeans are dressier., If you want to rip them yourself, practice first on a pair of old jeans if possible. Distress the denim first where you want the cuts by rubbing it with steel wool or sandpaper. Then cut jeans using small, sharp scissors or a box cutter. Alternately, you can go online and look for black jeans that are already ripped.This is a hip casual look seen on rockers and off-duty models.

Opt for high-waisted flares.,
Go for cropped or ankle-length flares.,
Stick to clean washes with minimal embellishment.,
Invest in a pair of trouser flares.",How to Wear Flared Jeans1," Low-waisted flares, also known as hipster jeans, feature an extremely low waist that starts just above the pubic bone and button or zip several inches below the navel. Hipster flares were a very popular look in the early 2000s. Flared jeans are definitely making a comeback, but not the low-waisted hipster versions, which can look dated. Go for high-waisted flares that sit above the hips and button above the navel.Look for flares that have clean lines and fit comfortably around your waist.
As a bonus, high-waisted flares can elongate your legs. If your legs are on the shorter side, try this look to add a little length.;
, Long flares used to be fashionable, but the new silhouettes are cropped or hit just above the ankle.If you’re unable to find a pair with the length you want, hem them yourself or have them tailored for you. Avoid the super-long flares that “puddle” on the floor.Avoid buying flares that overwhelm your legs. You want them to be fitted at the knee and then gently flare out.
A few designers have created lines of “petite” fitting flares, which feature a much-shortened bottom hem and a re-working of the classic shape to flatter small frames. Allison Izu is one such designer., When flares were first popularized in the 1960s, embellishments like patches, jewels, eye-catching stitching and frayed hems were popular, and they came in every wash under the sun. The flares being reintroduced into fashion today are no-frills – they aren’t overly “retro” and have little to no embellishment. The favored washes are “clean,” which means there’s no fading or distress on the material and the shade of denim appears uniform.Look for flares with clean washes in classic true-blue and dark indigo.
If you prefer lighter washes, just make sure the color is uniform. For example, icy “rinsed-out” looking hues are popular right now., While denim is probably the most popular material for flared pants, they are certainly not the only choice. Trouser flares are essentially dress pants made with fluid materials and a very light flare that begins at about the calf. These can be worn and styled to create a business casual feel that would be appropriate at the office.


Try trouser flares with a button-down shirt, a pair of slingback shoes and a fitted blazer."

Set your washing machine to the gentle or delicate cycle.,
Fill the washing machine with cold water.,
Turn your jeans inside out.,
Put your jeans in the washing machine with only other jeans or clothing of similar colors.,
Line dry the jeans.",How to Wash Jeans1," To keep your jeans looking the same way they did when you purchased them, wash the jeans on the gentle cycle. This reduces the wear and tear on your jeans, allowing the colors and design to stay intact.Use an environmentally friendly, mild detergent (such as Woolite) when you wash your jeans. Never use bleach or use detergents with bleach.You can use a mild fabric softener if you want your jeans a bit softer.;
, Never wash the jeans in hot water. Lukewarm water can also be used when washing your jeans.Hot water can cause color loss in jeans, especially darker jeans.Hot water can also shrink the fabric.

, Washing jeans can be abrasive to fabrics. Not only do clothes rub against one another, but the detergent, along with zippers, buttons, and snaps, can be damaging to the color and fabric.Read the label on your jeans to see if there are any specific jean washing tips that you need to follow. Some jeans should be washed alone on the first wash, or washed very rarely. Make sure to follow the recommended care instructions.

, One of the major factors to consider while washing jeans is the bleeding of the indigo. Washing too often can make your jeans lose their color or pre-fade.


If you wash your jeans with other, lighter colored jeans or clothing, you could dye everything in your wash. To be on the safe side, wash all your jeans separately.

, Do not tumble your jeans in a dryer. Avoid over-drying your jeans to prevent shrinkage and the loss of color to the fabric.


If you want to dry your jeans in a dryer for time, tumble them on a delicate cycle with low heat. Take them out while still slightly damp and let them finish drying on a rack or a line.Before you place the jeans on the line, stretch the seams to help avoid shrinkage.Fold your jeans once at the knee level and hang them on a clothes hanger or rack to dry. Over-folding while the jeans are drying can cause wrinkles and creases.

Consider tie dyeing the shorts.,
Consider ombre dying your shorts.,
Pull the shorts out of the dye bath.,
Rinse the shorts using warm water.,
Dry your shorts.",How to Bleach Shorts4," You can use completely bleached shorts, ombre bleached shorts, or even tie die bleached shorts. If you wish to learn how to bleach your shorts, refer to one of the sections in this article on bleaching your yours, ombre bleaching your shorts, or reverse tie dying your shorts.

, You will be dyeing your shorts in this, so make sure that you do not mind if it gets stained. You need 3 gallons (11.35 liters) of very hot water.

, You can use liquid fabric dye or powder fabric dye. If you are using liquid dye, shake the bottle, and pour ½ of the liquid dye into the hot water. If you are using powdered fabric dye, empty the packet into 2 cups (473.18 milliliters) of very hot water, then add the water to the bucket.Stir the dye with a long stick or spoon (that you will not be using for cooking purposes again) to mix everything.

, Measure out 1 cup (280 grams) of salt and add it to 2 cups (473.18 milliliters) of very hot water. Mix with a spoon until everything is combined, and then pour the salt water into the dye bath. Stir again until everything is mixed together. The salt will help the dye stick to the jean fabric better.

, You can do this by dipping a piece of white, cotton fabric into the dye bath and then taking it out. If the color is too dark, add more hot water. If the color is too light, add more dye. Once you have achieved the color you want, you are ready to dye your shorts.Keep in mind that the dyed item will be a little darker when it is wet than when it is dry.
Fabric dye is translucent, so the original color of the shorts will affect the new color. For example, if you choose to dye a pair of ombre shorts pink, the white part will end up pink, but the blue denim part will end up purple.

, Dip the shorts in warm water, then squeeze them to get the extra moisture out. Soak them in the dye bath for 10 to 30 minutes until you get the shade you want. Make sure to stir the shorts in the dye bath from time to time, or you may get splotches.

, Tie rubber bands around the shorts. You can tie the rubber bands in little nibs randomly for a starburst effect. You can also scrunch the shorts into a rope, and tie rubber bands around the ""rope"" at 3 to 4 inch (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) intervals. Once you are done tying the shorts, soak them in warm water, then squeeze them to get the extra moisture out. Dunk them into the dye bath for 10 to 30 minutes, or until you have achieved the color you want.

, Dip the bottom part of your shorts into the dye bath and rest them against the wall of the bucket so that they don't slide down into the water. Leave them in the dye for 10 minutes. After about 10 minutes, dip the shorts further into the dye bath, and lean them against the side of the bucket. Leave the shorts in the dye for 5 minutes. Swish the shorts around to get an even coating of dye, then dip them the rest of the way into the dye bath (or as far as you want the ombre effect to go). Quickly pull the shorts out., Once you have finished dyeing your shorts using your chosen method, pull them out of the dye bath and gently squeeze them to get the extra moisture out. If you have chosen to tie dye your shorts, snip the rubber bands off using a pair of scissors. Be careful so as not to cut the actual fabric of the shorts.

, Keep rinsing your shorts until the water runs clear. If you have chosen to ombre dye your shorts, hold them by the lightest part and rinse them using cool water first; squeeze the extra moisture out and then rinse them out using warm water until the water runs clear.

, You can do this by leaving them out in the sun, or by tossing them into the dryer for a few minutes.

Consider embellishing your shorts further.,
Add some designs using fabric paint or fabric markers.,
Draw designs using bleach.,
Add some studs.,
Fray the bottom of the shorts.,
Distress the shorts.",How to Bleach Shorts5," You can leave them as they are, or you can use paint, bleaching pens, or studs to add a personal touch.

, After your shorts have dried, you can add some designs using fabric paint and stencils, or fabric markers. Place a sheet of cardboard inside your shorts, so that the paint or marker doesn't bleed through. After this, you can place some adhesive fabric stencils onto your shorts, and fill the spaces in using a paintbrush and fabric paint. You can also draw designs free-handedly using fabric markers. Wait until the paint has dried before taking the cardboard out.

, You can do this with a bleach pen, or by dipping a paintbrush into some undiluted bleach. Simply place a piece of cardboard inside your shorts, and draw some interesting designs onto your shorts. Wait until the designs become as light as you want them to be, then take the cardboard out. Rinse the shorts using soap and cool water, and hang them up to dry.


You can also use this technique to draw designs on unbleached shorts instead.

, The best places to add studs is around the waistband and along the outer edges of the pockets. You can poke them directly into the fabric, and then flatten the prongs using a butter knife, or you can glue them onto the shorts using fabric glue.

, You can do this by simply cutting the bottom hem off. You can leave the shorts as they are, or you can use a sewing machine and sew along the bottom hem so that they do not fray too much. If you choose to sew, sew ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) up the bottom of the cut hem.

, You can create a unique look by distressing your shorts. You can do this by creating a few slices in the lap part using a craft knife and then pulling out the short strands with a pair of tweezers. You can also buff the lap area using a piece of coarse-grained sandpaper or a cheese grinder.

Pick jeans that fall right above the ankle.,
Account for your footwear.,
Pick a color appropriate for the situation.,
Get high-waisted jeans to elongate your legs.,
Go for a frayed hem only if you prefer distressed jeans.",How to Wear Cropped Jeans1," Cropped jeans should fall just above your ankle. They will show your ankle and look a little spring-like without being short enough to resemble something like capris. Try on cropped jeans before purchasing them to make sure they fall above your ankle., Think about the shoes you'll likely be wearing with the jeans. Cropped jeans go with a wide variety of shoe types, but if you have your heart set on wearing them with a particular type of shoe keep this in mind when shopping.If you're wearing boots, bring them with you when you go to try on cropped jeans. Make sure your jeans fall just at the top of the boots.
Lighter shoes, like flats or heels, tend to look good with flared cropped jeans.

, You can get traditional blue jeans. However, cropped jeans come in many colors. If you want something lighter for spring, consider white cropped jeans. If you want something slightly more formal, go for black jeans., Many people worried cropped jeans will make their legs appear short. If your legs are on the shorter side, go for high-waisted jeans. These will elongate the appearance of your legs.

, Distressed jeans are jeans with frays or holes strategically placed throughout the jeans. As cropped jeans are shorter and already somewhat casual, do not go overboard if you decide to distress your jeans. In general, avoid distressing around the knees or pant legs. A minor amount of distressing in the form of a frayed hem at the pant leg is all you need for cropped jeans."

Stick with a bold jean color.,
Throw on a contrasting top.,
Keep the boldness going with a bright shoe.,
Mute your accessories.,
Mute your make-up, as well.",How to Wear Colored Jeans2," The color blocking trend is all about bold colors and clean lines, so a bold shade is preferable over a pastel or rich hue.


“Colorblocking” refers to the fashion trend of wearing large, solid blocks of contrasting colors. It is a vibrant, edgy fad requiring the use of similarly vibrant colors.

, Look for something with straight lines and choose an equally bold contrasting color.


For instance, if you have orange jeans, go with a strong midnight blue top. Blue and orange are complementary colors that lie opposite from one another on the color wheel, so the level of contrast here is quite high.
Other possible color combinations include aqua and bright yellow, tomato red and fuchsia, navy blue and pink, mint green and melon, lilac and pastel orange, and coral and turquoise., A solid shoe, like a flat, sneaker, or boot, works better than a strappy sandal since it covers more space and has a stronger presence.


Choose a shoe in a color that contrasts with your jean color. An easy way to do this would be to match your shoe color with the color of your top. Orange jeans paired with a midnight blue tank top, then, would work well with midnight blue flats or sneakers.

, This look is already bold enough without the use of bold accessories.


Accessories that are too bold can actually make the outfit appear too loud and out of balance.
Neutral colors work best for accessories. For instance, pearl post earrings and a silver watch can look great with orange jeans and a midnight blue top.Small traces of color can also work, as long as they remain small. In the outfit described above, you could swap out the pearl post earrings for tiny orange-gem posts.

, For this style, natural-looking make-up is better than bold make-up. The idea is too make your outfit the center of attention, which you may struggle to accomplish if it has to compete with your cosmetics.


Choose neutral foundation, eyeshadow, and lip color. If you introduce any non-natural color to your make-up, do so with an eyeliner or nail polish.

"
"
Consider a pastel jean.,
Make your top a deeper shade of a like color.,
Keep the shoe simple.,
Wear a neutral jacket.,
Keep your accessories neutral.,
Continue the color scheme to your make-up.",How to Wear Colored Jeans3," The idea here is to use similar colors to tone down your colored jeans without becoming too monochromatic in the process.


Pastel jeans have a softer effect that is more suitable for this subtle look. Go for colors like baby blue, buttercup yellow, or light pink, or lavender.

, You can either choose a deeper shade of the same hue or a different hue that lies next to or near the color of your jeans on the color wheel.


For instance, use deep violet with a lavender jean or navy blue with baby blue.
Similar shades, like pink and purple, can be used together, too. A light pink jean would work well with a dark violet blouse.
For this style, you can use either soft patterns—like small floral print—or solid colors.

, Something feminine without a great deal of detail will often work best, especially a flat or ankle boot.


Consider a shoe in a neutral color like black, gray, or dark brown.
You could also use a shade that closely matches the hue of your top. If you have lavender jeans and a dark purple top, for example, you could opt for a grape-colored flat.
For a subtle hint of bling, you could also go for a metallic shoe. Choose a matte metallic over something too shiny or something decorated with sequins, though.

, While a jacket is only optional, nearly any style can work well with this look. Play with a variety of cardigans, leather jackets, denim jackets, light trench coats, and blazers until you find a look that appeals to you.


While the style depends on the cut of your top and your own personal preferences, you should play things fairly safe as far as the color goes. To prevent the possibility of clashing or making the outfit look too loud, choose a neutral color. Light neutrals, like white, cream, gray, and tan, are especially helpful in creating a soft appearance.
A white blazer would work well with lavender jeans and a dark purple blouse, or a gray trench coat can work with baby blue jeans and a navy blue sweater.

, Neutral accessories are the way to go for this look since they promote the overall subtle, mellow theme of the ensemble.


For jewelry, go with simple silver or gold chains and bangle bracelets.
Consider something like a tan or black leather purse as instead of a patterned bag.

, Most of your make-up should be fairly natural, but you can introduce a hint of your chosen color scheme with nail polish, lipstick, or eyeshadow. Only highlight one feature at a time, however; do not color your lips, eyes, and nails all at the same time.


If you decide to wear lavender jeans and a deep violet blouse, you could swipe lavender eyeshadow over your eyes. Alternatively, you could keep your eyes fairly subdued and go with a dark purple nail polish, instead.

Tone your make-up down.",How to Wear Colored Jeans4," Matching colored jeans with patterned blouses can be tricky since both are fairly bold fashion choices. The idea is to have wild style that is still well-put-together. To minimize the risk of creating an outfit that is too busy and unbalanced, opt for a light pastel jean over something bolder and brighter.


In this instance, a mild melon would be better than tangerine orange. Likewise, buttercup yellow would be better than lemon yellow.

, If you would rather go for a colored pattern, though, gravitate toward a small pattern that contains the color of your jeans in it.


A leopard print tank top could work with melon jeans, and a zebra print blouse could match well with buttercup yellow jeans.
Similarly, a feminine, flowing blouse with a small floral pattern containing melon in it can actually look quite elegant when paired with melon jeans. A chocolate brown blouse with small buttercup yellow polka dots can also look nice with buttercup yellow jeans.

, Your shoes should be a solid color rather than a pattern.


Neutral colored shoes work well no matter which sort of pattern you chose for your top. If your top contained multiple colors, you could also select a color from the top that varies from your jean color for your shoe color.

, If you want to tone down the wild effect of your patterned blouse, cover part of it up with a blazer or trench coat in a neutral color.


If you want to keep this style looking funky and wild, however, it is best to skip the jacket altogether.

, Adorn yourself with one or two simple accessories, at most.


For a zebra-print top and yellow jeans, you could opt for gold hoop earrings. With a floral top and melon jeans, consider something like silver or bronze bangle bracelets.

, As with other bold looks, fairly natural make-up is the way to go to avoid looking too unbalanced.


Keep your lip color, foundation, blush, and nails fairly natural. If you want to add a splash of color, consider doing so by swiping eyeshadow over your eyelids in a color that matches your jeans.

Wear a long blazer over a vintage rock band t-shirt and add a pair of platform sandals into the mix for an edgier look.

, Tunics are loose-fitting blouses that are typically made with soft, fluid materials.

Try a belt that cinches at the waist.,
Add a pop of color with brightly colored clutch or scarf.",How to Wear Flared Jeans3," The flared leg looks very flattering with almost any kind of heel – chunky sandals, clogs, wedges and platforms can all look very polished. Flares already tend to elongate the leg, and wearing heels with them emphasizes that even more. Make sure the bottom hems of your flares are not touching the ground, though, which can take this look from polished to sloppy pretty quickly. If you have to, hem your jeans or have them tailored for the shoes you plan to wear with them.
Avoid wearing pointed-toe shoes with flares, which can look dated.

, High-waisted flares already do a lot to create a soft, feminine silhouette, but you can emphasize this quality even more by wearing them with a thin belt that cinches at the waist. The belt can accentuate your curves while the high waist looks polished and appropriate for almost any occasion. Tuck in a button-down dress shirt and add a thin patent leather belt for an office-ready look.

This technique also works great with a monotone outfit, like crisp white flares paired with a white button down, because the added scarf or bag really pops against the single-color backdrop. Add a pair of chunky heeled boots to finish off this look.


A clutch with a sleek shape in a bright color like orange can add a lot of flair to a monotone outfit with very little effort.

Wash your jeans in the sink or a tub.,
Only wash your jeans when necessary.,
Spot clean stains.,
Air them out if they smell.,
Freeze your jeans.,
Know when it's time to wash your jeans.",How to Wash Jeans2," Washing denim by hand can preserve the colors and diminish the wear obtained from the abrasive action of machine washing.


Fill a tub with a few inches of cold or lukewarm water. Mix in a gentle, color preserving detergent.
Turn the jeans inside out, then lay flat in the tub. Don't bunch them or wrinkle them.Let them soak for about 45 minutes.
Run them under the water to rinse. Hang up to dry.

, Many people, including the CEO of Levi Strauss and designer Tommy Hilfiger, recommend only washing your jeans a few times a year.Washing can cause unnecessary wear on denim. Casual wear of denim shouldn't get the jeans dirty enough to wash with every wear.


Many expensive, designer jeans are raw denim, meaning they haven't been pre-washed or faded and the indigo dye has not been set.The every day wear helps raw denim conform to your body, and achieves an individualized fade on the jeans.
Jeans that have been pre-washed or faded by the manufacturer can be washed by just about any means.Wash denim every 2 to 6 months, depending on your level of wear, the type of jeans you own, and personal preferences.
The wash schedule of denim depends on their use. Jeans used to work outside will be cared for differently than designer jeans worn for a night out., Use water and a rag to remove any spillage on your jeans instead of tossing them into the washing machine.


Be careful using any kind of soap to spot clean. If your indigo dye is not set, it can cause fading in the spot where you are cleaning, which messes up the look of your jeans., If you're trying not to wash your jeans often, but they start to smell, try putting them on a line or clothing rack outside for at least 24 hours.


You can also use a deodorizing fabric spray on your jeans to remove any smells.

, One trick to prolonging the life of your jeans between washes is to freeze them when they start to smell. One major reason denim starts to smell is because of bacteria that are transferred from our bodies to the material during wear. These bacteria cause odor. Freezing your jeans can kill a large percentage of these bacteria, helping to reduce the odors.You can put the jeans in the freezer unprotected. However, this might allow things from your freezer to transfer to the jeans. Try a canvas clothing bag, or any bag that breathes (unlike plastic bags).
Allow the jeans to warm up before you put them on.

, Wearing them once or twice doesn't mean it's time to toss them in with the rest of your clothes. Jeans have a very different lifespan. Wait until the denim starts to sag in the seat, the knees are stretched or the fabric is creased behind the knees, and the waist is extremely loose.These details mean it might be time to wash your jeans.

Measure the jeans.,
Spray the jeans.,
Stand on the fabric.,
Pull the fabric.,
Measure the jeans.",How to Stretch out Jeans1," The area in the seat, thighs and hips is the most common place that feels tight, and the place that's easiest to stretch. You can also make your jeans a little longer by stretching them lengthwise.









If you want to stretch the waist or hips, identify a band across the front and back of the seat of the jeans that you will stretch. Choose the waistband or a lower spot, depending on what feels too tight.













If you want to stretch the jeans lengthwise along the inseam, choose a spot extending from the knee to the bottom of the jeans. Plan to stretch an area that doesn't have a lot of wear and tear; for example, you wouldn't want to stretch directly over a hole in the knee. Stretching areas that are already very thin may result in tears. Usually the areas near the calves or ankles are a good place to stretch the inseam.;
, Use a measuring tape to measure their length or width - depending on which way you want to stretch them - before you begin. Measure across the exact place you intend to stretch. This way you'll be able to tell if the stretching technique worked by measuring them again when you're finished.








, Fill a spray bottle with lukewarm water. Spray the areas that you want to stretch with plenty of water. Make sure the water seeps in to cover both the outside and inside of the denim.








, Place your jeans on the floor. If you're stretching the waistband or seat of the jeans, stand on one side of the jeans with both feet on the same pocket. If you're stretching the jeans lengthwise, stand on the dry part of the jeans just above the knee.








, Keeping your feet in place, pick up the side of the fabric opposite to where you are standing. Pull the fabric firmly toward your body. You should be pulling the fabric in the direction you want it to stretch. Repeat this 10 times, then do the same on the opposite leg, or the opposite side of the waist band.









If you're stretching the waistband, leave the jeans unbuttoned. Buttoning them before pulling the fabric can cause it to rip.
Don't pull on the pockets or loops of the jeans. Pulling on these weaker areas can cause rips to occur.

, Determine whether they have stretched at least an inch (2.54 cm) to make them more comfortable. If they have not, try another method.

pins
a sewing machine
thread;
, To figure out how much of the material you will need to take in, you will need to try on your jeans. First, turn them inside out and then put them on normally, with the zipper in front., Stand in front of a mirror and figure out where you want to take in your jeans. This will depend on how loosely the jeans fit you and how tight you want them to be.For example, if the jeans are tight around your hips and thighs, but loose around your calves and ankles, then you will need to take them in around the calves and ankles.

, Once you have decided where you want to take in your jeans, place pins to secure the material along the edges of the outer seam.If the crotch is baggy, then you might want to pin along the inside edges of your jeans instead. That will make it easier to take in the crotch as well. If the jeans are extremely baggy, then you may need to pin the inner and outer edges of your jeans.Make sure that you can still move around in your jeans and get the over your ankles and feet. Do not pin them so tightly that you cannot bend your knees or take them off.
When you are happy with the placement of your pins, you can take off the jeans. Remove them carefully so that the pins do not come loose.

, Sew a straight stitch along the pinned edge of the jeans. Try to sew right along where you placed the pins, but pull out the pins as you go. Do not sew over the pins or you may damage your needle.Remove the pins as you sew.
Sew the other leg after you finish the first one.

, After you finish the first straight stitch on the outside of each pant leg, sew another straight stitch alongside the first one. Try to make the stitch about ¼” away from the first one.Repeat the same stitch on the other leg.

, To make sure that the stitches are firmly in place, you will need to sew a zigzag stitch along the outside of the second straight stitch. Place the zigzag stitch about ¼” away from the second straight stitch., After you have finished stitching the zigzag stitch, you will need to cut the excess material next to the zigzag stitch. Do not cut any of the zigzag stitches though, just cut off the fabric outside of the zigzag stitches.Try to leave about ¼” to ½” of fabric past the zigzag stitch., Try on your new skinny jeans and inspect the hem. If the hem is lower than you’d like it to be, then you can easily adjust it. This is really up to you. If you like the look of a longer hem, then you can leave it. However, if you’d rather have the hem up around your ankles, then you will need to adjust it.


Try on a pair of shoes that you want to wear with your skinny jeans to determine if the hem looks right.
Keep in mind that you can always fold, tuck, or scrunch up the bottoms of your skinny jeans if you decide not to hem the bottoms., When you have decided where you want the hem to be, fold the bottoms of your jeans up to level where you want the new hem to be. Add a few pins to hold the hem in place while you take the jeans off., First, measure the distance between the bottom fold and the original hem. Use a measuring tape to find the distance between the bottom of your jeans and the beginning of the original hem. Write down or remember this number.Then, divide the distance between the bottom fold and the start of the original hem in half. For example, if the distance was three inches, then 1 ½ inches is your new number.
Measure from the edge of the original hem to the new number. Then, pin the bottom of your jeans at this level.

, To make your new hem permanent, stitch along the edges of the original hem. Stitch all the way around the pant legs. When you are done, flip the edges of the pant legs down and try on your jeans."

Choose a pair of jeans to turn into shorts.,
Pre-shrink the jeans.,
Decide what length you want the shorts to be.",How to Turn Jeans into Shorts1," The best jeans to choose will fit you comfortably in the hips, butt and thighs. Remember that baggy jeans will become baggy shorts, and tight jeans will be tight shorts.


Jeans made with stretchy material are not the best candidates to turn into shorts. They usually have pieces of rubber or plastic woven in with the fabric, and those won't look good dangling from the bottom of the shorts.
You can also turn khaki fabrics into shorts. Just take a look at the tag and make sure they are 100 percent cotton, or close to it.;
, If you're converting a pair of jeans you've barely worn, or that have never been washed, run them through the washer and dryer before proceeding to cut them off. This will pre-shrink the jeans so they won't end up shorter than you want them to be.

, Depending on how loose or tight your jeans are and what shape they are in, choose from the following lengths:









Capris are cut off right at the calf, and look great with heels or sandals.

Capris are only a little shorter than regular pants, so this is a good choice if you don't want to make a drastic alteration.
Tight fitting or ""skinny"" jeans look better as capris than loose-fitting jeans. You want the bottoms of the capris to hug your calves, rather than swim around them.


Bermudas hit at or right above the knee. Depending on the type of jeans you're converting, bermudas can be super comfy or incredibly stylish.

If you're looking for a roomy, comfortable pair of shorts you can live in all summer, convert a pair of loose-fitting jeans to bermudas.
Tight-fitting jeans that hug the thighs and knees look great as bermudas, especially paired with a flowy top.


Classic shorts hit 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) above the knee. This is a versatile style that can be dressed up or down.

Both loose and tight-fitting jeans are great candidates for classic shorts.
Classic shorts are a good length to choose if you're working with jeans that have holes or other damage below the knees.


Short shorts have a hemline of about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm). These are perfect for the beach, especially paired with a cute bikini top.

Tighter jeans look better converted into short shorts. With loose jeans you risk having too much upper thigh exposure.
Be careful when choosing this option. If you want shorter shorts, you can always take a few more inches off, but you can't go back once you cut off too much.

Skip the strategic tucking.,
Know which jeans work with which boots.",How to Tuck Jeans Into Boots," If your jeans are long, you’ll need to cuff them. They shouldn’t extend beyond your ankle, and cuffing them will ensure they bunch up above your boot. This technique works particularly well for pants that are loose at the end, such as flare or boot cut styles., Grab your jeans at the bottom, on the inner seam, and hold them the pant leg away from your leg. In other words, you will be stretching the denim out as wide as it will go. Then, carefully fold that denim vertically against your leg. Now, your jeans should be tight all the way to your ankle. Keep holding them in this fold., Continue using one hand to hold your jeans folded against your leg. Use your other hand to pull a tall sock over your jeans. This sock should be tight, so that it holds your jeans the way they are, keeping them tight against your leg., Carefully pull, zip, or tie your boots on over your socks. The socks should hold your folded jeans in place, so that they don’t bunch up or slide around in your boots. Voila! No one will know how much denim is expertly tucked away within your footwear., If you aren’t familiar with these, they are basically little straps that are used to hold mittens onto coat sleeves so that the wearer doesn’t drop and lose them. You can sometimes find mitten clips at places like Target and Walmart, but you might have an easier time finding them online. You can purchase packs for cheap on websites like Amazon, or find homemade ones on craft websites like Etsy., The actual strap will be running under your foot. Adjust the clips to ensure they are comfortable and aren’t rubbing anything. If you are wearing jeans with a bit of flare or extra denim at the end, you can clip any extra denim into the clip to hold it securely.Make sure your clips aren’t rubbing against your ankle bones. That will get uncomfortable very quickly.
The band should be close to the middle of your foot.

, After your jeans are securely clipped and the band is looped under your foot à la stirrup pants, it’s time to put your boots on. These mitten clips will make this task much easier! You won’t have to worry about trying to maneuver your boots over your jeans without them bunching up, or awkwardly jamming your hand into your boots to smooth out your jeans.After you’ve put your boots on, make sure to walk around a bit at home before venturing out of the house. You’ll want to make sure the clips are comfortable and positioned correctly!

, If you’re wearing smooth, crisp leather boots or sleek, over-the-knee boots, or a similar style, it’s important to keep your jeans sleek and fitted as well. This helps to create one long, smooth silhouette that will help to elongate your legs and give you a very polished look.However, if you’re wearing chunky combat boots, snow boots, slouchy boots, and so on, your jeans don’t have to be perfectly tucked.


Sometimes, perfectly and pristinely tucked jeans aren’t what your boots call for. Jeans that are loosely bunched up around the tops of casual boots will make your outfit look relaxed and trendy.

, Try sliding your boots on without even touching your jeans, and see what happens. You might be surprised at how the jeans can bunch up in a way that makes your outfit look effortless and cozy. Before you go crazy trying to fold your jeans perfectly and strategically maneuver your boot onto your foot, see how it looks if you actually embrace the bunching that happens., At the end of the day, your favorite distressed flares might work with your casual, lace-up combat boots, and your sleek skinny jeans might be the only pair that works with your tall, suede boots. Nothing ruins an outfit quite like baggy, balloon knees over tight boots, so have an idea of which jeans work with which boots. This will save you a lot of adjusting (and a lot of annoyance) throughout your day!

Put on your jeans inside out.,
Mark the area you want taken in.,
Pin the bunched material together.,
Sew and cut excess fabric.,
Sew the fabric together where you just cut off the old material.,
Put your jeans back on and cuff your preferred new hem length.,
Pin your cuffs.,
Sew across the pin tops and then cut off excess fabric.,
Zigzag stitch the edges to keep them from fraying.,
Flip right side in and iron smooth.",How to Taper Jeans," Before you start making permanent changes to your jeans, put them on inside out and pull and pinch the excess fabric around the inner calf and ankle area that you’d like to make more narrow. Doing this while the jeans are inside out is best because you’ll need to alter the inside seams to taper the jean correctly.





;
, Using a washable fabric marker or chalk, mark small dots in a straight line where you’re pinching the fabric. These dots should start right below your knees and continue down to the very bottom of the pant legs.









Give yourself just a little extra room around the thicker part of the calf. You don’t want to make them too tight to put on and take off., After you’ve taken the jeans off, use sewing pins to pin together the fabric at the dots you marked. The pinning should simulate the pinching you did while you were wearing the jeans. 







, Using a sewing machine, sew along the dotted lines that you created on each pant leg from below the knees to the bottom of the jeans. Once you do this, use scissors to cut off the extra fabric, including the old seams. Make sure not to cut any closer to your new seams than ¼ inch or ½ inch.







, At this point, the raw edges that are exposed will need to be secured. In order to prevent fraying, sew the raw edges together using a zigzag stitch pattern. It may be difficult to make this look attractive, but that’s okay because this stitch won’t ever be visible while you’re wearing the jeans.







, Put your jeans back on, but the right way this time. Your jeans should now be much more fitted from your knee down, but the very bottoms of your jeans are most likely still too wide. Cuff your jeans so that the old hem is where you want your jeans to end. This decision will depend greatly on exactly what kind of jean you’re aiming to create.









Skinny jeans should end at the top of the ankle.
Straight leg jeans should end at the bottom of your ankle, just before your foot.
Ankle jeans should fall at the slimmest part of the ankle., While keeping the jeans on, use sewing pins vertically to mark where you’ll sew, making sure that the vertical pin tops all line up evenly and are equidistant from the bottom of the fabric.







, Take your jeans off and sew horizontal lines where your pin tops are. Once you’re done, you can cut the bottom of your pants off, leaving about a quarter or half inch of fabric below where you just sewed.







, Just as you needed to create a zigzag stitch along the inside of the raw edges running vertically, you’ll need to do the same horizontally on the bottom of the jeans.







, Turn the edge back under so that you can see the original hem and iron over the bottom of the jeans to smooth and flatten them out.

Put the jeans on.,
Lay the jeans on a flat surface.,
Align a ruler with the cut off mark that you made.,
Cut the shorts.,
Try the shorts on.",How to Turn Jeans into Shorts2," Use chalk or a safety pin to mark where on the jeans you plan to cut them off: at the calves, knees, mid-thighs, or upper thighs. Remove the jeans once you've marked the spot.


Remember that the jeans will get shorter as they fray. If you want a line of fringe, the spot you mark should be about an inch below the length you want the finished shorts to be.
If you don't want fringe, mark a spot about 1/2 an inch below your desired final length.
If you plan to cuff the shorts, or fold them over a few times, mark a spot at least three inches below your desired final length.

, A table or desk would be preferable, since it is waist-high, but if you don't have a large enough surface you can lay them on the floor.

, Tilt it slightly up toward the outer part of the jeans. Lightly trace the cutting path with chalk. Repeat with the other leg.









The cutting paths should come to a slight point below the crotch, forming a ""v"" shape. This results in a more flattering final look than simply cutting the jeans straight across.
Don't pronounce the ""v"" too much; it should be quite subtle, unless you want the shorts to look shorter toward the thighs.

, Carefully cut in a straight line along the path you traced.









To get the best results, use fabric scissors, which are designed to cut through heavy fabrics like denim.
Don't panic if your line isn't perfectly even. When the shorts fray the little crooked parts won't be visible.

, Taking into account the extra inch or few inches shorter they'll be in the end, are the approximately the length you had in mind? You might decide you actually want bermudas instead of capris. Take a look and decide before proceeding.

"
"
Consider hemming the shorts.,
Consider cuffing the shorts.,
Create a fringe.",How to Turn Jeans into Shorts3," If you want to prevent excess fraying, or if you prefer not to have a line of fringe around the bottom of the shorts, you'll need to hem the shorts to prevent the fabric from unweaving.


Fold the edges under one-fourth of an inch and use a sewing machine to hem the shorts.
If you don't have a sewing machine, fold the the edges under one-fourth of an inch and sew around the edge of the shorts by hand.

, If you want to cuff the shorts, you should still stitch around the edge to prevent them from fraying too much.


Use a sewing machine to stitch around the edge of both legs, or stitch them by hand.
Fold the shorts up, then fold them up again to create a cuff.
Use an iron to press the cuffs into place.
If you want to keep the shorts permanently cuffed at the same length, you can stitch up the side of the cuffs to hold them in place.

, If you're going for the classic fringe look, it's time to throw your shorts in the wash. Put them through the regular wash and dry cycle to produce a nice line of fringe.









If you want more fringe, repeat the wash and dry cycle.
If you want to prevent the shorts from fraying too much, wash and dry until the shorts have the desired amount of fringe, then stitch around the legs right above where the fringe meets the intact denim.

"
Add some glam.,
Distress your shorts.,
Make your shorts holy.,
Bleach your shorts.",How to Turn Jeans into Shorts4," Sew on beads and sequins in a pretty pattern, or use paint to decorate your shorts.









You can buy sequin and bead kits at most fabric stores if you need a little help deciding what pattern to create.
Fabric paint is also available at fabric stores. Use stencils to create a neat image.

, Do you want your shorts to look like you've had them for years? Use sandpaper a cheese grater or steel wool to ""destroy"" them.


Rub the tools around the pockets of the shorts and along the thighs for that ""distressed"" look.
Rub the tools around the bottom of the shorts to create a gradual fray effect.

, Cut slits in the front of your jeans with a pair of scissors or an Exacto-knife.









Customize your look as much as you want: Opt for a lot of slits or just do a few, and cut the slits at different angles or try to get them parallel.
Use a scissors to cut small holes in the shorts. Gently widen the holes with your fingers. The next time you run them through the wash, the holes will have a frayed, authentic look.

, You can make a bleach pattern to lighten certain areas or bleach your new shorts completely white.


Mix two parts water and one part bleach in a plastic container.
Place your pants in a dry bathtub and sprinkle the bleach solution over your pants.
Concentrate the bleach in certain areas if you wish, and experiment with different patterns depending on how you spray the bleach.
Once you're satisfied with the color, run the jeans under cold water and then wash them in the washing machine, alone, without detergent.
Use rubber bands for more of an acid-wash or ombre effect. Simply bunch up your parts of your jeans and tie them off with rubber bands. Stick the jeans in a vat or tub filled with a bleach solution of two parts water to one part bleach. Leave there for 20-60 minutes, depending on the desired color, and wash them off under running water. Then, run them through the wash, alone, without detergent.

Knowing the weight of the item of clothing will help you determine how much dye you need to use to re-dye the jeans.If you don't own a scale you can estimate the weight of your jeans.
Mens jeans will often weigh more than female jeans.;
, You can purchase denim fabric dye at arts and crafts stores, department stores, and online. Read the label on the package before buying it to make sure that it's safe to use on denim. Match the color of the dye you're purchasing with the color of your jeans.Fabric dye colors include denim blue, navy blue, and black.RIT is a popular denim dye that's widely available in stores.

, Oil and dirt on your jeans will prevent the dye from binding with the jeans. Hand wash your jeans or wash them in a washing machine to remove dirt and oil. Once you're done washing them, make sure to rinse and dry them thoroughly so that there's no more residue from your detergent left on the jeans., Run the hot water from your bathroom faucet until it gets as hot as it can. Fill a bucket with 3 gallons (11.35 l) of hot water when unfading one pair of pants., Read the instructions on the back of the dye so that you know how much dye you have to use. Measure the dye and slowly pour it into your bucket of water. Use a metal spoon or wooden paint stick to mix the dye thoroughly., Adding regular table salt to your dye mixture will help it adhere to the threads in your denim fabric. Once you pour the salt into your bucket, mix it well until the salt dissolves., Place your jeans into the bucket to fully saturate them. Use your hands to agitate the jeans in the solution so that the dye can bind with your jean fibers easier. Wear rubber gloves so that the dye doesn't get transferred to your hands and make sure that the jeans are fully saturated.

, Leave the jeans in the dye bucket for an hour. During this time the dye should seep into the fabric of your jeans and remove any faded portions that may remain., After allowing your jeans to soak, you can remove them from the solution and wring out the initial water. If the jeans aren't as dark as you wanted, you can submerge them back into the dye and allow them to soak for another hour.

, Do a thorough rinsing of your jeans under your bathroom or kitchen faucet. Continue rinsing your jeans under cold water until they start to run clear. Keep in mind that the initial dye will bleed into your sink. To avoid dying the sink, make sure that you clean it immediately with soap and water after rinsing your newly dyed jeans.

, Run your jeans through a warm wash or hand wash them to get the remaining dye out of your pants. Continue to wash them until the dye stops bleeding into the water.It may take two full machine cycles before your jeans are clean.

, Hang your jeans up outside or in a breezy place inside of your house. Wear them for 20-30 minutes to loosen them up.

, After you rinse and wash your jeans, you can wash them as you normally would along with your other clothes. Using a color safe detergent will help your jeans retain their color."

Try to avoid washing jeans at all for the first three months.,
Brush them off to clean them.,
Wear them gently.,
Fold them in different ways.,
Avoid wearing a belt.,
Wash jeans with similar colors.,
Wash jeans in cold water.,
Let jeans air dry.,
Only wash your jeans after several uses.",How to Take Care of Your Jeans," The first couple of months are important for wearing in your jeans gently. You can get them to fit your form like a glove if you just wear them regularly without washing them. They shouldn't need it.


Alternatively, if you want to shrink up your jeans, wash them. It'll be easier to shrink them up a bit if you do it more quickly after buying them.;
, In the meantime, do a little touch-up cleaning if you must. If they are dirty, the best way to clean them gently is to hang them on a clothes line then spray them down with water and leave them to air dry.


If your jeans become soiled, just try brushing them off with a slightly damp washcloth before you wash them. Let them dry thoroughly and reevaluate.
If your jeans develop an odor, try wrapping them up in a plastic bag and putting them in the freezer. This is done sometimes to help deodorize jeans.

, Denim has a reputation for being a durable, standing up to heavy use. But if you want to keep your jeans from ripping and stretching out, try to treat them gently so they'll keep their shape. Try not to stretch, do yoga, or anything else that would stretch them out.

, Before you wash your jeans, it's important to avoid keeping them folded or stacked along a sharp crease. Unlike your khakis, which will benefit from a sharp case, your jeans can lose some of their color along the crease, which can end up looking a little silly.

, Buy jeans in the appropriate size, and you should be able to wear them without a belt. If you can wear your jeans without a belt, then try not to. This tends to wear out your jeans at the belt loops and around the waist. If you can get away with it, just wear your jeans on their own.

, Your jeans can bleed when they are wet, especially with darker colored jeans. You probably shouldn't put them with lighter colors in the washing machine. Don't bleach your jeans and avoid any detergents with bleach.

, Warm water can shrink jeans, and weaken fibers. In general, you want to run them through cold water if you want to run them through the washing machine.


You don't necessarily need to use the washing machine, either. If you just want to freshen them up, get your jeans wet in the tub, ring them out, and hang them up to try.
Wash jeans inside out to protect the outside from getting too dinged up in the washing machine. This helps to protect the fibers and the look of the denim.

, The best way to let your jeans dry is to just let them air-dry. Leave them inside out, to keep them from bleaching in the sun if you hand them outside. Do not tumble dry.

, Denim fibers will last a lot longer the less you wash them. Try to wear them a few times before you wash them, and only wash your jeans if they've developed an odor or become soiled in some way. If you have only worn them for a few hours, you should wear them again.


Your jeans will eventually fade after a while. The first time you wash your jeans they can shrink up to 2-3 cm. in length or width. If you're worried about them shrinking too much you can buy pre-shrunk jeans. Most jeans are pre-shrunk, but some aren't.

Roll the jeans up when you take them out of the dyer.",How to Soften Jeans," The oldest tried and true method of softening jeans is simply wearing them and letting the fibers stretch and soften. When you first buy jeans, wear them every day or at least as often as you can. They’ll soften up faster if you wear them for a week straight than if you wear them once a week., While the jeans will soften with normal wear, biking achieves an exaggerated effect. The constant bending and stretching motion that riding a bike requires puts extra stress on the jeans, breaking them in faster.Spend a half hour or more riding in your new jeans to jump start their softening.

, Put the jeans on and stretch one of your legs out in front of you as far as you can. Then lower your other knee to the ground. Stand back up and do the same thing with the opposite leg. Repeat this process at least a handful of times to break the jeans in quickly., Washing denim tends to tighten up the fibers that you’ve stretched out with wear. For occasions when you don’t get the jeans filthy, washing them every 5-10 times of wearing them is sufficient. You’ll have to judge for yourself if they are actually dirty and ready to be washed., Check the tag of your jeans to confirm this, but most jeans are supposed to be washed inside out. Since washing distresses the color and look of the jeans, turning them inside out reduces this a bit.







, Although denim isn’t going to shrink all that much, it’s still best to wash new jeans with cold water. Set the washer on a small load cycle and turn the agitation to high if you have the option. Let the basin fill before you put the jeans in it.For front-load washing machines, you won't have the option to fill the machine first. If you have a front-load washer, add the jeans as you normally would.

, Choose whichever softener you prefer. Measure out ½ to 1 capful of the fabric softener and pour it into the water. Swirl the water around with your hand or a hanger so the softener mixes into the water.








Don’t add any detergent the first time washing the jeans. Only add fabric softener.
For front-load washers, you may have to put the softener in the detergent compartment so it adds to the water during the wash cycle.

, Put the jeans into the washing machine and press them down under the water. Hold them there long enough that they soak up the water. You want to make sure they soak up the water rather than sit on the top of it. Close the lid and start the washer., If the jeans are especially stiff, stop the machine after it finishes the wash cycle and before the water drains. Add a bit more softener and start the wash cycle over again. It’s okay to do this three or four times for extra-stiff, new jeans., If the jeans aren't super stiff, let the washing machine run as normal the first time through. Also, if you run the wash cycle with softener additional times, let the machine run through the whole cycle (including rinse and spin) on the last time., Pull the jeans from the washer and leave them inside out. Also make sure the zipper is up and the jeans are buttoned., High heat puts extra and unnecessary stress on the material of the jeans, so stick to the low setting. Permanent press or delicate are both good options. It’s best to dry only a few pairs of jeans at a time or they will take a lot longer to dry., Dryer balls are rubber or wool balls that beat against the jeans during the dry cycle. They loosen the fibers of the jeans, which provides extra softening. Dryer balls are especially helpful with stiff fabrics like denim.Look for dryer balls in the laundry sector of the grocery or big-box store. Dollar stores may even have a cheap version.
Tennis balls are a cheap alternative which accomplish the same effect.

, Pull the jeans out of the dryer and roll them up while they are still hot. Fold the legs on top of each other. Then start rolling from the bottom of the pants until you get to the top. Leave them rolled up at least until they cool off from drying.

",How to Rip Your Own Jeans," You can rip any pair of jeans and get the same results, but don’t feel obligated to rip a pair of jeans you already own, as you can thrift for comfortable, cheap jeans at local secondhand and consignment shops.


Using jeans that are already worn a bit may give you better results than using brand new jeans, but don’t let that stop you from purchasing a new pair for this project.
Light to medium wash jeans typically look the best when ripped, as their color lends them a more distressed look. Dark washed jeans look too freshly dyed to be ripped, and might not look as “realistic.”;
, Pretty much all you need to rip up your jeans is a pair of jeans and something sharp. Depending on what kind of style you want, though, you'll probably want to use a sharp tool appropriate for the job:



If you want to create holes, use scissors, a razor, or a sharp knife to rip your jeans. X-acto knives or box cutters will work as well.

To create a frayed look, use sandpaper, a cheese grater, steel wool, or a pumice stone.

, Lay your jeans out flat on a table, and use a pencil to mark the places you want to tear. Use a ruler to mark an exact length if you want. Keep in mind the ultimate shape and the length as well as the width of your holes.


Generally, most people only rip around the knees of jeans, though you can rip anywhere around the leg of the pants.
Try to aim a little higher than your knee, so the tear won't get super-big as you walk around. Every time your knee bends, it might catch the hole and rip it more.
Don't rip too high, or your underwear might show.

, Slip a small block of wood to insert into the pant legs while you do the distressing, so that you don’t alter both the front and the back of the pants.








Alternatively, you could even use a cutting board, an old book or stack of magazines, or anything you wouldn't mind cutting into. Just don't do it on the kitchen table, if you're using a very sharp knife.

, Before you start cutting up the jeans, use the sandpaper or steel wool to start rubbing and thinning out the spot you want to rip up. This helps to loosen the fibers in the jeans and make it easier to rip.









Use a variety of different tools. Alternate between using sandpaper, steel wool, and your pumice stone if you have everything. This may take a bit of time depending on the thickness of your jeans to start.
If you'd rather just cut the jeans, go ahead. You don't have to weaken them first, unless you want them to look frayed.

, If you want frayed areas and stringy patches in your jeans, use your scissors or knife to tug at the area you just weakened with the sandpaper. This will loosen fibers in the area, allowing for a little skin to show through when worn. Pull at the white threads that stick out from the jeans to encourage this look.








, Take your scissors and cut a small section inside the distressed area. Make it as small as possible. You can always make it bigger, but you risk ruining the jeans and making them unwearable if you make it too big. Aim for a tear no bigger than a half-inch or so.









Make the rip across your body, not up and down. This looks more natural.

, Ripping it will tear the fibers, making it look like a real hole. Tug at the threads to pull them out a bit, as they would with natural rips.


Avoid cutting the hole too much, as this will give a very clean, unnatural edge to the fabric.
Alternatively, you can also just cut a small hole and let it grow as you wear the jeans. It'll look more natural this way.

, To keep the holes from getting even bigger, reinforce them by sewing around the perimeter of the hole. Use either a white or blue-colored thread to sew around the rip, either by hand or with a sewing machine.









If you want the jeans to grow over time, feel free to nix this step.If you want to learn more about sewing jeans, read this article.

Grab a pair of jeans and lay them on a flat work space.,
Measure straight across the top for the waist size.,
Measure the thighs two inches below the crotch seam.,
Measure the inseam from the crotch to the hem.,
Measure the front rise from the crotch to the waist.,
If desired, take other optional measurements.",How to Size Jeans1," Most of the measurements you need to make to size a pair of jeans are easiest if you lay them down flat. You can also take all of the measurements in this section holding the jeans vertically, but it can be a little awkward to hold and measure them at the same time unless you have a friend to help.


For the most accurate results, smooth out any folds and allow the jeans to settle before measuring.
Your jeans should be fully zipped up and buttoned before beginning.;
, Pull the top corners of your jeans so that the waistline is tight and flat against itself. For most cuts, the button and zipper should not hang below the rear waistline (however, on some tapered cuts, this will be the case.) Stretch a tape measure from the left side of the waist material to the right. Double this number to get your waist size.


If your waistband is made from elastic material, be careful not to stretch it as you measure or you will inflate the waist measurement.
Make a note of whether the jeans are labeled as ""high-wasted"" or ""low rise."" If the jeans are intended to sit somewhere besides your natural waist, when you measure yourself, be sure to shift your tape measure up or down by a few inches to compensate.

, From the crotch seam (the point below the zipper or button where the two legs meet), move about two inches (5 centimeters) down one of the legs. Measure horizontally across the leg. Double this number to get your thigh measurement.

, Smooth one of the legs so that it's flat and tight against the ground. Stretch a tape measure from the crotch seam down the side of the leg to the hem or cuff (the bottom of the leg.) This is your inseam (or ""inside leg"") measurement.Note that you do not need to double this measurement.

, Once again, pull the corners of the waistband so that it is tight and flat against itself just like you did when you took the waist measurement. Find the crotch seam and stretch a tape measure from here up to the waistline, passing over the button and zipper. This is your front rise measurement.


A less important measurement, the back rise, is measured from the crotch seam back and over the rear of the jeans to the top of the rear waist band. The rear rise will always be bigger than the front rise (especially on women's jeans to accommodate a curvier figure.), In general, the measurements above should be plenty for finding a pair of jeans that fits you well. However, there are other measurements you can take to get an even more precise fit — a few are listed below:



Knee: Measure across one leg at the point where your knee would normally bend. This is usually around 14 inches (33.5 centimeters) down from the crotch, but you may need to adjust a little for especially long or short pants. Double this measurement.

Seat: Measure across the back of the jeans at the widest point of the seat, usually about 7 1/2 inches (20 centimeters) below the waistline.You may need to adjust slightly based on the size of the jeans. Double this measurement.

Hem line: Measure across the opening at the bottom of the leg. Double this measurement.

Measure around your waist where your pants normally sit.,
Measure your thighs around their thickest point.,
Measure your inseam from your crotch to your ankle.,
Measure your front rise from your crotch to around your belly button.,
Take the rest of your measurements if desired.",How to Size Jeans2," Finding your own measurements to compare to your jean measurements is basically a matter of putting the measuring tape in the places on your body that correspond to the different jean measurements. For example, to get your waist measurement, you'll want to wrap the tape around your torso about where your pants would normally sit. Find the spot where the tape touches itself — this is your waist measurement.


This measurement can be tricky if you're shopping for jeans with a non-standard waist measurement (like low-rise jeans, high-waisted jeans, etc.) You may need to move the tape measure an inch or two up or down to compensate. To find your natural waist, bend to one side and find the spot where your body creases. Measure from this spot around the torso, passing through the belly button.
To get the most accurate results, all measurements in this section should be taken in your underwear, a pair of short shorts, tights, or something similarly form-fitting.

, Find the fullest part of your thigh — on most people, this should be near your crotch. Take a tape measure and wrap it around this point of the thigh. This is your thigh measurement.


Try not to pull your measuring tape too tight or you can give yourself an inaccurate thigh measurement and wind up in an uncomfortable pair of jeans. The tape should be snug, but you should still be able to slip one finger underneath.

, Measuring your inseam by yourself can be a little tricky, so if you have a friend you trust well enough to help you may want to use him or her. Stand up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart. Stretch the tape measure from an inch or two below your crotch all the way down the inside of your leg to the middle of your ankle. Keep your leg straight and keep the tape tight against the inside of your leg. This is your inseam measurement.


For the best results, don't bend over to read the measurement, as this can subtly change the length of your leg. Instead, use a mirror or have a friend take the reading for you.
If you're struggling to hold the measuring tape in place, try using adhesive tape to secure one end to your ankle while you hold the other at your crotch.

, Stretch a tape measure from just behind your crotch line (the bottom of the crotch of your underwear) up and over the front of your pelvis to your waist. For women, this is around the belly button; for men, usually an inch or two below. It can be helpful to wear a belt for the front rise measurement to give yourself an indication of where your jean waist would lie.


For the rear rise measurement, you'll want to measure from the crotch line back and around to your rear belt line, passing over the seat of your underwear.

, As noted above, the rest of the measurements in this section will usually be enough to get you a good-fitting pair of jeans. However, for extra accuracy, you may want to take the measurements below as well — it's up to you and the person you're buying jeans from!



Knee: Wrap the tape measure around your knee at its widest point. Generally, this is near the top of the knee.

Seat: Wrap the tape measure all the way around your pelvis and bottom at their widest point. This is usually midway between your waist and the start of your thighs, but this can differ, especially on women.

Hem line: Wrap the tape around your ankle at its widest point.

Pick a pair of jeans that closely matches your measurements.,
Always try on your jeans before buying.,
Keep in mind that jeans stretch slightly.,
Consider having your pants tailored.,
When in doubt, use a size chart.",How to Size Jeans3," Once you know your own measurements and you know how to find the measurements for a pair of pants, it's not hard to narrow down your selection of pants to the few pairs that fit you best. If possible, try to pick a pair whose measurements never differ by more than an inch (2.5 centimeters) from your own.

, Once you've made this mistake once, you'll never make it twice: always try on jeans before you pay for them. Even a pair of jeans that looks perfect on paper may not fit comfortably once you actually try them on. One reason for this is that different manufacturers use different standards for their sizes — some designers can even differ from the ""actual"" measurements by a matter of inches. In addition, some materials (especially elastics, etc.) feel more comfortable to wear tightly than others. For these reasons, you'll never want to buy a pair of jeans just because they seem like they'll probably fit you without making sure.


If you're shopping online, trying pants on before you buy them is unfortunately impossible. In this case, you may want to read customer feedback and reviews to get a sense for how the pants fit (e.g., whether they're unusually tight in the thighs, sit low on the waist, etc.) You may also want to consider buying from retailers with generous return policies for online sales so that, if worst comes to worst, you can get your money back and buy a different size.

, Unless they shrink in the wash, most pairs of jeans are at their tightest the first time you wear them. With the stresses from repeated wearing, most jeans loosen up slightly over time, becoming more comfortable to wear (Some people call this process ""breaking in"" a pair of jeans.) This may affect your purchase — if a pair of jeans feels just ever-so-slightly too tight when you try them on, you may be able to get away with wearing them in the long run.


Some tailors even recommend buying jeans that are 1/2 inch (about 1.25 centimeters) too small for you so that they will fit perfectly once they're broken in.Note, however, that this is somewhat dependent on the quality of the material.
Keep in mind also that different brands of jeans almost always fit and stretch slightly differently. One online fashion source ranks common jean brands as follows (from tightest to loosest):H&M, Calvin Klein, Alfani, Gap, Haggar, Dockers, Old Navy





, Not happy with the fit of your jeans? By enlisting the services of a professional tailoring service, you can make sure that your jeans fit just right. There are two ways to do this: by visiting a tailor's shop in person with your jeans or by using an online made-to-order jean seller (like for instance, madetoorderjeans.com).The former option is virtually guaranteed to get you the correct fit, while the latter is more convenient but is susceptible to your own measurement errors as well as the manufacturer's.


Jeans weren't traditionally the sort of garment that would usually be brought to the tailor, but you don't need to worry about bringing your jeans in for tailoring today — designer jeans can easily cost hundreds of dollars, so it's best to make sure they fit., Jean sizes — especially for women — are notoriously difficult to get just right. If you need help figuring out exactly which pair of jeans is best for you, try consulting a jean size chart (you can find a good one for women here and a good one for men here.)To use a size chart, find your measurements on the chart, then read across to the left to determine which size you need. For example, using the first chart suggested above, if we had about a 31 inch waist, a 43 inch hip, and a 25 inch thigh measurement, we'd be about right for a size 14 pair of jeans.

Wear jeans that are a couple sizes too big.,
Break the jeans in so that they hang just right.,
Find the right place for the jeans to sit.,
Tighten your belt.,
Show off your underwear.,
Add another layer to your outfit.,
Go shirtless.,
Sag your shorts or sweatpants.",How to Sag Your Jeans," Choose a pair of jeans that are one or two sizes too big for you in the waist. This way, the jeans will have enough extra space to sag lower on the hips but won’t be so big that they fall straight off. If you’re going to be wearing a belt with your jeans, you can buy several sizes up for a baggier fit and tighten the belt to keep the jeans where you want them.If you’re sagging your jeans without a belt, keep to only an inch or two extra in the waist. Any more and you’ll have difficulty keeping them on.;
, Put the jeans on and move around in them a little if they’re new or have been washed recently. The more worn-in a pair of jeans feels, the better they will look hanging off the hips. Knead and pull at the waistband and thighs of the jeans by hand if you want, or bend, crouch, and lift your knees high while wearing them to get the jean to better conform to your body.Some types of jeans like joggers make use of elastic waistbands that gather and bunch around the waist to prevent them from sagging. The scrunchy elastic will ensure that the pants hug the hips while sagging, which will keep them up, but may have a tendency to rest a little higher up. You may spend more time adjusting pants with elastic waistbands.

, Depending on your body type and waist size, the best place for your jeans to rest when sagging will vary. Decide exactly how low you want your jeans to fit. Pull the jeans on and then tug them down a little at a time or let them slouch naturally until they come to rest in a natural, comfortable spot.For most people, a few inches below the hip bones, right around the crease of the hips, will work best, because the jeans can sit low while being held up by the contours of the butt and thighs.
Remember, you’re trying to look good. Sagging any lower than about the upper thigh will expose your crotch and make you look ridiculous.

, Once your jeans are where you want them below the hips, tighten your belt to cinch the waistband and keep them in place. Your jeans may slide up or down slightly as you walk, but with minor adjustments your belt should hold them at just the right level. Don’t tighten your belt too much or the pants may ride up and stay in place higher than you want them.


Try not to sag so low that the waistband of your jeans constricts your movement while walking.
Resist the urge to pull your jeans up or down constantly, as this looks less like a cool, effortless slouch and more like you don’t know how to wear clothes that fit you.

, Besides ease and comfort, most of the appeal of sagging jeans is showing off a bit of underwear. This can help project a confident, alluring, sexy look for men and women alike. Pick out some underwear that are especially flattering or eye-catching and sag your jeans low enough to reveal them. Wearing a shirt that is cut a bit short can also help you show more of your underwear—some guys even prefer to tuck their shirt tails into their underwear so they don't get in the way!Bright colors and patterns like plaid look good under sagging jeans because they provide a little visual contrast.
Be careful: the dress codes enforced by certain business don’t allow pants to sag excessively, and some states even have laws in place that can hit you with a fine or jail time for wearing pants so low that they expose undergarments., Lend some complexity to your look by treating sagging jeans as another layer in your outfit. You already choose your shoes, socks, jeans, shirt and jacket to match; sag enough to show off your underwear for an extra matching layer. Again, choose bold colors, patterns and designs that will match the rest of your clothes but stand out beneath them. You’d be surprised how much a stripe of color or texture can add to an outfit.Start thinking of your underwear as part of your outfit, rather than beneath it. Buy designs you like that complement the types of clothing you tend to wear.
You can also sag to show off the waistband of your underwear if you tend to wear prestigious designer labels. This is an especially popular look with younger male celebrities., Lose your shirt and let your sag speak for itself when the setting allows. Whether it’s a hot day or you’re looking to inject a little more sex appeal, a shirtless-sagging combination can help you achieve the right look. This is the exact aesthetic that turned a young Mark Wahlberg into a national fashion icon in the early 90s., You’re not just limited to sagging jeans. Give your sweatpants or shorts a little slack the next time you’re headed to the gym or playing a game of touch football, or even if you’re just lounging around. Sagging athletic gear will help you put off a playful, sporty appearance—as long as they don’t interfere with your jump shot, you’re good to go!


Athletic pants like sweats typically feature elasticized waistbands that will be both an advantage and disadvantage when trying to keep them in the right place.

Wear your jeans, but use your pockets sparingly.",How to Prevent Skinny Jeans from Stretching," Owning a pair of skinny jeans that accentuate your frame and is the right cut for your body perfectly is a great way to prevent fitting issues later. Keep the fact that any and all sizes can wear skinny jeans in mind while you shop.For example, straighter shapes might want to gravitate toward low rise, super skinny jeans tailored at their calves. A tall person might want their skinny jeans to have a mid to high rise.
Skinny jeans that sit at a waist and have a classic silhouette tend to compliment most body shapes well, even curvier shapes.;
, Washes tend to be about personal preference more so than anything else, however, some washes offer a more flattering look than others. Darker washes tend to make people look slimmer, but lighter washes show less wear and tear over time and through use.Dark washes are most flattering on all shapes and sizes. As a denim selection, it offers the most versatility in being paired with different items. If you decide you want to invest in a higher price tag and splurge or a pair of designer skinny jeans, a dark wash is the way to go.
Medium washes are a color in between dark washes and light washes. Medium shades offer a range in versatility as well and can be worn in denim-heavy outfits where you wear denim jackets or shirts and want to pair it with jeans.
Light washes are hot and cold when it comes to size and shape flattery. Light bleached denim can make you look larger and show imperfections in the denim as well as the imprint of your underwear. If you choose to wear light wash skinny jeans, like in the summer for example, go for a sturdier denim in a mid to lighter blue denim wash to give your shape the most flattering effect.

, If you need extra help, ask a sales assistant to measure you. Knowing your waist size is important, because when you are unsure about whether the size 2 you are in one brand reflects the size 4 you are in another, you can compare your waist size to the waist size the tag will show – helping you accomplish the perfect fit.When skinny jeans are too small, the areas in the knees and waist that are supposed to be fitted tend to pull and stretch. This makes the jeans look awkward and feel uncomfortable.
When trying on jeans, make sure that the butt and thigh areas of the jeans have a more fitted feel than other jean types.Back pockets should sit on your butt squarely without showing the pocket lining or without pulling the denim., While a price tag doesn’t necessarily mean the jean will be less prone to stretching, consumer reviews and customer loyalty to brands say a lot about staying power of a pair of jeans.Levi’s are a great jean brand to start with due to its longevity, brand awareness, and loyal customer fanbase.


A good way to determine the quality of a pair of jeans is by looking at its fabric and its denim. Double ring spun denim (like Selvedge/Selvage denim jeans) has a different look than commodity denim (like store brand jeans) and will likely hold up much longer.Low quality jeans also have small, weak bar tracks on the belt loops and throughout the jeans, as well as fewer stitches per inch.

, Undesirable stretching in skinny jeans often occurs when the denim is pulled excessively due to bending in the knees or waist. When the jean has some spandex, it will move with the bend.


Test the “recovery” capability on skinny jeans. When you try the jeans on for the first time, crouch to the floor in a squat for 60 seconds. When you stand up, you’ll be able to assess whether or not the jeans are able to retain their shape even as you move., Turn your skinny jeans inside out and hand wash it in a bath of cold water with a small amount of liquid detergent, like Woolite Black.If you find that stretching from wear is happening, wash them to promote shrinking in the fabric.Always review and follow the washing instructions on the jean tags, since some jeans require very specific care to prevent stretching, shrinking, and fading.
The fibers can be weakened when excessive heat and harsh detergents are used in washing. This causes stretching, shrinking, fading and makes them more prone to rips and tears.Consider using a laundry conditioner to clean your jeans, like The Laundress Denim Wash. Laundry conditioners get your jeans clean while preventing stretching, fading, and fuzz., Get the most out of washing your jeans by allowing your jeans to air dry. Hang them up to air them out and help them maintain their shape and quality for much longer.Most people will instinctively want to put their jeans in the dryer, which is useful with helping skinny jeans shrink, but not recommended for long or excessive use because of the wear and tear the machine can create. Air dry your jeans whenever possible.
To accelerate drying even further, hang your jeans on a clothesline and allow the fresh air to help them dry and revitalize its scent. Be careful that they are not directly exposed to sunlight.

, If ever you’re feeling your skinny jeans are a little looser than you’d like, put them in the dryer. After hand washing them gently, toss them into your dryer at the highest setting to make the fibers of the denim constrict for a tighter fight when you wear them again.Be aware that a commercial dryer can cause wear and tear in denim with excessive use so use a dryer at your discretion.
If using a commercial dryer is your preference for drying your jeans, toss them in at the lowest setting to cut down some of the potential harm regular use may cause to the look and feel of your skinny jeans.

, Whether your skinny jeans were a bargain or a hefty investment, one of the goals with your jeans is to maintain its original color. With the water and soap you use for washing your jeans, denim’s dye will erode over time, with soap quickening that process even more. Set the dye in the denim before you wash it for the first time.Soak your skinny jeans in a bath containing cold water, a cup of white vinegar, and a tablespoon of salt. Allow it to soak for about an hour.
This step is especially crucial for darker washes and black skinny denim jeans. After the salt and vinegar soak, allow the jeans to lay flat to dry. The vinegar smell will go away once the jeans have dried.

, Jeans are one of those clothing items that can be worn often without the need for regular daily washing. To help jeans keep their color and shape, keeping your washes to a minimum is necessary. If you’re on a regular schedule of giving your jeans a wash every 4-6 months, mist them instead of washing them.Freshen up your pair of jeans by filling a spray bottle with equal parts cold water and Vodka. Give your jeans a mist with the solution. Allow them to air dry and then place them in the freezer overnight. Odor-causing bacteria will be kept at bay and will help keep any smells away.
An Vodka-free alternative is hanging your jeans up and spraying it down with some Febreze to help with odors. A quick tumble dry in the dryer with a dryer sheet is also effective., So you dropped some ketchup onto your jeans while you were eating or got an ink stain from a pen, what should you do? Washing is a possibility, but it breaks down jeans if done too often and it might not get rid of the stain. Instead of that, use some things around the house as spot treatments to help give your jeans a clean look again.If you ever happen to get some paint on your jeans, use Mötsenböcker’s Lift Off to help you with your stained denim woes.
Hairspray is a great way to remedy ink stains that might be drawn to your skinny jeans.
For grease stains, use Pine Sol to remove them.
A magic eraser also does the trick with most denim stains without excessive scrubbing or potential of disrupting the dye., Storage is as important as a step as any when it comes to caring for your denim properly. Avoid using hangers as a means for storing your jeans. The way you bought them folded up on that denim display is ultimately the best way to keep them. Fold your jeans to help them keep their shape over time., Jeans tend to get better the more you wear them. They hug you better, they gain a little character over time with fading and/or tears. It should be noted though, that excessively placing cell phones, cards, wallets, and chapsticks in your pockets can change the shape of your jeans, promote tearing, and leave permanent stains in those areas. So wear them, but consider using other things to hold your belongings to help them be worn the right way."

Wash your jeans in hot water.,
Dry your jeans with high heat.,
Wash and dry again if needed.",How to Shrink Skinny Jeans1," Change the settings on your washing machine to put it on the hottest water setting. Put the jeans in the washing machine by themselves and allow them to wash like normal.You can add a small amount of laundry detergent, but it’s not necessary.


The hot water will make the fibers in the jeans contract, therefore shrinking them.
This method works best on jeans that are 100% cotton, rather than cotton mixed with a polyester blend or spandex.;
, After washing the jeans, place the jeans in the dryer. Change the dryer settings so the jeans dry on the highest heat setting possible, and allow the jeans to dry for a complete cycle., After drying the jeans, try them on to see if they have shrunk to your satisfaction. If they have not shrunk enough, wash and dry the jeans again to make them shrink even more.

, Combine together ¾ cup of warm or hot water with ¼ cup of fabric softener in a spray bottle.Close the top to the spray bottle, and shake the bottle to combine the mixture.

, Spray whatever area of your jeans you are specifically trying to shrink.For example, if the calf areas on your jeans are a little baggier than you want them to be, spray the calf areas with the spot-shrinking spray. If you want to shrink the thigh area of your jeans, spray down the thigh areas.


Be sure to spray both the front and back of the jeans if you want to shrink down an area that covers the span of your entire leg.
If you are trying to shrink the butt area for example, spray the back of the jeans, not the front.

, Change the dryer settings to have the heat setting the highest temperature it can go.Put your jeans in the drying machine and let them complete a full drying cycle. Remove the jeans from the dryer, and try them on.


If the jeans haven't shrunk down enough, repeat this process again.

Wash jeans infrequently.,
Turn the jeans inside out prior to washing.,
Use a color preserving detergent or vinegar.,
Wash jeans with other garments.,
Use the lowest spin cycle and temperature.",How to Prevent Jeans from Fading in the Wash1," Jeans do not actually need to be washed as regularly as other clothing items. In fact, washing jeans too often can cause them to fade prematurely.You really only need to machine wash jeans once ever 4 to 6 weeks. If you notice any stains during this time frame, you can spot clean with household cleaners rather than throwing the jeans in the wash.;
, This should be a standard practice each time you throw a pair of jeans in with the laundry. Turning the jeans inside out will prevent detergent from wearing as harshly on the dye. Jeans washed inside out will maintain more of their color., If you notice your jeans seem to fade a bit with each wash, use a color protectant detergent. You can buy this at most supermarkets or department stores. You can also opt not to use detergent at all. Vinegar can be used as replacement and may better preserve the color of your jeans.Detergent is meant to eliminate stains but often does not differentiate between stains and dye. Vinegar, on the other hand, will make for a milder wash, cleaning your jeans without removing dye.
Vinegar has a strong smell, however. If you have a sensitive nose, using vinegar may be a bad idea.

, Jeans tend to fade less when washed with other dark clothing. Dark dyes can fade in the wash and swirl around with other clothes. If clothing is packed in together, less dye will fade out. Wait until you have a lot of dark clothes that need washing before washing your jeans., Jeans require a gentle wash and low temperatures to prevent fading. Set your washer for the slowest spin cycle possible and the lowest temperature water. If there's an option for a gentle wash or a hand wash on your washing machine, use it."

, If you need to use a dryer for any reason, such as needing the jeans dry right away, use the lowest heat setting possible. The higher the heat setting, the more likely the jeans are to fade., Never dry jeans outside on a clothing rack. Direct sunlight can cause jeans to fade. Always dry jeans inside, away from open windows or other sources of direct sunlight., If your jeans get dirty or start to smell, do not immediately throw them back in the wash. You can mist the jeans to remove an unwanted smell instead. You should only wash jeans every 4 to 5 weeks.Take a spray bottle. Fill it up halfway with cold water and halfway with vodka.
Mist your jeans and then place them in the freezer overnight to reduce the smell.

Air dry jeans after washing.",How to Pintuck Jeans," Roll up the cuff of each pant leg to adjust the cuff length. This will also give you an idea of what the cuff will look like when the rolled-up part is removed. Use a piece of white chalk to mark the bottom of the trench formed by rolled fabric.You may want to put these pants on and check out the length in a mirror. It can be difficult to tell if the length is just right without a second opinion or a mirror.;
, Unroll the cuffs. Your chalk line will indicate where the pants should be cut to remove the bottom hem from each leg. If your line is faint, go over it again with your chalk. Cut the pants at this line with scissors to remove the hem.


The line for cutting your hem should be even and directly crossing the leg from side to side.
The bottom hem of each leg can be thrown away or recycled after being removed., Lay the jeans flat on a level, clean surface. Use your ruler to find the center of the front of the leg. The pintuck line will run up the center of each pant leg. Mark this center line with your chalk.


Generally, pintuck lines start at the bottom of your adjusted cuff. Lines end about 2 in (5 cm) from the top hem and about 3 in (7.6 cm) from the center of the fly.
Where the fabric transitions from thigh to hip, your pintuck line will arc slightly inwards to point roughly at the top fly button.
Apply the chalk lightly at first. This way, if your line isn’t perfect, you can wipe it away with a lint-free rag. When the lines look good, go over them again firmly with chalk., The cut of some pants may cause your pintuck lines to fall unevenly. You’ll only be able to figure out whether this is the case for you by putting on your pintuck marked pants. Check out the lines in a full-length mirror.


If you don't have a mirror, ask a friend to take a look at your lines or snap a picture of the pants with your cell phone camera.
Wipe away chalk with a dry, lint-free rag and adjust lines as needed. Snap a picture of your lines so you have a point of reference if you need to take them off to make adjustments., Take one pant leg and fold it at the pintuck line. When the fabric is creased at the pintuck line, press the crease with an iron as you would normally.Do this for both pantlegs. Each leg should be creased and pressed so the crease faces directly inwards at the space between pant legs.

, Though you can sew your pintuck lines by hand, it will take considerably less time with a sewing machine. Sew the pintuck lines at 1/8 in (.32 cm) from the pressed crease. Sew each line along its entire length.Before sewing pintuck lines, you may want to carefully match the color of thread you’ll use with the thread used in the stitch work of the jeans. On the other hand, a bold color might add a unique touch to your pintuck.

, Many people like to turn up the adjusted cuffs of pintuck jeans to highlight the rough cut and play up the rustic/homemade vibe. This look is quaint and relaxed, so it’ll likely work well with most casual tops.Tops with a few simple vertical lines or frills can create a better sense of cohesion with the pintuck lines on the jeans.

, Most stains and blemishes can be cleaned from your jeans with a white, lint-free rag and cool, soapy water. Blot at stains and let them air dry. Deodorize and refresh your pants without washing them by hanging them in the bathroom while you shower.Use specialized spot cleaners, like detergent pens or spot treatment sprays, to remove stubborn stains. Follow the cleaner’s directions to achieve the best results.

, Washing jeans too often can cause denim fibers to break down. This is especially true for your adjusted cuff pintucks, which will fray more easily where the bottom hem of the pantleg was removed. Try to machine wash your pintucks no more than once a month.


Use a cold cycle when machine washing your jeans. A cold cycle will prevent the fabric from fading or shrinking., In a pinch, it’s OK to machine dry your jeans, but try to avoid this when possible. The heat from dryers will cause your jeans to wear out even more quickly than machine washing. Line dry jeans outside or hang dry them around your home.Hanging jeans in the sun will dry them more quickly, but the sun will bleach the color of your jeans over time.

Wash your jeans first. Dirty fabric won’t absorb the dye well.;
, There are several brands on the market that can be purchased at craft or retail stores, in both liquid and powder form. Follow the dye brand’s instructions. You may need to boil water, or you may be able to use your washing machine instead of a bucket, pot, or sink to dye the jeans.


Liquid dye is more concentrated and is already dissolved in water, so you can use less.If you choose powder dye, you’ll need to dissolve it first in hot water.
Use the right amount of dye. Make sure to follow the brand instructions to ensure that you add the appropriate amount to the water.

, You’ll need your jeans, the dye, a large metal spoon or tongs for stirring and lifting, rubber gloves, a plastic table cover or newspapers, paper towels or sponges, and a sink or tub to rinse the jeans afterwards. Make sure to have on hand anything else the dye instructions indicate.


Prep your work area with newspapers or the plastic table cover so dye does not get onto the floor or other items.
Don’t dye or rinse items in a porcelain or fiberglass sink or tub, as these can stain., The longer the jeans soak, the darker the color.Make sure to stir the water often, following the brand directions. Agitating the jeans prevents any one sport from becoming darker than another.
Try a dye fixative. After the jeans have finished dyeing, a fixative may help retain color before rinsing.Plain white vinegar works, but there are also professional fixatives available for purchase., Rinse your jeans in cool, running water until the water runs clear. Squeeze out any excess water after rinsing., Use gentle detergent and cold water, and don’t add any other clothing to the machine during the wash cycle.


If you use a dryer, dry jeans on the lowest setting or with no heat to ensure the new dye stays bright.

, Make sure to dump all used dye water down the drain, and rinse all items used to dye your jeans thoroughly with fresh, cold water.

, Before wearing new black jeans, you can presoak them to set the dye color. Simply turn them inside-out, and soak them in cold water with one cup of vinegar and a tablespoon of salt.Vinegar and salt act as a sealant on the jeans’ dye., Toss your new jeans into the washing machine for several cycles in cold water to get rid of excess dye that will rub off on other fabrics and contribute to fading.Use a fabric protector spray or dye fixative. Treating your jeans before wearing them with a fabric protector like Scotchgard or using a dye fixative may prevent initial fading., Use the gentlest cycle and cold water.Turn your jeans inside-out before washing. Your jeans will get just as clean when turned inside-out and will endure less abrasion from the machine.Purchase a high-quality liquid detergent made especially for dark and black fabrics. These kind of detergents deactivate the chlorine in the water that can fade colors., Try to avoid machine-washing your jeans as often as possible, there are a few other ways to keep them clean.


Handwashing jeans may be even better than the washer’s gentle cycle. Add a few drops of detergent to a sink, fill with water, and let the jeans soak for about an hour.Spritz your jeans with a spray bottle containing a 50/50 vodka-water mixture, allow them to dry, and put into the freezer overnight to kill bacteria.You can also use white vinegar and water in the same proportions.Steaming your jeans can get rid of both odors and wrinkles Drycleaning is another alternative method. Make sure to point out any spots or stains for professional treatment., Heat will cause further fading, so dry your jeans either with no heat or the lowest dryer setting, or let them drip-dry on a drying rack.


If you prefer to dry your jeans outside, choose a dry, shady spot where they will not receive too much sun. UV rays can damage the fabric and cause further fading.Avoid leaving them in the dryer too long. Remove your jeans while they are still slightly damp to help preserve the integrity of the fabric."

, Jeans that you love are like candy -- you want to savor them for as long as you can, right? Wearing them too often makes the signs of aging advance more quickly, and they're likely to become damaged in the wash. As well, you would feel silly wearing the same jeans several times times per week.

, To retain the color and protect trims and distressed areas, turn them inside out before putting them in the wash. That way, they get clean and yet they are protected from fading.

, A thicker fabric will keep the shape of your t-shirt a lot longer. Hang your t-shirt at the waistline, on a clothesline, to keep an even hemline.

, They create a slimming line. A scooped or crew neck broadens your appearance.

, Sleeveless, short or long sleeves may be your best bet. Three-quarter length sleeves broaden your appearance.

, If worn outside your jeans, the hemline of a t-shirt should be about three inches below your natural waistline. Shorter broadens your appearance. Longer includes the bulk of your jeans.

, Clinging fabrics will accentuate the flaws of your figure. Buy a larger size for the appropriate length and width.

, If you bought a larger size, learn to take in the side seams and sew a hem by hand for a nice finished look. It's pretty simple and you'll get a custom fit.

Put on your jeans to get an idea of the shape you want.,
Grab a needle and thread.,
Try on your jeans to see if they fit.,
Go over the seam again with a much shorter stitch.",How to Make Skinny Jeans1," It's best to go with a pair that fits you snugly around the hips. Stretchy denims works well.









Wear them inside-out. Take a crayon or marker, and draw a line on both legs to show how tight you want them to be. Remember to make the line on the inside so when you wear them you can't see the seams on the outside of the leg. Make sure you draw the line on the opposite side of the manufacturer's original seam.
You can use pins to tack, but you might end up poking yourself or the pins might end up coming out when you take the jeans off.
As an alternative, take a pair of skinny jeans you already own as a guide. Spread out the pair you want to reconstruct inside-out and lay the skinny jeans on top (lining up the crotch). Make sure the seam is evenly on the edge (of both pairs) and take your chalk down the side of your pants, starting about mid-thigh, mirroring the line of the skinnies.

Iron your jeans first to make everything easier. Flat, unwrinkled jeans are easier to work with.

;
, Choose thread that is preferably dark and blends in with the color of your jeans. Jean thread is best as it can withstand the wear and tear your jeans will go through. Thread your needle after slipping off your jeans, and begin to sew. Trace over the line you drew with the running stitch.









Start on the seam that is already there, backstitch a few times, and carefully follow your line all the way down making sure the edge of the denim remains flat. (Pins work for that.)If you're using a sewing machine and concerned the first go-round may not be ideal, set your machine to the loosest stitch in case you have to take it out.

, Walk around in them to see that the legs fit well, or you may want to jog a little -- sometimes jeans can come loose if you start moving around, in which case you'll need to tighten them.









If you're unhappy, remove the stitches. But if they're tight, short, and spaced closely so that there are no bumps in your jeans and the stitches won't be pulled out in the wash, you're good to go. Work over each stitch as perfectly and as carefully as you can -- there's nothing worse than having a brand new pair of skinny jeans for one day and then having the stitches all pulled out the next. This will be hard work, but it is essential.

, Cut any excess fabric if necessary (use a zigzag stitch beforehand) or go over it with a serger, which will seal off the edge and cut off the fabric at the same time.









However, you might want to wear and wash your jeans at least once before you start cutting them up, in case you want to go back and fix something later on.

"
"
Use the fabric you cut off (if applicable) to form new cuffs for your skinnies.,
Fold up the cuffs so the two new marks line up.,
Sew a straight line at the top of the markings all the way down.,
Sew a little bit above the seam that you just made.",How to Make Skinny Jeans2," You probably already sewed a rough seam matching the width of your new pants. Mark the seam on the inside and then use a seam ripper to tear off the rough seam.









While you have your seam ripper handy, rip apart the jean thread that's about one inch on the outside of the seam markings and everything in between those too. This will take a minute to do well.

, Put in pins in the bottom of the cuff. The bottom two edges must line up or your cuffs will be shorter in the front or back!









Then put pins going up the seam and remove the bottom pin. Unfold the entire cuff so you're able to pin it together, top to bottom.

, Follow the pins, taking them out as you go.









Cut off the excess fabric and fold the cuff back up. As you fold it back up, make sure the raw edges of the seam are opened--if they're closed, they'll get bulky and bumpy.
Pin the cuff to the pant leg. Adjust your sewing machine so the needle leans to the left and use the zipper foot instead. You want to get as close as possible to the seam.
Hold open the inner seam and sew all the way around the pant leg as close as possible to the original seam. Try them on after this step -- you may find that they're too long or too short and you can go back to adjust.
If there's too much fabric on the end, zigzag stitch and cut off the excess or use a serger.
Iron the leg of your jeans. Use a high heat setting and flip the pants so that the inside excess fabric is pointing upwards (toward the crotch). Go over this area several times.

, Hold the pants as flat as possible. Repeat this for both sides, constantly making sure each leg lines up with the other.

Wash and dry the finished jeans before wearing.








",How to Make Your Own Jeans," The most important measurements for jeans are your waist and hips. While side seams and inseams are usually quite easy to modify, the hip size can be difficult to alter. Measure your hips at their fullest point, usually 8 or 9 inches (20.3 or 22.9 cm) below the waist. You can use these measurements to look up the correct pattern size on the pattern manufacturer's sizing chart. Most patterns are suitable for use with a range of sizes, so you just need to make sure the range on the pattern you choose includes your size.






;
, As for just about any sewing project, you need to start with the right pattern. Your local craft store or discount store will have a variety of patterns, and you can also order patterns online. You should be able to find a pattern for any style you want. Patterns for non-denim pants can work if you know what you're doing, but if this is your first jeans project, you'll definitely want to use a pattern that's intended specifically for jeans.








, Be careful when choosing your fabric, because many denims are too thin for jeans. Make sure you get ""jeans-grade"" denim. There are many colors available, but you can also dye your fabric to your liking. Indigo dye is the traditional blue jeans dye.








, You should take several measurements at various points from your waist to your hips and down the legs, as well as the crotch. Write down these measurements, adding ""ease"" of up to an inch in the waist, 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) in the crotch, and 2 inches (5.1 cm) in the hips (adding ease ensures that your jeans aren't skin-tight, and you can alter the amount of ease you add depending on your preferences). Compare your measurements to those on the pattern, and alter the pattern where necessary. Remember, of course, to also alter the pattern for the correct length.








, Wash and dry the fabric on the same settings as you would use to wash the finished jeans. You can save water and energy by washing with your other like-colored laundry. Prewashing will make the fabric easier to work with, and it will help you make sure that your jeans really fit.








, Generalized instructions won't help you much at this point. You simply need to cut your fabric and sew it according to the instructions on your pattern.








, Once your jeans are finished, you can add trim, buttons, patches or anything else to dress them up and make them ""designer"" jeans.You can even make holes in them or distress them if you like that look.

Consider getting a pair of jeans that are loose-fitting in the thighs. This will make it easier to cuff them.;
, Use a washable fabric marking pen or a piece of chalk, and make a line. You will only be marking one leg. Try to make the mark as straight as possible across your lap. Be sure that the mark falls below the pocket (unless you want the pocket to show.Most inseams are about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters)., Spread the jeans out on a flat surface. If necessary, go over the line again to make it darker, straighter, and more defined.

, Take a ruler and measure 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) below the first line you have made. This will be your cutting line. You will be cutting the jeans a little bit longer than you want them to be so that you can hem or cuff them.

, Using a pair of sharp fabric scissors, cut the leg off along the bottom-most line. Do not cut the second leg yet.

, Flip them so that the leg you just cut is facing you. Make sure that the sides and waist band are aligned. You should be able to see the other leg right behind it. You will be using the raw, cut edge as a guide. This will ensure that your shorts are even.

, Using the raw, cut edge of the first leg as a guide, cut the second leg off. Discard the two cut legs, or put them into your fabric bin and use them for another project., If you wish to make a pair of cut-off jeans, then cut each leg at an angle, so that the outside edge will be shorter than the inseam. You do not need to hem cut-off shorts.

, If you are making hemmed shorts, fold 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the cut hem inside the jeans and pin it. If you are making cuffed shorts, fold 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the cut the hem on the outside of the jeans. Repeat for the other leg. The cut hem should be touching the first mark you made. The shorts are now 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) longer than you want them to be.

, Using the cotton setting on your iron, press the hems flat. Flip the shorts over and iron the back side as well.

, Fold each hem or cuff up one more inch. You will be folding past the first mark you made. The mark should be on the bottom edge of your shorts, making them the length you wanted. Once again, if you are hemming the shorts, fold inside the jeans; if you are cuffing the shorts, fold outside the jeans. Once you are finished folding, press the hems or cuffs with an iron. Be sure to iron on both sides to get a nice, crisp edge.

, Before you sew the hem or secure the cuffs, put the shorts on. If the shorts are too long or too short, take them off, unroll the hem or cuffs, and iron them flat. Then, roll the hem or cuffs back again, but not as much as before.

, You can hand sew it or use a sewing machine. When choosing the thread, consider using a color that matches the color of the fabric, or the color of the original thread. Look for something that is heavy-duty, or made specifically for jeans.


If you are using a sewing machine, try to use a needle intended for sewing jeans. If you cannot find one, then use a universal needle in size 90/14.If you do not own a sewing machine and don't know how to hand sew, you can use iron-on hem tape to hold the hem in place. Simply cut a piece of iron-on hem tape that is long enough to go around the hem of your shorts. Stick the hem tape inside the hem and iron it.
If you have cuffed your shorts, you do not need to sew it. You can, however, secure the cuffs on the outside and inside seam with a drop of fabric glue or a few simple stitches.

, For an added feminine touch, you can add lace to your hemmed shorts. Pin the lace to the inside of each leg, so that part of the lace is sticking out from behind the bottom hem. Make sure that the lace goes all the way around each leg. Cut off the extra lace, but leave enough behind so that the two ends overlap by about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters), Sew it in place using a sewing machine and pull the pins out. If you do not have a sewing machine, you can hand stitch the lace to the shorts instead.

, You can leave your shorts as they are, or you can give them a personal touch by adding embellishments such as rhinestones, studs, ribbon, and lace. This section will give you some ideas.

, You can add a boho-chic touch to your hemmed shorts by adding a lace inset. Cut two triangles out of lace and pin them to the sides of your shorts. The triangles can be as big or as small as you want them to be. The bottom of each triangle should be aligned with the bottom hem of the shorts, and the center of each triangle should be aligned with the side seam. Stitch the lace onto the jeans using a sewing machine. You can also hand stitch the lace down instead. Do not sew the bottom edge of the triangle; leave it open. When you are done sewing, cut out the fabric behind each triangle, leaving a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) seam.You can use lace fabric or a lace trim. Bridal lace trim works great!
You can also cut triangles out of crocheted doilies.If you are using lace fabric, consider flipping the shorts inside out first. When you are done sewing and cutting, flip the shorts back. The lace inset will be on the inside of your shorts.
The stitching should prevent the lace from fraying, but if you find that the lace keeps on fraying, then you can apply some fray-check or fray-stopper along the edges.

, Cut a piece of lace roughly the same size and shape as the back pocket. It is okay if the lace is a little bit bigger at this point. Pin the lace down to the pocket, and stitch it down along the outer edges of the pocket. Do not stitch the top part of the pocket, or you won't be able to use it. Remove the pins and trim off any excess lace.If you are careful, you can also use fabric glue instead—but keep in mind that the glue might seep through the holes in the lace and get all over your fingers!

, You can add strips of ribbon to the back pocket for extra color and personality. Simply cut a piece of wide, colorful ribbon the same width as the back pocket and glue it down onto the fabric using fabric glue. The upper edge of the ribbon should be aligned with the top of the pocket.

, There are different ways you can attach studs or gemstones to your pocket. Most studs either have to be ironed on, or hammered in. Most gemstones have to be ironed on, or glued on. Simply position the studs or gemstones where you want them to be and hammer, iron, or glue them on according to the manufacturer's instructions.


Gems and studs may look cute on the back pocket, but large, pointy gems and studs may make sitting uncomfortable.
You can place gems and studs anywhere you want, but the most common places are on the back pocket, and along the curved edge of the front pocket.
If you are gluing gemstones on, be sure to use fabric glue or super glue, or they may come off the next time you wash them.

, Draw a shape onto the back pocket. The shape can be anything you want, but simple shapes, such as hearts or stars, work best. Cut the shape out of the pocket, but be careful not to cut the seat of the jeans! You can leave it as it is, or you can add another piece of fabric or lace inside the pocket. This way, you will not only have a pretty inserted design, but nothing will fall out of the pocket. If you are using a second scrap of fabric, be sure to secure it by gluing or hand-stitching it to the inside of the jean pocket., Wrap rubber bands around the shorts. Soak the shorts in a container filled with one part bleach and one part water. You want the shorts completely submerged in the bleach-water solution. If the shorts keep on floating to the top and won't stay submerged, you can weigh them down with a large rock, a heavy glass vase, or something else you won't mind possibly getting ruined. Take the shorts out after about 20 minutes, or until they have been bleached to your liking.


You can create a striped pattern by scrunching the shorts lengthwise into a long rope, and tying the rubber bands at 2 to 3 inch (5.08 to 7.62 centimeter) intervals.
Create small flower or sunburst patterns by pinching a bit of the fabric and tying it off with a rubber band, creating a small 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeter) tall stub. You can create just a few stubs, or you can cover the entire surface with them.
Create a random pattern by scrunching the jeans up into a ball and wrapping several rubber bands around it to keep it together.

, You can use store-bought adhesive stencils or you can make your own using freezer paper. Stick the stencil onto a spot on the shorts you want decorated (such as the bottom cuff, a side pocket, or a back pocket). Next, fill the space in the stencil using fabric paint (for a colorful look) or bleach (if you want a distressed look).


If you are using fabric paint, squirt some paint onto a dish. Dip your paint brush or foam brush into the paint, and lightly dab the paint onto the fabric. Apply the paint using thin, even layers.
If you are using bleach, pour one part bleach and one part water into a spray bottle and shake it up. Spray the bleach onto the fabric.
You can create your own custom stencils using freezer paper. Simply sketch your design onto the dull side of a sheet of freezer paper, then cut it out using scissors or a craft knife. Place the stencil shiny-side-down onto the spot you want decorated and run a hot iron over it. This will cause the paper to stick to the fabric. Remove the iron and let the fabric cool before dabbing the paint on, or spraying the bleach. You can reuse this freezer paper stencil one to three more times by pulling it off carefully, repositioning it, and then ironing it again.
You can also use other items as stencils as well, including scraps of lace and crocheted doilies!

, If you have white or light-colored jeans, you can dye them to achieve a different color. Fill a bucket with 3 gallons (11.36 liters) of hot water—you want at least 140°F (60°C). Add 1 cup (280 grams) salt and ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of liquid dye to the bucket and stir to combine. Soak your shorts in warm water, then add them to the dye bath. Gently stir the shorts in the bucket with a stick for 10 to 30 minutes. Once you get the color you want, take the shorts out and rise them under warm water until the water runs clear. Give them a final rinse with cool water and squeeze the excess water out.If you are using powder dye, dissolve the packet in 1 cup (225 milliliters) of hot water first before adding it to the bucket.
Consider testing the color with a piece of scrap fabric first, before plunking your shorts in. If the color is too dark, add more water. If it is too light, add more dye.
Keep in mind that fabric dyes are translucent and that the original color of the fabric will blend in with the dye. This means that if you use yellow dye on blue shorts, you will get a greenish color.
You can also make tie-dye jeans by wrapping rubber bands around the fabric in random places.

Decide where to hem.,
Fold up the bottom.,
Pin the hem in place.,
Sew the hem.,
Unfold the hem.,
Iron the jeans.",How to Hem Jeans1," Try on your jeans and decide where you would like to hem them. Generally, jeans should fall about an inch above the floor. This will prevent you from tripping and also avoid making your jeans look like they are a size too small. Feel free to alter the length to meet your personal preferences though.;
, Create a cuff where you want the jeans to be hemmed. Crease the fold so it lies flat and double-check that you've folded it up by the correct amount. Once you've done this on one side, measure just below the preexisting hem and use that measurement to create an equal fold on the other leg.








, Place straight pins around the circumference of the pant leg to hold it in place. Check to be sure the seams line up on each pant leg as well as that they are even with each other.







, Stitch around the circumference of the pant leg just below the stitching for the existing hem. You can use a sewing machine or do this by hand. To be clear, you will be sewing the cuff to the pant leg and later will fold it inside the leg. This will allow you to take out the hem later if you grow taller or want the pants longer at a later point in time.








, Tuck the excess fabric of the folded cuff up into the leg of the jeans, folding the original hem down so its outer side shows once again. This should leave you a small loop of fabric along the bottom edge of the jeans inside the leg. Try on the jeans to make sure they are at the correct length.









If you don’t expect to want to lengthen the jeans at any point, then you can also cut the excess fabric. Cut the excess fabric about 1 inch away from the new seam you have created., Use an iron to flatten out the hem you've created along the bottom edge. This will smooth out the loop of fabric tucked into the leg, and leave your jeans looking the perfect length with no tell-tale hemming signs.

Mark your jeans where you’d like the new hem to be.,
Measure and mark two more lines.,
Cut along the bottom line.,
Fold the new hem under.,
Sew the new hem.",How to Hem Jeans2," The best way to do this is to put your jeans on (or have the person who will be wearing the jeans put them on) and fold the cuff under until the jeans are the length you’d like them to be. Then, use a piece of chalk to mark the spot where the new hem should end.







, Measure ½” from the hem line and draw a line above it that is running parallel to the first one. Then, measure and mark another ½” below the original line and draw the line so it is parallel to the original one as well.








Now you should have three lines total. These lines will serve as a guide for you to sew the new hem.

, Cut off the bottom of the jeans and the old hem. To do this, cut in a straight line along the bottom line that you made. Discard the material that you cut off.







, Next, fold along the center chalk line to create the new hem. You may also want to pin along the new hem to hold it in place while you sew. Check to make sure that the hem is even all the way around before you sew.







, Using some gold denim thread, or the thread color of your choice, sew around the area you pinned to hold the new hem in place. Use a straight stitch and try to keep it as even as possible.








Remove the pins as you go.
After you sew around both hems, your jeans will be ready to wear!

Wash the jeans first if they are new.,
Use a new needle.,
Go slow.",How to Hem Jeans3," Denim will shrink a bit the first time you wash it, so it is a good idea to do a pre-wash before hemming your jeans. This will help to ensure that you do not make the hem too short.Make sure to follow the instructions on the label for washing your jeans.

, It is important to change your sewing machine needle after every four hours of sewing or after finishing a major project to ensure that it is sharp enough to do the job. If you have not changed the needle in a while, then put in a new needle before you begin sewing the new hem., Denim and other bulky fabrics can be a bit harder to sew. They may get caught more easily, or not move as efficiently through the presser foot. To ensure that your stitches are even and straight, sew slowly.








Start by applying very light pressure on the pedal to get the stitches started and then only increase the speed slightly if the fabric seems to be moving along well.
If the fabric gets stuck, then you can always use the hand wheel to help move it along.

Choose your jeans.,
Decide the cut length.,
Add cuff or hem length.,
Draw cut line.,
Cut the fabric.,
Hem or cuff as desired.",How to Make Denim Cut off Shorts1," You will want to choose the pair of jeans which you want to turn into cut-offs. These should fit well, at least in the areas which will not be cut away. They should also not have irreparable damage or damage which will cannot be repaired in a visually appealing way (such as wear and holes at the crotch). If they have stains or an undesirable color, this will need to be taken into consideration, though it would not bar them from use.






;
, Put the jeans on in order to determine where they will need to be cut to. Estimate a length, mark the spot (with your finger, chalk or removable, powder makeup) and then double-check by sitting down to ensure that the chosen length is not too short. Once you’ve determined a good length, mark the spot more clearly and remove the jeans.








, With the jeans off, measure at least one inch below the desired length (if hemming) or three inches below (if cuffing). If you want to have the ragged-edge look, do not add any length.








, Measure the distance between the mark you made and the waistline of the jeans. Make this same measurement on the other leg and mark it, so that you have equal points on each side. Mark a straight line, following the threads of the denim if it is possible, across one leg. Fold the jeans to be sure that the mark on the other side is accurate and then draw a similar line on the other leg.








, You will then want to cut the jeans at the line you have marked. Use heavy shears to cleanly cut through the material, as dull scissors will leave edges uneven.








, Use a sewing machine with an appropriate needle to add a 1/2” hem, pinning beforehand and sewing with the jeans inside out. If you wish to add a cuff, which will minimize the the importance of a clean or even cut line, do not hem and merely roll the bottom to the desired length. Now you’re ready to wear your shorts or customize them to fit your style!

Do strategic bleaching and dying.,
Add paint.,
Create a fabric overlay.,
Add lace.,
Create a side slit.,
Finished.








",How to Make Denim Cut off Shorts2," You can use strategic bleaching or dying techniques to change the color and pattern of your shorts. Consider bleaching only the top or bottom half of the jeans, doing a fade effect with bleach, or bleaching the entire pair of shorts and dying them other colors.








, You can paint your shorts, if you do not intend to wear or wash them very often. There are limitless options for how you can paint your shorts and it will depend only on your skill and personal preferences.









For example, you can paint a dark pair of shorts to look like a galaxy or the night sky. Use an old toothbrush lightly dipped in paint to flick speckles of white or silver paint onto your shorts. Smudge on blues and purples to complete the effect.
You can also use a stencil to add a pattern or design to your shorts. Make your own stencil or buy one from a local craft store and then use spray paint to add the design in whatever sections or pattern you prefer.

, You can use a different fabric attached to the shorts in order to make them more fashionable and show your personality. Use cotton prints, such as those found at a quilt shop, and trace the shape of the area you want covered. Leave a seam allowance, iron down the allowance, and then stitch the overlay to the desired section by hand or with a machine, depending on where you are adding it to. You can cover the back pockets, one or both front sections, the cuffs or just the trim.








, Adding lace can make shorts sexy and fashionable, giving them a feminine appearance. You can add lace in a number of ways and in a number of places to achieve different looks.









You can add lace over the whole pair of shorts. Do this by sewing, using iron-in seaming or simply gluing lace trim into rows across the pair of shorts. This looks best if you use several different styles or patterns of lace. Begin at the waist and move downward in even, parallel rows.
You can also add lace to just one section of the shorts. You can add it over the back pockets, over one of the front sections, just at the hem or cuff, or anywhere else you feel it looks best. Trace the shape that you want covered, add a little extra to make the seam, fold and iron the seam down and then stitch the lace into place by hand.

, You can make shorts which are too small fit a bit better by adding a side slit and closing it by adding an inch or two of stretchy fabric to rejoin the sides. Choose a fun print to make them fashionable and show your personality. You can also make shorts sexier this way too, by adding a slit and grommets or button holes to lace it closed.

Put the jeans on again.,
Learn how to ladder your jeans.

",How to Fade out Jeans," Before trying to fade the jeans, you need to make sure that they fit comfortably and well. Mark with chalk where you want to fade the jeans. The jeans usually fade over time at the areas around the knee or thigh, but you can fade them wherever you would like. Look in a mirror to check that you've marked the right spots.;
, After you've checked if the jeans fit well and you've marked where you would like to distress them, take off the jeans. Double check that you've marked the jeans at the right places. You also take the jeans off for safety, sanding them down with them still on may hurt or at least be uncomfortable. Lay the jeans flat on a table and put something like a small block of wood in the part of the leg that you marked with chalk.

, Start lightly sanding over the block of wood. Bits of fabric will bobble and fall off; that's what you're looking for. The less colored fabric on the jeans, the more they will fade. Be sure not to rub too hard, especially on the corners of the block, unless you're trying to rip the jeans. If you're only trying to fade them, sand them lightly. The sandpaper will lose roughness after a while. Either use a different part of the sandpaper or get a new piece.

, Look in a mirror and check that you like what you see. If you don't, sand a bit more. If you think you've sanded a bit much, don't worry. You can fix this two ways. The first way is to sand the rest of the jeans to make it blend in. Go easy though, it's better to ruin a spot rather than the whole item of clothing. The second way is to re-dye that area with some lightly colored dye. For example, dye blue jeans with light blue dye. Dye black jeans with a lighter black (but not grey) dye. This will keep the area standing out too much.

2 towels
Fan (optional);
, You will need about a cap-ful of the shampoo. The shampoo will help soften the fabric and make it easier to work with.If you can't find a sink large enough to fit your jeans, you can also use a bucket or tub.

, Gently swish the jeans around from time to time so that the soapy water gets into the fibers. If the jeans won't stay under the water, you can try weighing them down with a heavy jar.

, Don't rinse, twist, or wring the jeans.

, The towel needs to be long enough to fit your jeans. Place the jeans on top of the towel. Start rolling the jeans and the towel at the same time. You can start from either the top or the bottom. It doesn't matter which side; you are just getting the excess water out.

, Unroll the towel and take the jeans off. The jeans should still be damp, but not dripping wet.

, The towel needs to be long enough to fit your jeans.

, Start tugging from anywhere below the knee in short, little jerks. Work your way down towards the cuffs. Be sure that you tug from both sides of the pant leg (the inseam and the outer seam) so that the leg will be even at the bottom.


If you're using flare jeans, pull by where the flare starts.

, If you want, you can set a fan down next to them. This will speed up the drying process."

",How to Lengthen Jeans4," This method is great for those pairs of jeans that need to be made a lot longer. Because of the wide, colorful cuff you'll be making, this method is great for children's jeans. Here's what you'll need:


Jeans
Tape measure
Scissors
Thread
Sewing machine
Fabric
Sewing pins

, Don't worry, your jeans will be longer by the end of this tutorial. The bottom hems adds a lot of bulk. It will be easier to sew without it.

, You will be sewing a fabric band or cuff to make the jeans longer. First, however, you will need to draft the pattern for your cuff. Here is how to figure out the measurements for your cuff:


Measure around the cut edge of the pant leg (the circumference). Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). You will need this for your seam allowance.
Decide how wide you want the band to be. Multiply that number by 2 (you will be folding the fabric in half later) and add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for the seam allowance.

, You will end up with something that looks like a rectangle. You can use any fabric you want, but a lightweight fabric (such as cotton) may be easier to sew with than a heavyweight fabric (such as canvas). Choose something with a contrasting color. You can even pick something out with a fun pattern.

, Make sure that you are sewing the right sides together. Use a ½ inch (1.27) seam allowance. You will end up with a squat tube.

, You should now see the right sides of the fabric on the outside and on the inside of the tube.

, Align the cut edge of the cuff with the cut edge of the pant leg. Rotate the cuff so that the seam is aligned with the inseam of the jeans. Pin everything in place.

, Slip the pant leg onto the sewing machine and sew along the raw/cut edge. Rotate the pant leg as you go so that it does not get tangled. Snip off any excess thread and tie the ends into tight knots.

, Press the hem against the jean fabric and away from the cuff.

, Slip the pant leg back onto the sewing machine arm and sew the hem down. Try to get as close to the seam as possible. Be sure to rotate the pant leg as you go so that it does not get tangled. When you are done, tie the threads off into tight knots and snip off any excess.

, Your pant legs will now be much longer. The bright band of color along the bottom hem will add some contrast and flair.,"

Stick with dark jeans for a traditionally dressy jean.,
Go with a classic cut, such as a boot or straight, for the most versatility.,
Consider a colored jean.,
Make sure your jeans fit properly.,
Avoid jeans with holes or tears.",How to Dress Up Jeans1," You can still dress up light to medium wash jeans, but darker shades look nicer and more formal than lighter shades. Dark wash jeans are also the most appropriate for casual business occasions.;
, A skinny jean may work under some circumstances, but a boot-cut or straight-leg jean will work for nearly anything, from a fun night out with friends to a casual meeting with a new client.

, Black or white denim can be dressed up with relative ease. Try to avoid funky, bold colors, however, since these may be more difficult to dress up and will likely go out of style after a season.

, The simplest, most important aspect of dressing up your jeans is to start with a pair that flatters your figure and fits your body right. Avoid jeans that are too snug in all the wrong places, as well as jeans that are loose and baggy.

, While some fashion chic styles can be accomplished with ratty-looking jeans, most dressy styles will be difficult to accomplish if your jeans have holes or stains.

Consider a blouse made of an elegant material, like silk or chiffon.,
Try a nice sweater.,
Choose a daring print.,
Choose a subdued print.,
Throw a dress over your jeans.,
Look for feminine details, like lace.",How to Dress Up Jeans2," On its own, a plain shirt and jeans may still look casual, but the combination makes a perfect blank canvas for tailored jackets, sparkly shoes, and rich accessories. Stick with solid colors over graphic tees, and gravitate toward neutral colors like white, black, and brown for the greatest versatility.

, A fitted button-down shirt looks crisp, clean, and business-like, especially when matched with dark jeans. Look for one in a plain color or one with vertical pinstripes.

, Look for a bold color that suits your skin tone. The sophistication of your top will likely prove more than enough to counteract the casual nature of your jeans.

, Shy away from bulky sweaters and stick with stylish cuts. Consider one with an interesting neckline, such as a boat neck, v-neck, or crew neck.

, Bold, bright prints, like geometric designs, often create a sophisticated look.

, Less daring prints, such as floral print, may create a softer, more delicate look.

, Pick out a playful, flowing spring or summer sundress to throw over a pair of skinny jeans. Gravitate toward knee-length dresses. Also stick with dresses that are a little more casual in nature, rather than formal dresses or work dresses.

, Lace and other similar embellishments automatically make a top look classier. This extra class will help your jeans to look dressier, as well.

Add a blazer over top to create a more professional look.,
Try a belted jacket.,
Consider a feminine, fitted cardigan sweater.",How to Dress Up Jeans3," A classic blazer can easily dress up a simple shirt and jeans, transforming it from everyday casual to business-casual. Look for a fitted blazer in a traditional color, like black, navy, or deep gray.


Alternatively, look for a blazer in a bright color to add a little spice and personality to your look.

, A belted jacket adds structure to your outfit, easily dressing up even the simplest of shirt/jean combinations.

, When you want to play up your femininity, a fitted cardigan in cream or white is just the thing. Look for a cardigan with feminine details, like faux pearl buttons, in order to make your jeans look even dressier. Consider wearing it over a lacy camisole or another notably girly top.

Experiment with shoe clips.",How to Dress Up Jeans4," Stiletto heels work especially well, but kitten heels can also dress up your jeans. Go for black or another neutral to give your style class.

, Pick a pair with embellishments, like bows or gems, to add a bit more flair.

, If you have dark jeans and a dressy top in a neutral color, consider a bright red pump or crocodile skin flat to add a chic twist to your outfit.

, Leather boots have a naturally sophisticated look. Ankle-length boots work well with nearly any cut, from the classic boot-cut to the more modern skinny leg.

, Knee-high boots can also look trendy, and if paired with a dark jean and a nice blouse, they can make an outfit look city chic. Pair these boots with a snug skinny jean, however, and zip the boot up over your jean. Wearing these boots beneath your jeans defeats the purpose of having a boot with such a tall height.

, Instead of getting too casual with your shoes on casual Fridays, keep your footwear professional. Stick with high quality leather loafers to add structure and professionalism to your jeans.

, These look like barrettes for your shoes, and they provide a quick, easy way of dressing up an otherwise simple pair of flats.

Choose a smaller, more subtle purse for dressier occasions.,
Dress up your appearance using cosmetics.",How to Dress Up Jeans5," A silk or satin fashion scarf in a bright, bold color dresses up your jeans for a number of occasions. You can wear one with a button-down shirt to dress up your jeans for the office, or you can wear one with a fitted t-shirt to dress up your jeans for the weekend.

, A thin belt looks especially sophisticated, but any belt will help add the structure you need to bump up your ensemble from casual to chic.

, Dangling earrings with a bit of shimmer can really give your jeans an added boost of class.

, These may not make your outfit look more professional, but a colorful piece of jewelry may help transform it for a night out with friends.

, Pearls are the ultimate in timeless sophistication. A simple strand of pearls around your neck or subdued pearl post earrings can even make jeans look dressy.

, Like colorful necklaces and bracelets, this style element can help transform your outfit into a semi-dressy ensemble for a night out with friends. It may not, however, work for the office or a more demanding occasion.

, For a romantic date or an evening function, consider a clutch or other small purse that hangs off a delicate strap. Smaller purses naturally look a little dressier than larger purses, especially in a neutral color like black or brown.

, Focus on one feature and play it up. Wear a bold shade of lipstick or give yourself smoky eyes.

,


Pick the one that's right for you. Iron-on patches and appliques are faster to apply, and great if you don't have much experience sewing.
Choose a location. Flat or simple designs are great for back pockets. Elaborate ones that have sequins or delicate embellishments fare better down the sides of the leg.

, Craft stores sell a wide variety of kits that supply everything you'll need, including design idea booklets.


Be safe when using hot glue applicators. If you've chosen to add crystals to your jeans, read the glue gun instructions carefully.
Mark your studs beforehand. Attaching studs creates small holes in the fabric. Be certain where you want your studs before using the tools.

Decorate your jeans with fabric markers.,
Paint your jeans freehand.,
Use stencils to add designs with fabric paint or markers.,
Add designs or patterns with a stamp.,
Use masking tape and paint to create geometric designs.",How to Decorate Jeans1," Fabric markers draw like ordinary markers, but are made with permanent inks that are designed not to wash out. Fabric markers are likely to work best on white or light-colored denims, although some are designed to show up on darker fabrics.









Try drawing or writing free-hand designs on your jeans. You may wish to sketch in your designs with pencil before going over them with fabric markers.
You can use lace to create a delicate marker pattern on your jeans. Just pin the lace to the part of the jeans you’d like to decorate, color over the part of the pattern you’d like to transfer with a fabric marker, and remove the lace when you’re done.;
, You can use fabric paint to create your own designs. You may wish to lightly sketch in your design with pencil before starting to paint. Keep your painting surface completely flat and prevent bleed-through by inserting a piece of cardboard into the part of your jeans that you’d like to decorate.









Fabric paints come in a variety of textures and application types. Some come in tubes with applicator tips and are designed to be applied in a controlled line, while others are designed to be brushed or sprayed on. Keep in mind what sort of design you would like to do and select an appropriate paint for the job.

, You can purchase stencils to use or make your own. Stenciling usually works best with fabric paint that can be brushed on or applied as a spray. If you are using spray paint, make sure to protect the area around the stencil with a sheet of cloth or plastic so that you don’t get paint where you don’t want it. For brush-on paint, try using a foam brush with a small amount of paint on it so that your stencil designs don’t become runny or smudged.







, You can use pre-made rubber stamps or make your own stamp with a small block printing kit. You can even use ordinary household objects to stamp simple shapes and patterns. For example, use the flat end of a pencil eraser dipped in fabric paint to create polka dots.







, Put strips of masking tape on your jeans to create the desired pattern, and paint over the exposed areas of the jeans. The tape will help you achieve perfect straight lines and crisp edges.

For example, some flat sequins or gems on your back pockets are probably fine, but raised embellishments on the backs of your thighs might create discomfort.

, Most studs can be added to fabric by hand. Just push them through the fabric and fold down the points.If you prefer, you can use a bedazzler to mechanically add studs and gems to your jeans.









Add your studs in a pattern, focus on a pocket, or place them around hems or along seams.
You may wish to mark in the desired placement of your studs with a pencil or marker before you start studding.

, Use a specialized glue like Aleene’s Jewel-It or Beacon Gem-Tac to glue on gems and rhinestones. This technique works best with flat-backed gems. Use tweezers or a jewel-setting tool to help you grip and place the gems and avoid getting glue on your fingers.

, Factors to consider include the width and weight of your jeans, the type of footwear you expect to pair with them, and whether you want a cuff that adds length to your silhouette. The breakdown of cuffs is roughly as follows:









Single Roll: Jeans are rolled up once about 1 inch (2.5 cm), with the option of tucking the hem under the rolled part. This works with a variety of jeans, and suits all body types thanks to its moderate length. Avoid narrow footwear, however, as it may appear too much like a slipper under this non-tapered cuff.
Long Roll: Like the single roll, only longer - up to 2 inches (5 cm). This is for selvage denim that you want to show off. More petite or stocky frames should beware, however, since this long cuff has a shortening effect.A more casual variation involves bunching the cuff a little to create dimension and texture.Skinny Roll: A mini cuff (about 1/2 inch or 1.25 cm) made from three small, tight flips to the hem. As the name suggests, this look is best for slim silhouettes and lighter-weight denim. Delicate shoes shine with this look, but opt out of chunky footwear.Double Cuff (Thick Cuff): First cuff the hem 1 inch (2.5 cm), then again, this time 2 inches (5 cm). This cuff works best with mid- to lightweight jeans; heavier jeans will give this cuff more structure. You can wear mid-weight to chunky shoes. Be aware that the thickness of this cuff can be shortening.Inner Roll: Instead of folding the cuff up, this one is tucked under. The original hemline is concealed, and the look is very smooth. Your denim needs to be fairly hefty to maintain this tuck. Depending on the jean width and how far you tuck under, it can work with a variety of footwear. Another bonus is that it can be quite lengthening., Stand in front of a full-length mirror if you can.









Wearing your favorite shoes and top helps give you a better overall sense of how the cuff works.
You can use a tape measure or ruler to help you make the initial cuff, and then adjust according to your taste.

, Use a tape measure or ruler to measure the length of each fold in the cuff, and write down this information. You'll need in the next section.








, Use cold water on the gentle cycle to prevent fading or shrinking.









Follow the care instructions on the jeans' inside label, if there is one. It may suggest washing the jeans inside out.
Remove the jeans from the washing machine as soon as the cycle has ended to prevent possible wrinkling of the fabric.

, Smooth out the material with your hands as much as possible.


You can lay out a thick bath towel or two underneath if you're concerned about getting the flat surface wet.

, Using your notes about the fold length(s), manipulate the bottom edge of the jeans until it has been folded over into a cuff. Make sure there are as few wrinkles as possible.









Repeat the process with the other jean leg, keeping both cuffs the same length.

, Keep them on a flat surface during the drying process. While it may be tempting to hang them on a clothesline or over a shower rack, doing so can cause the cuffs to unfold.


It might be useful to use a sweater dryer if you have one (you can let the waist drape off the end if the jeans are too long).
Flip the jeans over from time to time to allow both sides to dry evenly.

, Once your jeans are dry, get out your ironing board and heat up your iron.









Again, consult the care label on the jeans for iron temperatures. It may suggest a medium or high setting.
Press with the hot iron on both sides to ensure all wrinkles have been removed.
Press the cuffs (unless you want them bunched, as in the casual version of a long roll).

, Test out your cuffs with a few different outfits and shoes to see how you like it. If you think you've found a cuff you want to keep, you're ready to sew.


If you've worn the jeans several times, it might be necessary to repeat Part 2, Steps 1-6 before sewing.

, Use thread that is of a color similar to the jeans. The needle needs to be sharp and strong enough to penetrate layers of thick denim, so it may be advisable to use a leather needle. If your jeans are lightweight, however, a medium-thick needle may suffice., Do this at two points on either leg, where the vertical hem of the pants meets the horizontal hem of the cuff.









Start the needle from the inside of the leg and make enough stitches that the cuff feels securely in place.
The needle should not pass all the way to the outside of the cuff. Stitch the first layer of hem only.

, Repeat the process on the other jean leg. You're done!

Most of the lines below are sized 24 to 32.,
When in doubt about fit or a too long inseam, get a tailor, the results are usually wonderful.

,
""Stretch Blends"" Jeans with stretch will fit more generously, but as higher quality brands use stronger types of stretch the give will not be as great as the lower end 'shopping mall stretch' jeans (which should be avoided by anyone over 12.),
If you favor jeans with stretch be sure to buy a few high quality pairs, size down and rotate wearing them so they retain their stretch.

,
""True to size"" What does it mean?,
Jeans that ""run small"" : This set of jeans are running small mainly through the hips and thighs but may still work well if you are curvy depending on how you are built.,
Jeans that run really small: These lines (size 30) equivalent to a dress size 7/8 and will fit most comfortably on the very slim and tall or petite and tiny boned.,
Higher Waisted Styles: After rises became dangerously low, many higher end denim lines returned to a high waisted jean.,
Skinny Jeans: Many luxury denim lines now make skinny jeans that taper and fit like leggings.,
As with all jeans lines you will find exceptions to the rule.

",How to Buy Luxury Denim Jeans," Occasionally very small and plus sizes are available in high end denim so ask you retailer to search for you if you have a special size request. Many tiny or plus size celebrities have custom-made jeans from labels you and I normally would buy from which may not be available to the everyday buyer.;
,, Rigid denim (100% cotton) will eventually conform to your body, last much longer and run smaller.

,, The majority of the time a size 30 is equivalent to a size 9/10 dress. Despite a return to some higher-waisted styles, most jeans still hit at the low waist with the average rise (distance from the center crotch to the top of the waist band) being 7 to 9 inches (17.8 to 22.9 cm), thus the waist on a size 30 is measuring 33 to 35 inches (83.8 to 88.9 cm) NOT 30. Size your jeans by your dress size or low waist (where the belt loops are), not your natural waist size.

, A size 30 is equivalent usually to a dress size 9/8. If you are ordering through the mail you may want to size up or order two sizes and return one. Many of these jeans just won't work if you have sizable hips, thighs and booty as the model they were fitted on was probably the lovely Paige Adams Geller, the force behind Paige Premium denim and previously a fit model for half a dozen famous denim brands. Paige has a stunning form but is by no stretch of the imagination a Sophia Loren or Marilyn Monroe type.

, Think Paris Hilton, Kate Hudson or Teri Hatcher. If you are curvy you will definitely want to try on a pair in person and not buy online unless there is an unconditional return. Stretch blends will create some give but usually not enough if you want to sit down. These jeans create curves in all the right places and look amazing on skinny women.

, These look best if they are slightly bootcut. higher waisted styles will have a natural corset effect and give you a waistline you may never knew you had.

, The slimmer fitting denim lines will have also smaller leg openings and tighter tapering so proceed carefully and make sure you have a solid return policy.

Style them up!",How to Buy Comfortable Skinny Jeans," Look at the clothes in your closet – the stuff you have from one store is probably not the exact same size as the stuff you have from another. This is normal, if frustrating - clothing sizes usually vary from store to store and brand to brand. Getting the right size jeans is the most important step to making sure your skinnies are comfortable!Take three pairs of jeans into the fitting room with you – your usual size, one size smaller than your usual size, and one size larger. This gives you some options right there in the dressing room without having to change back into your clothes and exchange your jeans for another size if they don’t fit.
Remember that depending on the cut of the jean, you might wear a different size in two different styles from the same brand.;
, Because the actual measurements that correspond to sizes vary from store to store and brand to brand, you’ll have to take your own measurements and then check out that brand or store’s fit guide, which can usually be found online.


To measure your waist, use a piece of string around the narrowest part of your waist, but don’t pull too tight! Measure the string against a ruler to determine your measurement. Measure the fullest part of your hips with your feet about 6 inches apart for your hip measurement., Aside from knowing what numbers you should be looking for on the tags of your skinnies, you also need to know if you should be looking for petite, regular, tall, or curvy jeans. These different fits correspond to the measurements of your hips and waist.


Petite jeans generally have slightly smaller waist and hip measurements than regular jeans in the same size.
Tall jeans tend to have the same waist and hip measurements as regular jeans in the same size, but will have much, much longer inseams.
Curvy jeans normally have the same inseam as regular jeans, but slightly larger waist and hip measurements.

, How often have you tried on a pair of jeans that you loved, but they were either too short or pooled around your shoes? The perfect pair of skinny jeans should come to just below your ankle, without spilling onto the floor.


If you’re under 5’4” tall, you’ll generally want to look for a “short” length jean.
If you’re between 5’4” and 5’5”, you’ll generally want a “regular” length jean.
If you’re taller than 5’6”, try a “long” length jean.Whatever the length of your skinny jeans, skinnies should hit you at the same place. Perfect-length skinnies should work with flats, heels, and sneakers, and you should also be able to tuck them into boots without bunching up the material., A good general rule to follow is to find mid-rise skinny jeans, which shouldn’t hit you too high or too low at the waist. Focus on finding this type of fit rather than a specific size.If you’re looking for curvy skinny jeans, try something with a slightly higher waist.
If you’re looking for petite skinny jeans, try something that’s got a slightly lower waist., This will take some experimenting too, because some people look better in a dark wash and some look better in a lighter wash.


Dark washes tend to have a slimming effect, hiding the imperfections we might not want easily visible. Dark wash jeans are also the easiest to take from day to night, so you might want to go with a dark wash if you need a pair of skinnies for an event right after work.
Light washes are great for summer skinnies because they pair well with the lighter and brighter colors we tend to wear then. But some light washes can make your legs look bigger and some are see-through!Skinny jeans also come in a lot of different colors and patterns, rather than just denim washes. Small patterns – like polka dots or a leopard print – won’t add any heft to your leg, and vertical stripes will actually slim them. Stay away from overly large prints and horizontal stripes!

, When buying comfortable skinnies, stretch is going to be the most important factor. You want skinnies with enough stretch that allows you to breathe but also clings to you in the right places. This will vary from body to body and person to person, so you’ll have to experiment to find the perfect stretch. But if you pick up a pair of skinnies and they feel super stiff, they probably won’t work for you!

, If you find your skinnies are a little too tight at the knee, look for a straight leg or pencil cut. This will give you a straight cut all the way down and free up your knees!

, If your skinnies tend to sag at the waist after a few wears, try a pair with a two-piece contour waist. This means that the waist of your jeans is made from two, slightly curved pieces, rather than one straight piece that goes all the way around., This is the worst consequence of skinny jeans. You love the way the jeans fit through your legs but they’re just a bit too tight at the waist and the part of you that doesn’t fit into the jeans spills over the top! This easiest way to avoid this is to make sure you have a mid- or high-rise jean.

, Unless you want to draw attention to your butt, avoid pockets that are overly large. They shouldn’t fall lower than the crease between your thighs and butt.


If you’re a little flat in the back, go ahead and get jeans with big pockets! They will be more flattering., Skinny jeans are the most popular type of jean that retailers sell, but there’s a huge variety in what skinny jeans look like. Once you know what size, fit, and inseam will give you the perfect pair of skinnies, decide what you need the skinnies for! Maybe you need skinnies to wear for a night out on the town, or maybe you’re looking for skinnies that will easily tuck into the boots. Knowing what you need ahead of time will save you a lot of time.


For a more formal look, try a darker wash. As mentioned above, that wash tends to be slimming and it also looks great with dressier shoes.
For an edgier look, try skinnies that have interesting details – rips in the legs, a distressed wash, or an embroidered pattern can make your skinnies stand out.

, Everyone’s body is different so the same pair of jeans will fit you differently than they fit your best friend. Don’t be afraid to buy a pair that’s a little too long or a little too big in the waist and have them tailored to fit your body perfectly! Nordstrom’s offers free hemming on jeans that you buy from them!

, Being comfortable in skinny jeans is not just about the jeans, but about what you wear with them.If you have a curvier figure, try tucking your skinnies into mid-calf or knee high boots and pair them with a longer tunic shirt. This will flatter your body by evening out your proportions!
If you have a slim and straight figure, try a low rise that’s tailored to be tight at the ankles. This slims your legs and gives your hips the appearance of being wider.
If you have a petite figure, high rise skinnies can make your legs look much longer, particularly if you pair the skinnies with a tucked-in shirt!
If you’re on the taller side, congratulations! Skinnies will look great on you regardless of how you style them. If you’re self-conscious about the length of your legs, a low-rise skinny with a long shirt can help them appear shorter."

At this point, your marks don't have to be straight. Make sure they're visible enough for you to see and long enough to complete the process after you've taken the jeans off., Unbutton or unzip them. Keep them inside-out. This will allow the outside to look professional after you're finished with the alterations. Measure half the width of the area to be removed from the mid-mark. Use the chalk/pencil to mark that location. Do the same on the other side. For example, if you need to remove 2 inches (5.1 cm), you’ll place a mark at 1 inch (2.5 cm) to either side of the middle., Trace a wedge- (triangle-) shaped form starting at the top rear of the waistband. Its length should measure about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm). Connect it to the marks on either side of the mid-mark. Do this with either your tailor’s chalk or pencil.The length of the wedge can be longer or shorter, depending on how much you need to alter., This will be the area where the waistband meets the yoke (the area just below the waistband). Rip only about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) to either side of the wedge. This makes the sewing process run more smoothly., Place your scissors at the mid-mark and snip the entire band in half. You’ll probably cut through the label. Feel free to remove it if it’ll get in your way., Use your seam ripper for this step. Carefully remove the center stitches from the waist to the bottom of the wedge. When you reach the bottom of the wedge, tie off the remaining threads to prevent any more unraveling., Hold the ripped areas horizontally. Line up the wedge lines you made with the chalk. Use either safety pins or straight pins. Insert your pins horizontally so that you can easily remove them as you sew. As you pin, make sure the wedge lines and ripped edges continue to match up., Keep the jeans as flat as possible and completely together. Try an easy-to-remove basting stitch to test the fit first. Press the reverse sewing lever for just a moment when you start to secure your stitch. Continue stitching. Use the slowest setting on the machine, since you're working with a small area. Move the jeans from the crotch to the yoke. Remove the pins as you reach them. Fasten off the thread when you reach the yoke., Use fabric scissors to cut any excess from the edges. Give yourself an allowance of at least 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.3 to 1.9 cm). If you have a serger, secure the seam with that to prevent the denim from fraying. If you don't have a serger, use a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine., Turn the seamed are right-side out. Make a note of which pocket is farther away from the center seam. Turn the jeans inside-out again. Go in the direction of the pocket that's farther away from the center. Pin it in place, if necessary. Iron the seam in this direction. Remove the pin(s)., Turn the newly seamed area right-side out again. Feel the inside for the new seam. Place the edge of the seam under the needle of the sewing machine. This should be about 0.25 to 0.5 inches (0.64 to 1.27 cm). Start at the area just below the (still separated) waistband. Move toward the crotch. Fasten off the thread., Twist each side of the waistband so that the right sides are facing each other. Pin them on the marks you made to either side of the center. This will be where your new stitch will be. Place the waistband beneath the needle of the sewing machine. Start at the bottom of the waistband. Continue to the top. Remove the pins as you sew.


Make sure the pinned area lines up with the center seam. If it doesn't, readjust your pins. If it does, pin the bottom of the waistband to the yoke., Line up the top seam on the belt loop with the top seam of the waistband. Pin them together. Do the same with the bottom. Place the top of the belt loop under the needle of the sewing machine. Stitch horizontally across the top. Do the same with the bottom. Remove the pins."

Select the jeans you want to distress.,
Try on the denim and mark your jeans.,
Find a work station.,
Sandpaper the areas lightly (optional).,
Insert cardboard into the jeans.",How to Make Distressed Jeans1," You can distress any type of jeans. Choose a pair of jeans you do not mind ripping or fraying. If you've never distressed jeans before, you may want to opt for old jeans you do not mind damaging.;
, The easiest way to see where to distress your jeans is to try them on. Jeans fit everyone differently, so there is no precise rule of thumb regarding where, say, your knees will fall in the jeans. Try your jeans on and mark the areas where you want holes using a pen, marker, or piece of chalk.








Jeans are commonly distressed at the knees, back pockets, upper thighs, or at the sides. Mark which area you want to distress. For example, if you're distressing your upper thigh, think about where you would want the rips to show when wearing your jeans.If you've never distressed jeans before, it is not advised that you distress the sides. Side seams are necessary to hold the jeans together so these areas can rip easily. If you do distress along the sides, only make a few tears.
If you plan on distressing your back pocket, it is probably not necessary to try the jeans on first.

, You should have a flat work station with good lighting. For example, distress your jeans at the kitchen counter. You should also lay something down, like a tarp, to catch any fabric scraps while you're distressing your jeans.

, Sanding the jeans will make cutting and tweezing easier, so sand jeans if your jeans are very thick. Also, sanding can create a faded look. If you want faded colors on your jeans, use sandpaper to lightly sand the areas you're distressing beforehand. Only sand the areas a bit, until the color is just faded and the fabric is worn down slightly.







, Take a piece of cardboard and cut it until it fits into the pant legs of your jeans. Insert the cardboard into your jeans. This ensures you do not accidentally cut through to the backs of the jeans.








When distressing your back pocket, you can put a deck of cards or block of wood in the back pocket to protect your jeans.

Keep your cuts half an inch to three quarters of an inch apart (about 1.3 to 2 centimeters).Remember, only make a few cuts if you're distressing the sides of jeans and stay away from the side seams.

, Once the cuts are made, pull away excess fabric with tweezers until the holes are covered by bare strands of thread. Pull out as many threads as you can, only working in the areas where you cut. Try to remove all the colored threads so only white elastic threads are spread across the holes.








You will not be able to remove all the colored portions of the thread. There may be some fuzz leftover around the edges of holes when you're done as well. However, these come out in the wash, so do not worry if your jeans are not perfect the first time.

, There is usually loose fabric and thread on the jeans after you cut and tweeze them. Take a lint roller and roll it over the areas where you distressed the jeans. Roll the lint roller as many times as you need to remove excess fabric.







, Washing the jeans right after distressing will help remove any more debris and thread. Use a cold wash to protect your jeans. Warm or hot water should not be used on distressed jeans. You can dry the jeans as you usually would before wearing them."

Use the right material.,
Read the interior label before washing your jeans.,
Wash your jeans infrequently.",How to Make Distressed Jeans3," Not all jeans will hold up during the distressing process. Denim jeans come in different weights, starting at six ounces (about .3 pounds). In general, opt for denim jeans that are at least 20 ounces (1.25 pounds) when distressing jeans. These jeans will stand up better to the distressing process.The weight should be written somewhere on the label.

, Distressed jeans are more prone to damage in the wash, so read their label carefully first. Make sure you know any special care instructions for your jeans. Follow these closely after washing them., Most jeans do not need to be washed very often. Distressed jeans especially should be washed infrequently to prevent tears.

, Take scissors and cut into the fabric wherever you marked it with garment chalk. Make your incisions, and try to make them rough and chaotic. Clean cuts will look awkward in the context of distressed jeans. Slits can be as abundant as you would like them to be, but holes should be kept to a minimum. Going overboard on full-blown holes may destroy the cut-offs completely.

You can also fray the denim by scraping a knife against the fabric., Pulling out individual threads will cause a reaction throughout the surrounding area of denim. This is a perfect way to make your jeans look naturally frayed. You should put special focus on the areas you cut. This will make the holes look like they occurred from natural wear and tear.

Don’t just mix dirt and water together; the dirt will settle out. Keep checking on the shorts until they are stained enough. Remember, the shorts will be a lighter color when they are dry.
Coffee ground method: This method will last longer. In a bucket, use about two cups of coffee grounds and enough water to turn them into a liquid. The more water you add, the lighter the stain will be. Place the jeans in a bucket and let them sit overnight.
Running over method: A ""quick and dirty"" way is to place the cutoffs on muddy ground and drive over them a few times with a car.
Motor oil method: While working on your car or bicycle, or in your garden, wipe your hands on the shorts. Stains from dirty motor oil or from the bicycle chain are practically impossible to wash out.

, Smelling bleach on its own usually doesn't induce negative health effects, but it can make some people anxious. If you feel faint, leave the area immediately and call poison control. Keep the product label nearby, if possible, to give information to poison control specialists.Never mix bleach with other household products. Some chemicals, when mixed with bleach, create toxic fumes. Avoid mixing bleach and ammonia, or ammonia and rubbing alcohol., You can mix your bleach solution in a bucket, but using a bathtub makes it easy to turn on a fan and dispel fumes.

For even, large areas, use a sponge to dab the bleach on.
For a splattered effect, use a paintbrush or toothbrush. Apply the bleach to the brush, then rub your thumb back across the bristles to achieve a splattered effect.
If you want to work quickly, fill a cheap spray bottle with the solution and apply it to areas you want lightened.

, Focus on the front or back first, then flip the jeans over to work on the back. If you don't want to bleach a certain side, stuff your pants with newspaper before you begin. The newspaper will prevent the bleach from soaking through to the other side., If you want to lighten your jeans entirely, soak your jeans in the bleach solution for 20-30 minutes Reposition the jeans and swirl the water every few minutes to avoid overexposing one area. Check for color changes every time you reposition, and remove the jeans when you've reached an ideal color.Wring your jeans out over the bucket or basin to avoid staining the floor.
For a tie-dyed effect, tie rubber bands to the jeans before you submerge them. This will create a flowering pattern on the fabric., After you've finished applying the bleach or submerging your jeans, let them sit on the newspapers for five minutes. Then, rinse the jeans in cold water in either your sink or bathtub.

While your jeans are still wet, you will not have a full sense of how bleach lightened the fabric. Wait until they've dried to assess their color.

, Carry your jeans to the washing machine, wrapping them in newspapers to avoid staining the floor. Run your jeans through the washing machine without using fabric softener or detergent, which can yellow the jeans. This will rinse out excess bleach and make them safe to wash with other clothing later.

Put the jeans alone in the washing machine, without other clothes, to avoid bleaching your other clothing.

, After the first time you wash your jeans, do not put them in the dryer (which can also cause yellowing). Instead, hang your jeans to dry to avoid the intense heat of a dryer. After your jeans have washed and dried, your jeans are ready to wear., Now that your jeans are dry, you can have an accurate understanding of the color. If your jeans are not light enough, repeat the process using the bleach solution. Repeat until the jeans have faded to your ideal color."

Select an old pair of jeans for the acid washing process.If you do not have an old pair of jeans, stop by a local thrift store. You can find a cheap pair of jeans there, which you can acid wash at home.;
, This will help give your jeans the patchy, tie-dye like appearance of acid washed jeans. Work with one jean leg at a time, tying parts of the legs with rubber bands.There is no exact method for tying the jean legs. It depends on the kind of pattern you want. If you want a very tie-dyed appearance, twist your jeans in multiple places up and down each leg and secure these twists with rubber bands. If you want a less chaotic look, only twist and secure a few parts of the jeans. You can try concentrating on a particular area, like the lower legs or knees.
Once you've added as many twists as you want, roll up each pant leg. Use a large rubber band to secure each pant leg in a tight roll. Your jeans should now be tied together in a small, lumpy bunch.

, Choose a bucket big enough to comfortably submerge your jeans. Make sure to use cold water. If you have to, run the water in your sink until it becomes cold.Make sure to measure the water. Your bucket may have measurements written on the side. If it does not, use a separate measuring cup or container to measure out 2.4 liters of cold water.

, You want to use a chlorine bleach, which you can purchase at most hardware stores and supermarkets. Make sure to use gloves when handling the bleach. Pour your bleach into the water, making sure to measure out 1.4 liters.If you want a higher contrast look, add slightly more bleach than 1.4 liters. This will make the bleach solution more potent, stripping more color from the jeans.

, Wear gloves when you do this. Dunk the jeans into the bleach solution until they're more or less fully submerged.If part of your jeans are not submerged in bleach, this is okay. You will be flipping the jeans later. Just make sure the jeans are mostly submerged in the bleach solution.

, Set a timer to make sure you're turning them over regularly. Always use gloves when handling the jeans. Turning your jeans over regularly will make the acid wash effect even throughout.You will begin to see the jeans change as you turn them over. Some color should be leaving the jeans, giving them a whiter look.

, How long you soak depends on the effect you want. For a more defined acid washed effect, soak the jeans longer. This will strip them of more color. For a mild look, only soak the jeans for about half an hour.Check on the jeans regularly if you're unsure of how long to soak them. Once you see the effect you want forming, you can remove the jeans.

, Make sure to soak out all the bleach. You can run the jeans under cool water in your sink. As always, wear gloves when handling jeans. Bleach should not touch your bare skin.You can also hose down the jeans in your backyard.
Make sure to rinse every part of the jeans to remove all the bleach.
When you're finished rinsing, wring out the jeans.

, Use a cold cycle in the wash. You will want to run two cycles. Run one cycle without detergent, and then another with detergent.After two wash cycles, hang your jeans to dry. Do not put them in the dryer.
You should now have a pair of acid washed jeans.

, It can be dangerous for bleach to come into contact with bare skin. Wear a solid pair of plastic or rubber gloves when handling bleach.Examine the gloves prior to handling bleach. Make sure they are free of any tears. Throw out and replace torn gloves for your own safety.

, The build up of bleach vapors can cause dizziness, eye irritation, and respiratory problems. When working with bleach, always work in a well ventilated area.If possible, acid wash your jeans outside. This will provide the most ventilation.

, Safety goggles are important when working with bleach. Bleach can cause serious damage if it gets in your eyes.In the event you get bleach in your eye, flush with water for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove any contacts you were wearing.
Call poison control shortly after getting bleach in your eye.

, This is especially important if you're going to be eating after handling bleach. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after the acid washing process. Bleach should not stay on your hands for long, and should never be ingested."

Try to keep your insert fabric close to the weight of the pants fabric. Denim with denim, twill with twill, etc.
Choose a patterned fabric, an alternating color, or paint or embroider on your insert for contrast. You might also match the color and weight closely for a more a subtle version.

, You will sew the top of these slits closed (so that it doesn't tear anymore) later, when you add the insert (known as a 'gusset').

, You will sew this back into place later when you hem the edge of the gusset.

,,,


Be certain the diagonal cut is slightly longer than your slit length.
When measuring where the bottom cut should begin, keep in mind that you are cutting twice the width that you are looking at because of the fold in your material (e.g. 4.5 inches will open to 9 inches).
The reason for doing two pieces at once is to ensure that your gussets match in size and shape.

,,,, It is best if you use the same amount of seam allowance as was used to create the pants.

,, This will reinforce both your long seam as well as the top of the slit opening. You may want to backstitch several times over the top point of the slit to prevent unraveling later.


As you top stitch, you will need to hold the area being sewn flat while allowing the pant leg to bunch up around the presser foot.

There’s no need to dry the jeans. They should be wet when you bleach or dye them.
If you have blue or light color jeans that you don’t plan to remove the color from, the only prep you need to do is washing the jeans. You can skip the rest of the steps in this section.;
, To remove the color from colorful jeans, such as red or pink, or to create an even base for the black dye, it’s a good idea to remove the color from the jeans first. Fill a large stainless steel pot with enough water to completely cover the jeans, and set it on the stove set to medium or medium high. Heat the water until it comes to a simmer.Don’t place the jeans in the pot while the water is heating. Set them aside for the moment.
Make sure that there is enough room in the pot for the jeans to move around freely.
Avoid using an aluminum or nonstick pot. You can substitute a porcelain enamel pot for the stainless steel, though.

, While you can use regular bleach to take the color out of the jeans, it’s a better idea to use a color-removing product made specifically for pre-dyeing so it’s gentler on the denim. When the water begins to simmer, add the color remover according the package instructions, and stir it into the pot until it dissolves completely.








Be sure to wear rubber gloves when working the color remover.
Many companies that make fabric dyes also offer color removing products. You may want to pick one up from the same brand as your dye to ensure that they’re compatible.
When you’re using the color removing product, make sure that your kitchen is properly ventilated. Open a window and/or turn on a fan.

, Once the color remover as dissolved in the water, add the wet jeans to the pot. With the water simmering, use a long-handled spoon to stir the jeans continuously for 30 minutes to 1 hour or until all of the color is removed from the jeans.








Make sure that the water doesn’t come to a boil. If it seems like it might, lower the heat.
The jeans don’t need to be a pure white. They will still take the black dye well if they’re a beige or yellowish color.

, When the color has been removed from the jeans, turn off the burner. Allow the water to cool for about 5 minutes, and then drain it down the sink so the jeans are left alone in the pot.








Check the label for the color removing products that you’re using to be sure that it’s safe to pour it down the sink. You may need to use another disposal method depending on its ingredients.

, With the rubber gloves on your hands, lift the jeans out of the pot and rinse them in very hot water from the sink. Next, turn the temperature down so the water is warm and rinse the jeans again. Carefully wring the jeans over the sink to remove the excess water when you’re finished.








Don’t use cold or cool water to rinse the jeans. It may set creases in them.

, After you’ve rinsed the jeans twice, place them in the washing machine. Wash them again with detergent as you normally would to remove any residue so they’re ready for dyeing.








Once again, don’t dry the jeans after you finish washing them. They should be wet for the next steps.

, When you’re working with a dark dye color such as black, you want to protect your work area so it doesn’t get stained. Use a disposable plastic tablecloths to line the countertops and floor around your stove in case you spill any dye.If you don’t have disposable tablecloths, you can use plastic wrap or even garbage bags to line the work area.
Make sure that you are wearing the rubber gloves when you start working with the dye.

, To know how much dye you need, you need to know how much the jeans weigh. Place them on a scale to weigh them, and consult the dye’s packaging to determine how much dye you should use.Most jeans will weigh less than a pound (454 g).
In general, you’ll need a full bottle of liquid dye and 2 packages of powder dye to get a dark black color. Consult the dye boxes, though, to determine precisely how much you will need.
It’s a good idea to buy a little more dye than you think you’ll need. That way, you’ll have extra to darken the dye mixture if necessary.

, To dye the jeans, you’ll need a large pot. Add enough water that it will cover the jeans when they’re in the pot, and place it on the stove over medium to medium-high to bring the water to a boil.








In general, you’ll need 3 gallons (11 l) of water for every 1 pound of fabric that you’re dyeing.
There should be enough room in the pot for the jeans to move around freely, so make sure that you’re using a large enough pot.

, When the water is simmering, it’s time to mix in the dye. Add it to the water according the manufacturer’s instructions, and stir well to help it blend into the water. Let the mixture simmer for 5 minutes.








If you’re using a liquid dye, you usually have to shake the bottle well before adding it to the water.
If you’re using a powder dye, you usually have to dissolve it in a cup of hot water before adding it to the pot.

, After you’ve mixed in the dye, you usually need to add salt to the mixture. It helps the denim absorb the color and promotes even dyeing. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions to determine how much salt to add, and stir well to so it’s fully incorporated.







, To ensure that the dye is dark enough to turn your jeans black, find a light colored scrap of fabric or paper and dip in the pot. Remove it from the water and see if you’re happy with how black it turns.








If the dye doesn’t turn your test scrap as black as you’d like, add more dye to the pot.

, Your jeans should still be wet from having been freshly washed. Before you add them to the pot with the dye, squeeze them one final time to ensure that there isn’t any excess moisture. Next, smooth the jeans out so they’re as wrinkle-free as possible when you add them to the dye.







, When the jeans are smooth, add them to the pot with the dye. Use a long-handled spoon to stir them constantly for at least 30 minutes or until they are as black as you’d like.








As you stir the jeans, makes sure to move them back and forth and up and down. You want the dye to be absorbed evenly across the denim.
Avoid getting the jeans twisted or tangled as you stir. That can lead to uneven coloring.

, When you’re happy with how black the jeans are, take the pot off the heat and transfer the jeans to the sink. Rinse them under warm water from the sink. Gradually begin to make the water cooler until all of the excess dye is removed and the water runs clear.








Some dye brands also sell a color fixative for cotton fabrics to help prevent fading. You may want to apply some to the jeans right after dyeing according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

, In the sink, wash the freshly dyed jeans by hand. Use warm water and a mild laundry detergent, and rinse the jeans with cool water.








If you prefer, you can wash the jeans in a washing machine with an old towel. The towel will absorb any excess dye that comes off the jeans.

, Once you’ve washed the jeans, place the jeans on a hanger or clothesline to air dry them. Make sure that they’re completely dry before wearing them.You can also dry the jeans in a dryer with an old towel to absorb any excess dye.

Invest in heat-retaining fabrics.,
Go for one color.,
Use patterns to add variety.,
Use thin fabrics.",How to Wear Layers Without Looking Bulky1," You want to select fabrics that best retain heat. When you go to a department store, look for fabrics that are made to retain heat and warm the body. A couple of light layers of heat-retaining fabrics under your main outfit can keep you warm without adding too much bulk.You should also look into things like heat retaining socks and leggings.;
, One main color can keep your outfit looking neat. Competing colors may contribute to a bulky look. Not everything you wear has to be the exact same color, but go for a general color scheme.For example, wear a light blue blazer over a darker blue sweater.
You can also try something like a vibrant red vest over a lighter red shirt.

, Mix different types of prints and patterns. This can help your outfit stay stylish even when you have to layer. For example, try throwing polka-dot blazer over a blouse.Remember to keep one central color scheme in mind.

, You want to use fabrics for layering that are not too bulky. Instead of going for very heavy types of fabric, opt for a few layers of lightweight material.Things like chiffon, linen, and silk tend to be lighter weight.
You could, for example, wear a chiffon blouse over a silk tank-top.

Make use of light layers.,
Opt for longer sweaters.,
Limit yourself to three layers.,
Layer your lower half.,
Finish off with a light coat.",How to Wear Layers Without Looking Bulky2," Instead of bundling up in big, bulky outfits, use multiple light layers to stay warm. For example, wear a tank-top under a light t-shirt underneath something like a sweater or flannel button up.Make sure the outermost item you put on is long and flattering.

, A sweater can be a nice, cozy option. However, short and thick sweaters can make your outfit look bulky. Instead, opt for a longer sweater that hangs a little past your waistline. You can also go for a slightly thinner sweater with layers underneath.A sweater dress can also work well if you're looking for something slightly more dressy.
A turtleneck sweater may add extra warmth.

, Any more than three layers can start to add bulk to your frame. Challenge yourself to selectively choose three layers to best keep you warm.Choose your layers wisely. Two thin layers underneath a warm wardrobe option, such as a flannel shirt, should keep you sufficiently warm.
You can also add accessories, like a scarf, if you're still cold. This will help you stay warm without adding bulk.

, Do not forget to layer your lower half as well. You need to keep your legs and feet warm in the colder months. As with your top half, aim for several lighter layers.If you wear skirts, try wearing a skirt over pants or leggings. You could also do this with a dress.
You can also try to wear slim leggings or long johns over pants.

"
"
Add a scarf.,
Use cardigans, vests, and blazers.,
Wear a belt around your waist.,
Add color with knee-high socks.",How to Wear Layers Without Looking Bulky3," A scarf can be used to reduce the need for extra layers. It can add warmth and allow you to keep your layering minimal to reduce bulk. As scarfs do not hide your frame, you can go for a chunkier scarf. This can help add warmth, as your clothing will not be as big or chunky. For example, opt for a very long, thick knit scarf to keep you warm.
As a big scarf is eye catching, keep other accessories minimal.

, If your core is still cold, but you're already wearing three layers, accessorize with items like cardigans, vests, and blazers. These items can add warmth without bulk.Make sure to go for lighter varieties to avoid adding bulk. A slim cotton cardigan, for example, is a better option than a big, chunky knit one.
Blazers and vests may pull your other clothing in slightly, creating a slimming effect. They are a good option if you feel your outfit is looking a little bulky.

, If you feel your clothing is making you look puffy around the middle, use a scarf. Wearing a belt around your waist can constrict your layers in a way that highlights your figure. It's a great, stylish way to cut down on bulk when layering., If your feet get cold, try wearing knee-high socks. This can also be great if you want to add color. If most of your outfit is a neutral color, like gray or black, something like blue or red socks can add a little color.You can also add patterns with socks. Consider striped or polkadot socks.

Examine an example piece and see if it looks tidy and clean of any loose threads.

, Usually they require dry cleaning. Read the interior label and follow the cleaning instructions. You can wash your blazers if they are cotton velvet, but make sure to line dry them rather than using the dryer.Store your blazers in garment bags when not in use. This will prevent dust and lint from adhering to them.

, You can occasionally press them instead by using steam. Steam your blazers with a hand steamer or the steam from an iron. Don’t touch the fabric directly with the iron. Do this with the nap of the velvet facing down, and the steamer about half an inch away from the fabric.Do a test piece first to ensure that there is no damage to the fabric.

, If you spill something on your blazer, spot treat it immediately. Blot it with water and a clean cloth. It will leave a water stain, but you can then take your blazer to a dry cleaner or wash it immediately as per the care instructions on the interior label."

Slide on some bangles.,
Add a purse or bag to complement your crochet top.",How to Wear a Crochet Top," It can be daunting to pick out a crochet top simply because they can appear very exposing. Popping a nude camisole on underneath your crochet top is the perfect solution. By choosing a nude color, it will not blend in or distract from the crochet pattern, which is the star of your outfit. You’re also fully covered, so there is no need to worry about exposing too much or looking inappropriate., If you’re bold, you may not want to cover up completely under your crochet top. Instead, try layering it over a bralette or a bandeau. Bralettes are similar to bras, except they have no underwire and look less like an undergarment than a traditional bra.Bandeaus are a strip of cloth that cover your chest like a tube top. By wearing either of these under crochet tops, you can keep your stomach exposed in your crochet top, while still covering up your chest.


You can find bralettes with all kinds of pretty detailing, and both bralettes and bandeaus come in a variety of colors. You can choose a beautiful piece that will add interest to your outfit from underneath your crochet top.

, You certainly don’t have to stick to neutral tanks and undergarments. In fact, adding a pink bra, a royal blue tank top, or a bright red bandeau under a crochet top can add a pop of color to your outfit. Keep the rest of your outfit neutral and let the colorful undergarment highlight the pattern of the top.


For example, try pairing simple black shorts with a black crochet top, but slip a red camisole underneath for a bright pop of color.
Jeans and a white crochet top can become more interesting by adding a neon color bandeau underneath.

, Keep your entire look casual by pairing your crochet top with a pair of denim pants or shorts. Opt for a distressed pair for a more casual, flower child vibe. To dress up your outfit a bit more, choose sleek, darker denim. Jeans are an effortless choice, because they will go with any style or color of crochet top.Wear a loose, bohemian crochet top with distressed jeans with holes and tears. This is an easy, breezy look for the summer.
For a less casual option, wear a more structured crochet top with some dark wash, tailored jeans.

, Embrace the hippie vibe wholeheartedly with this tip. Pair a solid color crochet top with a skirt, shorts, or pants with a vibrant and eye-catching pattern. Mixing crochet with a pattern is a more unexpected choice, and your outfit will certainly make a statement.Wear a white crochet top with a floral or paisley patterned pair of shorts. Complement a retro, tie-dyed skirt with a neutral-colored crochet top.

, When it comes to creating a great outfit, it’s all about balance. If you’re styling a small, sexy crochet top, try pairing it with floor-length maxi skirt to balance out your outfit. A great flowy maxi skirt is the ultimate boho piece. By pairing it with a more form-fitting and revealing crochet top, you create a fantastic silhouette and strike the perfect balance between modest and risqué.A tiny crochet crop top paired with a miniskirt might expose more skin than you prefer, while a billowy skirt with a loose, flowing crochet top will not create the most flattering silhouette.
Wear a cropped crochet top with a high-waisted maxi. You will create a sleek silhouette and expose a bit of skin without overdoing it.

, You can wear crochet without looking like you’re headed to the beach or a music festival. If you want to wear your crochet top in a more professional setting, you certainly can. Again, it is all about balance. Pair your more casual crochet top with a more polished pencil skirt or pair of pants. Create a contrast by putting an unstructured crochet top with tailored bottoms.If you are wearing your crochet top in a work setting, it’s best to pair it with a full coverage tank top.
To really make your crochet top look more professional, wear a fitted blazer over it.

, Nothing spices up an outfit like a bit of crochet. To spice up a monochrome outfit, try popping a crochet top over it. If you have a favorite black dress, see what it looks like with a crochet layer. Try white jeans and a white tank top with a colorful crochet top over it. You have limitless options. A crochet top can be the perfect statement piece for a monochrome outfit.

, With a crochet top, there is typically plenty going on in the pattern itself. Adding chunky necklaces will distract from the crochet, and dainty necklaces will simply get lost. When it comes to pairing it with jewelry, earrings are one of your best options. Pair chunky crochet tops with a more basic earring, and pair dainty, intricate crochet with more delicate earrings.The earrings should complement the pattern of the crochet, rather distract or contrast with it.
For example, wear a simple, cream crochet top with bold feather earrings. If your outfit is monochrome or more neutral, consider wearing some eye-catching, bright colored earrings.

, On cooler days, a crochet top might not be warm enough. Luckily, these tops pair beautifully with loose cardigans! Crochet tops, particularly the tighter or skimpier ones, work extremely well with loose-fitting, effortless sweaters. Try to find a cardigan with a similar weight and texture as your top, and let it hang loosely off your shoulders.Pair a flowing crochet top with a lightweight, loose cardigan. Thin yet oversized cardigans work particularly well with crochet tops.

, When it comes to bracelets, nothing works better with a crochet top than a great bangle, or set of bangles. Because the pattern of a crochet top is more organic and free-flowing, a solid, geometric bangle stands out beautifully against it. Opt for the more basic designs – you don’t need to add much with these tops.

, Skip the super structured, heavy handbags and instead grab a more lightweight, unstructured option. Bags with fringe or florals will complement the bohemian look. Lightweight cross-body bags will hold all of your things while looking casual and effortless.

If you find a tee in a cut you like, stock up! You can never have too many tees and buying them in a variety of colors will ensure you’ll always have one ready to wear.

, A well-cut tee shirt should be neither too baggy nor too tight. There will always be some variation based on body type, but these guidelines should help.The shoulder seams should end at your shoulders. The tee should sit no higher than your hips (unless it’s a crop top.) Sleeves should sit halfway up your upper arm.
Avoid wearing boxy tees, as these will not flatter your figure or give you any semblance of a shape.

Sometimes you find a tee that you love, but it’s too big. If this is the case, don’t fear! There are many ways to creatively cut your tee so it fits you well and you can still wear it. You can try cutting fringe at the bottom, or shredding the sides and cinching them by tying knots. You can cut your shirt into a muscle tee or a crop top. The sky is the limit.
If your shirt is too big and you still don’t want to give it up, try using it as a cover up at the beach or a nightshirt at bedtime.

, Tees come in a variety of different fabric options and some mix more than one. Fabric will determine how well your tee will hold its shape over time, so it’s something to consider when shopping around.Organic cotton is one of the most highly recommended fabrics, as it is more comfortable and softer than treated cotton.

Shy away from half-tucks.",How to Tuck in a Shirt," To start, put on your shirt and button it. Grab the shirttails and pull them down towards the floor. This gathers any extra material at the bottom of the shirt and brings the material tight over your chest for a professional look.;
, If you haven't already put on your pants, do so. Pull them up to your waist and push the bottom of your shirt inside them. Pull up the zipper and fasten the button. The bottom of your shirt should comfortably sit inside the waist of your pants.








, When you wear a tucked-in shirt, you almost always accompany it with a belt, even if you don't need one to keep your trousers up. When you fasten the belt, line the buckle up so that it sits in the center of your waist, just above your zipper.








, Grab the bottom edges of the sides of your shirt and give them a light tug to bring some slack back into the shirt. Don't pull too much — aim for only about an inch or so of material. Doing this gives your shirt just a little ""slack"" so that if you turn or bend, you won't pull your shirttails out of your pants.









It can help to do this part in front of a mirror. If you accidentally pull a little too much material out of your pants, you can be left with a ""poofie"" section of extra fabric at the bottom of your shirt that can sometimes look a little dopey.

, Finally, give yourself a quick once-over examination. For a good tuck, the line formed by the buttoned-up edge of your shirt should match up with the line of the fly on your pants. This is called the ""gig line"" and, while it's not always something you'll want to spend the time and effort getting just right, for the most professional look possible, it's indispensable.








Since your belt buckle should be in the center of your body, your gig line should intersect it or else lie quite close to it.

, For most formal and semi-formal occasions, a standard tuck will work perfectly well. However, if you're having trouble getting that annoying ""poofie"" part of your shirt to go away, fear not — this tuck-in trick will work wonders. To start, get your shirt tucked as you normally would. Then, unbutton your pants. You'll be folding the fabric back in on itself, so you need a little slack in the pants to give us room to work.








, Put your hands down at your sides and grab the shirt material that's closest to them. Pinch it between your index finger and thumb on each hand. Pull the material away from your body slightly until the shirt is tight across your chest.









Don't pull so hard that you pull your shirttails out of your pants. Your shirt should stay tucked into your pants through the whole process.

, Now, push forward with your thumbs as you pinch the edges of the shirt between the sides of your thumbs and the fleshy part of your hand. The shirt material should double up on itself, forming a new ""flap"" of material. Fold this flap back over the sides of your shirt. The material should now be tight and fitted all around.








, Finally, while keeping your shirt tight, button your pants again. If done correctly, your shirt should now have a tight, sleek appearance all around your midsection with no extra ""poofie"" material. Note that this sort of tuck has a notorious reputation for coming undone, so you may want to practice the thumb motion used to make the military tuck so that you can keep things nice and tight!









Some folks prefer keeping their pants buckled while doing the military tuck. If you do this, you won't have quite as much room to work, but you also won't need to deal with the hassle of keeping your shirt tight while you're fumbling with your pants.

, Though there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to fashion, the vast majority of dress shirts are designed to worn tucked-in.Because of this, if you want to look as good as possible, you'll usually want to have your dress shirt tucked in with one of the methods above. While there are plenty of casual situations where it's just fine to wear an unbuttoned, un-tucked shirt with a tee underneath, it's hard to look better with this approach than you would by simply tucking your shirt in.









’’Always’’ tuck in dress shirts that hang past your hips. In these cases, the extra material can make your shirt look a bit like a flowing nightgown or even a dress, which will rarely be the sort of impression you'll want to make.

, Just as most dress shirts are made to be worn tucked, most polos and tees are meant to be worn un-tucked. When properly-fitted, these sorts of shirts should hang right up against your belt or the waist of your pants. You can tell this by looking at the way the bottom of a polo or tee differs from the bottom of a dress shirt — most will have a flat bottom edge, rather than long shirttails in front and in back.The exception here is when you have to wear an exceptionally-long tee or polo. In these cases, tucking the extra material in usually makes you look a little better. You can tuck in normal-length polos and tees as well, but this can sometimes give them an overly-tight appearance.

, When you're wearing a dress shirt, there are certain situations in which it's always advisable to tuck your shirt in. For instance, leaving your shirt un-tucked at many formal events or celebrations can be seen as a breach of etiquette bordering on disrespect. Below are just a few examples of the types of situations where you'll always want to have your shirt tucked in:









Weddings
Graduations
Religious ceremonies
Funerals
Court appearances

, In the business world, some situations will almost always call for a tucked-in shirt. Some of these situations are unique to certain jobs that demand formal behavior, but some, like job interviews, are things that almost everyone will encounter. Below are just a few examples of when you may need to tuck in your shirt:


Job interviews
Meetings with new or important clients
Meeting with strangers
Serious work events (layoffs, new hires, etc.)
Note that for many jobs, normal working days require tucked-in shirts or even suits.

, It's worth noting that some events which aren't exceptionally formal and aren't connected to work can still demand a tucked-in shirt. In these cases, an un-tucked shirt may not be seen as disrespectful, but may be a bad idea all the same. In these situations, you may want to look as nice as possible either to make yourself attractive or to show that you're taking things seriously. Here are just a few ideas for when you may want to keep your shirt tucked in:


Visits to fancy nightclubs or restaurants
First dates
""Serious"" parties, especially when you don't know many people attending
Art exhibitions and sit-down concerts

, It's important to remember that you definitely don't always have to tuck your shirt in. For instance, if you're staying in for the night, heading to a close friend's house, or just dining at a casual restaurant, there's no need to tuck in your shirt (or, truthfully, even to wear a dress shirt in the first place). Casual hangouts and other events where you won't be judged on the way you look have no need for tucked-in shirts, so unless you just want to look great 24/7, you can usually skip them.

, This innocent mistake can lead to the humiliating situation of having the top of your underwear show over the waist of your pants! When your shirt's tucked into your underwear, any sort of motion that would normally pull some of the shirttail material out of your pants (like bending or twisting) can cause your underwear to ride up. If if gets too high, the results can be seriously embarrassing.


Some people, however, do like tucking their undershirt into their underwear because it keeps their actual dress shirt from becoming un-tucked as easily. Opinions are split on this — to others, this is seen as the epitome of dorky fashion., Always wear a belt when you wear a tucked-in shirt, even if you don't need it to keep your pants up. Dress shirts are generally meant to be worn with belts and look most professional when paired with them. Leaving a belt off can make the waistline look somewhat naked and exposed, especially when you're wearing a shirt that contrasts greatly with the color of your pants.


If you really hate wearing a belt, there are alternatives. For instance, suspenders and side-tabs accomplish the same purpose of keeping your pants up..

, Once you make the decision to tuck your shirt in, don't turn back! Tucking your shirt in ruffles the material at the bottom of the shirt as it's stuffed into your trousers. When you're wearing the shirt tucked-in, this is impossible to see because your trousers in the way. However, as soon as you un-tuck your shirt, these wrinkles become visible. These can be quite visually unappealing, especially on light-colored shirts, so keep your shirt tucked in.

, If you're going to tuck in your shirt, tuck it all the way in. Don't stop halfway through! Tucking your shirt in completely in the back but leaving one of the front shirttails deliberately un-tucked won't usually make you look ""delightfully disheveled"" or ""convention-defying"". Instead, it will usually make you look like you've forgotten to tuck it in properly or you're trying to get attention. Unless you're a teen on their way to the skate park or you truly want to stand out at the cost of looking less put-together, stay away from the half-tuck.


Don't take this article's word for it — most adult fashion resources will give you similar advice. Some, however, will give this fashion choice a pass in casual situations."

Earrings are especially dangerous when they snag, as they can tear your earlobe easily if you pull too hard., Clips, bobby pins, or other clasps can snag on shirts as easily as jewelry.Having your hair pulled is pretty painful, so remove all hair accessories before you take your shirt off.

, Before you take your shirt off, you might want to remove any makeup if you’re wearing it. If you rub your face on your shirt as you take it off, it can leave stains and ruin your clothes. Remove makeup beforehand to eliminate the chances of messing up your shirt., The more open space you have, the less chance you’ll hit objects as you remove your shirt. You might have to move your arms a lot to get a very tight shirt off, so you don’t want to be too crowded. Try removing your shirt in your room, for instance, rather than in a small bathroom.

, Starting with the bottom of the shirt, roll or fold the bottom of the shirt up until your torso is exposed. This gets the majority of the shirt bunched together in one place, leaving the harder parts, like the neck and arms, for last., Keep rolling it upwards, bunching it so that the bottom of the shirt is now around your shoulders. You may have to push hard to stretch the bottom of the shirt around your shoulders, depending on how tight the shirt is.

, Once the shirt is completely over your shoulders, pull the neckline up over your head. The folded lower portion of the shirt will still be stretched around your shoulders, and the sleeves will still be on your arms. If you need to protect your hair-do, use both hands to stretch the neckline over your head without touching your hair., Now that your neck is through and the shirt is stretched around your upper body, raise your hands up. The shirt will pop off of your head and you’ll only be wearing the shirt on your arms.

, Simply lower your arms and remove the shirt. This might be a little tricky if the shirt has tight, long sleeves, but tug on the shirt until it comes off. You’re now shirtless!

, Men's style dress shirts typically have a row of buttons from the neck to the bottom of the shirt, generally in the middle.Always unbutton the shirt from top to bottom before removing it. Pulling the shirt over your head without unbuttoning won't work, and you may rip the fabric. Push each button through its hole until each one is unclasped.

, If you wore a tie with your button down, make sure to remove it. You won't be able to take your shirt off if the tie is still clasped around the neck of the shirt. Loosen the knot and remove it first., Men's shirts usually have buttons around the wrists. These buttons keep the sleeves clasped tight around your wrists, and depending on how large your hands are, they may not fit through the cuffs unless they're unbuttoned. Push the buttons through their holes using your free hand.


Since the hand with the cuff you want to unbutton won't reach the clasp, you may have a little trouble undoing the buttons. Try holding the button between your index and middle fingers, then pushing the fabric up over the button., It doesn't matter which sleeve you choose first. Pick whichever is most comfortable for you. Grasp the end of the sleeve, near your wrist, and keep the fabric taught as you pull your arm out, towards your body. You may have to pull hard if the shirt is tight.

, With the arm that you just removed, grasp the remaining sleeve near the wrist. Pull the shirt off of your other arm. Your shirt will end up in the hand of the sleeve you removed first.

, Super-tight workout shirts can get sweaty, but you’ll have to use the same method. The sweat may cause some friction, but this only means you’ll have to pull a little harder. Also, try crossing your arms as you pull the shirt over your head, which will give you more pulling power., If you are having trouble removing a tight tank top over your head, it might be because your arms are at a strange angle or not strong enough to pull it off. Try pushing it down over your hips instead, all the way down to your ankles. Then simply step out. This will only work for tube style tank tops or other shirts with wide necklines, because the neckline has to be larger than your waist.

, While your head may fit through the neck of a buttoned polo shirt, you may risk stretching it out. Unbutton the shirt first, starting with the top button and working your way down: there are generally three buttons.Then remove the polo as you would a normal t-shirt.

, Many women's shirts have zippers or buttons at the nape of the neck. You may have to unzip or unbutton these before you can easily take the shirt off. These clasps can be hard to reach, so you might have to get help: ask a friend or family member in the house to help you unclasp the shirt. It may be embarrassing to ask for help, but they may be your only hope.If there’s no one around, try using a mirror to see where the clasp is, then reach behind your neck and unzip little by little.

Repeat the process to attempt additional shrinkage, if necessary.,
Finished.

",How to Shrink Preshrunk Shirts," Some fabrics will shrink and some will not. Some shrink more than others. Make sure your shirt is made of a fabric that will shrink. Acrylics absolutely will not shrink...ever. Polyester does not shrink. But cotton or a cotton blend will. A cotton blend will shrink less than something made of 100% cotton.;
, Heat is your best form of attack to shrink fabric. Wash a shirt made of cotton in hot water, and then add to a hot dryer. Shrinkage is caused by the heat and agitation.


Customize your washer settings for optimum shrinking. Place the item you want shrunk in the machine by itself and set the machine to an extra small load. Set the temperature dial to the hottest setting possible. If your water is a little tepid instead of habanero hot, consider adding boiling water to the machine carriage. The hotter the better.
Keep up the heat by immediately transferring the shirt to the dryer. Set the dryer to the hottest setting. Dry the shirt completely. Leave it in the dryer to cool completely before removing.

, This may or may not work but is worth a try if you need the shirt to be just a little smaller.

For example, cotton and wool will shrink when you wash them with hot water.Your shirt might also have some specific instructions on the label about how to wash it to avoid shrinking.


For example, the tag might specify a water temperature, such as warm or cool. By washing the garment in the opposite temperature, you may be able to shrink the garment.;
, Allow the shirt to soak in the water for about five minutes and then remove it and wring it out. However, keep in mind that if the shirt is any color other than white, then soaking it in hot water may pull out some of the color.The hotter the water, the more the shirt will shrink, so use the temperature that seems appropriate to you.
To get the water even hotter, boil a pot of water and pour it into the sink.
If you want to wash the shirt as well as shrinking it, place a teaspoonful of laundry detergent in the sink. However, you will need to rinse the shirt in a separate tub or sink full of water after.
If you are worried about affecting the color of the shirt, then you can also try soaking the shirt in cool or lukewarm water and then hang it up in a warm place to dry, such as near a heater.

, After you wring out the shirt, lay the shirt flat on a drying rack and let it air dry. If you don't have a drying rack, lay the shirt flat on top of a dry, absorbent towel.


Don't hang the shirt to dry. This will cause the shirt to stretch in the shoulder area.
When the first side of the shirt is dry, flip it over and let the second side finish drying.
Try placing the shirt in a warm place to help it dry faster and shrink up a bit more., If soaking and air drying the shirt did not shrink it enough for your needs, then you can also try washing the shirt in a washing machine on hot. To do this, select the ""whites"" setting so that the washer uses hot water to rinse the shirt.


If you're concerned about fading the color of your shirt, then you can add a cup of vinegar to the machine to preserve the color.
The process of agitating the shirt may also help to shrink the shirt, so if you're concerned about adding heat to your shirt, you can use the ""permanent press"" setting or cold water instead of hot water.

, Drying your shirt in the dryer may also help to shrink it a bit more.If your shirt is has not shrunk as much as you want it to after washing and air drying it, then try placing it the dryer on high heat.


Use the ""gentle dry"" setting if you're concerned about how the fabric will hold up.
Use the ""permanent press"" or ""regular dry"" setting if you want to dry the shirt as fast as possible.

Tie your button-down shirt around your waist.,
Tuck in your shirt.,
Tie your shirt up.,
Wear it unbuttoned.,
Wear it as a dress.",How to Style a Button‐Down Shirt2," This might sound a bit strange, but it’s a trend that has exploded. You can instantly add a pop of color to a monochrome outfit just by adding a brightly colored or patterned button-down around your waist. If you’re wearing a dress or loose-fitting outfit, tying a shirt around your waist can even accentuate your waist, making a flattering silhouette.Plaid button-down shirts are especially perfect for this look. Tie them around your waist with a pair of jeans and a solid top, and you look comfortable and trendy at once.

, Seriously, this can change your outfit. Men, you may already do this when you’re at a formal event, so you know that untucked versus tucked is a major outfit changer. For ladies, this can transform an outfit similarly. Try tucking your button-down shirt into a pair of high-waisted jeans or a skirt, and you’ll instantly make your outfit look sleek and put together.

, You probably immediately think of a cowgirl tying up her flannel shirt, but this certainly isn’t the only look you can achieve by tying up your button-down. Unbutton two or three buttons form the bottom, and tie the two ends into a little knot. Try doing this with high-waisted bottoms, so that you don’t necessarily show skin but create a “cropped” look.Try tying up a button-down shirt over a dress. It is still modest, yet adds a bit of fun to an otherwise simple outfit.

, Button-down shirts don’t always have to be the bottom layer of an outfit. Try unbuttoning it and wearing it open, like a jacket or cardigan. When you can wear it both buttoned and unbuttoned, you have a whole new set of outfits you can create with the same shirt. This look works particularly well with thicker button-downs, like chambray shirts. , Why purchase a “shirt dress” when you can just make one? Throw on an oversized button-down shirt as a dress for a super easy and trendy look. To avoid looking shapeless, you can add a belt or something else to cinch in the waist, creating a shape. You can cuff the sleeves so they aren’t too long, and voila!

"

Pair it with sneakers.,
Match your shirt with a tie.,
Add a bold statement necklace.",How to Style a Button‐Down Shirt3," While the button-down shirt alone screams polished and professional, the sneakers take it down a notch. You can take your shirt from work to weekend by pairing it some Converse or other casual sneakers. To complete the look, throw on a baseball cap. The shirt makes you look put together, while the sneakers and cap show you’re ready to relax., While ties will naturally make the look a bit more formal, you can find more casual ties. Patterned ties look great with solid colored button-down shirts, and they are perfect for more casual settings. Even if no one else is wearing a tie, casual ties look like you put in the extra effort. They can add a lot to an otherwise simple look., Most people leave a few buttons undone at the top of their shirt, letting it expose a bit of skin near the neck. Instead, try buttoning up your shirt to the very top button, and then placing a big, eye-catching necklace around the collar. This is looks extremely chic, and can make any button-down shirt immediately look stylish."

Fill a spray bottle with water.You can use a spray bottle to selectively wet a shirt and shrink it all over or just in certain areas.,
Spray the shirt lightly.,
Dry the shirt.",How to Shrink a Shirt2," Fill up a clean spray bottle with plain water. If you're reusing an old spray bottle, make sure it is clean and free of the chemicals before you use it.

, Use the spray bottle to spritz the shirt on all sides. Dampening the fibers will help it shrink. Don't completely soak the shirt, or you may end up with a smaller size than you want.


If you only want the shirt to shrink in certain areas, such as around the arm holes, then you can just spritz the shirt in these areas., Put the shirt in the dryer on the ""permanent press"" cycle and let it dry for two minutes at a time.Check it every two minutes and dry longer as needed. Remove the shirt from the dryer when it is completely dry. If the shirt was stretched out before, it should now be refreshed and ready to wear.


If you want it to shrink more, repeat the process and use a higher heat setting on your dryer.
Place a fabric softener sheet in the dryer with your shirt to freshen up the smell, too.

Take it to a tailor or seamstress.,
Ask the dry cleaners to shrink it.,
Contact a knitwear specialist.",How to Shrink a Shirt3," If a shirt is important to you, you may want to take it to a tailor or seamstress instead of trying to shrink it at home.A tailor or seamstress can take in the shirt based on your measurements and specifications.

, Your dry cleaners may be able to help shrink a garment that is labeled dry clean only. If you have a dry clean only shirt that you want to shrink to a smaller size, then ask the dry cleaner if that is something they can do.


Keep in mind that water is necessary to shrink a garment, so dry cleaning will not usually shrink your clothes unless the machine is leaking.However, your dry cleaners might offer a safe method for shrinking items without affecting the color and integrity of your garment.

, For a valuable knit shirt, you might consider having the shirt unraveled and re-knitted to a smaller size. This might not be a cost-effective solution for less expensive shirts, but it might be a safer strategy for a designer label knit shirt."

Get the entire t-shirt wet in a bowl warm water.,
Add 1/4 cup of hair conditioner the water.,
Keep the t-shirt flat and submerged for 10-15 minutes.,
Rinse the shirt.,
Find a flat place to lay out the shirt.,
If there is a graphic on your tee that you don't want to stretch, iron it now.,
Place your forearms inside the part of the shirt that you want to stretch.,
Spread the stretched shirt out on a towel to dry.",How to Stretch a Cotton T Shirt1," You can do this by soaking it in the sink or in a large bowl. Make sure to use cool water and saturate every area of the t-shirt that you want stretched. The level of the water should well cover the t-shirt









Be sure to use cool water. If you use hot or cold water, the fibers won't be prone to stretching. They tend to loosen up more with warm water.;
, Once added, mix it up with your hand to make sure the conditioner doesn't stay in globs and fully dissolves into the water. The hair conditioner will soften the fibers, making them easier to stretch.









If you don't have hair conditioner around, you can use baby shampoo.
A cheap conditioner is fine; don't waste your fancy hair products on your t-shirt.

, It's easiest to put the t-shirt on top of the bowl or sink and then gently press it into the water, making sure the conditioned water gets into every fiber of the t-shirt. If it's wadded up, areas of the shirt will shrink differently.









Hold it flat toward the bottom of the bowl, keeping it from gathering, for a minute or two to ensure every fiber gets infused with the conditioned water. The more it gets saturated, the more it will stay on the bottom of the bowl on its own. Leave it there for 10-15 minutes.

, Take the shirt out of the bowl, dump the water out, and refill it with clean, cool water (or just use a different bowl). In much the same way as you would rinse your hair after using conditioner, you've got to rinse the shirt, too, otherwise it will be covered in a sticky residue.









Take your time. Spend 5 minutes or so rinsing the shirt, again making sure the clean water penetrates every fiber.

, An area such as the top of your dryer, a granite counter, or the top of a freezer works well. Lay down some towels first to protect the shirt (and the surface, if you don't want it wet).









Squeeze the water out of the shirt to keep it from dripping everywhere and to speed up the drying process.

, Stretching a t-shirt can distort the image on it. However, if you dry the picture first, it won't stretch as much as the bottom and sides of your shirt (the areas you want stretched) because they're still wet.








, If you want it wider, stretch the shirt outwards making sure not to put too much pressure in one spot. This can leave a strange ""dent"" sticking out in one place on the shirt. If you find that your arms are not strong enough to get the right amount of stretch, try using your legs, a sturdy pole of some sort, or getting someone with more arm strength to help you.









If you just want it longer, stretch from the neck and the bottom, pulling it longer in opposite directions. Work from left to right, making sure all sides of the t-shirt are equally stretched.

, If you're worried about it shrinking, place weights on the edges. If you're looking for a larger bust or stomach, you can place objects within the t-shirt to stretch those areas out even more.









The shirt will retain its shape until it is washed and dried again. If you want to keep it at its new size, make sure not to put it back in the dryer.

Check your shirt’s care instructions.,
Add a cup of vinegar to a large pot of water and boil.,
Soak your shirt for five minutes.,
Dry your shirt after it’s cool enough to touch.",How to Shrink a Flannel Shirt1," Before trying to shrink your shirt, double check to make sure it can be washed. Make sure the flannel is made from either wool or cotton.You’ll have more luck shrinking loose natural fibers, like wool or cotton. Synthetic fibers will be more difficult to shrink.
If the care label says the garment is pre-washed, you might have to take it down a size instead of shrinking it by washing and drying.;
, Fill the largest pot you have on hand with water. Add a cup of vinegar, and bring it to a rolling boil.Adding vinegar will help retain your shirt’s color by minimizing the amount of dye that bleeds out from the heat.

, When the water and vinegar begins to vigorously boil, remove the pot from heat. Place your shirt into the pot, and use a wooden spoon to soak and agitate it. Keep the shirt in the pot for five minutes.Be careful not to burn yourself.

, If you can pick up the heavy pot of water, drain the water carefully into the sink. When the shirt is cool enough to touch, pick it up and put it in the dryer for 45 to 60 minutes on a medium setting.If the pot is too heavy for you to pick up, just let the water cool until it’s safe to lift the shirt. Use the spoon to help get the shirt of out the water.

Keep rolling.,
If necessary, secure the sleeve.,
Finished.

",How to Roll Up Shirt Sleeves1," Remove your cuff links, if you're wearing any, and unbutton the cuff.






;
, Fold the cuff up so that the fold lies where the seam of the cuff meets the sleeve. If the shirt has no separate cuff, fold the end of the sleeve up two or three inches, evenly all the way around.








, Fold the sleeve again, using width of the first fold as a guide. Repeat as many times as necessary or desired. Rolling a sleeve up with multiple folds or past the elbow can help keep it from slipping down as quickly.








, Most shirts are made with fabric that will stay in place on its own, but if you're wearing a shirt made of silk or another slippery fabric, hold it in place with a safety pin. Make sure you pin it from the inside to hide it.

Wet the entire t-shirt in cool water.,
Lay it on a flat area for ironing.,
With your iron on medium-low, start going over the t-shirt using pressure.,
Leave it to dry.",How to Stretch a Cotton T Shirt2," In a similar fashion as the method above, wet your entire t-shirt, making sure every fiber is soaked. Hold it flat towards the bottom of a bowl or a sink to ensure it's evenly wet.









No need to soak the t-shirt; simply drench it in cool water. Once you're convinced it couldn't be wetter, you're ready to move onto the next step.

, Wring it out a bit to get rid of excess water to prevent dripping and soaking your surface or ironing board. Make sure whatever you're ironing on can handle heat. An ironing board is best, but you could also use the counter top or floor if you're careful.









If you'd like, give it a few tugs now to get the stretching process started. You'd be surprised just how much you can do with just your bare hands.

, With the iron in one hand and the shirt in another, start pulling and pressing the shirt out with the iron. Don't just go over the shirt, use the iron as a means of force, the t-shirt stretching as the iron passes over it, forcing it outward.









Make sure to go in every direction – pulling up, down, and to the sides. Flip the shirt over when you're done and begin on the back, too.
This method isn't great for significant stretching; it's best used if you just need the shirt to fit a little better or be a little longer.

, Make sure it's flat and give it a final tug one last time. Spread it out, and place weights around the edges if you'd like. This just makes sure it stays at the size it is now, just how you like it.









To make sure it stays at this size, avoid drying it. From now on, this shirt should be air-dried. You may occasionally have to stretch it out again, but avoiding drying will keep it larger.

"
"
Wear the t-shirt in the shower.",How to Stretch a Cotton T Shirt3," Clothes stretch more when they're wet. So, the next time you're in the shower (a hot shower is best), wear your shirt. Tug on it in all the areas you want stretched. Talk about a productive shower!









This sounds a little silly, but think about it: if you stretch it out as you're wearing it, you'll be able to stretch it in the areas you actually want it stretched, into just stretching it all over. So if you need a shirt that's only longer or only bigger in the bust, say, this is a decent idea.

"
"
Tug on the t-shirt often.",How to Stretch a Cotton T Shirt4," Cotton shirts are pretty malleable. If you tug and tug on it, the t-shirt will eventually stretch. If you wear it all the time, constantly pulling on it will stretch it out bit by bit. Just make sure not to overdo the stretching, as it will eventually look obviously out of shape.








"
"
Use weights to manipulate the t-shirt's size.,
You can also place items inside the shirt.",How to Stretch a Cotton T Shirt5," If you've used one of the above methods, you may want to use weights on the t-shirt to keep it stretched out for a final certain measure. On the edges of the shirt, place mugs, books, or bags of rice, keeping the t-shirt in it's stretched-out position.








, Need it stretched out for your chest? Place a couple of baseballs inside, stretching out that area. Need wider arms? Place a cylinder or small bowl in the sleeves.








"
"
Have a larger friend wear the t-shirt.",How to Stretch a Cotton T Shirt6," Here's the kicker: a friend who is too close to your size won't adequately stretch the t-shirt; a friend who's too big either won't be able to put it on or will stretch it out too much. But if you have a friend who's in that Goldilocks zone (just right), ask them for the simplest favor they could ever give you. All they have to do is wear your shirt for an hour or two; or just sleep in it.

There will be some dye bleeding due to the heat, so you wouldn’t want multiple shirts discoloring each other.Adding a cup of vinegar to the wash will help reduce color loss.

, Put your machine on its hottest water setting. Use the heavy wash cycle available so the machine will agitate the shirt as much as possible.If you have a front loading machine, see if you can wash the shirt in a friend or family member’s top loader.

, Flip it back so that the inside fabric is showing. The fold should be right where the cuff meets the sleeve of the shirt.







, Fold the cuff back once more at a width equal to the initial fold. Making sure both folds are equal gives this look a neater appearance.








, Examine the cuff to make sure the corners are tucked in so that the folds will stay in place. If you're wearing a shirt made of slippery fabric, secure the cuff in place with a safety pin. Repeat on the other side.









This type of cuff looks good if you're wearing a sweater over your shirt. Hike up the sweater sleeves a bit before you begin, then adjust them so that the tips of the sleeves fall just above the cuffs.

Once the glue is dry, lay the embroidery hoop on top of your T-Shirt so that the transparent material is laying against the T-Shirt.

Wear your shirt with pride (and an undershirt).",How to Make Your Own Distressed Shirt1," This method uses long, thin cuts and slices to give your shirt a drastic ""destroyed"" look. For this method, you'll want a t-shirt that you don't mind ruining. Preferably, the shirt should be solid-colored and bear no screen-printed design (screen prints can be tough and somewhat tricky to make clean cuts through).;
, Draw clusters of repeating horizontal or vertical lines of different lengths in an arrangement that looks appealing to you. You can make your shreds anywhere on the shirt that you'd like, so long as they don't make the shirt completely fall apart.


One easy example is to make a cluster of horizontal cuts on the front of the shirt to produce a makeshift see-through belly shirt. To do this, you would take your pencil and draw level horizontal lines across the front of the shirt in a stylish configuration. For instance, you might start with short lines, then have them gradually grow longer and finally taper off again to make a circular pattern.

, Use a fabric knife or a sharp pair of scissors to make your cuts. Try to follow your lines as closely as possible. Don't allow the material of the shirt to bunch up in front of your cutting tool - this can lead to jagged, uneven cuts.


Be careful not to cut too deeply or you may end up making cuts in the bottom layer of your shirt's material. To prevent this, you may want to put a thin piece of cardboard or plastic inside your shirt as a protective barrier.

, Basic shredded tees look great on their own, but if you'd like to personalize your shirt with additional decorations, feel free! Use any of the following ideas (or your own) to make your shirt uniquely yours:


Use glue-on decorations (beads, rhinestones, etc.) to give your shirt decorative glitz.
Draw shapes, designs, cartoons, and more with permanent markers (be careful of ink bleeding - place an insert inside the shirt before drawing).
If you know how to sew, add a decorative fringe along the bottom of the shirt or sew contrasting patches across the front and back.

, Congratulations - your shirt is ready to wear! Don't forget that this shirt exposes your midriff - if you're worried about breaking the dress code at your work or school, be sure to wear an undershirt!

Prepare for how cold it's going to be.,
Lower the temperature in your house.,
Stand outside for several minutes at a time.,
Take colder showers.,
Avoid shade and shadows.,
Think of a warm, sunny place.",How to Not Get Cold Wearing a T Shirt in Winter1," Check a thermometer for the temperature before you go outside. When you know what the temperature is going to be, you can mentally prepare for how cold it will feel.


If you're planning for the future, check a weather service to anticipate how cold it will be, so you can gradually allow your body to get used to the cold.
Keep in mind what the wind chill is before you go outside. Wind Chill is the temperature that it ""feels like"" based on actual temperature and wind speed.;
, When it's cooler inside your house, you won't notice how much colder it is outside. Getting used to being chilly indoors can help you adapt to the colder weather outside.


Be considerate of other people in the house. Don't lower the temperature too much, or it will make everyone else uncomfortable. It can also change energy bills, so be considerate of who's paying the bills, too., Allow your body to change your temperature when you're outside. Eventually, you'll start being more comfortable in the weather, but be wary that temperatures could drop even more the longer you're outside. Don't be surprised if your nose gets a little runny the longer you stay outside.Do this every day for several weeks leading up to winter. Eventually, your tolerance for cooler temperatures will increase.

, Turning the ""hot"" lever down a little bit will help your body adapt to colder temperatures in the long run, and it saves hot water. It might be uncomfortable, but it can be relaxing.


Colder showers can also be good for your health and blood circulation., Even if the temperatures are low, the sunshine can still warm your body if you're standing in it. Staying in shaded areas or shadows makes it feel significantly colder outside than if you stand in the sun.


There is a 10-15 degree temperature difference between standing in the shade and standing in the sun.Other factors affecting degree difference include a wind or breeze blowing through, as well as how much you've been sweating.

, Actively keeping your mind on warm weather can take your mind off the cold temperatures. Most people tend to think about the beach or the tropics, where the weather is warm year-round.


It's easier to think of warm places you've been personally. Everyone knows it's always warm in the Bahamas, but if you've never been there, it's hard to personally imagine it. Try thinking of a warm fire or sand on your toes.

, Another way to make your shirt appear naturally worn is to replicate the patterns of wear and tear that are common on actual worn-out shirts. The seams in any piece of clothing are natural points of wear, so tears and cuts in these areas will look especially natural. Fold your shirt along the seam, then use a sharp pair of scissors to make small cuts parallel to the seam. For an authentic look, try making multiple cuts of varying sizes. Below are a few ideas for locations for your cuts:


Along the seam around the neck hole
Along the seam at the bottom of the shirt
Along the seams at the ends of the sleeves

, To give your shirt a pattern of small rips and holes, use an everyday cheese grater. Stretch the fabric of the shirt as you grate it to ensure the sharp ""teeth"" of the grater can dig into the fabric of the shirt. You may find this easiest to do if you secure the grater to a sturdy post or pole first, then rub the shirt against it vigorously.

, One of the biggest difficulties when it comes to distressing shirts is that it's tricky to make a shirt's screen printed design look as worn as the rest of the shirt. The ink used for screen printing is relatively thick, tough, and resistant to most distressing methods. To replicate the effects of years of wear and tear on your screen printed shirt, use a square of sandpaper to abrade your screen printed design. For a natural look, wear the design unevenly.

Grab a brightly-colored shirt you'd like to make faded.,
Mix water and bleach in a 16-to-1 ratio.,
Add shirt(s) and stir vigorously.,
Allow to soak, stirring occasionally.,
Rinse and wash.,
Alternatively, for a blotchy look, use a spray bottle of bleach.",How to Make Your Own Distressed Shirt3," Bleach, renowned for its ability to ruin colored fabrics by turning them white, is a useful tool for distressing old shirts. In this method, a dilute solution of bleach and water will be used to simulate the dulling, fading effect that years of wear can have on bright-colored clothing. This method is best for strong, bright hues (cherry red, traffic cone orange, and so on), but doesn't work as well on dark shades. For obvious reasons, it's also unsuited for whites.


As always, only distress shirts that you don't have a special attachment to. You don't want to lose a treasured shirt because you accidentally spilled bleach on it.

, Use a suitably-sized container (like a large plastic bucket) as a container for your dilute bleach mixture. Mix well before proceeding. Note that a 16-to-1 ratio is the same as the ratio between gallons and cups, so if you're using a gallon of water, you'd use 1 cup of bleach, 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water would warrant 2 cups of bleach, and so on.


You may want to consider using a bathtub or a laundry sink to do your bleaching. These are convenient because they allow you to simply wash your mess down the drain when you're done.

, It's important to ensure that the shirt (or shirts) you're bleaching receive(s) an even soaking of bleach. Applying more bleach to some areas of the shirt than others can create an uneven, splotchy appearance. To counter this, start stirring as soon as you add your clothing to the bleach bath and stir continuously for about five minutes.

, After about the first five minutes, you may begin to stir less frequently. Be sure to monitor your clothing for color loss as it soaks. Stir every few minutes (no less frequently than every five minutes). Most shirts are ready after about half an hour to forty five minutes, but many may be ready earlier.

, When your clothing has lost as much color as you'd like it to, remove it from the bleach bath and rinse it thoroughly, removing any remaining bleach. Machine wash with warm water and line dry.

, As noted above, the uneven, splotchy look of a poorly-bleached shirt is generally something most will want to avoid. However, if you're interested in replicating this look, it's quite easy to do so. Mix bleach and water in a spray bottle as above, then bunch up your shirt with rubber bands. Spray the shirt in a few locations with your bleach mixture and allow it to sit for about half an hour, monitoring for color change. When your shirt is how you would like it, remove the rubber bands, then rinse and wash as above.


Consider adjusting the concentration of your bleach mixture for more or less contrast. For instance, if you use completely undiluted bleach, you'll get splotches of white or near-white against your shirt's natural color.

Grab a light-colored shirt.,
Mix staining agent(s) in water.,
Stir and allow to steep.,
Remove and soak in vinegar and water solution.,
Rinse, wash and dry.",How to Make Your Own Distressed Shirt4," Essentially the opposite of the bleach method above, this method uses tea and/or a similar staining agent to make a shirt's colors appear darker and muddier, rather than lighter and more faded. As such, this method is best for white or light-colored shirts, though it has some usefulness for vibrant, brightly colored shirts, so long as they're not too darkly shaded.

, Using a large plastic bucket or bathtub to contain your ingredients, mix your staining agents and water to create a staining bath for your shirt. The more dilute your staining bath, the less your shirt will be darkened (and vice versa). There are many possibilities in terms of potential staining agents - see below for just a few:


Tea
Coffee
Dirt
Paint (earth tones work best for the ""naturally worn"" look)

, Add your clothing to the staining bath and stir vigorously. Allow your clothes to soak in the liquid, occasionally checking their progress. Depending on the concentration of your staining bath, it can take anywhere from half an hour to several days for your shirt to reach its desired level of darkness, so be sure to remain vigilant as it soaks.

, If you have time, remove your shirt from its staining bath and place it in a bath containing vinegar and water mixed in a 1-to-3 ratio. Soaking the shirt in this dilute vinegar solution helps the stain ""set"" in the fabric. Allow the shirt to sit for 4 to 12 hours or as needed.

, Finally, remove the shirt from its bath and rinse thoroughly in the sink, removing any lingering staining agent or vinegar. Machine wash and dry as you normally would.


Congratulations! Your shirt should be ready to wear.

Stretch.,
Move around.,
Keep your extremities warm.,
Get hot coffee.",How to Not Get Cold Wearing a T Shirt in Winter2," Before you go outside, warm your body slightly by stretching your arms and legs and torso. Athletes do this to prepare for playing in colder temperatures, while also preventing injuries during the event.Try not to stretch too much before you go outside. If you begin to sweat indoors, then it will feel colder when the cool air touches the sweat on your skin.

, A good way for a quick warm-up is a quick warm-up. When you're active, your body's blood circulation increases, which causes you to warm up.Here are some standing exercises to keep warm while outside:


High knee kicks. Place your hands in front of you and kick your knees up to your hands.
Jumping jacks.
Torso twists. Keeping your elbows lifted, twist your upper body from side to side at a moderate pace.
Dance. If the occasion calls for it, don't be afraid to dance to the music!

, Even if you're just wearing a t-shirt, keeping other parts of your body can warm your overall internal core. Blow hot air into cupped hands and rub them together.Outer extremities are the first to develop damage from cold temperatures. These consist of your toes, fingers, ears, and nose. Extremities don't have the muscle or blood flow to keep them as warm as the rest of your body.Keep these areas warm to avoid freezing injuries like frostbite.

, Hot coffee, tea or cocoa are excellent ways to warm your hands and taking sips of the warm liquid will warm your body. It will force you to move around in order to get the drink, and the caffeine and sugar will give you energy to keep moving. It's a win-win for staying active and keeping warm.

Wear a hat.,
Wear an undershirt.,
Wear leggings.,
Wear gloves.,
Bring extra clothes or blankets.",How to Not Get Cold Wearing a T Shirt in Winter3," Although all parts of your body release heat, your head and neck are often exposed which releases major heat.Wear a hat and scarf to keep the heat trapped and circulate throughout your body. Any enclosed hat will do, but avoid visors.


If you can, wear a beanie or a hat that covers your ears. Your ears are one of the first parts of your body to experience damage to cold temperatures.

, If you're not going shirtless, wear a tanktop or thick sleeveless shirt or vest underneath your outfit. This keeps your core warmer, which can help regulate the rest of your body temperature.

, A thick pair of thermals underneath your jeans or sweatpants will keep your body focused on warming the exposed parts. Leggings or tights can also work, as well as high socks.

, Gloves can keep your outer extremities warm to avoid getting frostbite. If you don't need to use your fingers, mittens are better since they keep fingers together and trap heat more effectively than gloves.Gloves don't have to clash your entire outfit. A simple pair of white classy gloves for girls can add a nice tough, and black leather gloves for guys can make you seem cool.
You can purchase ""hot hands"" or hand warming devices to put inside gloves. These will keep your hands warm without getting too bulky.

, As the night goes on, it's bound to get colder. Temporarily warming up in a blanket or adding an external layer of clothes when the temperature becomes unbearable shouldn't affect your evening or your outfit.


Bring a scarfor sweater, and keep a blanket in your bag. These can be used to sit on to avoid cold benches or bleachers early in the night, as well.

Design your t-shirt online for a professional look.",How to Make a Tee Shirt1," Sports stores or bulk sellers like Target or Walmart are great for getting good-quality t-shirts in bulk. Cotton is the easiest fabric to work with, but try polyester and blends as well.;
, Cotton shirts will shrink in the wash, and it may ruin your design when it gets smaller, so pre-wash your shirts to make sure you get the design you want.

, This will prevent ink, paint, or dye from bleeding through to the back of the shirt.

, Transfer sheets are sold for both white and dark colored tees, and you can buy specialty paper at your local art store to make iron-ons. Simply print your image on the special paper using a home printer and iron the image onto your shirt.


Try on your shirt and mark lightly where you want the image to fall. After that, pin your tee to an ironing board or a sturdy surface so that the image goes exactly where you want it. , If you want to draw or write on your t-shirt, sharpies are fine too. Craft stores sell fabric paint and fabric markers, and you can also buy t-shirt dyes, decorative patches, studs, and rhinestones to add to your shirt.


If you use sharpie, wash the shirt separately the first time to prevent ink stains on your other clothes. , No matter what you use to decorate the shirt, resist the temptation to wear the shirt immediately. If you are using fabric glue and glitter, don't shake the glitter off the shirt until it's dry. Leaving a shirt in the sun or carefully hanging it may speed up the process.


Not all glitters are created equal—use glitters specifically made for fabric.

, There are a lot of different ways to make you own t-shirt unique. Try out new ways to design your shirt, including:

Cut out your design.,
Put a sheet of cardboard between the layers of the shirt.,
Tape your stencil securely to the shirt.,
Spray paint your shirt.,
Let your shirt dry for 2-3 hours.,
Carefully remove the stencil when the shirt is dry.,
Wash the shirt separately to prevent paint from bleeding into your other clothes.",How to Make a Tee Shirt2," Stencils are cut outs that allow you to apply spray paint, ink, or marker specific areas of the shirt. The stencil is a guide for where to draw, and it prevents you from making mistakes with complex shapes. To make one, you will need:


Poster board or thin cardboard.
Pencil
X-acto knife or other precision knife
Spray Paint

, The parts that you want to color will be cut out of the board, revealing the shirt underneath.


It can help to color in the stencil lightly. All of the parts you color in will be the design you paint on the shirt eventually.
Think of a stencil like carving a pumpkin -- all the parts you cut away make up the ""shape"" of the pumpkin.

, Precision knives, like x-acto blades can make fine cuts easily, allowing you to cut out detailed shapes. Cut away all of the parts you do not want covered in ink and discard them, but make sure you leave 4-5 inches of stencil on every side of your design.



Advanced Tip:Remember to leave shapes attached if they are surrounded. For example, if I want to cut out an uppercase ""A."" but want to save the triangle at the top, I need to keep a think line of poster board attached to the triangle so that I don't cut it out.

, This will prevent ink, paint, or dye from bleeding through to the back of the shirt.

, Make sure the tape does not cover over any part of the shirt you want colored in.

, The stencil will prevent the paint from getting on any parts of the shirt you don't want colored in. Following the instructions on the canister, spray your shirt thoroughly.


For a more vintage look, spray from a distance to create little patches without ink.

, Do not disturb the shirt or the paint could drip and ruin the design.

, You can even use this stencil again for another shirt if you'd like.

, The first 2-3 times you wash the shirt excess spray paint will leak off. Make sure to wash the shirt alone, on cool, to prevent it from ruining your other clothes.

Know that silk screens are the best way to produce identical shirts quickly.,

Turn on the light.,
Wash off the emulsion with cold water.,
Place cardboard or poster board between the layers of the shirt.,
Line up your screen.,
Squeegee the ink over your design.,
Slowly remove your silk screen.,
Repeat with as many shirts as you want.",How to Make a Tee Shirt3," Silk screening uses a pre-made design to apply ink onto a shirt quickly. You can then remove the shirt, put another one under the screen, and apply the same design to that shirt.

, To silk-screen shirts you will need some supplies, most of which should be available at your local art store or online:


Silk Screen ink (make sure it matches your shirt fabric)
Photo emulsion
Silk Screen and frame.
Squeegee
Bright light (minimum 150 Watts)
Large black, flat surface (chalkboard, poster, etc)
Poster board
Scissors or X-Acto knife
A design
A t-shirt, any fabric., Silk screens can only apply one color at a time, so create a simple shape or outline to begin learning. Your design will be what is eventually colored onto your shirt. Draw your design on piece of poster board and then cut it out. Think of your stencil as the ink on the shirt. Place your finished stencil on the shirt -- whatever part of the shirt the stencil covers will be inked over eventually.

NOTE: This is the opposite type of stencil from the one discussed earlier. Here, what you cut away makes your design.

, Photo emulsion is a special substance which reacts to light. When it does, it hardens. We will use this to make a shape in the emulsion for our design-- everything not covered in emulsion will be our design. Pour a line of emulsion along a side of the screen and use the squeegee to spread a thin line along the entire screen.


Apply emulsion to the side that is not surrounded by the frame on all four sides.
Do this in as dark a room as possible., Try to expose it to as little light as possible -- a closet or bathroom will work fine if you can close some blinds or curtains

, This is where you will expose the screen to light. Following the specification on the photo emulsion bottle, set up a light above your flat black surface. Each emulsion has different times, watts, and distances needed for proper exposure, so read the bottle carefully.


For example, if the emulsion calls for 30 minutes at 200 watts, set up a lamp with a 200W bulb 1-2 feet above a table. You will put the screen underneath the light.

, Cover it with a towel so it does not react to light as you transfer it to your exposure area. , The screen should be emulsion side up so that it is resting on the frame and the screen is raised a few inches above the table. Place your stencil in the middle of the screen.


Put your stencil down in reverse to get the right image. Look at your stencil the way you want it, then flip it over before you put it down.
If there is a breeze, or your stencil is very light, place a clear piece of glass on top of it to keep it from moving.
Do not push, prod, or move your screen, light, or stencil. , Check the emulsion bottle again to see how long you need the light for. If you smell anything burning, be sure to turn off the light immediately. When it is done, remove the stencil.


If you prepared the emulsion correctly, you should see the faint outline of your stencil in the emulsion.

, Take any high-powered water source (shower, faucet, hose) and wash off the screen, focusing the water on your image. You should see the outline of your stencil appear. Keep spraying until you see your image clearly. Don't forget to let the screen dry before moving on.

, This prevents ink from dripping through to the other side of the shirt.

, Place the screen on your t-shirt with the frame side up, centering your design where you want it on the shirt.

, Put a thin line of ink above your design. Firmly drag the squeegee over your design so that ink covers the entire stencil.


Higher pressure will result in a darker image. , Pull the screen off the t-shirt with even pressure then hang the shirt up to dry. The stencil should be the only part colored in.

, You can use your silk screen again with another t-shirt if you want, adding more ink as necessary.

Soak the shirt in hot water.,
Wash the shirt in hot water.,
Dry the shirt on high heat.",How to Make a Shirt Smaller1," Bring a large pot of water to a boil on the stovetop. Boiling hot water will make the fibers of the shirt contract which will make it shrink smaller. If you're looking to shrink a shirt as much as possible, high heat is the best way to go.


Remove the pot from the stove.
Submerge the shirt in the hot water. Use a spoon to push the shirt all the way underwater making sure it is completely covered by the water.
Soak the shirt for 30 minutes.;
, Set your washing machine settings to the hottest water possible. Wash the shirt on a regular wash cycle. If you bought a new shirt and want to shrink it before wearing, washing the shirt on hot will tighten the fibers and reduce its size slightly.Hot water may cause some fabrics to bleed or fade, wash the shirt alone to avoid damaging other clothes.
The agitation of the washing machine in top load machines will crinkle fabrics and lead to more shrinkage than a front loading machine.

, Place the shirt in the dryer and dry it on the dryer’s hottest setting. The heat will cause the shirt to shrink a little bit. With the exception of wool fibers, the dryer won't shrink clothes as much as hot water tends to. If you only want your shirt to shrink a little bit, wash it in cool water and dry on the highest setting.


Heat will shrink synthetic blend fabrics more than pre-shrunk natural fiber clothing.
Wool fabrics will felt in the dryer which causes the fabric to bunch and shrink as individual fabrics rub against each other and stick together.

If this is for a dress shirt, make sure that you include the entire length of the cuff, including the overlap.
Lace that is scalloped on one side and straight on the other works great for this.;
, Align the top edge of the lace up with the top edge of the hem. Overlap both ends of the lace by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Position them at the bottom of the sleeve, where the seam is.


If the lace is too long, push it further up the sleeve.

, Once you are happy with the look, secure the lace with sewing pins. If your shirt has a buttoned cuff, like in a dress shirt, do the following:


Unbutton and open the cuff.
Align the ends of the lace with the side edges of the cuff.
Fold the ends of the lace down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
Pin the lace in place.

, You can do this by hand or on the sewing machine. Try to place your stitches along the hem's original stitching. This will make your stitches less visible and obvious.Match the thread color to the fabric or the hem's stitching.

, Go back to where you overlapped the ends of the cuff by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Sew down the overlap using a thread color that matches your lace. This will keep the cuff together.


Consider spreading the edges apart slightly before you sew them for a flared look.

, Go over your lace cuff, and trim off any loose threads. If you pushed your lace further up the sleeve, consider trimming off the excess lace. Leave a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) hem.

This method works best on t-shirts, but you could try it on a dress shirt too.

, The lace will be on the outside of the shirt sleeve. It should be symmetrical, with either two straight edges or two scalloped edges.


Choose lace that is between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) wide.
Ruffled lace, or lace that is scalloped on one side and straight on the other, is not suitable for this project.

, Keep the sleeve folded, with the pressed edge at top. Cut a short slit into the top of the sleeve, just below the shoulder seam. Cut another short slit into the bottom of the sleeve, just about the cuff. Keep them perpendicular to the crease.Make the slits about ¼ to ⅓ of the width of your lace trim. When you flatten the sleeve out, the slits should expand to be about ½ to ⅔ the width of your lace trim.

T-shirts
Old blouses
Long-sleeved shirts;
, It is important that the surface is flat so that you cut the shirt evenly.

, This is why the shirt needs to be inside out, so you can see the seam more clearly.Use sharp scissors to cut many strips into the sleeves, cutting straight up to the shoulder seam and stopping.
When you are done, the sleeves should look like fringe hanging from the shirt.
This helps the shirt lose its curve around the shoulder seam so that it lays flatter and allows for a straighter cut.

, Using your scissors, make your way around the seam cutting off each strip carefully, as close to the edge as possible.


Avoid cutting into the shoulder seam, because that will cause fraying and may cause the shirt to unravel later.
Pull the strips tight as you cut, which will help make a clean, straight cut.

, If you do have any straggling threads or uneven edges, you'll want to remove those with the scissors in order to avoid fraying and unraveling later.


Take your scissors carefully along the edge at the shoulder seam, trimming up anything that needs to be cleaned up.
Your shirt is now sleeveless but still has the seams intact in order to help the shirt last longer. When the seams are cut off, the shirt tends to come apart quickly.

Select which shirt you would like to turn into a sleeveless tank.,
Lay your shirt on a flat surface.,
Cut out the neck of the shirt just below the seam.,
Trim off the sleeves starting at the armpit.,
Hem the new edges of the tank to avoid fraying on those edges.",How to Make a Sleeveless Shirt2," An old t-shirt is the best option for this method, as other shirts might have wider necklines that won't lend as well to making a tank.


The way this method differs from Method 1 is that in the first method, the shirt still came out to the edge of your shoulder and simply had the sleeves removed. In this method, we are removing both the sleeves and the neckline to make a tank.
Men's style t-shirts are a good option, because they tend to be looser-fitting than women's t-shirts., It is important that the surface is flat so that you cut the shirt evenly.

, Be sure to stick close to the seam, because this creates a wider neck opening than it seems.Stay within ¼ inch of the seam.
The cut doesn't have to be perfectly “straight,” especially if you're going for more of a grunge look. This means that the cut doesn't have to maintain the exact same distance from the seam all the way around the neckline.
Pull the shirt tight while you cut to avoid bunching and to make cutting easier.

, Unlike with the neckline cut, you will not follow the curve of the sleeve for this cut.


Start at the armpit and cut with a slight curve up toward the middle of the distance between the neck and the sleeve.You want to leave a good width for the strap of the tank, which should be about an inch-and-a-half or more.
Pull the sleeves tight while you cut to avoid bunching and to make the cutting easier.

, A double-turn hem is a simple and quick way to seal these new edges.


Fold your new edge to the inside of the shirt ¼ inch and press. Then, fold it in again another ¼ inch and press again. Use your sewing machine and its presser foot, also known as a rolled hem foot, to sew the folds down for the hem.Repeat on all edges, including both new armholes and the neckline.
Hemming is not necessary if you want your tank to have a grunge look.

Choose what t-shirt you would like to cut to make a muscle tee.,
Measure up about six inches from the bottom of the shirt to start your cut.,
Cut into the side of the shirt, cutting upward at a slight angle.,
Hem the edges, if you would like to keep the shirt from fraying.",How to Make a Sleeveless Shirt3," This style of sleeveless shirt is popular with people who workout frequently because it allows for more breathability.


Loose-fitting t-shirts are the best open for this style, especially if they are a bit big. The idea of this shirt is to have a baggy, open shirt in which to do strenuous activity, like weight lifting or manual labor.
This is the easiest method of making a sleeveless shirt, because it only requires two simple cuts.

, This will allow for a large open side in the shirt.This also ensures that you do not cut the side of the shirt completely open.

, Remember that you are not making this into a tank, so the width of the shirt at the shoulder should still be a good 3-4 inches wide.When you get up to the sleeve at the shoulder, you should have about an inch of fabric still attached to the sleeve as it is cut off. This allows for more fabric to be attached to the neckline, creating a muscle tee.
Pull the shirt tight as you cut to help keep a mostly straight cut. The new edges of the shirt will likely curl in on themselves a bit, but the cut should still be as straight as you can make it.

, A simple double-turn hem does the trick with minimal sewing.


Fold your new edge to the inside of the shirt ¼ inch and press. Then, fold it in again another ¼ inch and press again. Use your sewing machine and its presser foot, also known as a rolled hem foot, to sew the folds down for the hem.Repeat on the other armhole.

Find a sewing pattern for a sleeved shirt and a fabric to use.,
Reduce the width of your pattern at the shoulder by making new marks on it.,
Cut your pattern along the new lines.,
Trace your pattern onto the fabric.There are a variety of tools you can use to do this, but it is most important to use a tool that will wash out or leave no mark, if possible.,
Trim two extra strips of fabric on the bias in order to finish the armholes.This is a type of finish on the armholes that will give them a polished look.,
Follow the directions of the pattern to sew most of the shirt together, including the neckline.,
Fold and press your binding to begin the process of finishing the armholes.,
Pin the binding around the armholes.,
Make a small mark on the binding where it meets the side seam.Use a washable pen or other fabric-friendly tool to do this.,
Pull the bias tape, or the binding, away from the shirt.,
Sew all the way around the armhole.,
Press the binding away from the shirt at the new seam you just made.You should now have a small “sleeve” sticking out from the armhole and are ready to finish off the armhole.,
Use a sewing machine to stitch the armhole closed around the folded edge.This is the last step in polishing the arm hole on a sleeveless shirt made from scratch.",How to Make a Sleeveless Shirt4," If you like to make your own clothes, this is a method in which you can turn a sleeved pattern into a sleeveless one.


Almost any pattern of sleeved shirt will work for this.
Be sure that you are buying a pattern for the style of shirt you want (e.g. men's, women's, baby's, child's, et cetera).
Buy enough fabric to make the entire shirt so that you can avoid sewing scraps together.

, Remember that a sleeved shirt extends the width of the shoulder all the way to the tip, but sleeveless shirts usually do not.Use a pencil to make your new markings.
How much you shorten the width is up to you, but keep in mind that you will lose an additional 3/8 inch when you finish the seam on the sleeveless arm hole.
Try to make about the same new angle and curve on both sleeves so that they look the same. You may want to curve the front of the shirt a bit more than the back, simply for aesthetics.

, Before you start cutting your chosen fabric, you need to cut out your new pattern.


Carefully cut along your new lines, keeping your new curves as much as possible.
Prepare your pattern to trace onto the fabric.

, If it is a tool that claims to be washable, do a trial run first by marking an old shirt or scrap piece of fabric and washing it.

Measure your armholes and then add 3-4 inches to account for sewing.
The fabric strips should be about an inch wide.
These strips are also known as “binding.”

, Stop once you have reached the point of sewing the shoulder and side seams together., Lay your strips flat with the patterned side down.Fold one edge of the binding ¼ inch over the non-patterned side, and then press it flat.
Repeat with the second strip of binding.

, Start at the side seam.Leave at least an inch of excess fabric hanging before inserting the first pin at the side seam.
Put the unfolded edge of the binding along the edge of the armhole, so that the folded edge is closer to the breast of the shirt.
The right sides of the shirt and the binding should be together, meaning that the patterned side of the binding should be against the patterned side of the shirt, which should be right side out.
Continue to pin the binding all the way around the armhole.

,


Repeat this on the binding of the other armhole.
This is where you will sew the two ends together so that they will meet along the side seam.

, You may need to remove a couple of pins in order to do this.Sew the bias tape, with the patterned sides touching, at the marks you made on the fabric.
Trim any excess fabric off after sewing (remember that you left at least an inch before pinning).
Press open the small bit of fabric left after sewing and trimming and pin it to the armhole at the side seam.

, Leave 3/8 inch distance between the seam you are making and the edge.A sewing machine is recommended for this process, as it will be faster and straighter.

,


Flip the shirt inside out after doing this.
Fold the binding again along the ¼ inch edge that you made previously, and then fold it again along the seam.
Pin all the way around the armhole, with the binding folded in twice around it.

,


Repeat the process on the other armhole.
Press the new seam around the armhole one more time to give it a crisp edge, and you are done.

Lay the shirt on the ground with the front touching the ground, the back part where you're going to make the corset should be facing you.,
Fold the sleeves back so it forms a straight line.,
Cut only the back part of the shirt, cutting on the outer edge of the Sharpie line so that it's not on the good part of the shirt.,
Cut off equal portions of each side of the shirt until it's a desired fit.,
Momentarily move the strips and take your Sharpie making dots equal distance from each other on each side of the shirt.,
Take your knife, or scissors, and carefully pierce through the shirt where the holes are.,
Take the two strips still attached to the collar and stretch them out as long as you can.,
Begin lacing the corset through like you would do shoes, or obviously, a corset.,
Try on your shirt and tighten or loosen it as you please!

",How to Make a Corset Back T Shirt," Fold the shirt so that only the sleeves overlap each other.;
, Take a Sharpie tracing on the edge from the bottom of the shirt all the way up to the collar. When you're done and you unfold each side of the shirt, it should form a column in the middle of your shirt.

, Your shirt should now have a strip missing. Put it on like you would a jacket and see if it's a good fit; determine how much you need to cut off to make it tighter or show more skin.

, You're shirt should be a little bit looser than you would like it. Cut off equal portions of the shirt without cutting the collar, so the strip is still connected to the shirt (unless you are using different string and not the shirt fabric, cut the strip all the way).

, Each dot should have another dot across from it, this is the corset pattern. Make as many holes as you desire, but don't cut one into the collar.

, Try not to make it too big, or too close to the edge, because it will be easier to rip and won't last as long.

, These are the strings for your corset.

, The strips may not be long enough, so you will need to sew on more fabric from the middle part you took out.

Take your measurements.,
Draft the pattern.,
Draw the armholes.,
Cut the fabric.,
Bind the raw edge.,
Prepare the armhole binding.,
Bind the armholes.,
Try on the vest.",How to Make a Vest1," You'll need to measure your bust and the dimensions needed for the armholes of the vest.


To measure your bust, simply wrap a tape measure around the widest part of your chest. Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground as you wrap it around your torso.
Measure the armhole depth by measuring from the top of your shoulder to the bottom of your armpit. Add another 3 inches (7.6 cm) to this measurement to ensure that there will be enough space.
Determine how far apart the armholes will need to be by measuring across your back from arm to arm.;
, Draw a circle onto your fabric with a diameter equal to your bust measurement.


This circle makes up the entire outline of your vest.
Use a loose knit fabric to create a sweater-like vest
If you want to skip the binding steps and turn this into a no-sew project, use fleece. Fleece will also create a warmer, cozier product.

, Vertically center the armholes on your circle, spacing them apart according to the width of your back (as measured earlier).


Use a ruler or tape measure to find the exact center point of your pattern. Draw a straight vertical line from top to bottom, then a straight horizontal line from side to side. The point of intersection should be the center of your circle.
Half of your back width should extend to the right of this center mark and the other half should extend to the left.
Each armhole should rest perpendicular to this back width line and fall out at either end of this line. Half of the armhole line should extend above the back width and the other half should fall below.

, Use sharp scissors to cut out the circle. Also cut along the lines made for your armholes.


Do not cut along the back width line or any other line aside from those specifically mentioned.

, Sandwich the raw edge of the circle in the fold of double-fold bias tape. Pin the end in place, then gradually wrap the rest of the tape around the perimeter of the circle, pinning the tape down as you go. Top stitch the binding in place.


Turn over the raw ends of the bias tape. Fold 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from either end under, tucking the raw end beneath the inner folds of the tape. Pin and sew normally.
Stitch the binding in place near the open end of the tape, catching tape from both the front and back of the circle.
You can use any stitch you find aesthetically pleasing as long as the stitch catches the binding and holds it in place.

, For each armhole, you will need to prepare two strips of double-fold bias tape. Each piece must be 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) longer than your armhole.


For one armhole, pin two strips right-sides together so that the short ends are aligned.

Draw a 1.25-inch (3.18 cm) line on the center of each end with the tape folded open.
Sew 1/16 inch (1.59 cm) around this line through both layer to form one end of the armhole, then cut down the center of the line.


Repeat these steps using the other two pieces for the other armhole.
Turn the bindings right-side out, turn under all raw edges by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm), and press in place with a hot iron.

, Sandwich the raw edges of your armhole in the center fold of the prepared binding. Pin, then sew in place.


Sew the binding near the open edge of the tape using an aesthetically pleasing stitch. Make sure that you catch the tape on both the top and bottom layers.

, Hold the circle against your back and slip your arms through the prepared armholes. Drape the excess fabric over your shoulders so that it hangs naturally in place.


This step completes the project.

"
Cut out the material, if necessary.,
Fold the fabric in half.,
Mark the starting position of your armholes.,
Draw the armholes.,
Cut out the armholes.,
Put on the vest.",How to Make a Vest2," You can purchase 1 yd (0.91 m) of 60-inch (1.5 m) jersey fabric, and no cutting will be needed. If you have more fabric than you need, though, measure out 1 yd (0.91 m) of length and 60 inches (1.5 m) of width, then cut accordingly.


Jersey fabric is typically fray-resistant and drapes well. The two qualities combined make it a perfect choice for this vest. Its draping qualities will allow the material to hang loosely in front of your torso, while its fray-resistant composition prevents you from needing to hem the edges. As such, with jersey fabric, this vest can be made without any sewing.
If you use a different material that is not fray-resistant, however, you'll need to hem all of your raw edges. For the main body of fabric, simply turn 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of material to the underside of the fabric, pin in place, then straight stitch across each side to hold the hem down.

, Spread the material out flat in front of you with the long side running left to right and the shorter side running up and down. Fold the fabric over from left to right, lining all of the edges up evenly.


Note that the side of the fabric you plan on placing toward your body should face toward you after you fold it.
You may want to pin the fabric halves in place to keep them from moving around as you work.

, Use your tape measure to measure out 6 inches (15.24 cm) down along the fold from the top of the material. From that mark, measure 6 inches (15.24 cm) across from the fold, into the body of the material.


Only use fabric pencil, chalk, or another water soluble marking tool.

, Use fabric pencil to draw an 8-inch (20.32-cm) line down from your armhole starting point.


The line must be vertical and parallel to the fold of the material.

, Use sharp scissors to carefully cut a slit through your armhole marking. Make sure that you cut through both the front and back layers of fabric.


Consider placing more pins around the armhole area as you cut the slits out. Jersey material is stretchy and will likely get distorted as you work with the scissors. Using more pins directly around the area you plan on cutting will secure the material in that section of the garment more rigidly.
If you are not using a jersey fabric and instead opt for a fabric that is not fray-resistant, you will need to hem the armholes.

Cut 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) diagonal slits off each armhole. One should come off the bottom and point left while another should come off the bottom and point right. Similarly, another should come off the top and point left while a final one should come off the top and point left.
Fold the resulting flaps of material to the underside of the garment. Pin in place, then sew flat with a straight stitch.



, Unfold the material and drape it flat against your back. Bring your arms through the armholes you just cut out, and bring the rest of the material to the front of your torso. Hold the vest material in place by cinching it in at your waist using a coordinating skinny belt.


Alternatively, you could skip the belt and let the vest hang loosely over your front for a different style option.
The completion of this step marks the completion of this project.

Choose the right garment.,
Remove any unwanted elements.,
Cut off the sleeves.,
Cut off the top.,
Measure and mark the tucks.,
Sew the tucks into the top of the material.,
Stitch the shoulder seams.,
Sew around the neckline.,
Fold the collar down.,
Wear the vest.",How to Make a Vest3," Use a slightly oversized button-down shirt for this project. A cotton or flannel shirt will usually work well.


Sleeve length does not matter.
You could use a denim jacket or shirt, but since denim is a thicker material, you will not need to add the tucks later on.
Experiment with shirts made with different materials to alter the look. A flannel shirt will result in a soft vest with a decent amount of structure, while a shirt made from a lighter, ""flowy"" fabric may result in a vest that has a delicate, airy appearance.

, If the shirt has any pockets or pocket flaps, use a seam ripper to remove them. Work carefully to remove only the threads that connect the pocket to the body of the shirt. If you aren't carefully, you could accidentally put a hole in the front of th garment.


Even if you want pockets on your vest, it is still a good idea to remove any that are currently on the shirt. The alterations you will end up making will alter the structure of the garment and shift the pockets from their current positions.
Also consider removing any tags or manufacturer registration markings, especially if they were located under the pocket and are visible after you take the pocket off.

, Use scissors to carefully cut off the shirt sleeves. Cut to the outside of the seam, leaving the sleeve seam connected to the main body of the shirt.


By leaving the seam intact, you can prevent most of the fraying you would otherwise face. As a result, you will not need to hem the arm holes later on.

, Flip the shirt over to its back and identify the back yoke. Cut straight across the top of the shirt just below this yoke, completely removing the collar and upper portion of the garment.


There may be a seam or crease at the bottom of the back yoke. If not, know that the yoke is the portion of fabric that fits around the neck and shoulders.
If you are using a plaid flannel shirt, use the lines on your shirt to create a straight cut. If you do not have lines on your shirt, you may want to lightly sketch out a line with a fabric pencil and a ruler before cutting.

, Determine how much material you will need to take in at the top of your vest and plan out your tucks accordingly.


The top of your vest should be no longer than the span of your shoulders.
Keep in mind that a tuck will actually take in twice as much material. For instance, a 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) tuck will take in 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of fabric.
The tucks should each be about 4 inches (10 cm) long, regardless of how many you use and how deep you make them.
Mark your tucks using a fabric pencil or tailor's chalk. The marking tool you use should be water-soluble.
Note that tucks add structure to the garment, remove extra bulk, and add an element of style.

, Fold the tuck along the the marked line so that the wrong sides of the material come together. Sew a straight stitch 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) away from the fold to complete the tuck.


This step is easiest to complete with the use of a sewing machine.
Backstitch at the beginning and end of each tuck to secure the seams.
Repeat this procedure for each tuck that you have marked on the garment.

, With the vest inside-out and the right sides together, sew 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance across both shoulders of your vest.


Turn the vest inside-out and loosely pin the shoulder seams together. Try the vest on and reposition the pins as needed to provide a better fit.
Make sure that you leave enough room for your neck when measuring out the shoulders. Each shoulder seam should be around 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) long.
All the tucks should still point toward the center of the vest after you finish stitching the shoulders.

, Use your sewing machine to stitch a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance around the edge of the neckline.


The neckline will still fray a little, but this seam will prevent it from completely unraveling or falling apart.
If you want to minimize fraying even more, apply a fray-check liquid around the raw edge or fold the material around the neckline to the underside of the vest and stitch the fold in place.

, Fold the collars down at the neckline to a position that you find aesthetically appealing. Place a button on top of the collar on each side and sew it in place, holding the collar down in the process.


Use leftover buttons from the sleeves you removed earlier, if applicable.
If you do not have leftover buttons or simply want a different look, choose any button that coordinates well with your fabric.
Hand sew the buttons on.

, Slip the vest on as though it were still a shirt. You can let the vest hang open for one look, or button it up for a second look.


The completion of this step marks the completion of this project.

Sew your jersey in place.,
Place the jersey inside the frame.",How to Frame a Jersey," To display a sports jersey, use a shadowbox frame, which is a shallow, framed, rectangular box is usually use. Shadow boxes have a glass front that is ideal for displaying and protecting bulky items, because they provide more space between the backing and the glass than a traditional frame does. The inside of the frame will need to have at least 1 inch (25.4 mm) of space between it and your jersey. The typical jersey-size frame is 40-inches by 32-inches.Choose a frame that is stained or painted a color that matches your jersey, and the décor in your home.
Look for a shadow box with UV-protective glass.
There are certain frames made specifically for jerseys, but they tend to be very expensive. A shadow box with the right dimensions will most likely be much cheaper than a frame made especially for a jersey.;
, Unlike with a regular picture frame, the backing that comes with your shadow box may not be all you need to use for your framing project. For a jersey, typically you need foam backing to provide support (this might come in the frame), and an acid-free archival backing paper to go over the top. You may or may not choose to use matting around the edges for extra effect.A lot of framers choose to use dry mounting to prepare the backing for the frame. This safely attaches the archival paper to the backboard.
The backing paper should be a neutral color that complements your jersey.

, For completing your project, you’ll also need a measuring tape, an x-acto knife, a sewing needle (embroidery works best), clear thread (like fishing line), and whatever mounting materials you chose to use (specific to the type of backing you’re using). You’ll probably also want a clothing iron, so that you can prepare your jersey for framing and help the folds to lie flat inside the frame.

, Cut your foam or backing board to shape, using an x-acto knife. The board should be the same size as your frame. Then, place your mounting paper over the top. If you’re dry mounting the backing, you should do so now.

, If you have enough room inside the shadow box frame, it is a nice addition to insert a sheet of foam inside the jersey, inside the frame. This will provide support and help the jersey to look a bit more filled-out than if you pin it flat to the board. Cut a piece of your foam board into a rectangle the size of the torso of the jersey, and insert it inside. You can sew the backside of the jersey to the board to help secure it in place, or just use a few straight pins.

, Although there are a few different ways to fold your jersey, they all are done so that the major logos and symbols are visible inside the frame. Lay your jersey flat on a tabletop, and fold the sleeves over so that they go downwards. Use an iron to keep the jersey in this position, to prepare it for its life in a frame.

, Thread your needle with your clear thread, and begin hand-sewing around the edge of the jersey. Sew around the neckline, at the hem, and the sides and sleeves of the jersey. If possible, sew through the back of the fabric rather than the front, so that the thread is hidden. You are sewing the jersey to the backing, so that it does not move inside the frame.

, If the jersey is safely secured to the backing and arranged to your liking, you are ready to place it inside your frame. Carefully slide it in, being careful not to move the jersey as you do so. Make sure that the jersey does not touch the glass, as over time the moisture buildup here will cause the jersey to mold. Secure the back of the frame, and you’re finished!

Gather your materials.,
Fold the shirt in half.,
Mark where you want the new armholes to end.,
Cut the sleeves off.,
Tug the armholes gently to curl the fabric.,
Make larger armholes.,
Cut out the neckline.,
Trim off the hem.",How to Make a Cutoff Shirt," Making a cutoff shirt is easy, and no sewing is required. To make a cutoff t-shirt, you will need:T-shirt
Scissors
Chalk or pen;
, It is important for your cutoff t-shirt’s sleeves to be even, or you may end up looking lopsided. To ensure that your armholes are even when you cut them, start by folding the shirt in half lengthwise.


Make sure that the sleeves are matching up.

, Next, locate the place on the shirt where you want the new armholes to begin and end, then mark the shirt in these places. You can also mark how far in you want the sleeves to go. However, keep in mind that the deep into the shirt you cut, the more of your chest will be visible.


Try marking just above, beside, and below the current sleeve to guide you as you cut the sleeves off.Remember that you can always make the armholes larger if desired, but you cannot make them smaller after you cut them.

, Once you are happy with the placement of your sleeves, you can cut off the old sleeves. Cut along the points you marked in a slightly curving line.Try to avoid making any jagged edges as you cut.


If you do end up with a jagged edge, you can always cut in a little more.

, After you have cut off the sleeves, give the new armholes a gentle tug.This will curl the t-shirt fabric around the new edges you have created and soften the look a little bit. After this, your cutoff t-shirt is ready to wear.

, The wider you make the armholes, the more of your body will be visible from the side.Therefore, it is important to carefully consider how large you want to make your armholes. Try a small cut and see how it looks on you before cutting too far down. You can always cut more, but you cannot put the fabric back after you cut it.


For example, if you cut your armholes down to the middle of the shirt, then your ribs and the side of your abs will be visible. Don’t cut down too far if you are not comfortable showing off these muscles.

, You can simply cut around the neckline to widen it a little, or cut way outside of the neckline to widen it a lot. If you prefer a deep v-neck shirt, then you can also cut a V shape out of the front of the shirt.Try cutting close to the neckline and see how that looks first. The more of the neckline you cut, the more of your chest, back, and shoulders will be visible.

, Trimming off the hem is more for a uniform appearance than anything else, but cutting off the hem can shorten the length of the shirt by a little or a lot. Try cutting off the hem close to the seam at first to give the bottom of the shirt the same curved appearance as the arm holes. Then, give the hem a gentle tug to curl it up like the sleeves.If desired, you can trim the hem more to make it shorter.

Rinse and hand wash your shirt.",How to Design Your Own T Shirt," Maybe you are advertising your cleaning company, your rock band, or your favorite sports team. Maybe you’re using a personal illustration. The purpose of the design will determine the design.


If you are advertising a company, band, sporting team, or brand, you will likely need to focus on logo. The Nike swoosh logo, for example, is a very simple but effective design. A design for a sporting team might feature the team colors or the team’s mascot. A design for your band might focus on an image of the band or a graphic that represents the band’s style or sound.
If you are making a t-shirt to showcase a personal illustration or drawing, you will need to focus on how it will look on a t-shirt. Think about how original the illustration is and how the colors are working in the illustration.
Consider using a photo in your design. Use your own photo. You may use a picture made by someone else, but only if you have acquired the legal rights to use that image. You can also buy a stock image.;
, When designing a t-shirt, its important to think about color contrast. This means how certain ink colors in the design will appear against a lighter colored shirt or a darker colored shirt. Certain ink colors look more vibrant on a lighter or darker shirt on the computer screen than they actually do when printed.When using lighter shirts, avoid pastel colors like yellow, light blue, or light pink. These colors will be visible on the shirts but may not be legible at a distance. And if you are designing a shirt with a logo, you want to make sure that logo is legible from far away!
If you decide to use pastel colors, add an outline of a darker color to the lighter color to highlight the text and make it easier to read.
Darker colored shirts look good with lighter ink colors, such as pastels. But be careful when using darker ink colors on darker colored shirts like cardinal (dark blue), maroon, or forest green. These colors may look great on the computer or in a drawing, but when they print, the shirt color sometimes distorts the ink color. As a result, they can appear more brown or dull.
If you decide to use Adobe Illustrator to create your design, the Global Colours settings can help immensely with color schemes., Once you’ve added your colors to the design, it may look good but still a bit flat or one dimensional. To create more depth to a certain area of the design, add a color that is the shade of the color beneath it. This will brighten up the design and give it some dimension.If you plan to use software with a high capacity for manipulation (such as Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Gimp, Adobe Illustrator, or Paint Shop Pro), you can use a standard image and radically transform it to fit your needs.

Creating a vector outline on Inkscape is an especially effective way to resize a photo if necessary.

, This means combining all the parts or elements to form a whole. How you do this depends on the composition of your design. Maybe your design has a lot of smaller elements, like stars, plants or animals. Or may it is one large design with one main figure or image.Think about how you can make the design look cohesive, so that all the parts or elements fit well together. A balanced image will immediately draw the eye in rather than away from an image.

, Would your design work better as a centered image, an image on the top left of the t-shirt or as a wraparound image?


If you are designing a t shirt for a brand or company, a simple design in the center of the shirt may be the most effective.
Don’t forget you can also use the back of the t-shirt to include a branding slogan (“Just Do It”). Or a song lyric from a song by the band you are designing the shirt for.

, It’s best to sketch your ideas out before putting them on your t-shirt. Try out several different designs and color combinations. Keep in mind color contrast and dimension. Make sure the image is balanced and cohesive.When in doubt, get a second opinion. Ask friends, family, or coworkers what design and color scheme they like best.

, If your paper sketches are not high quality or drawn with clear lines, this option may not work. If your sketch is high quality:


Scan the sketches to your computer. Then, retouch them in Photoshop.
Clean up the lines. Play with the filters, colors, brightness, contrast, saturation, or any other effects at your disposal.
Add lines, flourishes, splatter effects, and other embellishments that might make the design more dynamic and balanced (where appropriate).
Make sure that the entire layout is internally consistent by keeping proportions reasonable, styles consistent, and colors cohesive.

, If you aren’t happy with the quality of your paper sketches, use computer software to draw line art on Photoshop.


If you have a computer drawing tablet, you can color and draw straight onto Photoshop or a similar program.

, Look for a font that complements your overall design, rather than overwhelm it. The font should work with the image(s) in your design to create a balanced design.


Think about the fonts on some of the more well known logos or designs. The font should relate back to the company or brand’s overall style. Nike’s Just Do It’s slogan, for example, is in a bold and simple font, just like their bold and simple swoosh logo. In contrast, the font used for a sports team or a garage rock band may be more elaborate or ornate.
Make sure any filters you are using on the design are also applied to the font. If you are working with layers on Photoshop, you will need to drag your font layers below the photo effects layers.Use free fonts from an online site like defont.com. You can also access free brush designs from brusheezy.com.Look at how to add fonts to your PC, Illustrator, or Photoshop if necessary.
If you’re feeling adventurous with design, you can make your own.

, The easiest way to do this is to print the design and iron it onto a plain shirt. However, if you want to test the quality of your design, you can hire a printing company to create a professional prototype.

, For a small-scale operation, you can continue ironing on the design.

If you’d like to make shirts at a larger scale, however, you can pay a printing company to make them for you.







, To screen-print your design at home, you will need:A plain t-shirt
50 ml bottle of degreaser (available at your local art store)
1 liter cold water
A large brush
500 ml of emulsion
A small bottle of sensitizer
A bottle of screen printing ink
A squeegee or a coating tray
A small wooden stick
A hair dryer
A transparency
A printing screen
You can purchase a printing screen at your local art store. Or make your own by buying a mesh screen and a canvas stretcher frame. Stretch the mesh across the frame and staple the edges down so that the mesh is taut. For standard designs on a light shirt, a 110-195 mesh works best. For fine designs with multiple colors, use a 156-230 mesh., Mix the degreaser and the cold water together. Place the brush in the mixture and then brush the mixture on to the screen.


Make sure you brush both sides of the screen. You just want to give the screen a light brush so don’t worry about putting too much of the mixture on the screen.
Let the screen dry.

, Take 20 ml of water and pour it into the bottle of sensitizer. Mix the sensitizer well by shaking for a about a minute.


Add the sensitizer into the emulsion.
Use the small wooden stick to mix the sensitizer and the emulsion together.
The color of the emulsion should change from blue to green. There should also be small bubbles forming in the emulsion.
Place the lid loosely back on the emulsion and place it in a dark area or room for an hour. After an hour, check that all the small bubbles in the emulsion have disappeared.
If they do not disappear after an hour, leave the emulsion to sit for another hour until the bubbles are gone.

, In a very dim room or with a low red light, drip a line of photo emulsion across the screen and use a squeegee to spread it around.The emulsion will leak through the screen, so be sure to squeegee both sides of the screen.You can also use a coating tray to apply the emulsion to the screen. Do this by placing the screen on a clean towel and tilting it away from you slightly. Place the coating tray at the bottom of the screen and carefully pour the emulsion on the screen as you move the tray up the screen.
Leave the emulsion to dry in a completely black room for about twenty minutes. Use a fan to help the screen dry., Now you’re ready to burn your image into the emulsion. Do this by placing the screen flat, placing the transparency down backward, and placing a piece of glass over the transparency to ensure that it doesn’t move., A 500-watt lightbulb will burn the transparency image into the emulsion in roughly fifteen minutes.


The exact times for this process depend on the light and emulsion you use.Specific directions for the light needed should be on the packaging of the purchased emulsion.

, Let the screen soak in a thin layer of water for about two minutes. Then rinse any excess emulsion off with a hose or in the shower., The flat side of the screen will go facedown on the shirt, and the side with the frame is where you will use the ink.

To make sure no ink ends up leaking around the frame, use waterproof tape to secure around the edges where the screen stretches over the frame., Make sure there are no wrinkles. Place the screen on top of the t-shirt, where you would like your design to be. Place the screen on top, making sure that the screen and design are aligned.


Clip your shirt down to a firm piece of cardboard. Doing this will ensure your t-shirt remains flat and unwrinkled. It will also make it easier to move your t-shirt to a safe spot later to dry.
If possible, have a friend hold the screen down tight while you spread the ink.

, Using your squeegee, coat the screen by spreading the line of ink from top to bottom.


The mesh is actually quite thick, so this step is more of a primer.Use very light pressure so you don’t push any ink through the screen.

, With the screen flooded, you’re ready to transfer the design to the shirt.


Use the squeegee at a 45° angle in both hands to evenly distribute the pressure. If possible, ask a friend to hold the screen in place.
Drag the ink back up across the flooded screen over the design., Using a hairdryer, apply even heat to the design for several minutes.Cure the ink before using the next screen to add additional layers of the graphic in different colors.
If you use the proper screen-printing technique and cure it, your t-shirt will be washing machine safe.

, Use cold water and scrub it with a sponge to get the ink out. Let the screen air dry.

, To stencil your design onto a t-shirt, you will need:


A black and white print out of your design. Its important to use a black and white printout of your design so it will be easy to trace.
A piece of contact paper, or a transparency
A craft knife, or exacto knife
A plain t-shirt
A piece of cardboard big enough to cover the front area of the shirt

, Contact paper is clear paper used for covering books. It has a normal side and a sticky side that peels off. You want to tape your paper to the peeling side so that the design is visible through the front of the contact paper—the non-sticky side.You can also use a piece of transparency or clear paper. Attach it to the printout of your design with tape., Lay the attached papers on a flat surface, like a table.


Trace the lines with the craft knife or an exacto knife. Keep in mind the black parts you cut out are the parts of the design that will be filled with paint., Remove the normal paper with the design from the contact paper as well. Place the sticky stencil onto the t-shirt, making sure it is straight and not wrinkled.


If you are using a transparency or clear paper instead of contact paper, attach the transparency to the shirt with tape., Doing this separates the front and back so the ink doesn’t bleed through to the other side.

, Only put paint on the spots that have been cut out of the contact paper—the spots that will be painted in dark on the t-shirt.Let the paint dry. Test the paint by gently touching the painted spots. If paint comes away on your finger, it is not fully dry.

, You will now have a stenciled on t-shirt.


You can use the stencil to make another shirt if you want more than one stenciled t-shirt.

, Bleach painting is a fun, easy, and inexpensive way to create a design on a t-shirt, especially text based designs. But, remember bleach is toxic, so keep it out of reach of children.Always protect your eyes, clothing, and any open cuts from coming into contact with bleach.
If you have sensitive skin, you should wear thin kitchen gloves while bleach painting.

, You will need:


Fabric safe household bleach
A synthetic bristle paint brush (go for an inexpensive one, as you’ll just be bleaching it anyway!)
A glass or ceramic bowl
A white towel or rag
White chalk
A piece of cardboard
A dark colored cotton blend shirt
You can try this method on a lighter colored shirt, but the bleach painting will show up better on darker colors.

, Then, slide the piece of cardboard inside your shirt. It will act as an even surface as you write your design. It will also stop the bleach from bleeding through the back of your shirt.

, This could be your favorite saying (“Bazinga!” “Reach for the Stars”), the name of your band, or the logo of your brand.


Don’t worry if you need the smudge out the chalk lines and re-sketch the design. The chalk lines will wash out once you’ve completed the bleach painting.

, Secure the shirt to the cardboard with elastics or small clips. This will keep the cardboard from slipping while you bleach paint.

, Pour a few cups of the bleach into the glass or ceramic bowl. Use a towel to wipe up any drips. You don’t want any drops of bleach to end up on your clothing.

, Drag it on the edge of the bowl to eliminate any dripping.

, For an even bleach line, reload your brush every two inches. The fabric will quickly soak up the liquid so work quickly, but with a steady hand.

, Then, take a break to allow the bleach to react with the fabric of the shirt.


Look over the shirt. Are there any uneven spots or light areas? If so, go back in with your bleach filled brush and even out the design.

, This will allow the bleach to process and lighten.


Depending on the cotton content of your shirt, the color of your design will range from dark red, to orange, to pink, or even white.

, Hang it to dry. Admire your new permanent bleach design.


Wash the shirt with like colors. The chalk lines should wash out, leaving only the bleach design.

Also a quality thread is kinder to your sewing machine which means the sewing machine will have fewer problems with sewing tension.

, You can also use a straight stitch to hem. Select 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) for sewing hems. This is the standard stitch length for almost all sewing projects.

, Most shirt sleeves can be hemmed using a turned-up hem. The following steps will guide you through sewing a turned up hem.

Wear a statement jacket.,
Put a collared shirt on underneath.,
Wear a dinner jacket.,
Pair it with a neutral blazer.,
Add a shirt dress.",How to Dress Up a Graphic Tee1," Pairing your graphic tee with a jacket that commands attention tones down the informal vibe a graphic tee can give off. For example, try a suit jacket with a micro-pattern, or go even bolder with a long, leopard-print trench coat.A loose-fitting, belted top coat can give your graphic tee a pick-me-up.
Try pairing a graphic tee featuring a band’s name or logo with a nice leather jacket.
A shirt with printed text goes well with a houndstooth jacket.
Mix up bold colors! For example, if you’re wearing a tee with a red, white and blue graphic, add a sunflower-colored cardigan jacket to add interest and contrast.;
, A shirt with a Peter Pan collar looks great underneath a graphic tee, especially if the tee is long-sleeved. However, any well-fitted collared shirt will do.For instance, wear a red collared tee underneath a black shirt with red graphics to dress up your outfit with a pop of color.
Try a shirt with a pointed black collar under a black-and-gray graphic tee. Or, look sharp in a white collared shirt underneath a black-and-white graphic tee. If the tee and collared shirt are long-sleeved, arrange it so that both your cuffs and collar show, to mix casual with prim and proper.
Make sure that the collared shirt is tight enough so that it doesn’t look or feel bulky underneath your tee.

, The combination of a casual graphic tee and a semi-formal jacket creates a vibe that is dressed-up without looking overdone. Go for a color or shade that is classy, but not too formal – avoid pure black.A dinner jacket is an evening suit jacket, often with ribbed and/or satin lapels. Sleek shades for this look are charcoal gray, navy blue, and silver.
You can pull from colors in your t-shirt for the hue of your jacket. For example, try pairing a navy blue dinner jacket with a lighter blue tee. Go monochromatic with a black and gray tee underneath a white jacket.
Try using complementary colors, which are across from each other on the color wheel. For instance, pair a blue jacket with a tee that has orange in it, or wear a purple jacket over a graphic tee with yellow details.

, Look for one with fancy buttons or hardware, in a calm shade like khaki.For a look that isn’t super-fancy, wear a black blazer with 3/4-length sleeves and strategically placed details like zippers and/or blocks of leather.For a clean, elegant look, a soft version of any earth tone will do. For example, try a moss-colored blazer, or a pale spring green. Wear it over a rust-colored graphic tee, or a printed tee with black, white and gray.

Get a t-shirt.,
Wash and dry the shirt.,
Get some rhinestones.,
Place your rhinestones where you want them to go.,
Make a small puddle of glue on a lid or disposable tray.,
Use a chopstick or popsicle stick to apply some of the glue to the back of a rhinestone.,
Put the rhinestone back into place, and press down on it gently.,
Keep gluing the rhinestones on until you are done, then wait for the glue to dry completely.,
Wear your new shirt.",How to Decorate a T‐Shirt1," The best type of shirt to use for this would be a plain, solid-colored shirt. Anything with patterns or designs may clash with the rhinestones you will be using. The style of the shirt you get will depend on where you will be placing the rhinestones. In the end, however, the color and style is completely up to you. For example:


If you plan on adding rhinestones to the shoulder area, a fitted t-shirt would work best.
If you plan on adding large, chunky rhinestones to the collar area, any style of t-shirt would work, especially one with a large/scooped collar.;
, This is especially important if the shirt is brand new, as it will remove any starches and shrinking. Most t-shirts do not need to be ironed, but if your t-shirt has a lot of wrinkles in it, it would be a good idea to iron it.

, You can use tiny rhinestones for a more delicate look, or chunky rhinestones to make a statement. White, silver, or black rhinestones will give you a classy look, while colored ones will give you a more cheerful look.


The rhinestones don't all have to be the same. Place around with different shapes and sizes.
For a longer-lasting design, get rhinestones with holes in them so that you can sew them on instead.

, One of the most popular places to put rhinestones (especially chunky ones) is along the collar and/or shoulders, but you can put the rhinestones anywhere you want. A great idea for tiny rhinestones is to make a heart or crown shape with them.


If you are sewing the rhinestones on, it might be better to sketch the design out first using tailor's chalk. This way, you won't have to worry about accidentally knocking them aside.

, The best type of glue to use for this project would be industrial-strength glue, but a high-quality fabric glue (not ""liquid stitch"") may also work.If you are sewing the rhinestones on, cut a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) long piece of thread, and thread a sewing needle. Make sure that the thread color matches the shirt., If you are working with a tiny rhinestone, you can use a toothpick or skewer instead. You can also use a pair of tweezers to dip the rhinestone into the glue. In either case, avoid using too much glue, or you will risk it bleeding through the fabric.


If you are sewing the rhinestones on, tie the end of the thread into a large knot, then poke it through the fabric, starting from the inside of the shirt.

, Try to get the rhinestone in the correct position. If you nudge it around too much, the glue will smear and create ""stains"" on the fabric.


If you are sewing the rhinestone on, simply run the thread and needle through one of the holes and back through the fabric. You'll want to do this 2 to 3 times per hole., How long the glue takes to dry depends on what you are using. Read the label on the bottle for specific drying times. It is typically a few hours.

, When it gets dirty, it would be best to hand wash your shirt. If you must use a washing machine, be sure to turn the shirt inside out and to use a gentle cycle. Hang the shirt up to dry; do not use a dryer.

Wear fancy trousers.,
Don a long, diaphanous skirt.,
Wear a mini-skirt.,
Sport wide-legged pants.,
Go bottomless.",How to Dress Up a Graphic Tee2," Slim-fit pants are a great way to dress up a t-shirt. Wear pants in a solid color or shade, such as black. Or, go for a wild animal print. Add semi-formal shoes, like nice flats or pumps.Optionally, add a skinny belt.
Look for skinny pants in any material; for instance, black or dark-washed jeans, or dressier fabrics. Add a well-tailored blazer or a fitted leather jacket.

, It should fall just below the knee. The skirt should be relatively voluminous. It can be structured at the top and flowy at the bottom, or flowy throughout.For example, opt for a white denim skirt with a belt. Or, don a skirt in solid black leather.
To up the fancy factor, look for a skirt in a jewel-toned floral fabric.
Try wearing a fitted cardigan in a solid color over a midi skirt in a micro-print.

, Look for trousers with a slight sheen and a crease down the legs in the center-front. Match them to a dinner jacket. Even sneakers won’t take this outfit down to casual, so feel free to sport any kicks you like.The trousers can be plain or patterned, from straight leg to wide-legged. Try wearing a long-sleeved tee with rolled-up sleeves over straight-legged pants. Or, wear a cropped and fitted blazer with big shoulders over high-waisted, wide legged trousers, and tuck in your tee.

, Turn a graphic tee into high fashion with an ankle- or floor-length, light-colored skirt. Wear formal shoes, and keep the tone of your accessories elegant.Pair your pastel maxi skirt with metallic or blingy flats. Or, if you’re a brave fashionista, try pretty clogs and ankle socks.Look for a skirt with a bit of volume, in a soft color like baby pink. A fabric such as chiffon or tulle would work well. If the fabric’s entirely translucent, wear a slip underneath.
For a bolder version of this look, try tucking a black and white graphic tee into a long, full skirt with a rich color like kelly green.

, Tuck in your tee and pair it with a high-waisted miniskirt. Or, if the tee is cropped, you can wear it untucked. Add a skinny belt. Try wearing wedges with this look.Try more casual looks like skirts in leather or denim. Or, wear a low-key graphic key with a bright skirt like sunny yellow or cobalt blue.

, For example, wear palazzo pants. You can opt for micro-print like cheetah, or a large, safari print. If you have a pair of palazzo pants that have a matching belt or sash, even better!Palazzo pants look great in any solid color as well. Your shirt and pants can have similar colors or be mismatched. Try adding a denim jacket and/or a crop top.

, If the shirt is long enough, wearing it as a dress glams up the look. This looks great with tall boots, such as plush black boots that stop just under the knee.This look looks chic with extra-long pendant necklaces. You can also dress up a scoop-neck tee with a choker necklace.
Wear an overcoat to give you added length in the back. Or, achieve a similar affect with a hi-lo graphic tee.

Wear a fedora.,
Pile on the jewelry.,
Hold a fancy handbag.,
Add a scarf.",How to Dress Up a Graphic Tee3," It can be a wide-brimmed fedora, but doesn’t have to be. Pop on some sunglasses to pump up the chic factor!


Try matching your fedora to another part of your outfit. For example, wear a light gray fedora with light gray pants, or match a black fedora to black pants and/or shoes.
Wear long, metallic necklaces, such as long gold, to compliment the tee and fedora.

, Tastefully, of course. Wear a statement necklace, chunky bracelets, or both.For a very pulled-together look, match the shade of your shoes to the metal of your jewelry.Try a collar necklace with sequin or bead details, or a necklace with crystal and resin flowers.
In lieu of a statement necklace, layer long necklaces.

, Whether it’s a large metallic purse or a blinged-out clutch, mixing an evening bag with your graphic tee is sure to dress it up. Match the bag to your shoes and/or jewelry for a purposely tasteful vibe.


Try mixing instead of matching. For example, carry a small magenta clutch with a monochromatic outfit. Or, add a silky, leopard-print bag to a bright red skirt and tucked-in tee.

, Double up an infinity scarf, so that your tee is still on full display. Choose a bold-colored scarf, like apple red.Look for scarfs with dressy accents on the fabric. For example, a scarf with fabric flowers that add texture, or a scarf with fancy beading or stud details.
Wear a bright-colored scarf with a tee that’s less loud in color, or vice versa.

Get a t-shirt.,
Wash and dry the shirt.,
Get some lace.,
Figure out where you want to put the lace, and what shape you want it to be in.,
Trace your design onto the lace, if needed.,
Cut the lace.,
Pin the lace to your shirt.,
Sew or glue the lace down.",How to Decorate a T‐Shirt2," You can use just about any type of t-shirt for this: fitted or loose, solid-colored or patterned. A shirt with a wide collar would look best, however.


In this method you will be sewing or gluing shapes made out of lace onto your shirt. If you want to add a lace hem, click here.

, This is a must if the shirt is brand new, as it will remove any starches and shrinking. T-shirts typically do not need to be ironed, but if your shirt has a lot of wrinkles in it, it would be a good idea to give it a quick pass with your iron.

, There are two types of lace that would work for this: basic lace and bridal lace. Basic lace is thin and net-like, while bridal lace usually has a raised or embroidered design. You can use either type for this project.

, The most popular places for lace trim is across one or both shoulders. The shapes are usually asymmetric and follow the pattern of the lace. Another popular design is a basic shape (such as a heart) in the center of the shirt; this only works with basic lace, however.

, If you are using basic lace, you might want to sketch your design onto it using tailor's chalk. Bridal lace typically comes on a spool and is only a few inches/centimeters wide. In this case, you simply need to figure out how long you need it to be, then mark it off with sewing pins.

, If you are using basic lace, you may notice that it has some designs on it (usually roses or leaves). Cut around these when cutting out your larger shape. If you are using bridal lace, cut around the raised or embroidered designs instead of straight through them.

, Carefully lay the lace down where you want it to be, then sew it with sewing pins.

, Sewing will take more time, but it will last longer. Gluing is quicker, but the glue will eventually wear off. It may also cause the fabric to feel a little stiff.To sew the lace on: choose a thread color that matches the thread, then sew the lace on using a straight stitch as close to the edges as you can. Remove the sewing pins when you are done.To glue the lace on: use fabric glue or liquid stitch to glue the lace on bit by bit; this way, the glue won't dry too fast. Remove the sewing pins as you work.

Overlap the side edges of the lace pieces by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then secure them with pins.You can have the back piece overlapping the front piece, or vice versa.,
Topstitch the lace down.,
Turn the shirt inside out, and trim off any excess lace, if necessary.,
Wear your shirt.",How to Decorate a T‐Shirt3," The best type of shirt to use for this would be a loose-fitting shirt. If you want to use a fitted t-shirt, make sure that you get some stretchy lace, or you won't be able to take the shirt on and off.

, This is a must if the shirt is new, because it will get rid of any starches and shrinking. Most t-shirts don't need to be ironed, but if your shirt has lots of wrinkles, it would be a good idea to iron it.

, Once you have decided on the width, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to that measurement. This will be for the inside hem.

, The lace needs to be long enough to wrap around the bottom hem of your shirt, plus a few inches. Here is what you need to do:Measure across the bottom hem of your shirt, from left to right.
Multiple that number by 2. This will give you enough lace for the back of your shirt.
Add 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) for the side seams.

, Each piece should now be the same length as the bottom hem of your shirt, plus 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).


If your lace has a design on it, consider trimming the side edges to follow that design. Be careful not to trim more than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) off of either side., Tuck the lace inside the shirt so that the hem overlaps it by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Pin the lace in place, then flip it over, and repeat the process for the back with the other piece of lace. Do not turn the shirt inside out for this.


Don't worry if the lace goes past the hem's stitching; you can always trim it down later.

, In either case, make sure that it is the same on both sides (left and right) of the shirt.

, Most t-shirts will have two lines of topstitching along the hem; try your best to follow one of them using a thread color that matches your shirt. Remove the sewing pins as you sew.


If the lace has some stretch to it, consider using a stretch stitch instead.
For a more professional finish, use a thread color that matches your shirt, and a bobbin color that matches your lace. This way, the stitching won't be visible on both sides.

, Some shirts have a much narrower bottom hem. You may have some excess lace peeking over the top of your stitching. If this is the case, trim that excess lace off as close to the stitching as you can. When you are done, turn the right-side out.

, At this point, your shirt is ready to wear! If you notice that the lace is starting to fray at the edges, you can seal it with some fray-check glue or clear nail polish. It would be best to hand-wash this shirt, and to let it hang dry.

, Holding a tape measure at the base of your neck, measure from that point to a couple of inches below your shoulder on the opposite side.


Round down by 1 or 2 centimeters, and then divide that number in half.

, Measure from the shoulder of your shirt (about 2 inches away from the collar) to the front center of the shirt. Mark the point where your measurement (divided by two) aligns with the original marking you made in the center of the collar. Mark just above the tape measure at that point and at the starting point (0).

, Making sure you are only cutting the top layer, make a circular cut from the shoulder to the center of the shirt where you made your mark. Now, make a horizontal cut at the starting point to release the collar and create a flap.








, Use it as a template to continue cutting the other side of the T-shirt. Again, make sure you are only cutting the top layer of the T-shirt.








, For the back of the shirt, only cut along the hem of the collar. Making a scooped cut in the back of the shirt will make the hole too large and the shirt will hang too low off of your shoulder.








, Cut the hems off of each sleeve and the bottom of the T-shirt.

Cut your t-shirt into a crop top.,
Make a tank top or muscle tee.,
Create a wider neckline.,
Cut slits into the sides or back.,
Make shoulder cutouts.",How to Cut a Tshirt Cute1," Simply cut off the bottom of a t-shirt to make it shorter if it is too long, or make it into a crop top length. Cut evenly all the way around the bottom of the shirt to accomplish this.


Each t-shirt will be different depending on the size and how it fits on your own body. Cut away a smaller amount than you think you want, then try it on. Make additional cuts if you want it shorter, and keep trying it on to check the length.
You can also create a pattern at the hem of your t-shirt, whether or not you cut it shorter for a crop top. Try cutting strips for a fringe hemline, or cut shapes like diamonds just above the hemline for a cute cutout look.;
, Convert a t-shirt to a tank top or muscle tee. Cut along the arm hole seams for a regular tank top, or further down the sides of the shirt for a wide-armed muscle tee look.You may also want to cut a wider neckline for a classic tank, but this is not necessary.
For a muscle tee, you can cut in a straight or slightly angled line down from the shoulder to the side of the shirt. Try it on between cuts to make sure you like how much of the side is open.
You can also cut all the way down through the bottom hemline of the shirt and tie the ends together at the bottom for a cute side-tie look., Cut off the collar of any t-shirt to make it wider or just get rid of the typical crew neckband. Remember to cut less at first, then try it on to check the neckline before cutting any more.


To make sure the front and back of your neckline are symmetrical, fold the shirt so that the shoulder seams line up and the neckband is folded evenly on itself. Then cut below the band, following the original curve of it.Create a v-neck neckline by folding the shirt in the same way with the shoulder seams lined up. Then use a diagonal cut for the front part of the shirt so that it ends in a point instead of a curve.

, Make “fish gills” in the sides of a shirt by simply cutting even horizontal strips down each side. Or create the same effect by making the strips down the back of the shirt instead.


Stretch out the slits after cutting to make the fabric relax and roll up slightly. Anywhere you create slits will provide some extra stretch in the fabric, which is a great way to make a too-small t-shirt fit a little better.You can also make slits vertically just to the inside of the front or back of your neckline to create more interest and stretch in those areas as well.

, Create an easy peek-a-boo shoulder by simply cutting a half circle out of each arm of the t-shirt. This will create a round cutout shape on the shoulders when worn.


Lay the t-shirt flat and find where the shoulder seams meet with the arm hole seams. This is where you will make a cut on each side.
Cut a piece out of one shoulder, then save the piece you cut away and lay it on the other shoulder to use as a guide. This will ensure both sides look even."

Dip a rag in the solution, and wring it out some. Dab it on the jacket. You don't want to rub, as that can leave marks.You just want to dab so that you don't get much water on the jacket. Hang it to dry when you're done.;
, If you get a small pen mark on your leather or vinyl, use a bit of rubbing alcohol. You can apply it using a bit of rag or a cotton swab. Dab it on, and then dry it quickly with a hair dryer on the lowest heat setting., If water dries in one spot on your jacket, you're likely to end up with a stain. To remove it, you need to dry it at as a whole, which means you need to use a cloth to lightly dampen the whole thing. Hang it up to dry., Cornstarch can absorb oil so that the leather/vinyl doesn't, so sprinkle some on as soon as you spill if possible. Let it sit for five minutes or so before brushing it off. You can use it on old stains, too. Just rub it in with your fingers so that the heat helps get rid of the oil., If something spills on your jacket that is liquid, try to absorb as much as you can first. Blot at it with a clean cloth to pick up the liquid. Keep dabbing until you've gotten as much as you can., If you get an oil, grease, or sauce stain on your jacket, start by scraping at the top of the stain with a butter knife, which removes some of the grease. Next, use a lint-free cloth to blot the stain with mineral spirits., For other stains, start by dabbing the area with white spirits. After dabbing with mineral spirits, use a solution of diluted vinegar (try half white vinegar and half water) to dab the stain. You can also follow with rubbing alcohol instead of vinegar.This process will work on a number of stains, including ink, egg, and milk.

, For a coffee stain, start with a cloth (lint-free) dipped in a solution of half rubbing alcohol, half white vinegar. Dab the stain with the cloth to moisten it. Press a clean cloth up against the stain to absorb it.You can also use this method for tea, chocolate, or coffee with milk, but you need to dab the edges with mineral spirits first.

, If you get blood on the wool, first use a damp sponge or cloth to absorb as much as you can. Next, apply pure white vinegar to the stain, dabbing at it. After the vinegar, use clean (lint-free) cloth with cool water., If the liner is coming up with a smell, try hand cleaning just that part. Add a single tablespoon of laundry detergent or mild soap to four cups (about a liter) of water. Swish it around to mix it up. Dampen a cloth with it, then wipe down the lining with the solution. Focus on smelly areas, such as armpits. Use a clean cloth with water to rinse off the liner., If the jacket has developed a smell, try deodorizing it. The best way to deodorize it is to put it in an airtight container with a deodorizer. For instance, you can use kitty litter, baking soda, or even activated charcoal. Leave the jacket there for at least a day, but you may need to leave it longer to completely get rid of the smell., Another possibility for deodorizing the jacket is using indirect sunlight. For instance, hang it near a window in your house, but don't let the direct sunlight hit it. The sunlight may help deodorize the jacket., Button the jacket with the inside out. That will help protect the leather from the washing machine.

Also, skip the spin cycle if possible.

, Add the detergent to a sink with water, and gently swirl the jacket in. Try not to agitate it. Rinse it by putting it in the same sink with clean water, preferably at the same temperature., It's likely best to air dry the jacket by laying it flat. First, wipe down the leather to dry it out as much as possible. Lay the jacket on a towel with the inside out so it can dry properly. It may help to blow dry the lining a bit to dry it out.Some people recommend drying the jacket inside-out in the dryer on medium. However, that could damage the wool. If you do, be sure to check it every 10 minutes or so. You may need to stretch the sleeves a bit as it dries to make sure they stay the same length."

Cut vertical slits along the collar for a neckline weave.,
Pull the second piece of fabric through the first.,
Weave each piece through the loop before it.,
Weave the sides or back of your t-shirt.",How to Cut a Tshirt Cute2," Cut small slits all the way around below the collar band of a t-shirt to create a woven pattern. Make sure the cuts are evenly spaced and perpendicular to the neckline.


The slits should be about 2 inches (5 cm) long. Make the first slit where you want to start half as long as the rest, as it will begin to open up into a hole during this process.
The slits should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from one another, but this measurement does not need to be exact.
When you’re done cutting, stretch out the fabric on either side of where you cut to make it easier to manipulate.

, Pick up the piece of fabric between the first two cuts you made. Pull the second piece of fabric under and over the first piece, creating a loop.


Start where you made your smaller cut. Your first slit will be pulled open into more of a hole by the weaving process, so it’s best to start with a smaller slit if possible.
To create more of a braided look, pull the second piece of fabric under the first, then twist it once before moving onto the next step., Take the third piece of fabric and pull it under and up over the loop you created with the first two pieces. Continue pulling the next piece through the current loop until you’ve reached the end.


Remember to twist each loop once before you pull the next piece through it to create more of a braided look if you choose to do so.
When you reach the end and you have a final loop with nothing to pull through it, cut the loop in half. Tie the pieces securely to the end of your weaved fabric to secure it. Trim the ends carefully if they are too long., Choose to create a woven pattern on the sides or back of your t-shirt. Cut slits and use the same method of pulling one piece under and over the previous piece to create the pattern.


If you weave the sides, make sure you lay the t-shirt flat, with the fabric folded evenly along each side before cutting. If you weave the back, pick up the t-shirt and fold it in the opposite way, so that the arm holes line up and the side seams meet before you cut the back.
You can create a more open back with several lines of weaving by cutting longer slits all the way across the back.Or, create two different ""strips"" of slits down the back.

Cut out the neck first for a bow-back shirt.,
Make a slit across the back and gather towards the top.",How to Cut a Tshirt Cute3," Cut a 2.5 inch slit in each shoulder of your t-shirt. Lay the shirt flat and cut down from the shoulder along each arm seam to create a 5 inch total cut when unfolded.Cut away the arm seam if you find that the inside of it shows after making your slit cut.
You may also cut a wider V-shape instead of just a slit if you want more skin to show on the shoulder. However, the more fabric you leave, the more gathered and pronounced the final bow shape will be.

, Cut all the way around the bottom of the t-shirt to create one long strip. Cut this strip into smaller pieces and tie the end of each sleeve to create a bow shape.


Cut two 2.5 inch pieces from your long bottom strip to use as ties. You can make the strips longer if you wish to wrap them around several times to create a thicker middle to your bow.
Gather together the fabric at the end of your sleeve below the slit you made. Tie tightly with on of your fabric strips.
Make sure you tie the piece in the middle of each sleeve, so it makes an even fanned-out bow shape from the fabric on either side of your shoulder slits.

, Cut away from the neckline at the back of your shirt, about 4 inches from the top to create a wider U-shape. Then cut out about a 4 by 2 inch strip from the excess material to use as a tie later.The lower you cut the back of the neckline, the lower on your back the bow will be. You can always adjust this cut to be lower later, so cut less to begin.

, Make a cut all the way across the back of the shirt, 6 inches down from each armpit. Gather the fabric between this cut and the neckline and tie with your fabric strip to create the bow.


Make sure to start and end your back cut just inside the side seams of your shirt. Otherwise, the cut can grow wider around the sides of the shirt.Tie the bow together securely at the center of the gathered fabric with the scrap that you cut from the neckline piece. Wrap the piece around several times if the fabric allows.

Hang the shirt to dry and check for crystallized bleach.,
Rinse the shirt in cold water once it is completely dry and free of crystallized bleach.",How to Bleach a Shirt3," This is a quick and easy DIY project that only requires a few materials.


A shirt
Bleach
A stencil (pre-made or homemade)
Spray adhesive
Spray bottle
A paper towel

, Make sure that it is clean and without wrinkles so that the bleach spraying comes out correctly.It is recommended to lay down a tarp, an old bed sheet, or some other protector if you are working on carpet.

, Make sure that the piece of cardboard that you choose is large enough to cover the width and height of the shirt.The cardboard should be visible in the neck of the shirt and should extend all the way to the bottom hem of the shirt. It should also cover as much of the width of the shirt as possible.
Again flatten the shirt to remove wrinkles once you have slid the cardboard inside.

, There are a couple of different ways to do this, depending on the type of stencil you are using.If it is a pre-made stencil, you can attach it by lightly spraying spray adhesive onto the back of it. Then, set it on the shirt and firmly press down around all of the edges.
If you make your own stencil, you want to be sure to cut it out of adhesive vinyl. Then, again, you can set it on the shirt and press down firmly.
Transfer your stencil to transfer paper if it has loose pieces (such as eyes, dots, et cetera) by pressing the transfer paper on top of your stencil. Then, carefully remove the stencil from the paper backing. After that, press the stencil on your shirt, firmly press down around the edges, and gently peel up the transfer paper.

, Then, set the spray bottle to a super fine mist. You do not want it on a larger mist or spray because it will make a mess and reach areas of the shirt that you do not want bleached.Diluting the bleach is not necessary.
Examine how big your mist is by testing the spray on a spare piece of cardboard. Spray the cardboard, with the spray bottle held about 6-8 inches away, and determine if the mist is appropriate.

, Remember you are only trying to mist the shirt and not soak it, so just a few sprays all around the area of the stencil will suffice.Hold the spray bottle about 6-8 inches away from the shirt.

, If you do have any large drops of bleach, quickly blot the whole sprayed area with a paper towel to clean them up to avoid large bleach spots., During this time, the sprayed areas may change to another color before lightening to a lighter shade of the shirt's color. This is just the bleach working through pulling out the color.Do not spray more bleach until you are sure that the color is done changing.

, Be sure to give the two minutes of wait time before doing this.


Generally speaking, you do not want to completely bleach the area to white. You are just aiming for a lighter shade of the shirt's color (e.g. for a red shirt, the spots will fade to pink).

,, The bleach will crystallize on the shirt if you were a little too heavy with the bleach spray. You will notice it as a fine powder on the shirt.Put the shirt through a cycle in the dryer for about 30 minutes if you notice crystallized bleach. Do not wash it, as the water will cause the bleach to reactivate and further bleach your shirt.

, Then, you can hang it to dry. Finally, you will be able launder the shirt as usual without fear of ruining your design."

Pour bleach into a glass container or measuring cup.,
Dip a folded-up rag or sponge into the bleach.,
Blot the shirt all around the design.,
Wait for the bleach to take effect.,

Remove the rags or cardboard and rinse the shirt in cold water.,
Dry the shirt accordingly.",How to Bleach a Shirt4," A few items are required for safely bleaching designs into cotton t-shirts.A shirt in a dark or bright color
Bleach
Rags or cardboard
An object to block the bleach, such as duct tape or adhesive vinyl
Rubber gloves

, Protect the surface with a tarp, old bed sheet, or other protector, if necessary.

,


Make sure that the rags or cardboard cover the inside of the shirt all the way up to the neck and all the way down to the bottom hem of the shirt. They should also cover the shirt's width.

, You can create a design by cutting shapes or a stencil out of the adhesive vinyl, or you can create a pattern with duct tape. Here are some ideas:


A name or title
A geometric shape
A piece of fruit, vegetable, or other food item
A criss-cross pattern
A zig-zag pattern

, Locate where on the shirt you want the design to sit (i.e. the middle, the top left, et cetera).


Gently lay the design on the shirt where you want it. Press firmly down on all of the edges to secure the duct tape or adhesive vinyl.
Consider transferring your stencil, if that is what you used, to transfer paper if it has loose pieces (such as eyes, dots, et cetera) by pressing the transfer paper on top of your stencil. Then, carefully remove the stencil from the paper backing. After that, press the stencil on your shirt, firmly press down around the edges, and gently peel up the transfer paper.

, Pour as much as you think you will need. You can add more later, if you find that you need to do so.

, Each will create a slightly different look, depending on what you want the design to look like.The rag will make clean edges around the design, while the sponge will make fuzzy edges.
Be sure to put on your rubber gloves before starting to handle the bleach for this step.

, Use the rag or sponge to gently blot the bleach all around the design, so that the areas behind the design stay colored and everything else becomes bleached.


If bleach bleeds into the area behind the design, you can touch it up later with a fabric-marker in the correct color., It may take up to a few minutes for the bleach to pull out all of the color.


If the fading is not to your liking, you can blot around the design with bleach again to make it even lighter. Keep in mind that it will take longer to bleach the shirt lighter, so be sure you are prepared with enough time.

, When the design has been bleached to your satisfaction, gently peel up the design from the shirt.


Drying your rubber gloves on old clothing or fabric before touching the shirt again will be helpful to avoid accidental bleach spots from any bleach that got on your gloves.

, Carefully pull out the rags or cardboard from in between the layers of the shirt. Immediately move the shirt to a sink to rinse it under cold water.


Rinsing the shirt stops the bleaching process.

, You can either put it in the dryer or hang it to dry, depending your preferences or the shirt's instructions.


You can launder it as usual after this, if you would like.
The shirt will now be ready to wear.

For a job interview, the traditional choices are conservative colors. White is the preferred color among business types. Off white, light gray, or light blue are also safe colors to choose from. First impressions at job interviews are key, so you will want to look professional without making a ""splash.""
If you are looking to project a more lively image at a party or bar, choose bright or unconventional colors. Bright greens and oranges are relatively popular, as is pink. While you might not want to turn off the people you are hanging out with, you do want to stand out among the crowd.
Most people work in business casual situations. These often require people to ""dress up"" while not being so formal. Plaid options are generally best here; shirts mixing together two or three colors which blend well together (such as blue, green and gray).;
, Solid colors are considered wardrobe staples because they are easiest to match, but you might consider choosing subtle stripes or a plaid pattern. Different patterns are more appropriate for particular circumstances.


Solid shirts are versatile in that you can wear virtually any tie with them (solid or patterned). If you have a high-level business position, or are going out on a date, solid colors like white, black, gray, or light blue are most appropriate.
Patterned shirts are a bit more difficult to match with ties. These shirts are more appropriate for lower level office jobs, partying, or walking around outside.
While thick, bold colored plaid shirts are better for casual settings, there are some exceptions to the rule. Shirts with subtle stripes, or pinstripes, can be worn in higher-level circumstances like office work, or going to a funeral/wedding.
If you are planning on wearing a patterned tie, wear a solid color shirt. When ties and shirts are both patterned, the outfit can become gaudy and distracting, The two major types of collars are point (standard) and spread collars. Each of these collars creates a different effect, and are designed for different shaped bodies.


A standard point collar is the most common type of collar (95%) where the collar edges point downward at a 60 degree angle, and there is little space between the section where the collar meets. Standard collars are designed to help elongate a face that is more rounded, drawing the viewer's eyes downward.
A spread collar is a bit more modern and is considered by some to be youthful and lively. The points of the collar have been ""cut away,"" the collars point downward at 90 degree angles, and there is more space between the section where the collar meets. This collar keeps the viewer's eyes on the face of the person wearing the shirt. Persons with longer faces can use this collar to create the effect of having a more rounded face.If you want to showcase more of the upper part of your tie, spread collars are a great option. The ""hipster"" look also takes advantage of the spread collar. However, most standard department stores only carry the standard collar. If you want to buy a shirt with a spread collar, look for stores that function solely as clothing stores such as J.Crew and Men's Warehouse., The three major types of fits for dress shirts are slim, athletic, and broad (traditional). Each of these different fits are meant for persons with different bodies shapes, sizes, and preferences.


Put the shirt on and tuck it in. With a few fingers, tug at the sides and the back of the shirt. Feel how much fabric is in excess, if any at all.
A slim fit or tailored fit dress shirt is slightly tighter around the chest and sides. There is almost no excess fabric around the back and sides. This type of fit is great for persons who are skinny, or for those who are going for a more modern look.
Athletic cut shirts have a full chest (traditional amount of fabric) but are tapered at the waist. Persons who work out tend to have problems finding dress shirts that allow room for their more muscular chest and arms. Athletic fit shirts give you that room, while also lacking much of the excess fabric in traditional fit shirts.
Broad fit shirts have the traditional amount of fabric which tends to hang out after you have tucked your shirt in. These shirts give the person more breathing room, and make it easier to walk/move around. Often times, persons who are bigger in size tend to find these shirts to their liking.

, The weave of a dress shirt is a combination of thickness in thread, and how tight those threads are woven together. The four major types of weaves are broadcloth, oxford, pinpoint, and twill.


These can be hard to detect by yourself without a professional. If you have a magnifying glass, you will be able to see the weave stitch. Otherwise, ask a professional to tell you what the weave of a particular shirt is.
Broadcloth shirts have thin yarn woven tightly together. These are smooth in texture and have a crisp appearance. Broadcloth shirts are generally worn at professional gatherings, and at high-level places of business.
Oxford shirts have a ""basket"" weave; one where the yarns are woven vertically and horizontally, crossing one another. These shirts are generally cheaper because of the yarn that is used. Oxford shirts can be used in more formal settings, or going to a semi-formal party/gathering.
Pinpoint shirts also use a ""basket"" weave but are woven together with finer yarn than oxford shirts. These shirts are generally heavier that broadcloth shirts. These can be used for both formal settings, and going out to bars/dinner.
Twill shirts have a ""diagonal ribbing"" pattern. These shirts are softer and yet heavier to the touch. They wrinkle less than most other shirts, but are hard to get stains out of. Twill shirts can be used for both formal and informal gatherings, Cotton or linen are the most common types of fabrics used for dress shirts. Each is used for different purposes and create very different feelings against your skin.


Linen is a very strong fiber, can absorb liquid at a rate of 20%, and allow for air to move easily. Linen is crisper than cotton, and becomes softer through the handling of the fabric. Because linen shirts retain heat, they are more appropriate for the fall and winter months. These shirts are used for more informal settings such as a party, or going outside.
Cotton is a strong fiber as well, with a liquid absorbency rate of 25%, and is very soft. These can be used in all seasons, and are more appropriate for formal settings such as a place of business.Check the tag of the shirt to find out if it is 100% cotton. If it is not, there are generally polyester threads mixed in. Some people can have very serious allergic reactions, and for that you should see Part 2 Step 2, and the warnings at the bottom of this article.

, If you are shopping at a retailer, most salespeople can help you find your neck size and sleeve length by using measuring tape. The chart below displays a guideline for common neck sizes and approximate sleeve lengths, determined by normal shirt size.


If you have your own soft, fabric measuring ruler, you can measure the length of your sleeves and size of your neck before you go in to buy a shirt. It is generally better to do this with a friend or relative.
To measure your neck size, stand upright. Have a friend pull the measuring tape around your neck at the level of your Adam's apple (make sure your friend does not choke you). Your friend, or yourself, should be able to fit two fingers comfortably between your neck and the measuring tape. Write down the number in inches, as most clothing stores uses inches as a standard measuring formula.
To measure your sleeve length, stand upright. Place your hand on your hip, so that your elbow/arm is bent at a 90 degree angle. Have a friend measure from the center back of your neck, down your shoulder, along the arm, all the down to your wrist. Write this number down in inches as well.
For further instruction on this, you can visit Measure Your Neck Size and Sleeve Length.

, Irregular stitching generally indicates high quality. Machine sewn fabrics will have uniform stitch lines.


Inspect the seam running down the side of the shirt. A high-quality garment has only one line of stitching visible on the side seam, while most shirts have two visible rows of stitches. Also check whether or not the stitches are uniformly distant from one another, or the pattern is irregular.
Another thing to check are the buttons running down the front of the shirt. Generally speaking, buttons sewn on by a machine will be loose, or some of the thread might already be coming undone. Another thing to check is the button holes themselves. Make sure the stitching of the button holes are bound tightly together.
In each case, use your fingers to grab at the stitch line of the shirt, or one of the buttons/button holes. Gently tug, twist, and move it up and down. If you already feel as if the stitches are about to come undone, or that they are loose, you will want to stay away from that shirt.

, This button is usually not there in lesser quality shirts. The gauntlet button allows for the use of less fabric, and a tighter fit for a person wearing the shirt.Gauntlet buttons make it easier for you to roll up/down your sleeves when you feel it is appropriate. Shirts with gauntlet buttons would be great to wear on a hot summer day, where you can roll the sleeves up and enjoy the outdoors more comfortably.
Cheaper, or lesser quality shirts might have the gap in fabric, but no gauntlet button. If you cannot afford a higher priced shirt, you can always attach a simple basic button to the area where the gauntlet button should be .

, The yoke of the shirt is the panel of fabric which runs along the back of your shirt, near your shoulders. A ""split yoke"" will have two pieces of fabric sewn together on an angle, rather than one singular piece of fabric.


Turn your shirt around so you are looking at the back of it. At, or near, the shoulder area you should find a rectangular shape of fabric stitched into the shirt. If the center of this piece of fabric has stitching, and comes upward at an angle, your shirt has a ""split yoke.""
The ""split yoke"" shirt design shows a level of higher quality. If your shirt is striped, there is an added benefit to having a ""split yoke"" shirt: the stripes will run parallel to the ""yoke"" seam, creating a more crisp look.
""Split yoke"" shirts also give the person more room to move around in. This is because the stretches more length wise, towards your shoulders., Ply count is how many different yarns are sewn together to make the threads used for the shirt fabric. This can sometimes be found on the shirt label.


Single-ply shirts are more softer textured and delicate. Two-ply shirts are more tough, but weigh more.Thread count (amount of threads per square inch) is also important. For example, if you buy a two-ply shirt, you will want around a 120 thread count. When the thread count starts to rise, especially for two and three-ply shirts, the shirt can become bulky, and uncomfortable. This can be found simply by looking on the tag of the shirt, or asking a clothing professional in a store.
Single-ply shirts are great for more moderate, to warm temperate zones. Two-ply shirts are generally better for breezier, and colder areas. Finer dress shirts are made of two-ply instead of single-ply., Shirts that are wrinkle-free, perspiration proof, shrinkage free, or water resistant are all laced with special chemical agents (see the next step for potential allergic reactions). Each of these can change the quality and feel of the shirt.


Check the tag of the shirt to see whether there is a notice about any added chemicals, or special ability (such as water resistant) of the shirt. If the tag does not contain this information, make sure to check with a clothing professional before you buy the shirt.
Wrinkle-free shirts have a mixed record when it comes to actually being wrinkle-free. While in general the wrinkle-free shirts do have less wrinkles in them, the shirts are looser around the body. This is because the chemical agent added to the shirt changes the nature of the fabric. Shirts that do not contain this chemical are better suited for business jobs, as they fit better, and present a more crisp look. Wrinkle-free clothes are better for a more casual setting.Perspiration proof, water resistant, and shrinkage free shirts also contain chemicals which alter the fabric of the shirt. Once more, there also mixed reports about their ability to combat such problems. The only way to find out if they actually work is to test them. Working out in them, spilling water on them, or washing them can tell whether the shirts are what they claim to be.

, Chemicals, added agents, or fabrics made with two or more different cloths can sometimes cause people to have an allergic reaction. Sometimes this information is added to the tag of the shirt, but you should also ask a professional.


Check with your doctor that your list of known allergens that you have bad reactions to is up to date. Ask your doctor whether he or she has any advice/medical fix to your allergies.
Any shirt that is created with a synthetic fabric can be laced with chemicals and dyes that are impossible to wash out. Almost all dress shirts are treated with some type of chemical before they are shipped out of the factory. Wrinkle-free, perspiration proof, and anti-shrinkage shirts all have the potential to contain some sort of chemical or dye. Make sure to check the tag on the shirt, and ask a professional for help.Beyond asking a clothing professional for help, you can do some things on your own to check. Make sure to smell the shirt before you buy it. Sometimes shirts can get mixed up, or thrown in with other items that might be harmful to you. You can also gently scratch at the surface of the shirt to see if the shirt has been polluted or contaminated in any way.

, Your sleeves should be long enough so that the cuffs do not ride up your wrist when you move your arm. The cuffs of the shirt should also not go past the first inch of your hand. You can use a ruler to measure whether there is too much extra sleeve length, and how much the shirt needs to be taken in.

, They should not hang over your hand. You should not be able to slip into shirt sleeves without first undoing buttons on the cuff. Run two fingers underneath the cuffs. If two fingers can fit comfortably under the cuff, then they are too large.

, They should be well-placed, with no gaping holes exposing your chest. Slip your four fingers and thump between each button. If your hand slides through, the buttons are too far apart.

, Breath in and out naturally, to see whether or not there is enough loose fabric. Keep your legs straight, as you slowly move your upper body forwards and backwards. If the shirt is cutting at your chest, you will want a shirt with a tad bit more fabric.

, Check that shirt tails do not come out of your pants. Bend your upper body sideways and backwards. If your shirt slips out of your pants, this can be embarrassing in the future. Also make sure to check your belt, and make sure it is tight enough to hold your shirt in.

, You should be able to slide two or three fingers between your neck and collar. Slide them from side to side, all the way around your neck. Make sure that while wearing your breathing is not becoming elevated. You will want to be able to breathe naturally and comfortably.

Remove the old onesie from the child.,
Use the ankle-hold technique, as you push back the one side of the onesie that is laying on the changing surface, up and underneath the child back.,
Remove the garment like a t-shirt on the child.,
Place the new onesie on your child.,
Pull both the front portion of the snaps and the snaps underneath the child until the garment can easily be fitted from the front and back to better situate the garment.

,
Snap the garment in place using the fasteners which should be in or near the child's diaper area/groin, using the process in the reverse order as what was described above.

,
Clean up the area.",How to Change a Onesie on an Infant or Young Toddler," In order to avoid creating temperature and safety situations for your child, always prepare the garment before you bring the child to the changing area, unless the changing area is on the floor or ground where the child can't fall or hurt themselves in some way.


Undo the snaps that are generally located in the groin area of the garment. Pull upwards firmly on the folded downwards side of the snaps and push a tiny bit inwards of the other to steady the advance of the snaps. This should make the onesie snap adjustment a little quicker.;
, Make sure any other clothing that you dressed your infant in(if any) on top of the onesie, has been removed and set to the side. Bring the child over to the changing area and grab the onesie. The onesie will need a bit more work to prepare it in the next step, but it's not too hard to get the new one ready.

, Unsnap the snaps from the onesie. To help, you may gently push on the side that lays closer to the diaper until the front snaps have unsnapped themselves from the old garment.

, If they are old enough and can stand without needing too much help, they can stand up instead.

, Put your hands into the garment, and remove the child's hands and arms one at a time, pulling the arms inwards. Once the hands and arms are done, work on the child's head so the onesie will cause the least discomfort later (babies don't like their face ever covered, and the path of least resistance should be observed when removing. When removal of the old one is complete, place the old onesie to the side and grab the new onesie in hand.

, Work on the face first, much like taking it off (put your hands up through the neckpiece of the garment and extend your fingers so the face opening is least obtrusive and can give your child some comfort in reasoning that it won't feel any bit tight. Remove your hands from around the neck area. Work on placing the child's arms and hand inside each of the proper holes inside the garment. Pull the rest of the garment down until it forms much like a t-shirt would on the child.

Have some basic tank tops for easy layering and pairing.,
Have some dressy, embellished tank tops if you like to dress up or go out.,
Have some casual tank tops with different prints and light embellishments for more specific outfits.",How to Wear Tank Tops1," Most bra straps won't fit under thin, spaghetti straps. The extra pair of straps also won't always look good. A bandeau or strapless bra will give you the support you need without drawing attention to your tank top.If you can't find a strapless bra that fits, try getting one with clear straps instead.
If you are going to be wearing another shirt or cardigan over your tank top, then you can wear any bra you want.;
, This means that they will reveal the shape of standard, underwire bras, which may not look very flattering. Instead, opt for a wireless, seamless bra. It will blend with your torso, and appear ""invisible"" under your tank top.

, The larger bust size you have, the more support you need. This means that a strapless bra may not give you the support you need, and that you will have to wear a regular, strapped bra. If you have to wear a strapped bra for support, you will need to wear a tank top with wider straps to conceal the bra. , In general, the wider your shoulders are, the wider straps you should look for. This will help make the tank top look more proportionate on you. Thin, spaghetti straps will make your shoulders look even wider than they actually are. On the other hand, if you have narrow shoulders, you might want to consider thinner straps instead. Thick straps will make your shoulders look even narrower., If you have a large chest, choose a tank top whose neckline ends right above your cleavage. This will help draw attention towards other important features, such as your pretty face and eyes. If you have a small chest, choose a tank top with detail, such as ruching, pleating, or ruffles, along the neckline. This will give the illusion of a larger chest.

, If you have narrow shoulders, choose a tank top with a rounder or straighter neckline. Also, consider tops in bright colors or horizontal prints. If you have wide shoulders, choose a tank top with a V-neck or a low scoop neck. This will help make your body look longer and narrower. Also, consider plain tops in darker colors or vertical prints.

, Basic tank tops are plain and solid-colored. They can go with just about anything, and are perfect for layering. Try getting them in neutral colors, such as black, white, or grey, or in earth tones, such as brown, tan, or olive green.Some plain tank tops will have lace along the neckline and bottom hem. These are perfect for layering under fitted shirts. The tank top itself won't be visible, but the lace will peek out from beneath the neckline and/or bottom hem.

, These tank tops usually have some lace, sequins, beading, or ruffles. They are dressy enough for work, and perfect for dates and special nights out. When paired with the right accessories and jewelry, they can make even the simplest pair of pants or skirt more dress., They are not as plain as basic tank tops, but not as fancy as dressy tank tops. Some have prints, while others have simple beading along the neckline. They rang in styles from babydolls to racerbacks. They can be formfitting, or have loose, asymmetrical hems. To make your outfits truly unique, choose some with specific details, such as: are: ruffles, crocheted lace, or tribal prints."

For a more polished look, opt for a plain white or black blazer with a solid-colored tank top. For something more summery, opt for a jacket/blazer with a pattern or bold embellishment., Leave it unbuttoned so that the tank top is visible underneath it. This is perfect for cooler days, and for extending your summer wardrobe into the fall and winter.

, You can wear a woolen vest or even a leather one. Whether you choose to button it up or leave it unbuttoned is up to you.Be sure to choose a color that complements your tank top and the rest of your outfit. Neutral colors, such as black or grey, go well with most other colors.

, The best tank tops for this sort of layering have some sort of lace either along the neckline or bottom hem. When worn under a regular shirt, the body of the tank top will not be visible. Only the lace will peek out from behind the upper shirt for a girlish, feminine touch.


Try to use a neutral color for at least one of the shirts. For example, you could wear a pink tank top under a creamy-white shirt, or a white tank top under a navy shirt.

, This will help cover private areas that you don't want people to see, such as your bra. You can match the color of the tank top to the shirt, or use a contrasting color.

The tank top will absorb your body sweat and oils, and protect your nicer shirt from getting stained to some extent.


Plain, cotton tank tops are usually cheaper than fancy dress shirts made from expensive silks; they are also easier to clean.

Add a pop of color and texture with jewelry.,
Tie a scarf around your neck for color, coverage, and style.,
Go big with a big handbag.,
Add a cute belt for color, or to break up monotony.,

Pair tank tops with high-waisted shorts for a touch of chic and glamour.,
Pair tank tops with any length of skirt.,
Pair tank tops with leggings carefully.",How to Wear Tank Tops3," Tank tops are relatively simple, but you can make them look more interesting with some bold jewelry. The tank top's plainness will balance out even the chunkiest piece's gaudiness. Try large, hoop earrings, chunky bracelets, or long, dangling necklaces.Jewelry will make tank tops made from fancier materials, such as lace or silk, appear even fancier than they actually are. This is a great option for special events.

, If you find that the tank top doesn't cover all of your cleavage, tie a scarf around your neck to help hide it. Choose a patterned scarves made from chiffon or silk. Loop it around your neck for a chic touch.


The scarf doesn't have to just stay around your neck. You can also use it as a headband, or tie it around your waist for a cute belt.
Avoid woolen scarves, or your outfit will look too wintery. The one exception to this, of course, is during winter or fall.

, Tank tops are simple, so you can get away with carrying around a large handbag. It won't detract from your outfit. Try to add some contrast, however. For example, if your tank top is solid-colored, try a handbag with a bold pattern on it. If your tank top has a pattern on it, try a plain, solid-colored handbag., If your tank top if a neutral color, such as black, grey, or white, you can bring some extra color to your outfit by wearing a brightly-colored belt about your hips. If you are wearing a loose, flowing tank top, try wearing a wide belt around your waist instead. This will cinch in the excess fabric, and make you look slimmer.


Leather, suede, and fabric belts are great for the day time. Shiny, patent leather belts are perfect for the evening.

, For a more unique outfit, wear one or two accessories that match your clothes in both style and color. If you are at a loss of what sort of jewelry to pick, try something in gold of silver; both are neutral colors that go well with most other colors.

, Finish the look off with a pair of sandals or heels. This will also help lengthen your legs.If you'd something more casual, or if you want to lengthen your torso instead, opt for regular shorts instead.

, A short skirt will give your a hit, chic look, while a midi skirt will give you a sweeter one. A long skirt will give you a more boho look, especially when paired with a wide, leather belt., The go-to color for most girls is black, but you can try other colors and patterns as well. Keep balance and contrast in mind, however. If your tank top is solid-colored, you can wear solid or patterned leggings. If your tank top is patterned, however, you will want to wear solid-colored leggings. If you pair a patterned tank top with a pair of patterned leggings, your outfit will look too busy and clash."

Prepare your supplies.,
Choose a color for your patch.,
Decide on a shape for your patch.,
Mark the sweater with tape.,
Position the foam.,
Prepare your patch.,
Stab the felting needle into the wool roving and through the sweater.,
Stab until the patch surface is flat and even.,
Patch up bare spots.,
Smooth and set the patch.",How to Make Felted Sweater Patches," To make felted patches for your sweater, you will need a 36 gauge felting needle, a piece of dense foam, some wool roving, a cookie cutter, an iron, and some tape. You can purchase all of these items at your local fabric store. If your community does not have a fabric store, you can buy the items online., Before you start felting, you will need to decide what color you’d like your patch to be. Wool roving comes in all kinds of colors. You can choose a color that matches your sweater, complements it, or contrasts with it. For example, you can use wool roving in a color that contrasts with your sweater, like yellow patches on a purple sweater.

, Once you’ve decided what color you will use, you will need to choose a shape for your patch. For example, if you are making felted elbow patches, you can use an oval cookie cutter to create an oval patch. If you want a trendy star-shaped felted sweater patch, you can make your own pattern using a piece of heavy duty cardboard. Like the color, the shape of the patch is up to you!

, Put the sweater on. Take a piece of tape and place it just above the top of where you want the patch to be located.. Take another piece of tape and place it just below the bottom of the patch position. This is where you will be placing your patch.








If you have a friend handy, ask them to place the tape for you.

, Once you’ve placed the tape, gently remove the sweater. Take a piece of thick foam and place it between the layers of your sweater. Take care to not stretch the sweater when you insert the foam. If necessary, cut the foam smaller so that it will slide more easily in between the sweater layers.








Make sure your foam is between the two layers of the sweater, not below both of them. If you place the foam under both layers, you will accidentally patch your sweater together!

, Take the cookie cutter or cardboard pattern and place it between the two pieces of tape. Cut a piece of wool roving to fit inside the cookie cutter. Spread the fibers out evenly. Your layer of wool roving should lightly cover the area. If you put too much roving in the cookie cutter or cardboard pattern, your patch will turn out thick and chunky.







, Hold the felting needle with your thumb on one side and three fingers on the other side, right above the place where the needle shaft begins to thicken. Stab vertically, up and down, making sure the needle enters and leaves the wool at the same angle.







, Use short, fast stabs, working your way around the outer perimeter of the cookie cutter or cardboard pattern first. Once the outer perimeter of the patch is flat, continue to stab the inner part of the patch until all the fibers are flat. Remove the cookie cutter or pattern, and use your needle to stab in any stray fibers., Sometimes there will be bare spots on your felted sweater patch. If this is the case, take a tiny bit of wool roving and place it over the bare spot. Then use your needle to secure the roving into place.







, Gently remove the foam from the sweater. Turn your iron on to the heat setting appropriate for wool, which is typically one of the lowest settings on a standard iron. Spritz a little water over your patch. Press the iron down on the patch to set it. Remove the iron.

Do some searching.",How to Make a Punk Rock Jacket for Under $1001," Depending upon where you live, and whether you have a computer, for some this part will be easier than for others. Do you want a leather jacket, or a jean jacket, which can be made into a jean vest? Do you want your jacket to be vintage, new, long, or short? Well whatever the case you should be able to find it for $20 to $50. There are numerous places to find a quality, yet inexpensive jacket for much less than $150 to $300.



Online Web Sites: This is, by far, the easiest and second cheapest place to find the jacket of your dreams. There are several online thrift stores and second hand shops, auction style web sites, and stores having clearance sales. You can always check out my online thrift shop: Retro Kitten Apparel, a Retro, Rockabilly, Vintage, Pin-up and Punk Second Hand Clothing Store. With online shopping, of course, you will have to pay for shipping for the jacket, but think of all the options you’ll have online, and the time and gas you’ll save!

Use keywords such as “Used Leather (or Jean) Jacket Size Large” and other variations. Remember: The more specific the search the more likely you’ll get what you want faster. Then let the search engines do the footwork.
Be careful for viruses. There are verified sites with various logos or green check marks, and even warnings telling you whether the site is safe, and be sure to have your anti-virus software up to date.



Thrift Shops, Yard Sales, and Swap Meets: These are some of the cheapest places to find your “new” jacket, which, of course, will probably be used. However, this can become costly with the high price of gas, especially for non-freeway miles, and you might end up driving all over the city and never finding the right jacket.

Check the newspaper, Craigslist, or ZZStar for yard sales, Flea Marts, Swap Meets, Church Sales, Estate Sales, etc. Contact the people who list phone numbers or email addresses, or inquire when you arrive at a sale as to whether they have a leather or jean jacket, even if they’ve listed the items that will be for sale, or you don’t see one, because maybe they forgot to list everything, or forgot they even had an old leather or jean jacket in the rafters. Maybe someone else will overhear you and speak up. This will save you time and money.



Army Surplus Store: This is the last place I would recommend, but you can find leather, jean, army, and flight jackets here. You will just need to be prepared to pay a hefty price for it. So now you have the leather or jean jacket you’ve always wanted, and, hopefully, you didn’t pay more than $50 for it! Let’s make it into your very own Punk Rock staple!;

Grab your pad of large plain white paper and your colored pencils, including regular #2 pencils, and draw your jacket in detail including every pocket, seam, button, strap, etc.,
Use your imagination.,
Begin designing your jacket with your pencils, coloring in painted areas, writing words, drawing patches and areas where material will go, etc.",How to Make a Punk Rock Jacket for Under $1002," Be sure to cover most of the paper, but leave room for an ""Idea Notes"" grid (see the tip below for using a grid). Then do the same for the back of the jacket on the other side of the paper (we want to be eco-friendly don’t we?). Then gather the items you already have that you want to use like patches, pins, etc., and let’s begin.


Use the grid to make notes. On the grid, write a headline such as Studs, then, perhaps, use a color system and put a red dot and write “pyramid stud - half”, and on your sketch draw the stud like a pyramid in red. For patches, you probably won't need the grid, because you can just draw the shape of the patch on your sketch and write the name of the patch on the sketch such as “The Addicts”.

, Ask yourself what you want your jacket to look like? How will your jacket represent you? Should it be a tribute to your favorite bands? A removable upper body tattoo? Or, just a really cool jacket made with all kinds of cool stuff? Well that’s up to you, and this the most exciting part of making your very own Punk Rock jacket.

, If you don’t like the outcome, erase and re-do, or start over fresh until you have your own perfect personal creation! Below are some ideas you can use to help brainstorm:


Get creative with your paint and paint an entire sleeve blue. Use your paint pens and draw a spiderweb on the other sleeve, maybe on the elbow. Stud the entire jacket (what a job that would be), or just the collar. Add some spikes along a seam, or intersperse them in your studs (be careful, because you don't want your jacket to hurt you while you're wearing it), add some band or symbol patches, or write band names the way they do.
Draw some skulls or symbols, or, if you aren’t a great artist, have someone else do it. It’s still your idea, and now you can help promote your friend.
Make a safety pin design, or use safety pins to hold down a patch. Use different colored thread to stitch down patches.
Lace up the side of your jacket with hand-made eyelets and leather string.

"
"
Make a list of the tools, materials, and supplies you've decided you'll need.,
Find inexpensive supplies:



Acrylic paint and paint pens: Try Office Depot or Walmart.,
Get all your supplies set up in an orderly fashion so your work station is comfortable, and your supplies are handy, then post up your sketch where you can easily reference it.

",How to Make a Punk Rock Jacket for Under $1003," Also, find a hard flat work station such as your kitchen table to put your jacket together.

, Ask for their Oops Paint, which is just paint mixed into a wrong particular color, for super cheap, but make sure it will adhere to leather such as acrylic. Also, try municipal (Metro) recycling where you can get reconstitute recycled quality paint in five or six generic colors for $5 gallon!

Patches, Pins, Badges, Spikes and Studs: Grab a patch, or a pin, from a punk show. Cut up a band tee and make a patch from the band logo, and use the rest of the t-shirt to make your own creative patches. Also, check online for cheap supplies for patches, spikes, studs, badges, and even tools.

Material: Get cool material from old clothes, thrift shops, or scrap bins at craft stores or Walmart.

Chain: “Borrow” your dog’s collar.

Thread: You can use dental floss, or fishing line, which both make sturdy thread for stitching.

Dart Awl aka hole punch: You can use a really sharp ice pick for making holes for studs instead of a Dart Awl, or use different sized nails for different sized holes and hammer them through.

Add studs.,
Do the stitching.,
Add patches.,
If you make a mistake with paint try Goo Gone from Dollar Tree, or a similar type of remover.",How to Make a Punk Rock Jacket for Under $1004," From the top side of the jacket, make the hole in the jacket and poke the spike through, or a few tiny ones and poke your pronged stud through. Then flip the jacket over and use your flat head screwdriver to press down the prongs, or screw on the backing of the spike. This is the most time consuming part of creating your jacket!

, Use a thimble to push your heavy duty needle through the tough material, and stitch anyway you want! You can use dental floss, fishing line, or thread the same way.

, Add super glue to the back of the patch before placing it onto your jacket then stitch it down, or safety pin it on. That will help keep the patch in place, and it looks more professional, if you want it to look professional.

, Sometimes, simply using a wet washcloth, or baby oil/olive oil will work.

Try it on.,
Lay the sweater out flat.,
Measure for stitching.,
Stitch down each side of the centre.,
Cut the middle join.,
Decorate.,
Add a closing mechanism.,
Resort to another use for your old sweater.",How to Save a Tight Sweater (Jumper)," This will help to give you a feel for how small the sweater has become and whether transforming it into a cardigan is a viable option. If it's too small to fit even as a cardigan, you may want to consider donating or trading it instead.;
, Smooth it out as much as you can.

, Use a tape measure to find the exact centre-line down the front of the sweater.

, Once you have marked the centre, stitch down each side of the centre join using an appropriate stitch. Choose a strong stitch, such as zigzag or serging stitch. Leave a very small gap between each line of stitching, to enable you to cut the cardigan opening.

, Using sharp sewing scissors suitable for fabric, cut the sweater in the tiny gap between the two lines of stitching, straight up (or down) the centre. The stitching from the last step will prevent any unravelling of the sweater.

, Cover over the stitching with ribbon that matches or complements the colour of the cardigan. Stitch with small, invisible stitches to attach the ribbon. If preferred, simply finish off with good, invisible stitching rather than adding ribbon. It depends on your skill and the final look that you are seeking for the cardigan.

, The closing mechanism depends on how much smaller your sweater has become. Even a brooch will suffice but here is a list of other possibilities:


In many cases, it might be best to just leave this as an ""open"" cardigan, to display pretty blouses or clean shirts underneath.






An eye and hook or a button at the top of the cardigan can be useful for keeping it together in one place. Alternatively, leave some ribbon at the top from the ribbon edging, enough to tie in a bow.






Consider inserting a ribbon or leather cord through the middle of the cardigan as a belt or sash.






Cardigan pins are fashionable also. These consist of little wooden pins (wren pins) that slide through the fabric. This might work for your new cardigan.






If there is a little give and the cardigan isn't at risk of puckering or stretching too much (not flattering to the chest area), you might like to consider buttons and buttonholes.






If there is plenty of give still, inserting a zip might be possible also. You will need to use your own judgment on this option as to what will serve your particular situation best.







, If you can't make a cardigan out of it, you might be interested in making your sweater into a purse, or a cat bed.

Stop the buckling.,
Disperse the thread.,
Continue until you can no longer see the snag.,
Smooth out the sweater with your hands.",How to Fix a Snag in a Jumper (Sweater)," A thread that has snagged will have pulled the material around it out of shape, so you'll need to gently stretch the jumper back into shape. Some of the yarn should retract into the sweater as you do this.;
,


If there is a loose thread left over, turn the jumper inside out and pull the thread back through to the reverse side, then try to smooth the snag out again.
Use a blunt needle to pull the thread through to the next stitch.
Keep pulling to the next part, dispersing the excess thread along the row.
Repeat this on the other side of the snag, carefully removing excess thread in the other direction.

, When you have gone all the way along both sides of the pulled thread, go over the row again, arranging the thread back into position.

, Turn it the right way and keep smoothing until you are satisfied with the how your jumper looks.

Choose a plain t-shirt.,
Find a good pair of fabric scissors.

,
Turn the t-shirt inside out.,
Create a V-neck if needed and wanted.,
Make the holes for the bow.,
Find a shoelace, ribbon or any other kind of tie.,
Tie the two ends in a bow.,
Done.,
If wished, add any other effects or decorations that incorporate the bow or enhance it.,
Draw in the t-shirt if needed.",How to Add a Cute Bow to a Plain T Shirt," It doesn't matter what color although choose a color you like personally.


Use one that's a size/half a size up of your normal size, if you're going to do belting, or tying in the back.;
,, Then lay it flat on the ground/table and line the seams up.

, Mark dots where you want the V-neck to be. Once you've measured up the neck, start cutting in the V formation. Hem stitch to prevent fraying after cutting.


Make sure there's no mistakes with the neckline. Adjust if needed.







, Flip the t-shirt over, and mark two dots in the middle of the t-shirt. Make these around an inch or two (2.5-5cm) apart. Then cut small holes where the dots were.

, Loop it through the two holes. Do this by sticking one end of the tie under the t-shirt, and pulling it through the hole, outwards. Then do the same with the other.

, If you'd rather a knot or a more fancy bow, tie as required (you may need to follow a bow-tying tutorial for fancier bows).

, Try the t-shirt on and check the effect in the mirror.

, For example, use fabric paint to draw the image of a person who is wearing the bow, as shown in this image. You could also add writing, more ties, etc., as your creativity inspires you to do.

, You could stitch it to make it fitted or draw it in at the back with a back tie, as wished."

Smile!",How to Look Beautiful for Your Boyfriend," Take a shower or bath and shampoo and condition your hair. While you're in there, shave your legs and armpits, if that’s something you normally do. Exfoliate your skin with a loofah to remove dead skin cells and keep your skin healthy, fresh, and gorgeous! Finally, wash your body with soap or a body wash to keep your skin smelling great.


You don’t have to wash your hair every day if it actually looks and feels better if you only wash it a few times a week. Every girl’s hair is different.;
, If you have dry hands, exfoliate them with a sugar scrub or another exfoliating soap. You can buy one from a store, or make one yourself. Simply run your hands under water, then wipe them off on a towel so that they are damp, and then put a generous amount of sugar scrub on them. Rub it around your hands, focusing on the areas that are the most dry. After you're done, rinse the scrub off, and you should have nice, soft hands.


Your boyfriend will especially love your soft hands if you hold hands a lot.

, Your boyfriend will love it if you have soft, nourished lips, especially if he's thinking about kissing you. Exfoliate your lips, and apply lip balm to hold in the moisture. Carry lip balm with you and apply it every few hours to keep your lips nice and soft.


If you think you’re about to kiss your boyfriend, though, hold off on the lip balm. You want your lips to be nice and soft when you kiss him, but if you put on lip balm right before you kiss him, then your lips may be a little too wet for his taste.

, Lock on the moisture by moisturizing your whole body. Focus on really dry areas, such as your feet, hands, and elbows, but moisturize yourself everywhere. This works especially well after getting out of the shower. If you shave your legs, make sure to moisturize them so that they're not dry. Smooth, soft, silky skin is sexy skin, and your boyfriend will love it.


You can also carry lotion around with you to reapply it throughout the day if you need to.

, Brush your teeth twice a day, floss them, and use a mouthwash to get extra-fresh breath. If you two are going to kiss, you'll want to taste minty, and not like what you ate for lunch. And when you smile, you'll want your teeth to look their best!


Chewing on gum or sucking on a mint is great before you kiss your boyfriend. Just don’t do it immediately before you kiss him, or you’ll be making your intentions a little bit too obvious.

, Pluck your eyebrows a little bit. If you shape your eyebrows already, just pluck any stray hairs. If you don't shape your eyebrows, just pluck the hairs in the middle of both your eyebrows, to avoid having a unibrow. If you don't pluck your eyebrows at all, just leave them; your boyfriend probably likes them the way that they are. Don't go crazy and overpluck! Once you do that, there’s no going back — until they grow out again, that is. Besides, some girls look better with thicker brows.


You can also line your brows with a brow pencil for an added dramatic effect.

, It doesn’t matter what you wear — what does matter is that you feel beautiful in your clothes, whether you’re wearing a little black dress or flannel and leggings. The more confident you are, the more beautiful you'll seem, as beauty and confidence go hand-in-hand. If you feel super-confident in all of your outfits, pick one that you know he likes the most. If you don’t dress up a lot and you and your boyfriend have a special occasion coming up, then wow him with a more dressy dress or a skirt and a cute top.


If you're on the bigger side, don't freak out! Pick out an outfit that shows off your gorgeous curves! Your boyfriend should like you for who you are, so embrace those curves!
If you’re looking to add some spice to your look, try wearing heels if you normally wear flats. They can make you feel taller and more confident. However, if you normally wear heels, try some flats for a change — you may feel happier and more comfortable!

, Brush or comb your hair, and then style it the way you like it best. Try out some different styles to see which one you think makes you look the most beautiful. If he's complimented your hair in a certain style, try wearing it in that style again some time, since he obviously likes it. Braid, straighten, or curl your hair for a new look. You can put it up or leave it down, depending on how you feel.


There’s no magical hairstyle that will appeal to your boyfriend the most; it’s all up to what makes you feel the most beautiful.
Don’t try something elaborate just because you think your boyfriend will really like it. It’s more important that you like it and you should think about that before you consider what he thinks.

, If you're allowed to, put on some makeup that enhances your natural beauty and brings out your best features. Go for a very simple and natural-looking makeup look, especially if you don't wear makeup very often. If you don't want to wear makeup, that's fine too; beauty doesn't come only from makeup.


If you want to put makeup on, just a bit of eyeshadow will be perfect for your lids, whether it’s a darker color like brown or a smoky black, or a lighter color like beige or light pink.
You can wear some mascara to accentuate your beauty, too. You may want to only stick to the top lid to avoid that spidery bottom-lid look. To apply mascara, place the brush below the bottoms of your lashes, and gently move it side to side and up to add volume to your lashes. If you just move it from top to bottom, your lashes may look cakey.
You can decide whether you want to wear foundation or concealer or just to try the natural look. Foundation and concealer can make your skin look more uniform and can make your makeup stand out a bit more; that said, it makes for a more dramatic look that takes time to implement.
Applying just a bit of blush to the apples of your cheeks can make your face look a bit rosier and more healthy. Just make sure you blend it thoroughly so it doesn’t look too cartoonish. If this is your first time with blush, try it for a nighttime or more formal occasion so it doesn’t stand out as much.

, Put in some special earrings, or wear a cute necklace or bracelet. If he bought you a piece of jewelry and you like it, wear that. If accessorizing isn't your thing, don't sweat it! You don’t want to look phony in a pair of earrings that really aren’t you. But if you do want to give your look that extra touch, then you can try some cute studs or small hoop earrings, a few bangles, a chunky ring, or just whatever jewelry works for you.


You can wear just one small piece of jewelry that means a lot to you. It’s all about whether or not it makes you feel beautiful, not about how many pieces of jewelry you can wear at once.

, If you really want to look beautiful to your boyfriend, then you have to know that he already thinks you’re beautiful. You don’t want to think that you’re inadequate and that you can dress yourself up with some fancy makeup and a new outfit in order to look great; you’re already beautiful and are just trying something different. You should always have self confidence to stay positive. It’s important to know that your boyfriend thinks you’re beautiful no matter what — if you have that attitude, he’ll be much more taken by your looks anyway.


If your boyfriend puts down your looks or tells you that you should lose weight or wear more makeup to look more beautiful, then he’s not in the relationship for the right reasons and it’s time to cut him loose. Your boyfriend should make you feel even better about yourself than you already do — not worse.

, Another way to look beautiful is to have a positive attitude about your life, how you look, and what you do in the world. Don’t complain too much and focus on talking about the things you’re looking forward to in life. Don’t nitpick every little thing your boyfriend or friends do and give them compliments instead. If you cultivate optimism in your life, then good things are more likely to happen to you. What’s more, you’ll be a more beautiful person because of the positive energy that you bring to the table.


Watch yourself the next time you talk to your boyfriend. If you notice yourself making a negative comment, make two positive comments afterwards to cancel it out.
You should compliment your boyfriend much more than you nag him. Positive feedback is more valuable than negative.

, Part of the attitude of a beautiful person is knowing that you’re beautiful inside and out. While you can lightly poke fun at yourself to show that you don’t take yourself so seriously, you shouldn’t talk about how fat, ugly, or dumb you are, because that will only make your boyfriend feel sorry for you. Instead, focus on accentuating the things you love the most about yourself instead of being negative all the time. If you’re too negative, then you’ll look like you’re fishing for compliments while being insecure.


It’s one thing to not take yourself too seriously and to poke fun at yourself every once in a while, and another to be so down on yourself that it makes people uncomfortable.

, You’re beautiful, and that has nothing to do with how beautiful your neighbor, best friend, worst enemy, sister, or Tyra Banks may be. You can appreciate the beauty of other women without wishing that you were more like them or feeling like you don’t have enough to offer. Focus on looking and feeling as beautiful as you can and don’t worry about anyone else; besides, your boyfriend will be much happier if you don’t waste your time talking about other women and focus on yourself.


You can compliment other women or mention how pretty or interesting another woman is when she’s not around. This will show that you’re comfortable enough with yourself to not feel competitive with every female on the planet.

, As mentioned before, confidence is very beautiful and very sexy. You can be drop-dead gorgeous, but without confidence, you're nothing. Work on your confidence, and wear things that make you feel gorgeous! Don't do anything that you're uncomfortable with, because this will bring your confidence down.


Walk in a confident way by keeping your head up. Look at him when you're talking to him.
You don’t have to be 100% in love with yourself to be confident, but you do have to work on loving who you are, and on addressing the flaws you can fix if you make that your goal. As for the rest, it’s important to accept that there are some things you can’t change about yourself (like your height) and to learn to accept them as well.

, To top it all off, smile at your boyfriend as often as you can. If you have braces, don't feel self-conscious! He's your boyfriend, so he obviously loves you for you (including your braces!). When you see him, smile at him. When you walk away from him, smile and wave. Smiling makes you look friendly, confident, and very beautiful.


Besides, it’s been proving that smiling can actually make you feel happier, so you have nothing to lose by smiling."

Learn to cook for yourself if you don't already possess this skill; it's not hard and it makes healthy eating a whole lot easier. Healthy eating will help you to keep your body in balance, which can help improve the look of your skin, keep your overall shape and most importantly, gives you sufficient energy to do all the things you pack into your day.


Sugary foods, fatty foods and processed foods should be consumed in moderation; the more you treat them like treats rather than standard fare, the better.
There are many fad diets. Rather than simply accepting them at face value, think carefully about whether the diet is truly beneficial and will actually help you. Many diets are hype and are not based on good nutrition principles. Always put your long-term health before any fad; talk to your doctor before selecting a diet.;
, Starvation leads to the body's natural instinct of hoarding fat, which can in turn cause you to gain weight and keep that weight when you eventually begin eating again. Starvation is also a form of self-harm, stoked by trying to meet beauty ideals that can sometimes err into the realm of ridiculous. Instead, focus on eating moderately and healthily; eat more protein and complex carbohydrates from unprocessed food sources, eat smaller portions and eat nutritionally-dense food over food from which all the nutrients have been stripped. Looking amazing includes feeling amazing too, something having plenty of energy will ensure. Exercise regularly; you may find it helps to do a brisk walk before mealtimes, to help stoke up your metabolism before eating.


Fasting is promoted by many people as a way to ""detoxify"" your body and lose weight quickly. Again, talk to your doctor about the benefits of fasting in your case; it is not always the right option.
Constantly aspiring to being ultra-thin can be an issue about control. If you feel that you are consumed by counting calories, weighing yourself and obsessing about wearing size 0 all the time, you might consider discussing any underlying emotional issues with a qualified therapist. There is more to life than the diet treadmill and you deserve freedom from such crushing expectations.

, It is important to find your optimal sleep range to ensure your continued well-being. For most people, the optimal amount of nightly hours for sleep is between 7 and 9 hours, with variations for age, health and personal requirements. There is no shame in needing more sleep than somebody else and it is important to recognize that many people who claim to thrive on 5 hours a night are not likely to be as healthy as someone getting more sleep. While you can push your body on less sleep for a while, the sleep deficit clocks up and will impact you later, including possible weight gain and ongoing irritability.


Get your sleep pattern set. Aim for around eight hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. Adjust either side by an hour or so, to suit your needs. Waking up feeling refreshed and having energy is a sign you're getting sufficient sleep.
Keep your bed setup simple but effective. Don't be too warm or too cold, as both extremes harm the ability to sleep well. Use comfortable bed linen and wear non-constricting nightwear to bed.
Some drinks can aid with sleeping, such as chamomile tea or warm milk. If you have ongoing sleep problems, talk to your doctor for advice.

, Give yourself time to do things that help you feel better each morning, such as stretching, doing some exercise, reading or working on a hobby. Early morning is a special time of day and it is more enjoyable to get ready at an even, unrushed pace. Exercising in the morning can increase your energy for the rest of the day.

, At least go for walks; these are as healthy as you can get, provided you take them regularly. Be sure to include inclines (hills) to give your body a full challenge, and speed up the walking at some parts of the whole walk. Other exercise should always be based on what you enjoy doing and what is best for your body type. A physiotherapist can help you decide what is a good exercise for your body type if you're not sure (it means that you will get the most benefits for the effort put in). Any exercise that you hate or causes you pain is likely to end up being discarded or put you off exercise in general, so it is not recommended. Some other ideas include:


Run on a treadmill a few times a week or even go run around the block a few times.
Maybe go to the gym and workout with friends. (Not everyone likes gym work, although you can feel pressured into using a gym given the heavy advertising this industry invests in. If it isn't for you, it isn't for you; there are plenty of other ways to keep fit and toned.)
Go to the park and have a race or two with your friends. Or, take your dog and race her instead.
Do long walks, hikes or cycle rides on weekends.
Swim.
Play team sports regularly.
Exercise at least three times a week for 30 minutes each time. Not only will this keep you in shape, it will also eliminate stress and keep you looking younger.

, Wash and condition your hair with a shampoo suitable for your hair type. Brush your teeth at least twice a day. Use a facial wash to gently clean your face, especially after a day of being out and about in the grimy city.

, Things you might like to do include:


Apply a deep conditioning masque to your hair to repair any damage.
Do a facial masque to deep clean your pores and once a month or so, get/do a manicure/pedicure.

Note that over-excess of nail polish is not recommended due to the amount of damage it does to your skin, especially the cuticle area.



,


If you have allergies, test brands that state they are hypoallergenic or contain no allergens, etc. While there are no regulated tests that substantiate such claims, these brands rely on not causing itching and swelling, etc., to keep their customer base. It doesn't mean you won't react, so try little amounts to begin with.

, For example:


Use concealer for blemishes. Simply dab it on rather than rub it in. Dab on the discolored area until hidden.
Add foundation and powder, if needed. A multicolored mineral powder can work well, or find one that is the closest to your own skin tone. Use a brush or a bodied pouf to apply an even layer (flat poufs can make it looked caked-on.)
Leave thick eyelashes alone; they need nothing extra. If your eyelashes are straight and long, simply curl them and that's that. If you do need mascara, use a waterproof one that is shade darker than your eyes, and apply sparingly.
Match eyeliner to the color of the mascara. It should have a fine point; use this to carefully dot along the dashes––do not draw a straight line!
Use light pink or clear lip gloss on your lips. Don't apply too much. Avoid using sparkling glosses. Exfoliating the lips can enhance the softness but isn't something everyone likes doing.

, Wearing it regularly can end up being a huge time and financial expense. In some cases, makeup can cause skin problems and bacterial infections. To look amazing, it is a good idea that people are used to you without makeup as much as with it, if not more so. Your unmade-up self is amazing too; be sure to brush the hair, brush the teeth and put on your best smile.

, Keep in your closet at least four tops and two pairs of pants that are of a nondescript nature so that if you wear them on Monday and Thursday, no one will recognize them. Note that the set nondescript clothes should be changed at least once every two months. Then, go shopping like crazy - as long as you will actually wear what you bought. However, keep in mind how you would like to come across to other people. If you go for the simple and sophisticated look, don't get a clownish top with culottes to match.

, Keep a fancy black shirt and a fancy black dress handy for formal events. (Also, consider getting a semi-formal to formal non-black, non-white outfit for special occasions such as weddings.)

, Have at least one pair of running, one fancy black, and the remaining choices of styles and colors are up to you.

,, Accessories can make clothes look richer, deeper and more interesting. Besides which, accessories are just plain fun!


A small accessory can make a big difference, so take care not to overdo them.
Eye-catching purses or handbags can really set off an outfit.

, Smiling costs nothing and it helps you to glow. Smiling helps you to feel better. And it's one of the best things you can give another human being. A smile will always make you look amazing.

, Change the things about you you're not happy with, but only because you know you can do or be better, not because someone else prefers you to be something else. Learn how to spot the difference; if you feel pressured, it usually means that someone or something else is raising your expectations to change, not you. That is a recipe for losing yourself, not gaining the best from yourself.

, Happiness is fleeting, contentment and fulfillment are enduring. Contentment with life isn't about getting stuck; it's about appreciating what you do have already and knowing that, in spite of setbacks (of which there will be plenty throughout life), you have the ability to keep going and to continually grow stronger.

, As the saying goes, everyone in life is doing it tough somewhere, some of the time. Kindness can be the helping hand that another person needs, and kind people are awesome. If that isn't about looking amazing, then what is?


Be nice to the people you come across in life. It takes the same amount of energy to be nice as it does to be mean, with the difference being that kindness opens up opportunities, while meanness shuts them down. Moreover, a mean-spirited heart carries many a burden that a kindhearted person doesn't have to bear.
Being kind and thoughtful towards others has its own attractiveness; you can feel like a role model for the better world we'd all like to live in.

Read the care label.,
Hand wash your sweater.,
Avoid wringing out your sweater.,
Lay the sweater flat to dry.",How to Prevent Sweaters from Stretching1," Always read the care label on the inside of your sweaters. You should find out if the sweaters can be washed at home or if they must be dry cleaned. The care label will also tell you how to wash the sweaters, although you should plan on hand washing them just to be safe.


If your sweater has to be dry cleaned, don't even consider hand washing it at home. Your sweater should be professionally cleaned.;
, Squirt a little gentle laundry detergent into a large sink or bucket. Fill it with cool water and swish the water around so the soap bubbles a bit. Add one sweater at a time and soak it completely. Swish the sweater around with your hand to loosen any dirt. Let the sweater soak for 30 minutes before rinsing it out with more cool water.You can find extra delicate laundry detergents. These are designed to be gentle on your clothes and they're usually fragrance free.

, Once you rinse the clean sweater with cool water, don't twist or wring the sweater to get the excess water out. Lay the wet sweater on a clean, thick bath towel. Roll the towel up so the sweater is rolled and the extra water is pressed out.If you have a large salad spinner, you can also place the wet sweater in it to spin the extra water out.

, Take the damp sweater and lay it on another clean, dry towel. Arrange the sweater so it's flat and the arms aren't folded over onto the sweater. Leave the sweater to dry completely on the towel.While you can lay the sweater on a wooden drying rack, the sweater may develop bumps or ridges from the wooden dowels as it dries.
Never hang damp sweaters from hangers to dry. This will make bumps and stretch out the shoulders.

Have a reference point.,
Dress to fit your lifestyle.,
Act your style.,
Shop for outfits.,
Buy quality that lasts.,
Have foundation pieces.,
Have a grooming regimen.,
Accessorize your outfits.,
Don't over-do it.",How to Look and Feel Stylish (for Men)," Think about your personal style icons: people you consider to be the height of style. Whether it's Kanye West, Ralph Lauren, James Dean, or Walt Whitman, try and wonder what they're trying to accomplish with their style. If it is truly ""the perfection of a point of view,"" think what your icon's point of view might've been, and think about what your point of view might be. Whatever it is, let it guide you when you shop and dress.


Consider how you'd like others to think of you, or your style. Is it classic? Do you aim to be an iconoclast? Style isn't dressing ""well,"" or ""fashionably,"" it's dressing for your character. There are no style ""don'ts"" and only really one style ""do:"" wear what you want, and own it.;
, If you're a high school student, it won't do to clothe yourself as a full English gentleman. If you're a construction worker, you'll need to leave the Armani for the weekend. Tailor your point of view to the life you lead in order to feel as stylish as you look, and to make your style a part of your everyday life. Playing the style peacock only feels as good as your life will allow; it won't feel great wearing your Bruno Maglis if you've got to stand all day as a cashier, for instance.


If your school or work maintain a strict dress code, push it to its limits (accepting the risk, of course). In these situations, don't underestimate the power of style-through-detail: make unique choices wherever possible.

, If you're sporting Gucci, don't act like a boozy frat boy. If you're channeling Kanye West, don't be afraid to loosen your gait and walk with a swagger. If your clothing echoes a certain point of view, allow your behavior to do the same. This is key to feeling stylish, as it completes the personal connection you've drawn between yourself and your outfit.


Let your clothes inspire confidence. Do your best to transfer how you feel strutting in the mirror in the morning to how you feel going about your day, realizing that nothing's changed from being in front of that mirror to being at work, or school., Design your wardrobe (especially if on a budget) to have a lot of stuff that matches (or doesn't--if that's your style). Prepare your outfits the night before. Not only does this save time, it allows you to put more thought into what you're wearing, giving the impression that you're cool and composed in all decisions stylish.


Know the color wheel. A quick Google search for matching colors and patterns will reveal all sorts of informative sources regarding how to match. Even if you're looking to dress against convention, it always helps to know what goes with what.

, If you can afford it, try and go in on some high quality (do your research) items which can serve as foundations for your wardrobe. Shoes should be on the top of this list; no other item in your wardrobe will be used as much with as much wear and tear.


Be sure it fits. Most clothing stores (note: not stores that also sell clothes) will have staff trained to measure your size and help you pick out items to match. You could buy the most expensive clothing and it would still look awful if none of it fit.
Don't skimp on underwear. It may be tempting to save money on the piece of clothing least seen, but good fitting, high quality underwear lasts long and contributes to well-fitting pants.
If you can afford it, try and build a relationship with a reliable alterations tailor as well as dry cleaner. Having one or both goes a long way towards making quality clothing last as long as it can.
Browse regularly, buy rarely. Always know what's available, whether in stores or in shops online. It helps to know all of your options before making a choice., At the core of your wardrobe should be versatile pieces, available for many different occasions. This saves a tremendous amount of trouble when it comes to crafting your outfits, as beginning the process will be as simple as choosing a piece to build on.


Own a pair of shoes for every occasion. This will probably mean at least three: one casual (not running shoes), one semi-formal, and one formal. For the latter two, try to have one brown pair and one black, this covers essentially 99% of possible outfits.
Dark wash jeans are almost a must-have, as they go with a variety of outfits and occasions. Even for the semi-formal events, dark wash jeans can be paired with an image-less t-shirt and well-fitted suit jacket if you're looking for something simple, but tasteful.
Have one white and one blue button-down shirt. Like the dark wash jeans, quality button-downs are a tremendously versatile item. While the obvious pairing is formal, with a suit jacket or sports coat, you could roll up the sleeves and wear them un-tucked with jeans or slacks.

, The most important detail outside of your outfit will be how you handle your hygiene. It's not necessary to reach for the top shelf grooming items, despite many claims that you're soap ought to be as nice as your shoes. Find a set of products for your hair, face, and body that you feel comfortable with, and stick with them. Don't go more than two days without a shower, and try to be consistent no matter what your rhythm is.


Keep a signature cologne. While it might be tempting to keep a menagerie of fine cologne, you only really need one. That way, others will grow to associate a particular scent--your scent--with your style, deepening your point of view.
Have a devoted barber, and see them every 4-6 weeks. Avoid letting your hair grow out of its hair-do. While this might be considered stylishly unkempt, its usually just a sign you've gone too long without a trim. Be open with your barber about what you're trying to achieve with your cut--having one which matches your style really tends to bring an outfit together.
Don't over-condition your hair. Unless you have very thick hair, you usually won't need to condition more than every other day. For those with thin hair, you might consider experimenting with losing the conditioner altogether.
Maintain your facial hair. Whether you keep clean-shaven or wear a full beard, be sure to keep it in check. Avoid letting your mustache move past your lip line. Own a brush or comb to tame your beard every morning. If you just keep some light stubble, have an electric razor and try to never go 4-5 days without a trim. , Particularly if you're going for a ""classic"" look (picture how Ryan Gosling dresses), it will be an interesting combination in your socks, or the look of your watch's wristband which will really ""wow"" people. Even if you're reaching for a hip-hop aesthetic, or a punk-rock look, it will be the additions to your clothes which bring the outfit home.


There's a lot of options for watches. You could reach for the most expensive watches to go with your most formal outfits, but could also keep a variety of lower-cost watches on hand.
Hats also afford for a lot of creativity. You can top a plain outfit with a bright baseball cap for some added flair. Fit is key here as well; nothing looks sillier than an over-sized hat.
If you wear glasses, be sure to match them to the size of your face and features. Large frames for large faces; the bug-eyed glasses trend is a distinctly feminine one, so mismatched glasses usually has the effect of looking cartoonish.
When it comes to jewelry, tread lightly. Conventional wisdom usually suggests that men abstain from wearing necklaces, and that if wearing a ring (it should really only be one) it ought to have a thick band and worn on the right ring finger. If the ring has a gem, it should be low and wide.

, Unfortunately we can't all be Johnny Depp, with his jewelry store's worth of ornamentation. Adding too much to your outfit will potentially blur your style's point of view and have you veering into ""gimmick"" territory. A single flourish--a pocket square, an extravagant necklace, a matching baseball cap--will usually do the trick.


Similarly, avoid grooming to excess. For better or worse, men are usually associated with a least a hint of ""rugged-ness,"" which is ruined by excessive grooming. Common mistakes include moisturizing too much (you shouldn't feel oily) and dousing yourself in too much cologne."

, How do you stand? If you are slumping, you will be creating unnecessary lumps and bumps on your body, including around your chin area because the fat seeks infirm areas to settle in.

Avoid hanging the sweaters.,
Fold your sweaters.,
Use extra support if you must hang the sweaters.,
Put sweaters in long-term storage at the end of the cold season.",How to Prevent Sweaters from Stretching2," One of the easiest ways to prevent stretched sweaters is to avoid hanging them up. If you store your sweaters by hanging them in a closet, the weight of the sweater will pull it down over time. This is especially true for thick, bulky, or beaded sweaters that are heavy.


Hanging sweaters on the hanger also causes peaks in the shoulder area where the hanger stretches the fabric.

, Instead of hanging the sweaters, fold or roll them and store them in a dresser. To fold a sweater, lay it on a flat surface so the front faces down. Fold each of the arms across the back of the sweater so they cross. Gather one end of the sweater and fold it over so the sleeves are contained.You can also roll your sweaters to prevent stretching. Once you've laid the sweater and folded the arms in, gather the bottom end of the sweater and roll it up to the collar.

, If you don't have storage space to keep folded sweaters and you have to hang the sweaters, use proper support. Choose hangers that are thick and have lots of padding. The size of the hanger should match the size of the shoulders so the sweater doesn't slide off or stretch to fit the hanger.Consider folding the sweater and hanging it across the lower bar of the hanger.
Never hang your sweaters on metal clothes hangers. These easily stretch the shoulders.

, Try not to hang your sweaters for an extended period of time, especially if you won't be wearing and caring for them. To store them for the long term, wash and dry them properly. Fold the sweaters and put them in storage clothing bags or boxes that offer good air circulation. Look for storage containers made of cotton, muslin or canvas.Avoid using vacuum-sealed bags for storing clothes. Any moisture that's sealed into the bags with the clothes can cause mildew and staining.

Minimize the number of times you wash the sweaters.,
Consider fabrics when you purchase sweaters.,
Avoid pulling on the shirt cuffs or bottom hem.,
Reshape sweaters if you accidentally stretch them.",How to Prevent Sweaters from Stretching3," Unless you get a sweater dirty, stained, or smelly, you don't need to wash it after each time you wear it. Instead, air it out between wearings and only wash it when it truly needs it. This will prevent unnecessary wear and stretching.Be in the habit of immediately deciding if you need to wash or air a sweater once you've worn it. This will prevent clean sweaters from getting mixed with ones that need to be washed.

, Read the care labels for sweaters you're considering buying. You'll want to know whether or not you can wash and dry the sweaters and what the sweaters are made of. You might want to avoid sweaters made with acrylic materials since these can stretch easily.Look for sweaters made from cotton, cashmere, or wool. Keep in mind that these materials will also have special handling needs, so read their care labels closely.

, If you've developed a habit of pulling down on your sleeves or the bottom hem of your sweaters, drop the habit. Pulling on the cuffs or hem stretches the sweater which will wear it out in the long term.


If you're pulling down your hem because you're worried the sweater is too short, you might want to layer a longer shirt underneath the sweater.

, If you've completely stretched out a sweater, you can soak the entire thing in water and put it in the dryer. Dry the sweater using high heat until it's totally dry. This should help to shrink it back down. If you only need to reshape a few stretched areas (like peaks in the shoulders), just wet the stretched areas and put the sweater in the dryer.If a sweater isn't stretched too badly, consider misting it until it's just a little moist. Then you can dry it completely to return the shape.

Take an umbrella with you.,
Keep a sunny attitude.",How to Look Amazing in the Rain," If it's raining before you go out, put an anti-frizz cream or anti-humidity styling product in your hair. Set your style with hairspray.

, If you think you might get your face wet, here are a few changes to make to your normal makeup routine.


Wear waterproof mascara to avoid dripping raccoon eyes.
Use a lip stain to keep color on your lips even if they get wet.
Don't put a lot of color on your eyelids - it could look weird if your face gets wet and the makeup runs off. Instead, opt for colors that are close to your natural skin tone.

Wear a good trench coat in a classic color. A quality trench should cover you adequately without making you look like you're wearing a shapeless bag. Choose one in a color that complements your skin tone, and in a length that hits at mid-thigh or mid-calf. If it has a hood, that's even better.

If shaving at home, be sure to lather up on shaving cream and use a good, 3-4-blade razor to avoid unsightly cuts or razor burn.


For those opting for a wax, be sure to book an appointment a few days before you hit the beach to give inflammation time to heal.

, Use sunscreen all over your body and face to avoid a burn. Sun damage also can cause wrinkles, so it’s important to lather up even if you’re working on a tan. Look for moisturizers, make up, and lip balm with a little added SPF to get some extra protection.

, Sweat and dirt in your pores can easily turn into unwanted pimples and blackheads. If you struggle from body or facial acne, use a body wash that contains salicylic acid to maintain blemish free skin., This should be applied after you moisturize. It usually takes between 5-7 days for skin to peak, so plan accordingly.There’s no need to use a self-tanner, but many find it boosts confidence in the early beach season when skin is still lighter from winter. Remember, pale skin is beautiful too!

Play with bangs.,
Keep the hair off your face.While bangs can work, keeping hair off the face altogether may actually help more, especially if you don't like the way bangs look with your face shape.,
Choose glasses with a wide, low bridge.The low sitting bridge will divide the long vertical line of your nose more evenly, so the bottom portion of your nose--the portion that the eye naturally catches--will seem smaller.,
Wear large earrings.Your ears and nose share the same horizontal space on your face.,
Pick a hat with a prominent brim.",How to Hide a Big Nose,"









Starting with a clean face is an absolute necessity.
Contouring is a makeup application technique that plays with the natural shadows of your face. Depending on how you apply contours, certain areas of your face can look smaller or larger. By applying contours using the steps listed here, you can make your nose appear smaller.;
, If you do not already have a regular foundation, pick one that matches your natural skin tone as closely as possibly. Apply that all over your face, including your nose.








, Pick a foundation one or two shades darker than your natural shade. Apply this foundation to the sides of your nose, blending well.









If you have a long nose as well as a large one, you should also apply this foundation to the tip of your nose.
The most important part of the entire contouring process is the blending process. Use a makeup brush or sponge to thoroughly blend this darker shade into the natural foundation beneath. When finished, this dark foundation should look like a natural shadow instead of looking like makeup.

, Pick out a third foundation one shade lighter than your natural tone. Apply this foundation to the top bridge of your nose, starting in between your eyes and ending just before the tip and nostrils.









This foundation highlights the center line of your nose, making the ""shadows"" you created with your dark foundation more effective.
As before, you need to blend this foundation into both your natural and dark shades as thoroughly as possible. The transition between shades should be seamless and must appear natural.

, Select a loose matte powder and dust it all over the sides of your nose.









This loose powder can help mask any lines or imperfections in your foundation, allowing your makeup to seem more natural.
Make sure that you use a matte powder. Shimmer powders draw more attention to anything they touch, so if you apply a shimmer powder to your nose, you will only accentuate it further.

, One of the best ways to hide your nose is to make another facial feature stand out more. Wearing bold eye makeup or daring lip color will cause onlookers to notice your eyes or lips more than any other part of your face, including your nose.


If you choose to accentuate your eyes, make them pop by applying dark eyeliner and mascara. Bright or bold eye shadows are also great to wear for evening looks but should still be avoided for daytime wear.
If you choose to accentuate your lips, use bright or bold lipstick colors. Lip color with a little shine or sparkle can also work great.
Only accentuate one feature at a time. Applying heavy makeup on both your eyes and lips can easily overwhelm your face.

, In addition to accentuating your lips or eyes, you can balance out your nose by making your cheekbones more prominent.Choose a blush one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone and apply it to the apples of your cheeks. Shimmer blushes can actually work well here since they highlight skin more than matte blushes do.
Similarly, you can also apply a light bronzer along the cheekbones to make them glow and stand out more.

, In particular, you need to keep shine off your nose. Shine catches the eye and draws more attention to a feature, so shine on your nose will make your nose look even larger.


The most important thing to do is to keep as much oil off your nose as possible. Use a gentle facial cleanser on your nose each morning and evening. Harsh cleansers can actually irritate the skin and cause it to produce more oil. Throughout the day, dab off some of the excess oil that gathers on your nose with tissue or cosmetic oil blotting paper.
When applying any makeup to your nose, use a matte formula instead of a shimmery formula.

, Medium and long hairstyles are typically better than short cuts. Short hairstyles frame the face and highlight the nose, which can make it look even larger. Medium and long cuts balance out your facial features, making them appear smaller., Straight, blunt styles create more straight vertical lines and emphasize the largest straight line on your face—your nose. Put layers in your hair, instead, to create a softer and more rounded look.


While all layer styles are better than blunt styles, feathery layers are the best of the best. This texture is especially soft and wavy, so it provides the greatest amount of balance against the straight line of your nose.

, In general, adding waves and curves to your hair will break up and balance out any harsh lines on your face. The bridge of your nose is the longest, most visible straight line on your face.


Use a diffuser, hair rollers, or a curling iron to add a wavy texture to your hair.

, Sleek, tight ponytails can make your facial features appear sharper and more severe. As a result, the angles and size of your nose will stand out more.


When you tie your hair back in a ponytail or sweep it into an up-do, choose a somewhat messy style. Create body at the crown and allow a few stray strands to swoop down, framing your face in a subtle curve.

,


In contrast, a side part offsets the lines of your face, breaking them up and making your nose stand out less.

, Bangs can help hide a large nose, but you should generally avoid bangs that hand down at blunt, sharp angles. Straight lines will only draw more attention to the straight line of your nose.


When getting bangs, consider side swept bangs that break up the angles of your face or wispy bangs that that soften the lines of your face.

,


The idea here is to balance out your facial features with one another. When hair covers your forehead or the sides of your face, these features get lost while your nose remains very visible. As a result, your nose appears to take up more space on your face. Keeping hair off your face can prevent this from happening.
For this reason, men who want to hide a big nose should avoid mustaches and beards. Covering too much skin on your face can actually make your nose stand out more.

, A wide bridge creates a stronger, more visible divide.


Larger frames are generally a better option than smaller ones. The large frames can compete with the size of your nose and help balance it out, but smaller frames can draw more attention to the size of your nose.
The other option is to go for contacts. Since glasses sit at the top of your nose, they do draw some attention to that area of your face. Getting contacts avoids this issue completely.

, Short, dainty earrings can draw attention to this horizontal space, which could also draw attention to your nose. Larger earrings that extend below the ear enlarge the sides of this horizontal space, making the nose at the center of this space appear smaller by comparison.


If you do not want to wear long earrings, at least choose short earrings that cover the earlobes completely. This will draw more attention to the sides of this horizontal space, which can help draw attention off your nose.
Rounded earrings that occupy both horizontal and vertical space are better than earrings that only add a vertical dimension. Earrings that emphasize straight, vertical lines will also emphasize the straight, vertical line of the nose.

, Both men and women should look for hat styles that have a rounded or down-turned brim at the front of the face. A brim that hangs down over the front of the face can visually build out the forehead. As a result, the nose appears shorter and more proportionate.Avoid ""tricorne"" styles, which meet at a point above the forehead.
Hats that have a larger brim in the front than in the back may build out the forehead better than those with an even brim all around.
Make sure that the crown does not pinch in too tightly toward the front of the face. Ideally, this crown should also be of medium height to maintain better visual balance, and it should not taper in much toward the top.
Consider choosing a hat with a wide, colorful band above the brim. This band can draw the eye up and away from the nose."

Know who you are and keep being you.Be comfortable with who you are and don’t change it.",How to Improve Your Appearance," Are you doing this for yourself or someone else? What do you hope to achieve by improving your appearance?


If you’re trying to change how you look with the hopes of attracting someone, be careful that you stay true to yourself as you go through the following steps. Only do what feels right for you.;
, Most of us find it easier to identify what we don’t like about ourselves, but it’s important to identify some good things, too.


Once you figure out what you like best about yourself, think about how you can play it up.

, You might find it useful to make a list of what you like and don’t like, and then realistically consider what you can actually change about yourself.


For example, you can’t change that you’re short, but if you want to, you can give the illusion of looking taller by wearing high heels (women) or shoes with thicker heels (men or women). There are also things you can do with your clothing and hair to help give the appearance of length (for example, if you’re short, you might want to avoid having very long hair or wearing long jackets that reach below the knees, as these things can make you look shorter).

, Maybe you hate most of how you look, but your appearance isn’t only about how traditionally attractive you are. As you work through the following steps, try to move at least one thing from your “don’t like” list to your “like” list.


Maybe you hate that your hair is so thick, but with the right hair cut, products, and styling, you might be able to turn that around and really love what you can do with your hair.

, Ideally, improving your appearance is about letting your true self shine through. It’s not about fitting a standard ideal of what attractiveness is to society in general. As you work on improving your appearance, keep this in mind.


Maybe you feel most like yourself with your natural hair and skin tones, wearing neutral clothing. Maybe you feel most like yourself with colorfully dyed hair, piercings, and hand-made, one-of-a-kind outfits. Don’t let society dictate what the best version of you looks like. You are the expert on you.

, For some of us, feeling better about our appearance might be as simple as getting a new haircut; for others, it might be a much longer, more difficult process. Know that we have all struggled with self-confidence and maintaining healthy habits. The key is to stay positive and, most importantly, be kind to yourself.


If you decide that part of your plan to improve your appearance is to exercise more often, being gentle means being realistic about what you can do — for example, if you don’t exercise regularly, start with two days a week and move up from there. Being gentle also means that when you miss a day or make a mistake, you don’t get mad at yourself; you just acknowledge it, forgive yourself, and make a commitment to start fresh tomorrow.

, Having a clear sense of your goals will help you stay focused and on track. When making your action plan, be careful not to set too many goals for yourself at one time. If you make too many changes at once, you’ll risk becoming overwhelmed and not being able to keep up with any of them.


If you decide you want to lose weight, improve your skin, and sleep better, you’ll likely need to implement these changes to your lifestyle in stages.

For example, you might start by exercising twice a week and committing to washing your face twice a day with an appropriate cleanser (i.e. one for your skin type — dry, normal, combination, acne-prone) for the first one or two weeks.



, As you consider your motives and plans for improving your appearance, keep track of your thoughts and feelings in a journal. Devote a journal to improving your appearance. Write your action plan down in the journal so that you can refer back to it.


Continue to keep your journal as you develop new habits for improving your appearance. This will help you evaluate what works and what doesn’t.

, Unless you have unlimited funds and are willing to undergo surgery, your results won’t be immediate. To improve your appearance in the long term requires long-term lifestyle changes. Give yourself the time and space you need. Know that this will be different for everyone depending on their individual goals and situations.

, Most people don’t drink enough water. Staying hydrated will not only improve the quality of your skin; it will help keep you focused and energetic, and it might even help you shed a few pounds.


Advice for how much water to drink varies, but the average is 8 (8 oz.) glasses per day.
To verify that you are properly hydrated, check that the color of your urine is clear or very lightly colored, not dark. Dark urine indicates severe dehydration.

, Eating healthfully means different things to different people, and really depends on your body chemistry. In general, you’ll want to ensure you’re getting enough protein (i.e. lean meats or alternatives, nuts), healthy fats (i.e. extra virgin olive oil, avocados), and other nutrients from fruits and veggies, and you’ll want to avoid processed foods and sugars as much as possible.


If you are lactose intolerant, vegetarian, vegan, celiac or have any other specific dietary requirements, you might even find it useful to consult a nutritionist about the best diet for you.
Note that changing your diet is not the same thing as dieting. Unless you’re working with a doctor to decrease your weight significantly, avoid cutting calories or cutting out otherwise healthy foods to lose weight. Diets are infamous for being unsuccessful; when you’re starving and exhausted from a diet, you have less energy and will power to stay on it.

, Instead of looking at the scale every morning, think about how your bones feel, how your brain feels, how energetic you feel. You should find that over time, unless you’re struggling with a medical condition, these things will improve as you make healthy changes.


If you’re struggling with a medical condition, be sure to consult your doctor and get their approval before implementing any changes to your lifestyle.
If you’re 5’11 and you’ve read that your favourite actor or actress is 110 pounds, be realistic. Being 5’11 and 110 pounds is not healthy. You will be skin and bones!

, Choose physical activities that you enjoy and that work for your body, and implement them slowly into your lifestyle. If you already work out twice a week, find a way to fit three days a week into your schedule. Ideally you'll want a blend of flexibility, strength, and cardio.


Ultimately you’ll want to work up to being active for at least 30 minutes each day, with longer, more intense workouts 3-5 days each week.
By choosing activities that you enjoy, exercising will feel less like work, and more like a reward. Take a dance class or join a team sport!
If you have knee problems, don’t decide that you’re going to start running; swimming would be more appropriate.

, Meditating helps you get more in touch with your mind and body. It will not only help you stay focused on your goals, but will also help you foster a sense of inner peace and tranquility, making it easier for you to accept yourself as you are, no matter where you are in your journey.

, When we regularly don’t get enough sleep we are not our best selves. It shows in our mood, body language (hunched back, droopy eyelids), and skin (dark eye circles, bags under eyes), and can make us appear less attractive. Aim for between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night, and try to be consistent in your bedtime (for example, sleeping from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. consistently).


If you have trouble sleeping, you might find progressive muscle relaxation helpful.

Lying in bed before sleep, close your eyes and take some deep breaths, drawing an awareness to your body. Beginning at the top of your head and working down your body, tense your muscles and then release them. An appropriate order would be as follows: forehead, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, nose, mouth, jaw, neck, shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, fingers (make a fist), chest, upper stomach, lower stomach, pelvis, buttocks, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, feet, toes. Once you’re done, tense your entire body and hold it for a moment before letting go.


For those of us that work at home, it can be difficult to transition from work to sleep, especially if the home is small/a specific office space is not available. If you suffer from insomnia, it’s important to dedicate a specific area to sleep, and only sleep. Don’t bring your work into this area. Make your bed your sanctuary.
Oils and herbs might also be helpful in relaxing you before sleep. These can vary from essential oils such as lavender and neroli to herbs like valerian root. If you choose to take supplements, consult your doctor or specialist to ensure that they are safe to take with anything else you may be taking, or with any medical conditions you may have.

, If you’re working to improve your appearance, you may be struggling with some body confidence issues. Even if you aren’t, you may find that improving your appearance is a difficult journey. Make sure that you take time to reward yourself for your hard work.


Rewards could include buying a nice article of clothing or treating yourself to a spa day, or even buying that video game you like (as long as it doesn't take away from the time you spend exercising!) or saving up/paying for that pricey exercise class/club membership you’ve been wanting.

, Most drugstore brands make this easy by explicitly stating on their labels which skin type their cleanser is designed for.


You’ll likely see one of four types: normal (occasional zits but no problem areas), combination (often a combination of dry on cheeks, oily on forehead, nose and chin), oily/acne-prone, and dry/sensitive (some flakiness, often sensitive to scented cleansers).

, While washing your face, be gentle. Avoid scrubbing too hard, as this can irritate your skin and cause blemishes or make existing blemishes worse.

, After cleansing, gently apply a toner using a cotton pad. Toners help you balance your skin’s pH (acid-alkaline ratio), and can keep your skin looking healthier. Avoid toners that contain alcohol, as this can dry out and irritate your skin.

, As with facial cleansers, most drugstore moisturizer brands will specify which skin type they are designed for on the packaging.

, Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and brightens your skin. If you have severe acne, you’ll probably want to avoid exfoliating all together, as the friction can irritate your skin and the exfoliant can spread the bacteria from your pimples to other areas of your skin.

, You may wish to have tea tree oil or a cream containing salicylic acid handy in case you get zits. Do not try to pop your zits, as this will only make them worse.

, If you have severe acne and are really struggling to get it under control, consider seeing your doctor and/or a dermatologist. A professional can help you address your acne and come up with an action plan to reduce or even get rid of it.


You might find that the doctor/dermatologist recommends a medication, topical cream, or a combination of both.
If you’re a male and you shave your face, try shaving in the same direction as your hair growth to avoid breakouts caused by irritation.

, Many facial moisturizers include an SPF of 15 to 30. Keep an eye out for the words “SPF 15” or “SPF 30” on the label. When purchasing sunscreen, especially for your face, be careful to ensure that it won’t clog your pores (i.e. that it is non-comedogenic). Avoid sunscreens containing oil.

, If you feel really self-conscious about your complexion, consider trying a tinted moisturizer or concealer. These are available for men and women. Aim for something that is non-comedogenic (won’t clog pores), and directed at your skin type (i.e. normal, combination, oily/acne-prone, dry/sensitive).


To target a pimple or any other redness on your face, you can try putting a dab of green cover-up on there before going over it with one that matches your skin tone.
Note that wearing makeup can exacerbate acne, although some brands do claim to help fight it.

, Compliment your nice complexion with clear eyes. Reduce puffiness and dark circles with creams and/or a concealer. Reduce redness with eye drops.


If you have any medical conditions related to your eyes, check with your doctor before using eye drops.

, Unless you have extremely dry skin or some other condition or living situation that prevents you from doing so, shower every day. Pay attention to ensure that you thoroughly wash and rinse your body, particularly the parts that get more sweaty (i.e. your armpits and genitals).


When selecting a soap it may be tempting to go for something that smells great, but strong-smelling soap can irritate skin. You’re safer purchasing an unscented soap or something designed for your particular skin type (for example, if you have oily skin and have acne on your back, you may want to seek out a soap designed for oily, acne-prone skin).

, If your teeth are healthy and the enamel is not thinning, you can use a whitening toothpaste. If your teeth look a little translucent, you’ll likely want a toothpaste for sensitive teeth that advertises enamel repair.

, This will remove food and plaque from your teeth, keeping them healthy and keeping your breath better.

, There is a huge selection of deodorant available for a variety of purposes. If you are more health conscious you may choose to avoid antiperspirants containing aluminum, which studies have suggested can cause cancer., Ensure that your clothes are clean and, if necessary, pressed (i.e. dress shirts, slacks will likely need ironing after washing).


A good rule of thumb is to wash undershirts, underwear and exercise clothes after each wear (with the exception of bras, which you can wear several times before washing); wash tops after one or two wears, depending on how much you perspire; wash pants after five or six wears; and coats every one or two months.Washing your pajamas regularly (after three to four wears) may also help you avoid acne, if you have it in places other than your face.

, Find something that feels unique to you — your own “signature scent”. Different scent categories suit different body chemistries: you’re best off going to a drugstore or department store that sells perfume and cologne, and sampling the scents until you find one that works on you. Be sure to give it at least an hour after spraying on your skin, as the scent can change over time.


Scents come in several categories of smell: aromatic (grass-spicy), chypre (moss, patchouli, bergamot), citrus (tart scents like grapefruit or mandarin), floral (freshly picked flowers — note that floral and fruity can often overlap), leather (smoky, tar, combined with floral and tart scents), oriental (musk, vanilla, resin, wood combined with florals and spices), and woody (warm, sandalwood, dry/sharp cedar, balmy often combined with aromatic and citrus).Be careful not to wear too much cologne or perfume. In this case, too much is far worse than not enough. If you’re unsure of how much to put on, start small, with only a few spritzes. You might even try spraying it in front of you and then walking through it.

, If you’re about to meet with someone and are self-conscious about your breath, consider popping a couple of mints in your mouth or using a breath spray. If you choose to chew gum, ensure that you spit it out before entering any important meetings, as many people find gum chewing to be rude and/or annoying — some even see it as demonstrating a lack of class.

, Maybe you’ve already got a good sense of who you are and how you want to represent yourself. If you don’t, you might find it useful to start a style diary or even an online folder of styles that you like. When defining your style, consider the clothes and hair (and, if you wear it, makeup) that will best represent YOU.


Are you edgy or more subdued? Are you extroverted and like a lot of attention? Or, do you like attention but would prefer to wear neutral clothes and then surprise people with your personality.
It's sometimes necessary to acknowledge that finding a style that is true to you is not always possible, whether due to financial or work constraints. For example, if you’re a nurse, you’re limited to a specific style of uniform; you may be able to show your personality through the patterns that you choose for that uniform, though.

, Figuring out your body type will help you decide which cuts look best on you, and which parts of your body you might want to accentuate. Body types are different for men and women.


In general, women have four body types: apple (top heavy, with big busts and thinner legs), straight/rectangular (waist and hips are roughly equal, “boyish”), pear (bottom heavy, with hips significantly larger than bust), and hourglass (equal hip and bust measurements, with a narrow waist).
In general men have four body types too: average (with broad shoulders tapering down to the waist), inverted triangle (athletic, with moderate to heavy muscle definition), rectangular (skinny or narrow in build, with the waist and the shoulders being the same width), or the triangle (a more pronounced midsection with narrower shoulders)., Use clothing to accentuate the things you like about your body. For many women, this means accentuating their waists, busts, backsides, or legs; for many men, this means accentuating broad shoulders, a strong chest, or a nice backside.


If you’re a woman and you have an apple body type, you’ll likely wear something that accentuates your slender legs and draws attention away from your broad shoulders or thick middle.
If you’re a man with a triangle body type, you’ll want to try to make your shoulders look broader and your midsection look narrower; structured, simple shirts are your best bet., Many variations exist within the two basic categories of “warm” and “cool” skin tones, but figuring out whether you’re warm or cool is a great starting point.


If you have a warm skin tone, you’ll have yellow undertones. Warm skin tones often have greenish veins. Warm-toned people look good in earthy shades: burnt orange, cream, sunny yellow, brown, dark green, autumn red.If you have a cool skin tone, there’ll be pink undertones. Cool skin tones often have blueish veins. Cool-toned people look good in “cool” colors: black, royal blue, navy, gray., Once you’ve defined your style and figured out what clothes look best on you, go through your entire wardrobe and get rid of anything that doesn’t look great on you. This includes workout clothes and sleepwear, if you can afford it.


Improving your appearance is largely about improving your confidence, so it’s important to ensure that you always feel good about how you look — even if you’re just in your PJ's.
If you’re unsure of what to get rid of and what to keep, invite a friend or two over to give you advice. You can make a night of it by offering to get them dinner in exchange for their help.

, It’s tempting to buy things on sale, but you can save money by only purchasing what looks best on you.

, Ask a friend or two to come along with you when you go out shopping for new clothes. If you’re really struggling to figure out what looks good on you, and if you can afford it, you might even consider paying for a personal shopper to help you out.

, Accessorize with watches, sunglasses, ties, necklaces etc. Keep your nails trimmed/manicured and, if it’s something you're into, paint them to match your outfits. It’s the small touches that really cement your style.


For example, maybe you always wear black, but bold accessories. For a woman this might mean a big, chunky, bright necklace with bright lipstick. For a man this might mean a brightly patterned tie with vintage cuff-links.

, Is your hair thick or thin? Is it dry, oily, or somewhere in between? Is it colored? Curly? Straight? All of these things will influence which hair products you buy, and thankfully most brands (both drugstore and professional) tell you right on the label exactly which hair type they are designed for.

, Figure out how often you need to wash your hair to keep it looking clean (it needs to be washed when it’s oily, flat, and separating), and do that — don’t wash it more than it needs to be washed, as this can dry it out.

, Facial shapes include square or circle (face as wide as it is long, with square faces having angular chins), oval (face longer than it is wide), or heart-shaped (chin comes to a point, hair line on forehead may be a widow’s peak).

, Look online or purchase a hairstyle magazine at your local drugstore to find some examples of hairstyles that you like and that match your face shape.


A square face can look great with a more edgy, angular cut such as a chin-length bob. Softer layers can also work.
An oval face will look more balanced with layers, no matter the length. Bangs can also give the long, oval face a more balanced appearance.
Heart-shaped faces often have great high cheekbones. Accentuate those with short layers or long bangs.

, If you have thin, straight hair and you want a cut that requires thick, curly hair, think again. Even the most talented hairdresser is not a magician; they cannot completely change the quality of your hair.

, Ask around and/or look online to find well-reviewed hairdressers in your area. Bring photos of your selected haircuts/styles in with you to your appointment, so that the hairdresser can see exactly what you want. Talk to them about what you’re going for, and make sure that you’re both clear on what will be done.

, Logically, your natural hair color should match your skin tone quite well, but coloring your hair can be a great way to make your eyes pop or add a little extra excitement to your over all look. As with clothing colours, you’ll want to select your hair color based on your skin tone (i.e. warm or cool).


If you have a cool skin tone, you can go with dark, “harsher” shades like black or, if you're feeling adventurous, blue.
If you have a warm skin tone, you’re better off sticking with earthier shades like red, copper, or a rich, warm brown.
If you can afford it, always get your hair professionally colored. This way, you can consult the stylist on what he or she thinks will work best with your skin tone, and in general the quality of the products is higher, so you’ll likely cause less damage to your hair.

, If you are a female, chances are you will want to pluck your eyebrows and remove any hair elsewhere on your face (i.e. coming out of moles, moustache hair, hair on your chin). If you're a male, it can get a bit more elaborate, with eyebrow plucking, shaving and/or moustache and beard trimming.


For men, facial shape is more relevant here. For example, men with a heart-shaped face might find it useful to grow a goatee or beard to help balance out the upper part of their face.

, It’s popular for women and some men to shave their legs and underarms, and to at least trim their pubic hair. If you are not comfortable with and/or do not wish to do these things, don’t do them! You are working to improve how you appear for yourself, and if you like the way you look with hairy legs, there is no reason to change that.

, A lot of us have negative voices telling us that we aren't good enough, that we’re stupid or unattractive. Don’t let these voices get you down. Acknowledge them, and counter them with positive self talk.


Maybe one morning your clothes feel a bit tight and you think, “God I’m so fat. I’m so ugly. I can’t believe I’ve gained weight. I’m such a loser.” Think to yourself, “I acknowledge that negative response to my tight clothes. Yes, my clothes are a bit tight, but it’s not the end of the world. I'm not uglier because of it. I'm not stupid. I’m not a loser. My clothes are just a bit tight. That is all.” Then, counter with positive talk: “I was great in that meeting yesterday,” or, “I’m proud that I am trying to improve my self image.”

, Good posture means standing upright with a straight (but not rigidly straight) back, with your chin tilted every so slightly down. Practise good posture by sitting upright even at your desk, and avoiding hunching.

, When speaking to others, there are things you can do to show that you are open to talking to them, and that you’re actively listening to them:Smile. Nothing crazy or too wide, but a light, relaxed smile will show that you’re happy to talk to them.
Look at them with your chin angled down rather than up, so as not to appear as though you’re “looking down on them.”
Avoid a full frontal display; instead, face them at a slight angle to avoid looking too dominant.
Avoiding any closing off or compressing gestures — open palms, open eyes, high eyebrows, open (not compressed) lips.

, Don’t overdo it to the point that you’re staring or wide-eyed and crazy-looking, but do look into someone’s eyes when you’re talking to them and/or when they’re talking to you. Remember to blink!

, Being charismatic means being confident (but not cocky), interesting, optimistic, and an active listener.In a conversation, being charismatic means telling great stories, having a sense of humour, and, above all else, focusing on the other person.Ask them for advice, ask them follow-up questions when they tell you a story. Validate their opinions and don't be judgmental., Studies have shown that higher, weaker voices are associated with submissiveness, whereas lower pitches are associated with social dominance.Ideally, you want to speak from your diaphragm in a strong and confident manner.


There are various vocal levels, and each of them have different effects on the listener: nasal (high pitched, whiny), mouth (makes sound but is not very powerful; is easy to ignore), chest (used by many men and women, sounds pleasant, can generally maintain interest, nothing negative, just not the best), diaphragm voice (commands attention, most attractive, sounds strongest and most natural). To help you learn how to speak from your diaphragm, practise breathing deeply (imagine inflating your belly) rather than shallowly (into your chest). Not only will this help your voice sound better, it’ll also help you feel more relaxed and focused.If you really struggle with having confidence due to your voice, you might consider investing in a voice coach or at least looking up some vocal coaching videos online., When you smile, people will generally feel that you are more friendly and approachable. They key to having a great smile is to be genuine, which means smiling with your eyes, too.


How you smile will depend on your situation — for example, you might smile with your teeth in a photo or when talking to people at a party, but prefer a less intense, closed-mouth smile if you’re trying to get someone’s attention from across the room.

, People who are confident and comfortable in their own skin have an attractiveness about them that no amount of styling, grooming, or fitness can match.When people know you’re consistent, and they know what to expect, they're more likely to want to be around you. If they know you're sometimes fun but sometimes a real downer, they might be nervous to approach you.
As you work towards improving your appearance you might find that you seek out certain icons or gurus as models of what you want to be like. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as you don’t wind up constantly comparing yourself to them and/or trying to be just like them. This is about becoming the best you that you can be — not the best mimic of someone else.

Get bangs.,
Go for a low, loose up-do.,
Create volume with layers.,
Rock an edgy bob.",How to Hide a Big Forehead1," The best way to hide your forehead is by going to a salon and getting bangs. A straight across bang that gets gradually longer on the sides is the most versatile and fitting for larger foreheads. However, there are many different types of bangs to choose from. Flip through a magazine and pick a favorite type to ask your stylist for, and be sure to go with one that best fits your face shape.


Opt for curtain bangs or textured side bangs if your face is round.Oval and long face shapes look better with a below-the-brow wispy bang.;
, If you want to wear your hair up, part your hair down the middle and put it in a loose bun. Pull a couple of pieces out of the top front and curl them with a curling iron on low heat to create a nice face-framing effect.Avoid the slicked back look. Unlike the low, loose up-do, a tightly pulled back ponytail or bun won’t be very flattering., A big forehead often means a seemingly longer face. While flat, straight hair will make your face look even longer, hairstyles with a lot of wave and volume bring balance to your head shape by having a subtle widening effect.Also create volume by using volumizing hair products, curling your hair, or blowing it dry with a hair dryer and a round brush.

, Get an asymmetrical bob with a dramatic side part. The side part breaks up your forehead and draws attention to your eyes while the longer front section makes your neckline a focal point."

Flood the eye by splashing water into your eyes.,
Rinse the eye by lowering your open eyes into water.,
Pour a saline solution (eye drops) into the eye.",How to Get an Eyelash Out of Your Eye1," This is the easiest and fastest method of removing an eyelash. Splashing your eyes with water can cause the eyelash to simply be rinsed out with the water. Mineral and bottled water is ideal as it's more sterile than tap water. You can use tap water if you don't have mineral or bottled available.


Cup your hands, catch some water in them, and splash into open eyes. It is okay to blink when the water touches your eye. Repeat several times if necessary until the eyelash is gone.;
, This is another, slightly gentler way to rinse out the eyelash using water. Use mineral or bottled water if you have it.


Pour water into a large bowl. Slowly lower your face, with open eyes, into the water until the liquid touches your eyes. If you feel the urge to blink when your eyes touch the water, do so. All that matters is that the liquid touches your eye.
The eyelash should then wash out into the bowl. Repeat several times if necessary until the eyelash is gone.

, Saline, like mineral water, is more sterile than tap water and safer for the eye.Take an eyedropper and fill it with saline solution. While keeping your eyes open, pour a few drops directly into the open eye. Hopefully, the eyelash washes right out. Repeat if necessary.
Many saline solutions come in small bottles with a squirt head. If this is the case, you don't have to use an eyedropper. Simply lift the bottle and pour a few drops into your eye. Blink and if necessary, repeat several times until the eyelash is washed out.

Photo edit with caution.",How to Hide a Double Chin," High necklines frame your neck and face, and as a result, they also tend to draw more attention to a double chin. Direct the eye away from your chin by opting for low v-necks and similar collar styles. The idea is to keep the collar of your shirt as far away from your chin as possible.


If you're wearing a button down shirt, leave the top two or three buttons undone.Deep necklines are better than broad necklines since they draw the eye down and away from your chin. If plunging necklines are too far out of your comfort zone, though, a broad neckline—like a boat neck or wide square neck—is still a much better option than a high collar.;
, Small dangling earrings are acceptable, but when you wear bulky earrings that end just around your jawline, you end up inviting onlooking eyes to your jawline—and, more significantly, your chin.The right earrings can help turn attention away from your chin. Play around with various post earrings in a range of sizes and styles. Small posts that add a touch of sparkle or larger posts that demand attention can keep people focused on your eyes and upper cheeks.

, Adding too much bulk to your neck can accent a double chin, but if you choose long necklaces and thin scarves, you can actually guide the eye further down your torso. People are more likely to direct their attention toward the end of your accessories, so the lower your necklace or scarf goes, the further you can separate their gazes from your chin.


Avoid choker style necklaces or other necklaces with short chains. Long, beaded necklaces that drape over your chest are a better option, especially if the beads start small near the neck and get progressively larger as they get lower on the chain.
If you opt for a scarf, choose one in a muted pattern or color and stick to light materials, like chiffon. Avoid heavy, bulky scarves.

, For guys with double chins, picking out the right tie for an occasion can make a big difference. Bow ties hug the neck and draw extra attention to the area below your face. Long ties, on the other hand, encourage the eye to look further down and away from your chin.


Generally, you'll want to stick with a standard long tie instead of a super skinny one. A standard long tie keeps your features looking more balanced, while a skinny long tie can make your face, chin, and neck look oversized.

, Contouring is the art of applying different shades of foundation in a way that tricks the eye into seeing the fake shadows and lines on your face, thereby changing its overall perceived shape.


Apply a foundation that matches your skin tone to your entire face, all the way from your hairline to your neck. Blend it in well.
Pick out a second foundation that is two shades darker than your standard, skin tone foundation. Apply this foundation to your chin and jaw line. Use a foundation brush, pad, or your fingers to blend it in evenly., Pick out a matte bronzer and apply it to your neckline, around the base of your neck and collar. Avoid applying the bronzer to your chin area.


Avoid shimmering bronzers since they tend to look unnatural.
If you use bronzer on your cheeks, use the same shade for your neck. Doing so will make your look appear more natural.

, When applying lipsticks and lip gloss, go for ""nude"" or understated look. Since your lips are so close to your double chin, drawing attention to them can also invite attention to your chin.


Apply a hydrating lip balm, then layer a natural color lipstick or gloss on top.
Matte colors are preferred over glossy or sparkly colors.
If you want to give your lips a little more attention, you could outline them with a natural lip liner before applying a natural shade of lipstick or gloss. The liner should match your natural lip color.

, Use eyeliners, shadows, and mascaras to draw attention to your eyes. By inviting onlookers to look you straight in the eyes, you can subtly convince them to look away from your double chin.


Dress your eyes up, but don't get carried away. For daytime looks, stick with neutral eyeshadows, blended eyeliners, and a light coat of mascara.
For evening looks, you can glam your eyes up a bit more dramatically. Consider applying a smokey eye using shadows and liners, then top your look off with two coats of black volumizing mascara.

, By keeping your hair short, you can reduce the amount of bulk around your chin and neck.


Make sure that the cut you get does not curl under your chin, though. Onlooking eyes are naturally drawn to the end of a hairstyle, and if your hair style frames your double chin, it will draw more attention to it.
Long hair styles can also work as long as they are not excessively bulky around the neck. If you want to keep you hair long, make sure that it stays long enough to dip well below your collarbone.
Everyone's features are a little different, so for best results, talk to you hair stylist about the best cuts to mask your double chin.

, If you have long hair, consider styling it so that the bulk of your hair rests on top of your head instead of falling below your chin.


Stacking your hair on top of your head draws the attention toward the top of your face. As a result, your face and neck look longer, and your double chin will become less noticeable.

, Men have the option of hiding a double chin with a well-groomed beard. Just make sure that your beard is neatly groomed, trimmed, and stylish. Facial hair is a great way to mask a double chin, but a rugged or disorderly beard could backfire and make your overall appearance look sloppier.


You can still take advantage of this trick even if you do not want a full beard. Extend your shave line further down the neck, positioning and tilting the stubble to create a deeper shadow.This trick can elongate the appearance of your neck, thereby reducing the visual impact of a double chin.

, This is not an ideal method, but if someone is about to take a picture of you and you don't have time to prepare, it is one of the quickest fixes you can use.


Casually place your hands in front of the lower part of your face, just below your mouth and over your chin.
Duck behind someone taller so that his or her shoulder blocks the bottom part of your face and neck.
Use any other prop you have available to you that is large enough to hide behind without looking unnatural.

, If you feel comfortable with having a super close-up of the rest of your face, ask the person taking your photo to bring the camera in as close as possible.


Your face will need to be centered in the frame, and other parts may also need to be cut off. If you take a photograph where you can see past the top of your head and beyond the sides of your face, having your chin cut off in that photograph will seem like poor work or an obvious attempt to hide something.

, Angle your face so that it is at eye level with the camera. Tilt your head up and to the left or right to help conceal the excess skin from the lens.


It's also a good idea to simultaneously contract your jaw and neck muscles. Do so by pressing your tongue into the roof of your mouth. You won't be able to grin wide, but you should still be able to manage a natural smile.You can also elongate your neck by rolling or pushing your shoulders back a little.
Another trick to make your head tilt look natural is to stand next to someone or something tall. In such circumstances, an upward head tilt will make it look like you're simply trying to improve the overall composition of the photograph.

, Digital photo editing can hide or alter nearly anything, and a double chin is no exception to this rule. That being said, good photo editing is much harder than it looks. You can minimize the appearance of your double chin in a photo, but if you try to erase it from the photo completely, your tampering might be obvious.


If you lack photo editing experience, start by playing around with filters, exposures, and highlights. You can create interesting lighting effects on a photograph that look intentional and artistic, and some of these effects may also draw attention away from your chin in the picture.

Contour to create an optical illusion.,
Add drama to your eyes.,
Balance with blush.",How to Hide a Big Forehead2," Use a bronzer along your hairline that’s a shade darker than your foundation to create the impression of a smaller forehead.

Locate the problem lash.,
Use one finger to move the eyelash into the inner corner of your eye (toward your nose).,
Remove with a Q-Tip.,
Remove with your fingers.",How to Get an Eyelash Out of Your Eye2," For this method of removal, you need to set the stage by locating the eyelash and washing your hands.


Look in a mirror to see where in your eye the lash is located. You should use your fingers or a Q-Tip to remove only if the eyelash is on the white part and not the colored part of the eye. The colored part is more sensitive and you may want to see an eye doctor instead if the eyelash is there. Wash your hands. Use soap, and dry your hands completely. Washing your hands removes bacteria that you could otherwise get into your eye.

, Stand in front of a mirror as you do so, and keep your eyes open so you can see what you're doing. Don't push it all the way to the corner, just away from the center (pupil) of the eye.

, Make sure that the cotton of the Q-Tip has not loosened, as you don't want any particles coming off into your eye. If try this more than once, use a new Q-Tip for hygiene each time you touch your eye.


Moisten a Q-Tip by immersing the tip in saline solution. Saline solution will not hurt the eye. To get the Q-Tip wet, you can either unscrew the lid of a saline bottle solution, and dip the Q-Tip in, or pour a little into a bowl, and dip the Q-Tip into that.
Touch the Q-Tip gently to the eyelash. Keep your eye open while doing so. You may want to hold your eyelids open with the fingers of one hand while holding the Q-Tip with the other.
Remove the eyelash. Ideally, the eyelash sticks to the Q-Tip and is removed safely and easily. Simply pull the Q-tip directly backward, taking the eyelash with it.

, This method involves either swiping or pulling it out with your fingers. Make sure that your hands are clean and that you keep your eyes open.


Swipe the eyelash with one finger. You may want to hold the eyelids of the affected eye open with the fingers of your non-dominant hand. With one finger of the other hand, gently swipe the eyelash in a light sliding motion. Try not to blink. The eyelash should be dislodged from the eye by the motion of your finger.
Pull the eyelash with two fingers. If a simple swipe doesn't dislodge it, try gently pinning it between two fingers. Your fingers should rest gently on your eye as you pin the eyelash between them. Do not use this method if you have very long fingernails, as you may scratch your eye. Once you have the eyelash caught between two fingers, pull it gently directly outward.

Grab the top eyelid's lashes with your thumb and pointer finger.,
Pull your eyelid out and down over your lower eyelashes.,
Release your eyelid and let it slide back.",How to Get an Eyelash Out of Your Eye3," Pinpoint the location of the eyelash before trying this method. This works best if the eyelash is trapped in the top part of the eye.

, Pull the lid gently, not strongly. Your upper and lower lashes should brush against each other. Try blinking once or twice with your lid closed. It might help loosen the lash from the area it's stuck.

, Ideally, the motion of your lid against the eyeball as it moves dislodges the eyelash. It may stick to your lashes instead of the eye, from which you can remove it easily, or fall out of your eye as you open your lid.

, What do you wear most often? Fish out your favorites. Use these clothes as a template for what else you should buy.

, Buy clothes similar to the ones you love. Make sure nothing has curse words or innuendos. Buy some nice khaki and black pants. Do you love that blue tee? Then buy a professional shirt in the same shade. 'Upgrade' the clothes you have by changing the cut or style. Don't be afraid to buy fitted clothes.

, For girls, try nice jewelry in a single shade and neat fingernails. If you wear glasses, keep them clean and simple - you probably shouldn't buy the hot pink cat frames.

, Try out different ideas until you find something you like. Don't think that there's just one way to look smart/neat because that isn't true. If something isn't you then try something else.

, If you're trying to look smart then plain, well fitting clothes work best. Slogans, logos, faded clothes, rips and ""distressed"" fabrics tend to edge away from the smart look.

, Have a look through the magazines and books at the hairdressers when you go, or have a look on the internet to find something you like. If you want to make a good impression then try to keep your hair from falling over your face too much (if you have a style that does this then just clip it back, you don't need to get it cut if you like it!) as hiding your face will make people feel wary as they can't see your expression. How you style your hair will depend on your hair type, but as a general rule avoid anything which looks untidy and you should be okay.

, Large quantities of make-up doesn't usually look smart, once again this is simply a case of looking through magazines and finding a look you like but if you're not sure where to start then try some mascara, natural (minimal) foundation (if you need it)and lip gloss.

, Keep tattoos small and discreet. Keep body piercings to the ears and maybe belly button. Remember that you might want to cover these piercings and tattoos up someday!

Pull your hair away from your face.,
Clean your face.,
Mix the bleaching powder and developer.,
Test the bleach creme on your jawline.,
Apply the mixture.,
Keep an eye on the clock.,
Wipe away the creme from your eyebrows.",How to Bleach Your Eyebrows1," You can use a headband or a towel to keep your hair in place, or you can put longer hair into a tight ponytail. This will keep you from accidentally getting bleach on other hair.Even if you have very short hair, pulling it back from your face is a good idea, as stray hairs are likely to distract you.
Eyebrow bleaching is very detailed work, requiring your full attention.;
, Removing any makeup, dirt or oil from your skin before bleaching will help your bleaching be successful. To clean the tender area around your eyes, apply a make-up remover, and gently rinse clean with lukewarm water.If you've just had a shower, your skin will be easier to clean. The steam from a shower softens any oil that's clogged in your pores, making it easier to remove.
Pat your skin dry with a soft towel or cloth. Rubbing can irritate the delicate skin around your eyes.

, If your hair bleach is one of several popular commercial products, it will contain bleaching powder, liquid developer/peroxide, and an instruction manual for use. You should follow the instructions on how to do the mixing process, which will result in a creme that you can put on your eyebrows.Mix your powder and developer in a glass bowl, or another non-reactive container.
Stir it with a cotton swab until it's a smooth consistency.

, Doing a patch test to see how your skin will interact with the bleach will keep you from accidentally injuring yourself. Make sure you only use bleach creme intended for facial bleaching, because the skin on your face is more delicate than other areas.If you have very sensitive skin, use a milder bleach creme that's labeled for sensitive skin.
Testing the bleach creme on other body hair may also show the speed at which your hair will lighten, allowing for a more predictable lightening experience when you bleach your brows.

, Usually, commercial bleaching creme comes with a small applicator. You can also use a cotton swab if you've lost your applicator, or your bleaching creme doesn't come with one. You'll need to be gentle, but accurate, as you apply the creme to the eyebrow hairs you want bleached.Don't rub the creme into your skin.
Make sure the parts of your eyebrows you want bleached are covered evenly and completely.

, If this is the first time you've bleached your eyebrows, you might want to only leave the mixture on your eyes for a minute or two. Remember that the time that the bleach is on you eyes starts with the very first touch of the bleach.You can always apply more bleach, but once your eyebrows are bleached you'll have to wait for them to grow back before you can reapply.
Leave the bleach on your skin for no longer than 10 minutes, no matter how dark your brows are or how light you want them to be.

, A warm, wet washcloth is best for wiping off the bleaching product. Be careful not to rub your skin, which may be irritated by the bleach.Make sure to get all the bleach off.
Once you've wiped your brows well, look at your eyes in the mirror and check the results. If you need to reapply the bleaching creme, you can do this now.

Avoid rubbing your eyes.,
Wash your face daily, focusing on cleaning around your eyes.,
Wear less mascara.,
Use an eyelash curler in place of mascara when possible.,
Gently massage petroleum jelly through your lashes every night before bed.,
Have your eyelashes dyed.,
Try wearing fake eyelashes or eyelash extensions.",How to Get Perfect Eyelashes1," This can damage your lashes and irritate the follicles, causing hairs to bend or fall.;
, Use a gently face soap or moisturizing wipes to clear around your eyes and eye-lashes, removing gunk, dirt, and oil, for healthy and shiny lashes.

, If you wear mascara every day, your eyelashes won't grow as thick and full as they would otherwise because your hair needs to breathe. For best results, stop wearing mascara altogether or wear it occasionally. You can also purchase mascaras made of more gentle, less artificial ingredients that won't harm your eyelashes as much.


Never use water-proof mascara, as it chokes out your hairs and is very difficult to safely remove.
When you do wear mascara, always take it off before you go to bed. Use a gentle makeup remover or moisturizer with cotton pads to completely but gently remove all traces from your eyes.
Don't pump your mascara frequently, as it can cause it to dry out. If it is crusty or past the expiration date, throw it out.
Never share mascara, as it transfers oil and potentially bacteria from one eye to another.

, There are many different brands, and you can find them anywhere you can buy makeup. If you already have an eyelash curler, make sure that there the soft rubbery part is still in it and hasn't fallen out, as this can damage or pull out hairs.


Hold the curler down gently for 15 seconds on each eye.
Unclamp the curler slowly and carefully to prevent pulling out any hairs.

, If your eyelashes feel dry or you feel they aren't growing fast enough, you can try carefully moisturizing them with Vaseline before you go to bed. This helps heal any irritations and encourages growth.

, If your lashes are very light colored or you just want the impression of mascara without wearing it, you can dye your lashes black or dark brown. You can buy home kits but it is best to have it done professionally at a salon since you are using harsh chemicals near sensitive eyeballs. It is usually not expensive. Beware though that the dye will damage the lashes a little and doing it too often will keep them from growing properly.

, They take some practice applying and getting used to, but many women wear them every day. Better brands will last longer, but ever cheaper ones can be fine for a few wears. You can find a range of fake lashes to suit your tastes -- from subtle, pretty lashes to outrageous large lashes in fluorescent colors.


If you haven't worn them before it is best to practice putting cheap pairs first, as they can be tricky to get used to.

Put aloe vera or an ice pack on your threaded eyebrows.",How to Thread Your Eyebrows," To thread your eyebrows, you will need high-cotton sewing thread. Measure out a piece of thread that is as long as your forearm, plus three inches. It should be around 14 inches or 35 cm long.Using high-cotton sewing thread will ensure your eyebrow hairs do not snap off between the thread. High-cotton thread tends to grip hair better than synthetic thread.
Thread is the best thing to use for threading. Do not use floss or string as this will not be as effective as thread.;
, You will use the eyebrow scissors to trim your eyebrows before you thread them. You can also use small hair shears or small sewing scissors. You want scissors that will be small enough to trim your brows and sharp enough to get at the hairs., You will use the brush on your brows to prepare them for the threading. You can use a standard eyebrow brush or a fine toothed hair comb. Make sure the brush or comb is clean as you do not want to get bacteria or dirt in your brows before you thread them., You will use the pencil to draw the shape you want for your eyebrows. This will help to guide you as you thread your eyebrows. Go for an eyebrow pencil that is the same shade as your brows or slightly darker than your brows.You should also check that the eyebrow pencil will wash off with water or makeup remover so you can get rid of the outline once you are done threading your eyebrows.

, You will use the aloe vera or the ice pack to soothe your brows after you are done threading them. The aloe vera or ice pack will also help with any redness or irritation that develops due to the threading. You can use aloe vera from a bottle or a standard ice pack, wrapped in a clean towel., To prepare your eyebrows for threading, sit in front of a mirror with your supplies spread out before you on a table. Make sure the room has good lighting so you can clearly see your eyebrows in the mirror. This will make it easier to prepare and thread your brows.


Do not use a magnifying mirror, as this can lead to over threading. A standard mirror with good lighting will be fine.

, Take the eyebrow brush and sweep your eyebrow hair straight upward. Then, hold one section in place with the comb. Use the small eyebrow scissors to trim a very small amount of the tall hairs that stick out from the comb. Then, sweep your eyebrow hair downward with the comb and hold it in place again. Snip any long, standout hairs with the scissors.








Make sure you do not cut the hairs too short or trim too many of the hairs. You simply want to remove any overly long strands of hair so it is easier for you to thread your brows.
Repeat these motions on the other eyebrow so both eyebrows have been trimmed. Comb the hair back in place when you are done trimming them. They should appear more groomed and clean.

, Once you have trimmed your eyebrows, take the eyebrow pencil and carefully draw out the eyebrow shape you’d like to have. If your goal is to have full, clean looking brows, you may draw out a thicker arch and a higher brow line so you can follow the outline when you thread. Start from the inside of your brow and draw outward in a sweeping motion. Try to make the outline for each brow as even and symmetrical as possible.








Customize the outline based on your existing eyebrow shape. If you have thin arches to your eyebrows, for example, you may not draw a thinner arch outline. If you have a lot of extra hair growth around your eyebrow arches, you may draw a thinner arch outline so you can remove these extra hairs when you thread them.

, Hold the thread against your forearm and make sure it is long enough. Then, tie the two ends together to form a loop. Make sure the thread is tightly knotted together. Trim off any loose ends so you have a clean loop of thread.







, Hold one end of the loop with your thumb and forefinger. Let the other end hang motionless between your other thumb and forefinger. Twist the loop four to five times while holding one end of the loop with your thumb and forefinger.








You should eventually have a twisted section in the middle of the loop with the loop taunt between your thumb and forefinger on each hand. It will look like an hourglass or bow tie shape.

, Before you start threading your eyebrows, practice the threading motion with your hands. Open one hand with your thumb and forefinger positioned in the loop. Then, close the other hand. The loop’s center twist should move back and forth as you increase and decrease the distance between your thumbs and forefinger. This twisting motion will be what you will use to remove your eyebrow hairs.









You may need to practice this motion several times to get the hang of it. If you find the loop is too hard to control, you may try making a new loop that is shorter in length. You may find a shorter thread loop is easier to manipulate between your fingers.
You can also use your other fingers to help gain control of the loop. You can use the middle finger and ring finger of your dominant hand in addition to your thumb and forefinger to help you get the hang of manipulating the twisted center of the loop.

, Make sure you position the twisted center over your eyebrow, directly over the hairs you want to remove. Your fingers should be firmly positioned in the loop with your thumb and forefinger on one end and your thumb and forefinger on the other end.

, As you do this, open your other hand. Slide the twisted center against your skin slowly and firmly. The corners of the twisted center will grab your hairs and remove them as you open and close your hands.








Always thread your eyebrow hairs in the opposite direction of their growth. This will ensure the hair comes out easily and reduces your risk of developing ingrown hairs.
Do not tug too hard on your skin or press the twisted center too deep into your skin as this can lead to irritation and pain. Instead, glide the twisted center across your skin to remove the hairs.

, Once you finish one stroke and remove a section of hair, place the twisted center back to the starting position and do another stroke, removing another section of hair. Make sure you also remove any hair between your eyebrows with the thread, making sure you move the thread in the opposite direction of the hair’s growth.









You can remove a small amount of hair or a larger amount of hair depending on how quickly you glide the twisted center over the hair. You may start with a slow glide until you get the hang of the movements and can move more quickly.

, Once you finish threading both eyebrows, you may have some redness or irritation on your skin. Place some aloe vera or an ice pack wrapped in a towel over your brows to soothe them. The redness around your eyebrows should go away after about an hour.








After an hour, you should examine your eyebrows and check for any stray hairs you may have missed. You may use the threading to remove the stray hairs or pluck them out.
You can also fill in any gaps in your eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil to make them look fuller and more uniform.

Shape your eyebrows.,
Use good lighting and a regular mirror.,
Know where you will apply bleaching creme.",How to Bleach Your Eyebrows2," Using slanted-edge tweezers, pluck your eyebrows into the shape you prefer. Your eyebrows should frame your eyes, and so use your eyes as a guide for how to shape your brows. Your eyebrows should be poised directly above your tear duct, and the high point of your brow's arch should be in line with the outer side of your iris. The other end of your eye brow should end just outside an imaginary line drawn from the outer corner of your eye.Taking a shower or bath before shaping your eyebrows will open your hair follicles, making plucking easier.
If plucking is painful, consider applying a topical numbing creme to your brows prior to plucking.
Experts recommend refraining from plucking for 3 weeks, in order to avoid over-plucking.

, Magnifying mirrors can overemphasize your eyebrows, and you might pluck too many. Using a regular mirror in a well-lit room is the best way to pluck your eyebrows.


Take a step back periodically to see your eyebrows from a distance. This will give you a better sense of what your brows look like to other people.
Remember, other people will only be looking at your eyebrows in ordinary light.

, Many people choose to only apply bleach to the tops of their eyebrows, where plucking may result in unnatural looking lines. If you use bleach on the tops of your eyebrows, the result is a natural looking eyebrow where stray or dark hairs are lightened.Bleaching can also be used to lighten any hairs between your two eyebrows.
Be very careful whenever applying any chemical near your eyes. If you accidentally get bleach creme in your eyes, rinse with water immediately.

, Do this a couple of times. Make sure you get your bottom lashes too, even though they seem ""less important.""

, Allow the first coat of mascara to dry.

, Layering 2 different mascaras together will really open your eyes, since they are both formulated differently. If you don't have more than one mascara, you can just use the same one for two layers.

",How to Make Eyebrows Thicker," Use an eyebrow brush or a clean mascara wand to sweep your eyebrow hairs to the sides, from the inner edge to the outer edge. This will help you determine the natural shape of your eyebrows, so you'll be able to identify places where you'd like more thickness and places that need to be trimmed back., Take an eyebrow pencil or another straight object and line it up from the edge of your nostril to the inside corner of your eye. The place where the pencil passes over your brow is typically where the brow line should start. If your brow starts to the inside of this line, you may want to grow in the hair or fill it in. Repeat on the other side.









If your brow starts to the outside of the line (toward the center of your nose), you have the choice to either pluck the hair outside the line or leave it in place for a fuller style.

, Now take the pencil and line it up from the edge of your nostril to the outside corner of your eye. The place where the pencil passes over your brow is typically where the brow line should end. If your brow doesn't extend all the way to the line, you may want to grow out the hair or fill it in. Repeat on the other side.









If your brow extends past the line (toward your temple), you have the choice to either pluck the hair outside the line or leave it in place for a fuller style.

, Hold the pencil to your face and line it up from the corner of your nostril right past the pupil of your eye. The end of the pencil should pass over the place where your natural eyebrow arch is located. You'll want to fill in your brow around this area to create a thicker appearance. Repeat on the other side.









Many people pluck the hair on the underside of the arch to create a more defined look. The choice is yours, but if you're aiming for a thicker look, you may not want to pluck anything but stray hairs in the area.

, You have the choice to use an eyebrow pencil, powder or cream to fill in the gaps where your eyebrow hair is sparse. Choose a filler that's the exact same color as your eyebrows, so the final look will be as natural as possible. If you don't have a special brow filler, choose a matching eyeliner pencil or eyeshadow.Powders will create a softer, natural look, while pencils create a defined look.
If you have fair hair and want a bolder brow, choose a filler that's a shade or two darker than your eyebrows.

, Use tip of the pencil (or a liner brush dipped in powder) to faintly and carefully outline the shape of your eyebrows. Connect the three points you identified: the inner brow, the arch, and the outer brow. Make sure the line stays close to your natural brow so you don't end up with a ""drawn-in"" look.









This may take a bit of practice, so don't be afraid to wipe off the outline and start over.
Remember to use a light hand; even just a bit of color will make your brows look thicker.

, Use the pencil, powder or gel to go back and fill in the areas with sparse hair that fall inside the outlines you made. Take a step back to ensure that your brows look natural and evenly filled, and that both sides are the same shape and size.








, Use a clear eyebrow gel to hold the powder or pencil marks in place so they don't wipe off during the day. Use an eyebrow brush to brush the gel through your eyebrows, then let it completely dry. The gel helps to distribute the color evenly and creates a beautiful final appearance.








, Many people are afraid to stop, since the grow-out period for brows can be a little uncomfortable during that awkward in between stage. Eyebrows can take up to six weeks to grow in, so you'll have to practice patience to get the thicker brows you want. Do what it takes to wait it out, since removing those hairs will never help you reach your goal.


You may be tempted to pluck a hair here or there in order to keep things looking neat, but it's advisable to grow out all of your eyebrow hair to see what you've got to work with before you resume plucking or waxing.

, When your hair starts growing back in, it may have the appearance of stubble. If you're worried about how it looks, try the following trick to mask the baby hairs as they're growing in:









Apply a layer of wet foundation or concealer over the hair that's growing in.
Apply powdered foundation in the same color. The powder will stick to the moist surface and provide a double-layered masking effect.

, Thinning or patchy brows can be the result of overplucking. You can encourage your brows to grow back in by using a soft toothbrush or washcloth to gently exfoliate the area. Wet the brush or cloth and move it over your brows in a circular motion to stimulate circulation and improve growth.

Measure your inside brow.,
Find the right length.,
Find your arch.,
Create the right shape.,
Remove the extra hair.,
Trim your brows.",How to Arch Eyebrows1," The inside of your brow, the starting point, needs to be in just the right place to help give shape to your face and brighten your eyes. Avoid the appearance of a unibrow by starting your eyebrows too close together, or making them sparse by starting too far away.









Hold a brow pencil or tweezers vertically, aligned with the inside corner of your eye. The intersection of this line and your brow is where you should start your brow.
This line should be near the bridge of your nose, and should not go over.
When you have found the perfect starting point, make a mark with your brow pencil.;
, Although some people have longer, fuller brows while others have short, sparse brows, there is an ideal eyebrow length that applies for everyone.









Take your brow pencil or tweezers to make another measurement. Start one end of your pencil at the corner of your nose, lining it up with the outside corner of your eye.
The place the pencil extends past the edge of your eye is the ideal length for you eyebrow. Mark this with your eyebrow pencil.

, Line up your pencil with the corner of your nostril and the center of where your pupil would be if you were looking straight ahead. The extension of the pencil into your brow is where your arch should be.









This should be the equivalent of about ¾ of the way into your eyebrow from the starting point.
Your arch should not be in the center or near the end of your eyebrow. This shape will give the illusion of surprise or boredom.
Your arch should always have a natural curve, never a sharp angle.

, Use your eyebrow pencil to fill in all of the brow from you're starting to ending point. Follow the natural thickness of your brows, but feel free to thin them if they are very bushy or too thick to your liking.









Filling in your brows before removing hair will help you to not remove too much, and to be more conscientious of the shape.
You want your brows to be at least as wide as three brow-pencil strokes. Too thin, and they won’t have the ability to frame your face.

, Using angled tweezers, pull the hairs from outside of your shaped brow. Avoid pulling too many from above, as doing so can drastically alter the shape and angle, making them too low. Instead, pluck on the bottom and outside edges of your eyebrow.









Pull hairs from the base to avoid simply breaking off the tops of hairs.
Tweeze hairs in the center of your eyebrows above your nose, to help remove the possibility of a unibrow.
Don’t forget to pull out the soft, peach fuzz hair that often covers the upper part of the eyelid. This can give the appearance of untamed brows if it is not removed.

, Using a small pair of eyebrow or hair scissors, trim the tops of any hairs that stick out above the natural top of your brow.









Typically, the hairs closes to the center of your face grow upwards and may need to be trimmed to match the average height of your brow.
If your eyebrows are very unruly and long, use a brow comb or spooly brush to brush the hairs up, and then trim the longest ones.
Avoid trimming off too much hair, as doing so can give jagged lines to the hairs in your brows. Only trim if you have hairs that are too long. "

Decide what shape your eyebrows should be to complement your face.,
Pluck any stray hairs not included in your ideal brow.,
Start at the bottom of the eyebrow.,
Trim your eyebrows carefully.,
Make your brows slightly different.",How to Fix Bushy Eyebrows1," Take a pencil and rest it vertically on one side of your nose. Where the pencil rests between your eyebrows is where the eyebrow on that side should reach. If your eyebrow is shorter than where the pencil falls, you can lightly fill it in with a brow pencil or powder.


Next, tilt the pencil on your nose toward the eye that is on that side while keeping the base of your pencil on the nostril. Once your pencil crosses over your pupil, stop and look where the pencil reaches. The arch of your eyebrow should be where the pencil stopped over your pupil.
Lastly, keeping the bottom of the pencil on your nostril, continue to tilt your pencil to touch the outside corner of the eye on that side. Where your pencil lands should be end of your eyebrow. Like the beginning of your eyebrow, you can always fill in the ends if they do not reach the pencil. If they go past the pencil, pluck the ends to wear they feel comfortable.;
, Use a pair of tweezers and a magnification mirror, and carefully remove any hairs found outside the line of your drawn brow. Match the curve of the bottom of the brow to the top. The end of the brow should be around the end of your eye socket.


Do not thin out the head of the brows. It should be the thickest part. Also, do not remove hair from the top of the brow unless you have any especially insane hairs. Use the natural shape of the top of the brow to shape your arch.

, Go slowly, taking breaks to see how thin they are becoming. Make sure you don't over-do it. After cleaning up the bottom row of hairs, look at the top of your eyebrows. Many salons suggest not plucking the top of your eyebrows, but this can be helpful to those who have a 'jagged' look to their eyebrows. Plucking the stray hairs from the top will help your eyebrows look neater.

, If you are doing this at home, use an eyebrow brush to sweep your eyebrow hairs upward. While holding the hair up, begin to lightly trim the hairs that stick up above your eyebrow with a pair of sheers. Be very careful to avoid trimming them too short. Repeat this process while brushing the hairs downward and trimming.


While this is possible at home, it is advised to go to a professional for this to avoid accidentally cutting hair too short and creating a ""hole"" in your eyebrow.

, Your eyebrows should not be identical. Use the differences of their natural shapes and the placement of your nose and eyes to guide your plucking. Unlike with most makeup looks, finish one brow before working on the other. At the end, you can compare them both and make sure they look compatible.

",How to Make Your Eyebrow Hairs Straight Instead of Curly," Just like when you are finding a new hairstyle to try, the safest route is to map out what inspires you. This especially helps when going to a professional because no matter how well we think we can articulate what exactly we want, the stylist may have a completely different perception. Play it safe and bring pictures your stylist can work from in order to avoid any misinterpretations.


Ask someone someone with a look that you admire where she got her eyebrows done. If she did it herself, use local review or social media sites to do your due diligence in finding a professional. Factor in method, location, and customer service into the budget you’re willing to spend.;
, Brushing your eyebrows up and out will make them look full and natural but it will also give you a sense of how long they are and what stray hairs need to be removed in order to achieve what you want.

, Wash your hands with antibacterial soap, disinfect tools with hygienic solution, and remove make-up with water-based makeup remover. When removing hairs there may be a chance for infection so be safe by keeping your skin and tools clean and sanitary., Tweezers are an easy tool for plucking individual strands of eyebrow hair that may have grown astray. Use a sharp and slanted tweezer along with a mirror in a well lit room to pick out any loose hairs. Slanted tweezers ensure you don’t pinch at the skin when trying to pluck stray hairs from their root. Take your time and pick individual hairs working inward from your eyebrow.A hasty approach can cause you to pluck several hairs at once making your eyebrows look patchy and cause you some unwanted pain. If you have over plucked, don’t repeat until you have given your eyebrows at least a month to grow back into its natural shape.
Use a concealer to find out how your eyebrows will look after you have plucked the unwanted hairs.Tweeze after a shower or washing your face with hot water. Warm water softens your hair and opens the follicles so that your hair is easier to remove.
If you have a lot of hair that needs to be removed, you may want to use a razor, wax, or another method that removes a lot of hair quickly. Research which method appeals to you as each have their own pros and cons.

, Trimming is the main step in dealing with your curls by using a combination of brushing, plucking and trimming to create the overall shape.Scissors can cut off curly tips that may seem unruly to the rest of your eyebrow. Research which brow scissors are best for the look you are trying to achieve and trim slowly.


Using tweezers and scissors may be tedious so don’t get stuck on minute details that can only be seen with a magnifying glass or up close against a mirror. If you have to strain to point out an imperfection then it won’t be visible from a normal distance.
Trimming is a one time deal so don’t do it unless you are confident. If you have overdone it, allow your hair at least a month to grow back before attempting it again.

, Once you have shaped your eyebrows, apply eyebrow wax to straighten out the rest of your curls. This will lock in the shape as well as straighten out the curl.If you are using waxing as a means to remove excess hairs rather than tweezers, it can be painful and irritate sensitive skin. If you are unsure how your skin will react and have the time, use professional waxing services., Apply brow gel on top of the wax to lock your curly eyebrows in the straight position. Having the wax base allows the gel to adhere to it as it keeps your eyebrows in place.Use an eyebrow stick or brush to help apply the gel over your eyebrows but avoid placing the gel on the tip of your eyebrows. Cover the area with special absorbing eyebrow film and a towel for 15 minutes but check every couple of minutes to ensure the hairs are placed in the right direction. Wipe off any excess product from the brush before applying.
After 15 minutes remove the film and towel and use a dry cotton swab to remove unsightly gel.
Brow pomade works just as well as gel. Just like hair products, eyebrow gel and pomade will hold your hair in place but provide different looks. Brow gel can make your eyebrows look and feel hard and crunchy while pomade won’t., Use massage oil, coconut oil, or even olive oil to further straighten your eyebrows. Massage in a single direction rather than circular in order to keep the straightness. Use your fingertips and repeat every night before bed.Remove the oil from your face each morning by washing your face with hot water and dabbing your eyebrows dry with a towel. Make sure not to rub but dab in order to keep the straightness.

, Employ the bristles and chemicals in clear mascara to help shape your eyebrows and keep them in place. Mascara that is the same shade as your eyebrows can fill in any sparseness if you’re attempting a fuller look., Use tiny hair like strokes when applying the colour. Eyebrow pencils that are the same colour as your hair or darker create an unnatural solid look. Give your eyebrows dimension by using a lighter colour.Don’t use your eyebrow pencil where there isn’t hair. This can draw unwanted attention to an unfavourable look.

, To keep from trapping hairs that are too long, brush brows up and then trim any that stick out over the top of your natural brow line.

, Using the same process as you did to form the ""X” in the string, twist one end of the thread between 10-15 more times, as you like.









To remove hairs, you will catch them in the twists you’ve created in the thread. Having been caught, you will pull up to remove them.

, Having eyebrows that don’t match your hair color is very common, especially if you have light hair. To help even out your hair color, apply an eyebrow tint to darken them to a natural tone.









You can get an eyebrow tint done at local spas and salons, or you can buy a kit to do it yourself from a beauty supply store.
Be sure to apply it to your entire eyebrow and let it sit for the right amount of time so that the tint is effective.
Tint is not as strong as straight-up hair dye, and will rinse out over time. If you have an accident and need to remove the tint however, you can use nail polish remover on a q-tip to gently wipe it off.

, Whether from a salon accident or genetics, sometimes uneven or misshapen eyebrows come up. To fix them, it is very important to let them grow in. Hands off your tweezers for at least three weeks!


Your hair grows in stages, so waiting at least three weeks will give enough time for hair at every stage to grow in.
Create a very clear shape, and stick to it. Be careful about getting absorbed looking at your eyebrows close-up without seeing the big picture. Take a step back from the mirror occasionally to check that your shape is in line.
Don’t change the shape of your brow often. This will make it look odd over time. Stick with one, natural looking shape and maintain it.

Then take the (prepped) toothbrush and comb your eyebrow into shape.


Use only the top end of the bristles to fine-tune the arch and the corner of your eyebrow. You don't have to do it all again for the second brow, simply comb it as well.
If your eyebrows are really wild, put a very tiny amount of hairspray on it as well.

, Use an eyebrow pencil to draw the shape that you want. Then, use tweezers to pluck the hairs that seem out of place, then quickly comb your brows with dry toothbrush. Fill in gaps with an eyebrow pencil and then smoothing it in to blend with the rest of your brow.


Be sure to make sure that those really long hairs on the edge aren't based in the middle. If they are, you can snip them, but be careful that you keep things even.
Get a close-up magnification mirror to help with this process. This really helps locate some of those little annoying hairs.

, Use home wax strips, not cold or hot wax to avoid potential eye hazards. If you decide to wax completely, look up videos on how to draw eyebrows so you do it right, and try several methods over the weekend. Be sure to make them look natural, and get a pencil colour that matches your hair tones.


Take it easy on the waxing. It's easy to over-do it, and leave yourself looking witchy.

, Most nail salons offer this service, and it is generally not expensive. However, you may want to ask your friends for recommendations on your local salons, as a bad wax can be very painful. After the wax, the esthetician will probably apply some creams and tweeze any stray hairs. This is a great option if you're looking for shape to your eyebrows but do not know how to get your desired look.

, Next, prepare to do the upper region of one brow. Only wax one brow at a time so that you can concentrate on what you’re doing. You don’t want any of it to get in your eye! If you feel jittery at all doing it yourself, then stop and have someone else it apply it for you.







, Only microwave for 10 to 15 seconds, 5 to 10 seconds if less than half is in the jar. Don’t let it come to a boil, though, which it can easily. Stir to make sure it’s evenly heated. (It should be the consistency of warm honey.) 







, Quickly but carefully, while the wax is still warm, glide the wax on the hair that you want removed above the brow. Next, place a strip of fabric over the area, press firmly and rub over it going in the same direction that the hair grows. Let it set for a few seconds, and then pull it off. But don’t worry! It only grabs the hair, not the skin, so it shouldn’t be painful.







, Then, using the comb side, gently comb the hair upwards. Trim any excess and long hairs (only the ones sticking over the comb) by cutting straight across with the scissors. Be careful to not cut into the actual brow. 







, You’re working with a small area. Be careful you don’t get wax on the area you just finished! If you do, though, just dab a little baby oil on it to remove it.

Pluck any stray hairs around your brows.,
Visit a professional.",How to Use Eyebrow Pencil1," Hold a pencil point up and vertical against your nose to see where your eyebrow should begin. The edge of the pencil that is closer to your nose marks the line where your brow should start. If it goes beyond that point, you should use tweezers to remove the excess hair. If it falls short, you will probably want to extend it to that point.Use a white makeup pencil or a very light stroke from your brow pencil to mark this spot if you don't want to lose its precise location when you move the pencil.;
, Ideally, your eyebrow should end at a 45-degree angle from the outer corner of your eye. Still holding the pencil against the side of your nostril, pivot the point of the pencil away from your nose and to the outer corner of your eye. That is where the tail of your eyebrow should be.You can mark this spot with a light dot from your brow pencil, using that as a guide for tweezing or penciling in your brow later., Look straight forward and line up the outer edge of the pencil with the outer edge of your iris to find where your arch should begin.Mark this spot with your white pencil so that you can find it easily for tweezing or penciling.

, Hold the pencil horizontally across the tops of your brows to check that they are about the same height.If they are not, don't immediately try to pluck them to the same size. You'll use the pencil later to build them up to a similar height.

, Use the shape of your face to help you determine the best eyebrow shape for your features.


If you have a round face, a sharp, high angle will open your eyes and elongate and balance the face.You can get away with most shapes if you have an oval face. If your face is very long, try extending the length of your brows and don't fill them too much or too dark.A heart-shaped face can be a challenge--too shaped or angled can be harsh and accentuate your forehead. Try a lower, straighter arch that follows your brow bone.If you have a square face, full, even dark, brows will balance out your angular jaw., You can enhance your eyes by grooming your brows in a way that best accentuates the spacing of your eyes.









If you have wide-set eyes, keep brows fairly natural. Focus more on grooming than on shaping and plucking.If your eyes are close together, leave the hair closest to your nose alone. Instead of making your eyes look wider, it will highlight their closeness. Extend your brows with a long, wide arch and don't go too thin or sharp., If the tail of your eyebrow is longer than the point you marked, remove those hairs. Clean up the hairs that are outside your natural arch. Just don't get crazy and over-pluck. The lines of your brow don't have to be totally precise--this can look dated and severe. A feathered appearance is more natural.







, If you are having trouble shaping your brows, a professional can help. Visit a brow bar or a salon and, once they have revealed your groomed eyebrows, you can easily do upkeep with tweezers.

",How to Use a Brow Brush," There are three basics brow brushes: the spoolie, the mascara brush, and the slanted brow brush. Each brush has a distinct shape and serves a different purpose.


The spoolie brush is essentially a mascara applicator. This spiraled-bristle brush is used to shape your brows and blend your eyebrow filler.
The mascara comb is a double sided tool. Its plastic comb is used to brush through eyelashes; its thick bristle brush is used to tame and shape brows.
The angled brow brush, also known as the slanted liner brush, is used to apply eyebrow filler. You may also use the slanted tip brush to apply eye liner to your lids. ;
, There are several different forms of brow fillers on the market. Choose the product that will help you achieve the look you desire.


If you have defined eyebrows with minor gaps, use an eyebrow pencil. Select a brow pencil that is blend-able—it shouldn’t be extremely soft or too waxy. Apply this filler with light, small strokes to mimic the look of hair.
If you are looking to soften and fill your sparse brows, use a brow powder one shade lighter than your natural hair color. In addition to thickening your brows, you can use powders to add shape and definition to your brows. This product is applied with an angled brush.
If you are looking to highlight your brows with a bold color, use a brow pomade. Apply this thick product sparingly to your brows with an angled makeup brush. Pomades are very tricky to work with and should only be used after mastering the application of brow pencils and powders.
If you are concerned about your brow makeup smudging or fading, consider using a brow pencil. Apply this product with light, feathery strokes.
If you want to maintain the shape of your brows throughout the day, use a clear or tinted brow gel. You can use brow gels in combination with other products., If you are using a powder or pomade, dip your angled brush into the the product and tap off the excess. When applying the filler, start in the center and work your way out to the edges. This method of application will allow you to avoid creating an extremely severe brow.


Place your pencil, pen, or brush at the arch of your eyebrow.
Move the applicator out towards your nose and upwards towards your forehead in short, feathery motions. Do not draw straight lines.
Return your applicator to the arch.
Move the applicator out towards your ear and upwards towards your forehead in short, feathery motions.
Repeat on the other brow. Do not draw straight lines., After filling in your brows, you may notice patches of color of misplaced hairs. You can correct both issues with a brow brush or spoolie. Pull the brush or spoolie upwards and through your brows several times.Whenever you brush your brows, brush them upwards., A light concealer applied around the edge of your eyebrows will make your handiwork pop. Additionally, the concealer define the lines of your brows, making them look professionally done.


Use a flat brush outline the underside of each eyebrow with concealer.
Use the applicator to create a crisp line along the top of each brow..

, Elevate your look with a dash of shimmery eyeshadow directly under your brow. Dip your eyeshadow brush into a neural iridescent shade and tap of the excess powder. Lightly apply the eyeshadow from the outer base of the arch to the end of the brow.

, Brow gels are designed to prevent your eyebrow makeup from smudging or fading. Unscrew the brush and wipe off any excess product on the side of the bottle. Lightly comb through your brows in an upwards motion.


Instead of brow gel, you can use a spritz of hairspray on a disposable spoolie., While everyone has a natural brow shape, it is possible to transform your brows into a shape that complements your features. Individuals with angular features can soften their look with a round brow. Individuals with round faces may with to intensify their look with a sharply arched brow., Carefully examine each of your brows for stray hairs. Use your tweezers to pluck away stray hairs above and below your brows. Do not alter the shape of your brows.If you need to trim or thin your brows, do so with a spoolie brush and a pair of brow scissors. Use the spoolie brush to direct your hair upwards and out. Trim the excess hair that falls above your brow line with a pair of scissors laid horizontally across the top of the brow. Next, use the spoolie brush to bring the hairs down and out. Trim the long hairs that fall below your brow line with a pair of scissors., There are three important areas of the brow to consider when shaping and filling in your eyebrows: the starting point, the peak, and the ending point. To identify each of these points, follow these steps:


To locate the start of your brow, place a brush vertically along the outside of your nostril so that the top of the brush intersects your brow. Your brows should begin at this point. Remove any hairs that fall beyond the brush (towards the center of your face) with a pair of tweezers.
To locate the peak of your brow, slide the brush diagonally across your brow until the brush reaches the outer edge of your iris. This point of your brow should be the highest part of the arch.
To locate the end of your brow, slide the brush diagonally until it reaches the outer corner of your eye. If any hairs fall beyond the point, remove them with a tweezers; if your brow does not extend to this point, you can add length to your brow with a filler.
You may mark these three points on each of your eyebrows with a small dot of filler.,"

Take a hot shower or apply a hot washcloth.,
Comb the hair up with a fine-tooth comb or toothbrush.,
Trim the hair with eyebrow or nail scissors.,
Comb eyebrows down and trim.",How to Trim Eyebrows (for Men)1," Hot water opens your pores and will loosen hairs that are close to coming out. Take a shower as you normally would, or get a washcloth wet with hot water and press it against your eyebrows for two or three minutes.








If the washcloth gets cold before a few minutes is up, get it hot again.
When you’re in a time crunch, this is not absolutely necessary, but when you have time, it helps make the process work better.;
, Take an eyebrow comb (or a clean toothbrush) and comb the hair straight up. Start from the bridge of your nose and move outward until you reach the end of your eyebrow. Use the comb as necessary to hold the hair in that position when you trim the hairs.








In a pinch, you can use your finger to “comb” the eyebrow hairs upward, but a comb or toothbrush gets between the hairs and is much more effective.

, Look at your eyebrow and notice hairs that stick up higher than the rest of the eyebrow. Start at the outside end of the brow, and cut the long hairs along the top line of your eyebrow.








You want to use eyebrow or nail scissors because they are sharper and narrower than standard all-purpose scissors. Never use kitchen or craft scissors to cut your eyebrows.

, As a final check on overall eyebrow hair length, comb the hairs straight down. Check for hairs that are much longer than the overall length of the eyebrow. Carefully trim those long hairs so that they line up with the rest of the bottom of the eyebrow."

",How to Tint Eyebrows," Go to your local drugstore or beauty supply store and find an eyebrow tinting kit. This kit will come with everything you need to tint your eyebrows.


Think carefully about what color you choose. The darker your hair, the darker the shade of tint you should get. Blondes shouldn't get black eyebrow tint, as the contrasting shades would clash.;
, It's advised to shape your eyebrows before you tint them. Use whatever method you normally use to shape your eyebrows, be it trimming, tweezing, waxing or another. Do this a day before you dye your eyebrows., Use makeup remover to remove any makeup from your eyebrows and gently clean them with a damp cotton pad. Brush them down with a spoolie.

, To prevent the tint from dying your skin, apply petroleum jelly on the skin around your eyebrows.

, Eyebrow tinting kits vary on what they come with and how they are mixed. Follow the instructions on the kit you've chosen to mix the dye and the conditioner. Some kits come with a black and a brown paste. If you want darker eyebrows, put a dab of each into a paper cup. If you want lighter eyebrows, only use a dab of brown. Also add as many drops of eyebrow tint developer or conditioner as recommend by the kit instructions, then mix.Your kit might come with its own mixing cup. If so, you can use that. Otherwise, you can use any small cup or plate.
Some kits will come with a spatula or wooden sticks to mix the tinting components. You can either use that or a small brush., Brush the tint onto your eyebrows using an eyebrow brush. Use whatever application device the kit came with, most likely a wooden stick. Thoroughly coat your eyebrows from the inside to the outside corner. First concentrate on the center of the brow, then go back over, focusing on the smaller hairs along the edge.

, If you didn't use petroleum jelly to avoid getting tint on your skin, you can use a q-tip and some eye makeup remover solution to clean up the tint around your eyebrows. Slowly drag the q-tip along the edge of your brow to give it a nice, clean line.

, This step is optional. If your eyelashes are light colored, you might want to apply some of your tint to them so that they better match your soon to be tinted brows. Take your spoolie and bend it so that it's angled. Then dip it in your tint and apply it slowly to your eyelashes, being careful not to get any in your eye.

, Read the instructions for your kit to determine how long it takes, then set a timer, and wait. Timing the wait is very important if you want your brows to match.

, Once the colour has set, remove it using a wet cotton pad. Again, start from the inside and work your way outside. Remove the tint thoroughly, making sure none remains on your eyebrow hairs. You'll need to apply some pressure. Once the tint is gone, remove the petroleum jelly as well.

, Once you've removed all the tint from the first brow, start over on the second brow. Make sure you apply the tint just as thoroughly, wait just as long, and remove it completely.,"

Repeat these same steps to do the opposite brow.",How to Wax Your Eyebrows at Home2," Two teaspoons brown sugar, one teaspoon honey, one teaspoon water, butter knife or Popsicle stick, and cloth strips for peeling the mixture off.

, You can also heat it up on the stove if you don’t have a microwave.

, You need to find the right balance, though. If you don’t heat it long enough, it will be too soft and sticky. If you heat it too long, it turns into hard candy. You may have to experiment with a few batches until you get it right. Generally, 30 to 35 seconds is good.


It will take longer to heat if you’re using the stove.

, This part is also important. You won’t know if you’ve heated it too much until it cools down. If it’s too thick, dilute it with a little water.

, For safety reasons, only do one brow at a time. And if you feel jittery at all doing it yourself, stop and ask someone to apply for you.

, Press and smooth it in the same direction as the hair. Let it set for several seconds. Next, pull the cloth off in the opposite direction from the hair. Know ahead of time that sugar wax is not as painful as paraffin wax can sometimes be!.

, Remember you’re working with a small area. Be careful to not accidentally get wax on the area you just finished! If you do, though, it’s not the end of the world, just dab a little baby oil on it to take it off.

Repeat these steps for the hair underneath the brow.",How to Wax Your Eyebrows at Home3," Most waxing kits contain a pre-wax cleanser, a waxing applicator, paraffin wax, wax warmer, and pellon strips or muslin. Along with these items, it’s also good to have baby powder, tweezers, small scissors and baby oil, which is a great wax remover should you get it anywhere other than where you want!, Shape and trim your eyebrows. If your eyebrows are less than a one-quarter inch in length, they probably won’t be long enough to wax., Wipe the cleanser off with a damp washcloth. Also put a little baby powder in the palm of one hand, pinch a bit out and sprinkle some onto both brows. This helps to absorb any excess moisture so that the strip and wax adhere well., If the kit you’re using doesn’t have a warmer, then you can eat it in the microwave or in a small container on the stove.

, For obvious safety reasons, only wax one brow at a time so that you can concentrate on what you’re doing. If you feel jittery at all doing it yourself, then stop and have someone else it apply it for you. Using the applicator, apply the wax in the same direction that the hair grows. Make sure it covers the entire area; though it’s not necessary to make it too thick either., Leave a little extra on the side to help you remove it. Using your fingers, rub over the strip in the same direction as the hair. Allow it to set for several seconds., Don’t pull up though. Just pull straight across. If any hair remains, replace the strip and pull again. Be prepared. If you’re not used to how tweezing feels, it could be a little painful.To help with redness, put a soothing moisturizer on the brow. Aloe vera works well. Wipe off after a few minutes.

, If there’s any excess hair, remove with a tweezer. If there’s any remaining wax, remove with baby oil. Follow these same steps to wax the other eyebrow.

Choose an eyebrow pencil.,
Sharpen your pencil to a fine point.,
Fill out your brows with light, upward strokes of the pencil.,
Blend the color with a spoolie or brow brush.,
Finish with a brow wax or gel.",How to Use Eyebrow Pencil2," For most people, a shade of taupe will work, and is the best starting point for color. Taupe gives dark brows some depth and it doesn't overwhelm lighter hair.Test different shades on the side of your hand so you can see if the shade has warm or cool undertones. If you have red or strawberry-blonde hair, warm (red or orange-ish) tones will look good. Other hair colors should stick with cooler undertones (blues, greys, and rosey pinks).Blondes should try light taupe or a pencil one or two shades darker than their natural hair color.Brunettes should choose a pencil that one to two shades lighter than your hair color. Don't try black or a shade darker than your hair unless you want some angry, evil-looking brows.Those with raven black hair should still keep away from the black pencil. Instead, try dark brown or taupe.Redheads should try taupe and medium brown.Grey-haired gals should go for light brown or taupe instead of another shade of grey., You are not coloring your brow in a solid line--rather, you are trying to draw what look like many individual hairs. You can use a sharpener for eyeliner and brow pencils, but a sharpener for regular pencils will work, too.








If your pencil is too soft or crumbles, keep it in the refrigerator between uses and it should hold together., Focus on sparse areas, feathering the pencil strokes so they resemble natural hair.The pigment should be concentrated on the arch and the tail of your eyebrow--the thicker area that is closer to your nose should be lighter and a little less dense.








If you found your brows were different heights, use the pencil to add hair to the top of the lower brow, instead of trying to even them out by tweezing the higher one.Remember the saying that your eyebrows are sisters, not twins. They won't look exactly alike, and that's okay.

, Again, using light strokes, brush the spoolie through your brow, from front to tail. This will soften and shade the color, making the brow look more natural.








Remember to focus the color on your arch and tail of your eyebrow.

, Keep your freshly groomed eyebrows in place using a brow wax or gel.








If you have made a mistake or want to highlight your brows and brighten your eyes, use a small brush to carefully line under your brow with concealer. Make sure you blend this down toward your lids so it looks natural and not severe.For small mistakes, erase with the tip of a cotton swab dipped in concealer."

Prepare your skin and brows.,
Sketch the shape of your eyebrow.,
Sharpen your pencil to an extra fine point.,
Draw in hair.,
Add makeup or brow sealing solution.,
Try microblading.",How to Use Eyebrow Pencil3," Cleanse your skin thoroughly, wiping off any excess moisturizer. Dab your brows with translucent powder. The powder will give your makeup something to grip on to, allowing it to keep its definition and stay on longer.







, Use a small, angled brush dipped in brow powder or eyeshadow to very lightly sketch the shape of an eyebrow. You can use the pencil trick from method one to determine precisely where your brow should begin, arch, and end, or you can eyeball it.








Drawing very lightly will allow you to easily erase the shape of the brow if you've made a mistake.
You don't need it to be perfect--too precise an eyebrow won't look as natural., This is essential for drawing natural-looking hair. Keep a sharp point throughout the process, and make sure you sharpen when switching to your other brow.








Don't try this with an eyeliner pencil instead of a brow pencil--it will smear and rub off.

, Use light, upward strokes to draw little fake hairs on top of the shaded brow you already drew. This layering will help create a 3-D effect and make your brows look more realistic.








Use a cotton swab to soften the edges a little, giving your brows a more natural look., Dab a little more powder over your drawn-on eyebrows and finish with a makeup or brow sealing solution. The powder and sealer will ensure your brows don't smudge or get rubbed or sweated off during the day.









If the sealer is too shiny, use a brush to lightly dust translucent powder over the area, dulling the shine., As an alternative to using a pencil everyday, you can get your brows temporary tattooed on in a process called microblading. Hairlike strokes will be tattooed on to look like additional eyebrow hair. Consult a professional to ask about trying this process."

Pluck hairs from the root.,
Use eyebrow tweezers to remove hairs past the outside end.,
Pluck the hairs that grow between the two brows.,
Remove hairs that grow above and below the eyebrow.",How to Trim Eyebrows (for Men)2," Plucking is generally painful, so be aware of that when you begin. If you pluck partway along the hair it will break rather than pluck cleanly out. Be cautious that you don’t start plucking hairs that are part of the main shape of your eyebrow. There’s a risk of over-plucking if you get caught up in it., Use the comb to line your eyebrows up as they usually grow, outward toward your temples. Pluck hairs whose root is clearly past the end of the main portion of the eyebrow. Only pluck hairs that grow alone, separate from the rest of the eyebrow.







, If your eyebrows tend to meet in the middle, you may want to reduce this extra growth. Start plucking at the center and work outward toward one eyebrow first and then toward the other. It is personal preference how much you want to pluck, but less is usually better.








Use your thumb as a guide for how far apart your eyebrows should be. Place your thumb directly centered between your eyebrows and pluck the hairs that fall under your thumb.
If you over-pluck your eyebrows, you’ll start to affect the natural shape, which is not usually what guys want to do.

, With your tweezers still in hand, look for hairs that are growing significantly above the main eyebrow. Pluck those strays. You’ll also want to look below the eyebrow, toward your eyelid. Pluck these hairs as well."

Run the electric trimmer along the length of the comb.",How to Trim Eyebrows (for Men)3," If you want to make the investment, buy an electric trimmer specifically designed for eyebrows. Otherwise, if you have a beard or mustache trimmer, use this. It’s not a good idea to use hair clippers, as the blade is too wide and won’t give you much precision.Only use an electric trimmer if you have bushy eyebrows that need to be thinned and shortened.
You must use caution with an electric trimmer because there is a large margin of error, and you don’t want to remove too much of your eyebrow.
A nose trimmer also works well because of the narrow blade width.

, The goal of trimming with an electric trimmer is remove length and bulk, so comb the hairs outward. Hold the comb in place when the desired length to be cut is in the teeth of the comb.

Leave about one millimeter of hair in the teeth, and repeat later if you need to remove more.
It is better to trim a little bit at a time and repeat than to trim too much on your first pass.

, Turn the trimmer on and press it to the comb near the outer edge of your eyebrow. Gently and carefully move the trimmer along the comb, trimming the hairs as you go.It is important to keep both hands steady so you don’t remove more hair than you intend to.

Get a good pair of tweezers.,
Soften the skin around your brows.,
Identify the direction in which your eyebrow hair grows.,
Hold a pair of tweezers in your hand like you would a pencil.,
Place the tip of the tweezer at the root of the hair you want to pluck.",How to Pluck Your Eyebrows1," Use fine-tipped, clean tweezers to do the job. If the tweezers you use are too blunt or unwieldy, the process of plucking can take much longer and cause unnecessary pain. You need to be able to firmly grasp individual hairs and pull them out smoothly.;
, When the skin there is soft and supple, the hairs slide out much more easily. Plucking skin that is dry and stiff will make the experience more painful.









Plan to pluck your brows right after you take a shower. The warm water and steam will have left your skin moist and supple.
If you need to pluck at other times of the day, wash your face with warm water and blot it dry. You could also take a washcloth and put it in the hottest water you can handle, then place it on your eyebrows for 2 minutes. It will open the pores, making it easier to pluck.
Put some lotion on your eyebrows to make them softer and easier to pluck.

, For most people, the hair grows outward from the nose toward the hairline. In some cases, people's brows have hairs growing in more than one direction. Take careful note, because you'll want to pull the hairs in the direction of their growth when you pluck; this helps them come out cleanly.








, The open end should be up. Give it a few squeezes so you're comfortable with the motion you will need to use to pluck your brows.








, (Follow the directions below to figure out which hair you should be plucking). Get as close to the root of the hair as possible and pull, always pulling in the direction of hair growth and keeping the tweezers angled as close to your skin as possible.


Continue this until you have finished plucking one brow, then repeat on the other brow.
If you need to stop and take some breaks, that's ok. Resume plucking when you're ready.
Sometimes plucking eyebrows causes the eyes to tear up and the nose to itch. That's perfectly normal; just keep going until you're finished.

Comb your eyebrow hair up to look for long our out of place hairs.,
Make a loop with your thread.,
Make a rectangle with the thread using your thumbs and pointer fingers as the corners.,
Turn your right hand 3-4 times to make a little notch in the middle of the string.,
Lightly cover your eyebrow in dry concealer.,
Fit the string underneath the hairs you want to remove, keeping the center braid near the hair.,
Open your right hand quickly to slide the braid towards the hair, snipping it.,
Use the thread to clean your eyebrows into the right shape.,
Apply some astringent or soothing lotion to your eyebrows.",How to Thread Your Own Eyebrows," With a spoolie, lash comb or fine toothed comb, sweep eyebrow hair straight upward and pin it in place one section at a time. Trim a small amount off of any large hairs.


Repeat this process a second time, this time combing down instead of up.;
, Take a piece of high-cotton sewing thread about as long as your forearm and tie it to form a loop. Snip off loose ends.


You want thin thread, usually found cheaply at a drug store.

, Each hand will be on opposite sides of the string.

, The string will now look a little like an ""8."" This small bit of braided string in the middle will be used to pluck your hairs.With your hands apart in front of you, the string should now look similar to an ""X"" with the twisted portion in the middle.
Note how, if you pinch or close the thumb and finger on one hand, the braided section moves back and forth.

, This will make your hairs stand out more. Lightly powder below and above your eyebrow.

, The corners on each end of the twisted thread will be grabbing your hairs almost like scissors, but rather than shearing, the twisted thread will fold hair into itself, plucking individual hairs at your own pace, depending on how fast you open and close your fingers.


You want to keep your thumbs/finger on the corners of the string.

, Place the thread on the skin with the twisted portion of the thread just to the side of the hair you would like to remove. Gently move the twisted portion along the skin from side to side to capture the hairs, either to the right or to the left whichever way feels more comfortable, by doing what we learned in step 4. Once hairs are captured, simply pull.

, Keep threading until your eyebrows are their desired shape. Go slowly when you first start to prevent pulling out large chunks of hair undesirably.

, This will ease some of the pain from pulling up the hairs and prevent redness. Your eyebrows will usually stay nice and clean for 2-3 weeks!

Understand the best eyebrow shape for your face.,
Outline the eyebrow shape you want.,
Try waxing, either at home or in a salon.,
Try threading to shape your eyebrows.,
Comb and trim your eyebrows to make them look neater.,
Use an eyebrow pencil or powder to fill in your brows for a better look.,
Use an eyebrow gel to make them look more in control.",How to Shape Your Eyebrows Without Plucking," As with hairstyles, the shape of your face should dictate which brow shape looks best on you.


If you have a square jaw, softly rounded brows that aren’t too angular or round are the way to go.However, if your face is round, angular brows work better because there is a lack of definition in a rounder face that angled brows can fix.
If you have a heart-shaped face, bold brows will probably overwhelm your face. Don’t make your brows too thick but you want a controlled shape that isn’t too bushy. If your face is oval, a classic balanced brow works well because your face is already well-proportioned.;
, It's important to figure out exactly which shape you are going for before you attempt to shape your brows. You need to plan this out with care.


The way to do this is to remember that the front of your brow should line up with the bridge of your nose.You could use a pencil to determine where that spot is, and draw a little washable dot there with brow pencil. Hair inside the line will be filled, and hair outside the line lightly trimmed or removed.
Your brows should begin directly above your tear duct. They should peak at the outer side of your iris. They should end 45 degrees from the outer corner of your eye.The brow arch should be about three-quarters away from the nose bridge. The tail of the eyebrow should taper off after that. Figure out your brow thickness. Although this varies, a rule of thumb is to have brows that are between a quarter inch and a half inch at the thickest., Waxing is a relatively quick way to shape your eyebrows without plucking. It will remove finer hairs, too, that you would be unlikely to see with a pair of tweezers and a mirror. If you have thick or dark brows, waxing may be the best bet.At a salon, they will spread wax under and on top of your eyebrows. Then, they apply a small cloth or strip to the wax and pull the wax off (the hair comes with it). This is somewhat painful, but it’s over fast. One benefit of waxing is that the hair won’t grow back as fast as it will with some other methods.
You can also buy at-home waxing kits at local drugstores.It would be a good idea to try waxing at a salon first. If you mess up, eyebrows do grow back, but it’s still not a fun thing to go through. At home kits usually include wax and application sticks. Another version of at-home waxing kits are waxing strips that are already shaped for eyebrows.

, Threading involves using cotton strings to remove hairs by twisting them off. The stylist can shape the eyebrows this way with great precision.


You should ask at local salons or malls whether they offer threading. It’s best not to try this yourself unless you are specifically trained in it. Threading is an ancient art that dates back to ancient Eastern culture. One benefit of threading is that wax can irritate sensitive skin, but threading is less likely to do so because you aren’t applying a chemical to the skin.Another benefit is that threading creates very detailed definition of the brows.

, One way to make your eyebrows tidier is to trim them with a pair of small manicure scissors (don’t use large scissors!)








First, start with a spoolie brush. This is a mascara style brush (but that doesn’t have mascara on it). You can buy these makeup brushes at drug stores and beauty stores. Comb your eyebrows upward. This will neaten your eyebrows and help you determine their natural shape.
Then, cut along the tips of any eyebrow hairs that extend beyond the top of your eyebrow. Be careful! You can’t undo what you cut. The smaller scissors will be easier to control.

, The problem with tweezing is that you could accidentally over tweeze your eyebrows. Luckily there is a fix for this. You can also use pencil or powder to define brows even more that are already in decent shape.









Fill in the thin spots of the eyebrow with an eyebrow pencil. You can find these at beauty stores or drug stores, and you should choose a color that most closely matches that of your eyebrows. If you don't have a special brow filler, you can use a matching eyeliner pencil or eyeshadow.Don’t draw too hard or the pencil could become too obvious. You want to go for a natural look here.
For more filling, use eyebrow powder and a small makeup brush. This will create a natural look that shapes your brows. Look for open spaces by holding a pencil or tweezers from the front of your brow to the arch. Then fill in any open spaces with powder or pencil.Begin applying the powder in the center of the brow. Work outward to the edge of the brow and then back toward the beginning of the brow. Use short, light strokes. You can use more pressure on the underside of the brow. , There are eyebrow gels widely available that will make your brows look more tamed and shapely.


These gels usually come in a mascara like tube, and you put the gel on your eyebrows with a small mascara style wand that comes with the product. The gel is usually clear, but you can also buy tinted gel for eyebrows.
Another variation is to put hairspray on your eyebrows. This method will also hold the fine hairs in place, but it gets a little stickier.

Purchase a razor made specifically for eyebrows.,
Use a small amount of shaving cream.,
Shave in the direction of hair growth.,
Hold your brow skin taut.,
Check your progress frequently.,
Wash your face after you finish.,
Maintain your brow shape by shaving weekly.,
Consider waxing or tweezing.",How to Shape Your Eyebrows with a Razor1," A standard razor will not give you detailed brows, and can be dangerous to use near your eyes. Instead purchase an eyebrow razor, whose small blade will give you the brows you desire.You can order an eyebrow razor online or purchase one at your local beauty supply store.;
, You will get a closer shave if you apply shaving cream to the area of skin surrounding the eyebrow. Try starting with a dime-sized amount, and use more if necessary. Try applying the shaving cream when you get out of the shower., It’s important that you stroke the razor in the same direction that your eyebrows grow. If you use the blade in the opposite direction, you can nick your skin and possibly create ingrown hairs. Instead, gently stroke the razor in the direction that your eyebrows grow., Use your non-dominant hand to hold the skin around the eyebrow taut. This will help you get a closer, more detailed shave. Then use your dominant hand to begin shaping your eyebrow., You should check your progress in a mirror as much as possible. It is easy to accidentally shave off too much of your eyebrows. To prevent this from happening, step back and look in the mirror after completing each section of eyebrow., Once you are done waxing your eyebrows, wash your face with a gentle facial cleanser. This will help remove any remaining shaving cream or oils from your hands. Do not apply moisturizers to the freshly shaved area, as this can clog pores., In order to maintain the look of your newly shaped eyebrows, you will want to shave them regularly. Try shaving about once a week, or more if your hair grows quickly., While you can effectively shape your eyebrows using a razor, the hair will grow back quickly. This means you will need to shape your brows more often than if you wax or tweeze them. If you’d like longer lasting brows, try tweezing or waxing your brows instead of shaving."

Identify the place where your brows should begin.,
Figure out where your brows should peak.,
Mark where your brow should end.,
Figure out how thick you want your brows to be.",How to Pluck Your Eyebrows2," This is different for every face, but the same technique may be used to find anyone's brow line. Take an eyebrow pencil or another long instrument and line it up from inner corner of your eye to the edge of your nose. Use a white pencil to make a dot above the spot where it crosses your eyebrow. This is where your brow should begin. Repeat with the other nostril.









Feel free to move the dot a little forward or backward. This technique shows you the general spot where your eyebrows should begin, but your personal preferences can also come into play.
Make sure the instrument you use to find your brow's starting place is very thin. If you use something thick, it will slightly throw off where you place the dot.

, Nicely groomed eyebrows arch around the eye, and the place where they peak can make a big difference in your final look. Take the same instrument, and this time line it up from the outer edge of your nostril to the outer edge of your iris. Mark the spot where it crosses your brow, and repeat on the other side.








, This time line up the instrument from the edge of your nostril to the outer corner of your eye. Mark the spot where it falls across your brow. This is where your brow should naturally end; repeat on the other side.








, There is no ""perfect"" thickness for eyebrows; it all depends on your face shape and style choices. You should have a thickness in mind before you start plucking, so you'll avoid plucking too much or too little. Consider the following factors:


The size of your eyes. If you have large eyes, you might want to balance them with thicker brows. If you have small eyes, balance them with thinner brows.
The space between your brows and your eyes. If your brows are set high on your forehead, you may want to go with heavier brows to help frame your eyes. If you have a low-set browbone that slightly juts over your eyes, go with thinner brows so they don't look too heavy over your eyes.

",How to Pluck Your Eyebrows3," Brush them slightly in the direction they grow. You'll immediately see some long, unruly hairs that need to be plucked.








, Carefully pluck a hair at a time, shaping your brows according to the plan you made.









Pluck the hairs that are closer to your nose than the dots you drew over your inner brows.
Shape the arch areas by plucking a few hairs around the peaks to give them a more defined shape.
Pluck the hairs that fall closer to your temples than the dots you drew on the outside of your brows.
Pluck more hairs from the bottom of your brows to make them as thin or thick as you'd like.

, When you're shaping your brows, take it slow. Step back and look in the mirror every few minutes to check your progress. Make sure you don't pluck too much; eyebrow hairs can take 6 weeks to grow back, and sometimes they don't grow back at all.








, Comb your brows in the direction of their growth and apply a bit of brow gel (or hair gel) to hold them in place.

Line up your brow’s inner edge with the outside of your nose.,
Make sure the arch peaks just past the outer edge of your iris.,
Taper the brow.,
Don’t let the outer edge of the eyebrow droop.,
Ask a friend to help you.",How to Shape Your Eyebrows with a Razor2," The inner edge of your eyebrow should roughly line up with your nose’s outer edge. Try taking a pencil and placing it along the outer edge of your nose. This will help you see where the innermost edge of your eyebrow should be., The iris is the colored part of your eye, and it can serve as an excellent guide for figuring out where your eyebrow’s arch should peak. The arch of your brow should peak about 1/8 inch or 3 millimeters past your iris’s outer edge., You should maintain a uniform thickness from the inner edge of the eyebrow up to the arch. Once you reach the arch, you can begin tapering the brow thinner until you reach the outer edge of the eyebrow. You can also keep your eyebrows at the same thickness throughout if tapering doesn’t seem right for you., The outermost edge of your eyebrow should not dip below the level of your eyebrow’s inner edge. Keep both edges of the eyebrow on the same level. You can also let the outer edge sit a tiny bit higher than the inner edge., You will be more successful at shaping your eyebrows with a razor if you ask someone to help. A friend or family member can help you determine the best brow shape. They can also alert you if it looks like you are shaving away too much of your eyebrows."

They are amino acids that assist in cell repair and can strengthen and increase the size of your hair follicles.Biotin is a B vitamin that is thought to strengthen and enhance hair growth.Minoxidil is found in many popular hair growth creams.;
, If you have serious hair loss or your brows are patchy and won't grow, your doctor may be able to write you a prescription. The hormones in these serums extend the active growth phase of your hair follicles, so your hair will constantly be growing, and often growing thicker and longer.When you stop using these products, the follicles will enter a ""resting"" phase and the hair may all fall out at once. They will grow back, but not at the same rate or length as when you are using the potion.Side effects of prescription brow potions include dry, discolored, or darkened skin in the area where the potion was applied.Prescription hair growth products can be expensive, and it is unlikely your insurance will cover the cost.

Follow the instructions (either leave it on or wash it off, depending on the potion) and wait 24 hours.


If you show no reaction, go ahead and use the brow potion on your eyebrows.

, Use a gentle cleanser to wash your face and dab your eyebrows dry with a towel. Brow serums should be applied to dry, makeup-free skin and hair.If you have makeup on your eyebrow (such as pencil or powder), use a makeup remover or olive oil to remove all traces.

Brow potions only work if you use them continuously, so designate a time to always apply and you should see results in as little as four weeks.Increasing your use will not cause the potion to work faster and may cause damage to your skin.Allow the brow potion to dry before going to bed, or you risk ruining your pillow cases and possibly getting the potion on other parts of your face., Your hair follicles need vitamins, nutrients, and proteins to function properly and build strong hairs. These are delivered through the blood stream, and massaging your eyebrows can stimulate circulation, ensuring your cells get the nourishment they need.Gently massage your eyebrows using the tips of your fingers. Make circular motions along the length of your brow bone., Your blood system delivers nutrients to the cells in your hair follicles, but it's up to you to provide your body with those nutrients. A healthy, balanced diet will keep your hair strong, glossy, and can prevent some types of hair loss.


Eat proteins like nuts, chicken, turkey Greek yogurt, and eggs to prevent hair growth from stalling or entering a resting state. Your hair is made from proteins, and can't produce new hair if you aren't providing your body with enough protein.The B vitamin biotin can be found in eggs, almonds, wheat bran, salmon, and avocados.

Heat up some water.,
Put the washcloth in the cup.,

Hold the washcloth or a hot pack over your eyebrows.,
Pluck after a shower.,
Start with new tweezers.,
Try a numbing gel.,
Soothe afterwards.,
Pull the skin tight.,
Pluck from the base.,
Pluck in the right direction.",How to Pluck Eyebrows Without Pain," The easiest way to heat up water is to fill a mug halfway up with water. Put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds. You don't want to get the water too hot, as that could burn your hands or face. You'll also need a washcloth to apply it to your face.


As an alternative, you can warm up a hot pack that’s typically used for injuries in the microwave to achieve a similar result.;
, You want the washcloth to absorb the warm water. Therefore, all you need to do is dunk the washcloth in the cup, and let it sit for a few seconds., Once the washcloth has absorbed most of the water, take it out. Hold it over the sink so you don't get water everywhere, and then wring it out so it's just damp rather than dripping.

, Fold or roll the washcloth so it easily fits over your eyebrows. Hold it there for a couple of minutes. The washcloth should stay warm the whole time. After a couple of minutes, take it off, and proceed with plucking your eyebrows as normal.If you’re using a hot pack instead, hold it to your eyebrows in this same way.


The idea behind this method is the heat helps the pores open up. In turn, the hairs you are plucking will come out more easily. That makes the whole process less painful for you.

, Another way to make the process less painful is to pluck your eyebrows after a shower. While you're in the shower, the steam opens up your pores, and as noted in the previous step, having open pores makes the process of plucking much easier and not as painful., Unless you stay on top of sharpening them and cleaning them with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball, using an old pair of tweezers will make it harder to grasp hairs.If you can't grab the hair effectively, you might accidentally get your skin. Try picking up a new pair of tweezers to make it easier.Don't pick sharp, pointed tweezers. Instead, opt for a slanted style that comes to a point but has an edge where the tweezers meet. Having an edge makes it easier to pick up hairs., You can apply a numbing gel to your eyebrows. The numbing gel will numb your skin, making it less painful to pluck out hairs.For instance, a dental numbing gel meant for babies is a good one to try.
Just use a cotton swab to dab the gel along your eyebrows. Wait for the skin to get numb before plucking.

, To help cool down any pain afterwards, add a bit of aloe vera gel to the area. The gel will help soothe skin, as well as help it heal from the irritation of plucking.Aloe vera gel can be purchased at almost any drugstore or grocery store.
You can also use aloe vera from a plant. Simply break off a piece, and squeeze out the aloe vera to use.
If you don't have aloe vera on hand, try an ice cube to numb your skin., Using your fingers, stretch the skin near your eyebrows so it's tight. Stretching the skin stretches the pores, making it easier to pluck out hairs. When it's easier, it's less painful., It's always best to grab the base of the hair rather than try to pull from the tip. The reason is your tweezers may slip off, and then you'll need to pull the hair again, causing extra pain. In addition, you might split a hair instead pulling it out properly., You should pluck hairs in the direction they grow to make it easier for them to come out. If you don't, the hair could split or break, meaning you need to go in for another go. You don't want to pluck each hair twice, as that's just more pain for you. This is a good rule of thumb for all types of hair removal."

Plan to wait for several months.,
Stop plucking and waxing.,
Grow them in rows.If you can't stand the idea of letting all your hairs grow out before you shape your eyebrows, try the row-growing strategy.",How to Make Eyebrows Grow1," Eyebrows take a long time to grow back fully after they've been overplucked. For some people, it might only take six weeks, but others may have to wait a full year before their eyebrows regain their former shape. The best thing you can do for your brows is to be patient. Look at it this way: at least your brows won't need a lot of maintenance for a while.;
, You probably already know this one, but it's worth emphasizing that plucking or waxing around your eyebrows isn't going to help them grow faster. In fact, sometimes plucking and waxing eyebrows damages the hair follicle permanently, preventing the hair from ever growing back.

, Allow a row of hair to grow out and pluck the stray hairs around it. When the row is finished growing in, start on the next row. Continue growing your brows out a row at a time until they're finished growing back.


This method gives your brows a neater appearance while still allowing you to grow them back.
The row-growing method may take quite a long time, so be prepared to wait even longer than you would if you just let your brows grow back all at once.

, If you want darker eyebrows, you can use eyebrow makeup such as powder, gel, pomade, or pencils. There are many color options for eyebrow makeup so it is important to choose a color that best matches your hair.

For red hair, choose a color similar to your hair, but slightly ashier if you have pink tones in your skin.
Brunettes should stay within a one or two shade range of your hair color. Match more to your highlight rather than your base.
Black hair looks best with cool medium-brown eyebrow makeup.
For blonde hair, match the makeup to the tone of your hair not to the highlight., Brushing your eyebrows will make the shape clearer before you fill them in with makeup. This will allow you fill them in better and be more true to your shape., Put eyebrow primer on your eyebrows before you apply makeup. This will help make the makeup stay on your eyebrows longer., Very lightly do short and quick strokes on your eyebrows. Mimic the natural stroke of your hairs to match your eyebrows so the makeup blends in. Pay extra attention to the extra sparse areas on your eyebrows. Fill in your eyebrows shape, not outside of it. , Use an angle brush to apply a powder all over your eyebrows. Powder is great because you can use various shades to create dimension. Use a lighter shade all over your brows and a darker shade for bare areas., Pomades last all day and don’t smudge easily. Use an angle brush to outline the entire shape and blend throughout your eyebrows with a spoolie brush., You can use an eyebrow pencil to darken your brows and give them shape and definition. This option is faster than other options and is easiest if you want to give your eyebrows a natural appearance. Keep the strokes light and don’t press too hard on the pencil for a natural appearance., There is clear gel and there is tinted gel. You can use clear gel after you use pomade, powder, or pencil or you can just use tinted gel on its own. Gels keep your eyebrows locked in all day so it is great for eyebrows that don’t stay in place. Apply using upward strokes on each section of the brow and let dry. Use a clean spoolie brush to blend tinted gel into your brows."

Men 19-30 should be getting 6 1/2 ounces (or ounce equivalents) a day, while men 31-50 should be getting 6 ounces and men 51 and older should be getting 5 1/2 ounces.
""Ounce equivalents"" are servings of other proteins besides meat that the government considers equal to an ounce, such as 1 egg, 1/2 an ounce of nuts, and a 1/4 cup of beans or tofu.Stick with lean sources of protein, like fish, beans, and tofu, since high fat intake can increase testosterone, which has been connected with hair loss., Iron is one of the leading causes of hair loss, so making sure you get enough is important. Have your doctor check your iron levels, as you may need to take a supplement if you're not getting enough. Animal protein provides a good amount of iron, but so do leafy greens, lentils, and broccoli.The reason iron can cause hair loss is that your body may steal from your hair follicles if it is iron deficient.

, While omega-3 fatty acids won't necessarily prevent hair loss, especially if it's from a medical condition, they do contribute to healthier hair, and they are used by hair cells near the skin. Plus, they're good for your overall health.Eat fatty fish like salmon, trout, and herring.
Vegetarians can get omega-3 from walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and avocados.

, B vitamins include riboflavin, folate, biotin, niacin, and others. These vitamins work together to help sustain healthy hair, which in turn can help prevent hair loss. You can take a supplement, but you can also get many of these vitamins from your diet.Leafy greens, vegetables from the ocean, and whole grains are all good sources of B vitamins.

, Sulfur, particularly that found in the amino acid L-Methionine, can increase hair health.Nuts, especially Brazil nuts, are high in this amino acid, as well as animal protein, soy beans, and sesame seeds. Vegetables like leafy greens also provide this amino acid., Not getting enough biotin in your diet can make your hair straw-like and brittle. When your hair is brittle, it's more likely to break, leading to you losing hair. Increasing biotin in your diet can help with hair loss.Eggs yolks, whole grains, yeast, soy flour, and liver all have high levels of biotin.

, Being hydrated is necessary for good health, including healthy hair. Make sure you are drinking the recommended amount of water.The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 13 cups of water daily and women consume 9 cups of water daily.Try drinking water with fresh fruit like strawberries or oranges in it for added flavor.

, If you are having trouble getting your necessary nutrients from diet alone, you may want to add a supplement that is specifically designed for reducing hair loss and contains all of these important vitamins and minerals.You may also consider taking a supplement with 500 to 1,000 milligrams of L-Lysine daily, which can help improve hair loss.
Many eyebrow growth products are currently on the market, including gels and serums. None have been approved by the FDA for treating eyebrow loss. Use any such products with caution and monitor closely for side effects., If you're diabetic, having uncontrolled blood sugars over a long period of time can lead to hair loss. Therefore, to decrease this problem, try to keep your blood sugars under control through eating the prescribed diet for diabetics, taking your medications, and monitoring your blood sugars.If your blood sugars are often out of control, talk to your doctor about changing up your medication.

, Keeping skin moisturized helps keep hair moisturized, as well. Coconut oil, in particular, is helpful for preventing hair loss, as it helps reduce protein loss in your hair. Try applying coconut oil to your eyebrows before and after washing your face., Tweezing too much can lead to more permanent hair loss. In other words, not only do you remove the hair, you may prevent it from growing back in the future. If you've noticed hairs are not growing back, try slowing down on the plucking.Over-plucking may also cause ingrown hairs and follicle damage.
Always clean tweezers with alcohol before plucking to prevent transferring bacteria that can cause infection.

, Pregnancy, menopause, and changes in birth control are all changes in the level of estrogen in your body. Estrogen loss can lead to hair loss, so if you suspect you may have hormonal changes, talk to your doctor about taking a supplement., When you are stressed, your body starts shutting down processes that aren’t necessary for survival. This shutdown can occur with physical stressors, like surgery or an illness, and emotional stress, which often manifests as physical symptoms. Loss may occur up to three months after the stressful event and may take another three to grow again.Start a daily meditation practice. Make time in the morning, after work or school, or before bed to calm your mind and sit quietly. Pick a time that works best with your schedule and spend at least 20 minutes focusing on your breathing.
Yoga is a great way to get more exercise and reduce stress at the same time. It is also easier for many people to do than traditional cardio exercises and only requires a mat for practice.

, Smoking can lead to hair loss. The chemicals in cigarette smoke and other types of tobacco smoke can break down hair cells, leading to hair loss. If you're concerned about hair loss, think about stopping to slow down the problem.To quit smoking, make sure your friends and family know you want to quit. They can help you avoid triggers and remind you when you forget.
Avoid triggers that lead you to smoking, such as going to bars.
Use aids to help you, such as patches and support groups., Dyes, tints, and even eyebrow pencils may cause hair loss, particularly if you apply too much pressure. If you've noticed that you are losing your eyebrows, especially after starting a new makeup, consider laying off the makeup for a period of time to see if it helps., Numerous medications can cause temporary or permanent hair loss, including chemotherapy,antidepressants, and mood stabilizers.Nonetheless, many other medications can cause hair loss in isolated cases. If you've noticed hair loss after starting a new medication, talk to your doctor about this side effect.

, If you suddenly lose your eyebrows, that could be a sign of a more serious problem, particularly if you only lose your eyebrows or eyelashes and not other hair. Sudden loss of eyebrows can be a symptom of eye conditions, skin conditions, systematic disorders, infections, and nutritional deficiencies. Seeing your doctor can help you narrow down the condition.Often, when you treat the underlying condition causing the hair loss, you're hair will grow back.

, If you also notice unexplained weight gain, chronic fatigue, feeling depressed, or feeling colder than usual in low temperatures, your thyroid gland may not be producing enough hormones. You may also notice your periods getting heavier or becoming sporadic. Hypothyroidism is most common in women, especially over age 50, and it can be treated with a synthetic hormone.Talk to your doctor if you suspect you may have this condition. Your doctor will use a physical examination as well as a blood test to diagnose hypothyroidism.

, These patches may indicate a skin infection or interaction with a new beauty product or environmental trigger. You could also have inflammation from dermatitis or psoriasis.These conditions don’t actually cause hair loss, but they can lead to it if you rub and scratch the affected areas.


If you think you have dermatitis, make an appointment with a dermatologist and stop using any skin care products that are not made especially for sensitive skin until you see them. Even products you have used for a long time can suddenly be too harsh due to changes in your skin.

, Having thinning eyebrow hair is not a huge cause for concern, particularly if you're getting older. However, if you have completely bald spots that are splotchy on your eyebrows or other facial hair, you should talk to your doctor., It's natural to lose some hair as you get older, including in your eyebrows. Everyone does. In fact, it also affects the rate at which your hair grows, so less grows back in when you lose it. While you may not be able to change this fact, know that everyone else is in the same boat as they age.Hair loss with age comes in two forms. One form involves scarring. If you have that kind, your hair loss is likely not reversible. If you have the other kind, you may be able to reverse it.However, if you suddenly lose your hair and you are younger, you should see a doctor."

Choose an eyebrow pencil and powder that is similar to your natural coloring.,
Dust the area with translucent powder.,
Use eyebrow powder or eyeshadow and a stiff, angled makeup brush to etch the shape of your brow.,
Use a very sharp eyebrow pencil and begin drawing little hairs in gentle, upward strokes.,
Set your eyebrows by dusting again with translucent powder.For extra staying power, use a makeup sealer or lacquer that will protect your brows from moisture and from your own hands (it would be a shame to accidentally wipe off all your hard work).",How to Hide or Fix a Shaved off Eyebrow1," If you still have one of your eyebrows, this might be a little easier--just match the pencil to the shade of your eyebrow hair. Otherwise, use your hair color as a guide. If you are a brunette or a redhead, look for a color that is one shade lighter than your hair. If you are a blonde, try one shade darker.You can't substitute eyeliner for an eyebrow pencil in this case. You are literally drawing on your eyebrow, and eyeliner is too likely to smudge and ruin the illusion.
Use the same method to choose powder, but don't get too matchy--if the colors are a little different, it will add more dimension to your drawn-on brow.Feel free to mix brow powders or eyeshadows to get the right color or simply add more depth to the look.Avoid anything with sparkles or shimmer, as this will look unnatural.;
, Make sure your skin is clean and free of any excess moisturizer. As your skin releases natural oils throughout the day, your makeup can begin to slide or will smudge easily. The powder will help absorb the oil and also give the makeup something to cling to so it stays put on your face.








Use a soft, fluffy brush to disperse the powder.

, The application should be very light, just a vague suggestion of an eyebrow. You can use your other eyebrow as a guide for where your missing brow should begin and end. Otherwise, there are a few tricks you can use to figure it out.









Hold a pencil against your nose. The edge of the pencil that is closer to your eye marks where your brow should start. Don't go any further inward than this line.Keep the pencil held against your nose but pivot the tip so that it points to the outer corner of your eye. This should be about a 45-degree angle. That is where your brow should end.The arch should be right above the outer edge of your iris (the colored part of your eye) if you are looking straight ahead.If you make any mistakes, just use a cotton swab to wipe off the makeup.

, You want to follow the shape you created with the brow powder or eyeshadow and use short, feathering strokes that look like actual little hairs. It is important to keep the pencil very sharp, so make sure you stop to sharpen it and keep that fine tip.Don't press too hard or draw your strokes too dark. It will look more natural if you draw your eyebrows in several layers of light strokes.Again, use a cotton swab to fix any mistakes.

, You simply paint this clear product over your brows and allow it to dry. It may look a bit shiny, so go over it with another layer of powder.

Try exfoliating.,
Use a brow serum.,
Eat nourishing foods.",How to Make Eyebrows Grow2," While you're waiting for your brows to grow, stimulating the skin in the area may help the hairs come through faster. Use a soft facial brush to scrub your brow area in a circular motion, removing dead skin cells and spurring circulation in the area.You can also use an exfoliating scrub in your brow area. Buy a scrub at the store or make your own sugar scrub.
Don't scrub too hard; rub the skin in gentle circles. Using too much pressure may loosen the hairs that are still in place.

, Brow serum is a product that is designed to stimulate growth at the follicle level with peptides. Some people have greater success with serums than others with these serums; they can be quite expensive, and they don't work quickly. If you'd like to give one a try, look for eyelash serums as well, which contain the same active ingredients and are more widely available at drugstores., Stimulate hair growth the natural way by making sure you're getting the vitamins and minerals you need to maintain healthy hair and skin.

Use a brow pencil.,
Use brow powder.,
Employ concealer to cover the stubble.,
Try applying Vaseline on your eyebrows before going to bed.",How to Make Eyebrows Grow3," While you're waiting for your brows to grow, you can draw them in quite effectively using a brow pencil. Choose a pencil that matches your brow color or is a shade lighter. Make short, thin strokes in the same direction as your hair growth.


When using a brow pencil, subtle strokes are better than thick ones. Don't go overboard trying to give yourself the popular bushy look; stick with filling in the gaps for now.
For a bolder nighttime look, go a shade dark than your brow color.

, Brow powder is formulated to stick to your existing brow hairs and make them look fuller and more filled in. It's a good way to add some heft to your brows if your hair tends to be sparse. Choose a shade that matches your brow color and use a brush to apply it in the direction of your hair growth.

, When your hairs first start to grow back, they may have the appearance of stubble. Resist the impulse to pluck and use a little concealer there instead. Go for a chemical-free concealer so that you won't risk impeding your hair growth.

Using the white pencil will make it easier to see the shape of your eyebrow when you go to wax.For instance, a good place for your eyebrow to ""start"" from the inside is in a straight line with the inside of your nostril. Use a card or piece of paper to make straight line up from the part of your nostril closest to the middle of your nose.
Some people recommend you start from the outside of your nostril instead. You can pick your preference. Some people say making your eyebrows too far apart can make your nose look bigger.;
, Now you need to mark the outer edge of your eyebrow. This edge is where your eyebrows ""end,"" meaning after this point, you will use wax to remove any extra hairs.For the outside of your eyebrow, use a card to line up the outside of your nostril with the corner of your eye. Keep the line going up to your eyebrow, which designates the outer edge.

, The arch is the point of your eyebrow that curves upward, forming an arch. The arch should be aligned with the outer part of your nostril and your pupil, if you're looking straight ahead.Use the card to help you mark the arch point by making a straight line from the outer edge of your nostril through your pupil into your eyebrow.
Use a white pencil to put a mark the arch point.

, Start by using a card to make a straight line across the bottom of the brow on the inner side. Hold it up to the inside of the brow, and angle it up slightly towards the arch point. Use your pencil to make a line up to the arch point.Do the same going towards the outside on the bottom, but going down instead.
Also add lines across the top. Make a line going from the inside point to the arch point, then one from the arch point to the outside point.
You can thin your eyebrows out a bit if you find them too bushy by bringing in your natural lines. However, you don't want to make them too thin, as they will look wispy.

, Now that you've made the straight lines across the top and bottom, you can create an arch. You don't want a corner or point at the arch, but rather a slight curve. As you come to arch with your straight lines, curve the lines into each other, following your brow lines.If you want, you can make a more natural shape by creating a more pronounced curve. In that case, follow the line of your eyebrow instead of making straight lines across the top and bottom.

, Use a spoolie brush to brush your eyebrows up. That gives you a better idea of your eyebrows shape, plus it gets your hairs all going in the same direction, making it easier to shape.A spoolie brush is basically a mascara brush that you don't use for mascara. You can find them at most drug stores and make up counters, or you can wash off an old mascara brush.

, Once you brush up, you may notice some hairs are long enough to hang over the lines you've made at the top. To help the plucking and waxing process, use a small pair of eyebrow scissors to trim off the tops of these hairs. You can use your spoolie brush to help hold them in place if you need to do so.Brush the tips you cut off away so that they don't get caught up in the wax.
Also, when brushing, if you notice that any hairs hang over the side of the brush, you can trim them, too.
However, you don't want to trim too much. It's important to leave your hair long enough for the wax to pick up, meaning at least 2 to 3 weeks of growth. Mostly, you only want to trim the hairs that you are not going to wax, the ones that are inside the shape you want.In addition, most of the time, your beautician will also trim your eyebrows for you if you get them professionally waxed. You might as well let the expert do it.

, For a couple of days before getting a wax done, you should skip certain skin products. These products make your skin more sensitive, so by using them, you make the waxing process hurt more.Definitely skip any retinol product for several days before waxing.
Also, skip your astringents and exfoliating products. These products often have ingredients that will make your skin more sensitive.

, Once you've outlined your shape, you're ready to wax. You can use small wax strips for this purpose that only need to be warmed with your fingers. Using hot wax can be dangerous near your eyes.Cut the wax strip in half or so, so that it is only about 1/3 of an inch thick. You don't need a very thick strip for your eyebrows. Warm the strip with your hand.
Cut wax strips to the right length, and apply along the lines you've created, making sure to do so in the direction your hair grows. Rub your fingers over the strips several times, warming the strip up and making sure it's adhered to your skin.
Remove the strip quickly to pull off hairs.

, Once you've waxed your eyebrows, you'll need to pluck any excess hairs. Look for any hairs that were left outside the line you made, and pull them out. Make sure to not get any hairs within the hairline.When plucking, get the tweezers close to the skin. Obviously, you don't want to catch the skin, but getting near the skin gives you a better hold on the hair.
As you pluck, pull in the direction the hair is growing, not against the grain.
Also, try plucking after a shower. The warmth opens up the follicles, making it easier for you to pull hair out.

, If you have older tweezers, it can make it more difficult to pluck hairs. In addition, they need to be the right shape for plucking. The best kind are the ones that have a slanted edge that come down to a point.Stainless steel is a good option for tweezers. They are sturdy, plus for most people, they won't irritate your skin like some other metals will., If you have a good pair of tweezers that you've used for years, you can make them sharp again. To sharpen them, rub sand or a nail file along the plucking edge, which will help you to grasp hairs.It's also important to clean your tweezers each time you use them. The best way to clean them is to dip a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol, then use it to rub all over your tweezers.

, You need to be able to see what you're doing when you pluck. Therefore, make sure you are in a bright light when you start plucking. A good option is a bright vanity light or even standing next to the window to catch natural light.It's also good to use a magnified mirror. You'll be able to see what's going on with your eyebrows much better than if you use a regular mirror. You can get small handheld magnified mirrors at most drug and big box stores.

, You shouldn't start on one eyebrow, do the whole thing, and then move to the other. Rather, you should move back and forth between eyebrows as you pluck. You are much likelier to get them even this way.If you keep plucking on one eyebrow, it's much too easy to go too far. Moving back and forth helps keep them even and helps you see what they look like together so you don't pluck too much.
This step holds true for shaping your eyebrows, as well. When you're shaping your eyebrows, it's best to draw a line on one side, then move over to the other side to make it even.

, It may be tempting to pluck out stray hairs when you're putting your makeup on. However, doing so can thin out your eyebrows too much, as you may pluck out hairs that you should let grow in.For instance, you may pluck a hair underneath your eyebrow that needs to actually grow in. It may be needed to fill in your eyebrow line, so you don't constantly look surprised.
The most often you should pluck is once a week, but every 2 to 3 weeks is better.

, If you are trying to change the arch of your brow or want your eyebrows to be a specific shape, let your esthetician know so she can incorporate your wants.

, Use an eyebrow pencil to fill in patchy brows.


People with blonde hair should use light brown pencil; redheads look best with honey-colored brown pencil; and deep brown or black works well for brunettes. , Move the brush upward and outward. Set them in place for the day by applying a clear mascara.

, If you have grey hair or dye your hair a color other than your natural color, you will want to dye your brows to match. If you're a natural redhead trying to pull off brunette hair dye, bright red eyebrows will give it away!


Going a shade darker with the dye will make your eyebrows appear fuller.
No dye is FDA approved for your eyebrows or eyelashes, so be aware of the risk when you are dyeing your eyebrows.
Eyebrows fall out and grow back quickly, so you will have to dye them every week or two to maintain them.

, There is some eyebrow-specific conditioner available on the market, but you can just use your regular hair conditioner and it works just as well. As long as you're washing your face, you don't need to wash your eyebrows specifically--you've already got it covered.You can condition your brows at the same time you condition your hair. Just make sure not to get any conditioner in your eye!

, If you've been over-tweezing, you may need to rehab your eyebrows. Experts recommend you stop tweezing for 16 weeks. This may be very frustrating at first, as your brows will look a little overgrown, but eventually they will start growing back up to the brow line.At 16 weeks, you can start to tweeze the hair closest to your eyelids.
It will take four to six months before your eyebrows fully grow in, after many months of over-grooming.

Decide where the inner edge of your eyebrow should be.,
Decide where your eyebrows end.,
Create an arch.,
Make straight lines.,
Decide how you want your arch shape.",How to Groom Brows1," First, you need a white facial pencil so you can mark it. You will also need a straight edge to help you determine where your eyebrow should begin.Use the straight edge to create a visual line vertically from the inside point of your nostril up to your eyebrow. Make a mark on the inside edge.
If you prefer, you can use the outside edge of your nostril. However, doing so can make your nose look bigger.
Don't forget to do the other side.;
, Once again, you'll need to use a straight edge and a pencil. The end point of your eyebrows is the outer edge, the point nearest your ears rather than your nose.To create this boundary, make a visual line with the straight edge from the outside point of your nostril. It should run to the outside corner of your eye up through your eyebrow.
Mark it with a pencil, and then do the same on the other eyebrow.

, An arch can be a curve or more of an angle. Either way, it's where your eyebrow reaches upward near the middle. Once again, you'll need to use your straight edge to make a visual line that will help you determine where your arch should be.








The visual line should run from the outer point of your nostril. It should also line up with the middle of your pupil.
Once the line reaches your eyebrow, that's the place you mark for arch. Draw one on the other side, too.

, Now you want to make the boundaries of your eyebrow, going from point to point. Use the straight edge to create straight lines, following the natural lines of your eyebrow.








In other words, go up towards the arch on the bottom from the inside, then down from the arch towards the outside. Do the same on the top, keeping the lines mostly straight until you reach the arch.
If you don't want to use straight lines, you can just follow the curve of your eyebrow, making them as thin or as thick as you want, being sure you don't get them too thin, as they might not show up.

, If you want your arch shape very angled, don't curve as you come into the arch. Simply keep the lines straight. If you prefer the arch more curved, create a curve as you come into the arch."

Square faces can pull off thicker brows with high arches. This eyebrow shape can soften square faces and doesn't require too much trimming or thinning.Round faces benefit from eyebrows with high arches. This can require precise plucking, but it will help reduce some of the roundness of your face.Flat eyebrows with a low arch look best on a long face. They can open up your face to the sides, rather than emphasizing your face vertically.Eyebrows with a rounded arch suit a heart-shaped face.Oval faces can pull off any of these shapes, since the face is the most symmetrical.;
, While there are benefits to both, you'll want to take experience, time, and cost into account. If a friend offers to groom your eyebrows, consider how experienced your friend is and how much you trust them to do a good job.


If you've never shaped your eyebrows, you might want a professional to fix them for the first time. While this will cost more than doing it at home, you can rely on their experience. You could also ask them for maintenance tips, so that you can trim them at home.

, Are you going to get them plucked? Waxed? Threaded? If you've decided to go to a salon, determine which one you're going to and find out how much they charge. Ask the salon your questions in advance.


Don't forget that there are costs associated to fixing your eyebrows at home. You might need to buy an eyebrow brush, wax and applicators, thread, or tweezers. Be prepared and have all necessary supplies on hand before you begin.
Waxing is good for removing very fine hairs or large patches of hair. This can be a good first step in fixing bushy eyebrows. After waxing, you can go back and pluck or thread to give your brows a defined shape.

, Just comb your hairs up and into their natural shape. This will help you see any hairs that stand out longer than your natural hairline and what needs to be trimmed.







, Simply outline the shape of the eyebrows you'd like to have. This will make it easier to see where you need to pluck, wax, or thread. If you prefer to wing it, just use a makeup pencil to mark where your brow should start, the highest point of your arch, and where you want the brow to end.

, The hairs should be at least 1/8 of an inch long, any smaller and the wax won't be able to pick it up. Press the wax strips into the direction the hairs are growing.








, Use one swift movement to pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Avoid pulling it off slowly. This can be painful and you won't pull out as many hairs.








, You can use hydrocortisone cream to soothe irritation and inflammation or apply aloe-based lotions.


If you have residual wax that you need to clean off, try wiping it off with baby oil or petroleum jelly.

, Hold ice or something cold over the eyebrow till you're no longer bothered by the cold. This will make tweezing painless.

, Slant-edged tweezers will grab the hair easily. Use firm swift movements to pull the hair up and away from the brow. Start by tweezing below the brow. When tweezing above the brow, be careful not to over tweeze your arch.









Step away from the mirror every so often, so you can check your work. Err on the side of caution when starting out and don't overtrim your brows.
Plucking will take longer than waxing, but it offers greater precision. If your eyebrows need a lot of shaping, be sure to wax first, then pluck to create the shape you want.

, After combing your eyebrows up and out using an eyebrow brush or toothbrush,take scissors and snip the few hairs that stand out or against your brow.Stagger the length of the cut so you don't end up with a completely uniform layer of hairs. Avoid snipping too much, since you could accidentally trim too much and it will take a while for the hairs to grow back.









You can also pluck the eyebrow itself. To thin the eyebrow, tweeze one or two hairs from various parts of the brow, taking care not to remove too many at once. The idea is to reduce the overall amount of hair while keeping your brows balanced.
If you're hesitant about trimming, thinning, or shaping your brows, or are simply running short on time, try concealing bushy edges. Take a thin makeup brush and carefully apply foundation in light strokes. Start by lightly applying the foundation to the part of your brow that is closest to your nose, then work to the outer edges.

, This will keep thick eyebrows in place after you've combed them into your desired shape. If you don't have the brow gel, spray a little hairspray on an old toothbrush and comb through your eyebrows.

Stop tweezing, waxing, and threading.,
Use a serum on your brows to promote faster growth.,
Eat a diet rich in protein and vitamins that promote hair health.,
Begin tweezing only those hairs closest to your eyelid and lash line after letting your hair grow for four months.,
Give your new brow hair at least four to six months to grow in around your actual eyebrow.",How to Grow Bushier Eyebrows1," Most people's eyebrows grow in a 3-4 month cycle, so hide your tweezers and get comfortable with the idea that your eyebrows might look a bit strange for several months.This is a fairly lengthy process and you're going to have to be patient.


Leave all those random looking baby hairs alone, even if they seem nowhere near your brow. If you have hairs that grow in odd directions or straight out, it could be due to damage from tweezing or waxing.If the regrowth really bothers you, you can try taming them with brow gel or cover them with a little concealer.;
, Most serums will prolong the first stage of hair growth, the anagen phase, which is when your hair is actively growing. This results in longer, fuller hair. Some will also stimulate more follicles to enter this stage so you actually grow more hair.Most of these serums require daily (sometimes twice-daily) application, and don't provide a permanent boost in hair growth: you have to continuously use them to keep seeing results.It usually takes a minimum six weeks of diligent use to start seeing results from a growth serum.Look for products with prostaglandin, a hormone-like compound that occurs naturally in the body and can increase hair growth.There is no guarantee that growth serums will work on everyone--sometimes hair follicles are damaged or made dormant by long-term tweezing, which makes it difficult to regrow hair., Vitamins B and E, biotin and zinc are all linked to hair growth and health.


Your hair is made from proteins, so make sure your diet contains foods like greek yogurt, nuts, and lean meats like chicken and turkey.Biotin nourishes hair and helps it grow and can be found in eggs, another source of protein.Zinc is found in oysters, beef, crab, spinach, and tofu, and keeps your hair from falling out by repairing cells and keeping them healthy.Vitamin E helps with circulation, which aids in hair growth. Find it in almonds, kale, avocado, and kiwi., You will still have hair that is growing not quite at your brow line, but don't start shaping or plucking them yet.Even at this point, your hair may still be growing back at unruly angles. Don't give up on these hairs--as your follicle becomes healthier and your hair goes through a few growth cycles, they will begin to come in at the right direction., It can take up to 12 months for your brows to reach their full potential. Once this happens, don't go crazy with the tweezer, and definitely don't wax. Plucking gives you control to do maintenance (you want bushy brows, not a unibrow) and leave a full brow. It's far too easy to ruin all your hard work with a waxing mistake.Don't use a magnifying mirror or super bright lights when tweezing. It is easy to lose perspective and over pluck."

Apply an antibacterial soap and soothing lotion when you are done plucking.",How to Get Rid of a Unibrow1," Using only the corner will allow you to get your unibrow wet without dripping on your whole face.


Another option is to pluck your unibrow directly after getting out of the shower. The warm water and steam of the shower will have opened up your pores a great deal.;
, Hold it there until the washcloth cools. Repeat this procedure two to three times. The hot water will open your pores and make tweezing your unibrow easier and less painful.

, If you have a magnifying mirror, use this. A magnifying mirror will help you see each hair that you want to remove, but it is not absolutely necessary; a standard mirror will suffice as long as you can get close to it.

, Work outwards towards the part of your eyebrows that you wish to keep. If there are particularly difficult hairs to pluck, use your other hand to pull your skin and make it taut. Be careful not to pluck too much of your eyebrow. Continuously step back to see your results and determine how far you want to pluck.


To figure out where your eyebrow should begin, hold a thin brush vertically at the edge of your nostril and check where it lands along the brow line. That point should be the center starting point of your eyebrow. Repeat this process for both sides of your face., Start from the bottom of your existing eyebrow and work your way upwards. Again, continuously step back and look in the mirror, checking to make sure that you are not plucking too much of your eyebrow.

You are just cleaning up the brow area right now and will begin shaping your eyebrows next.
If you don’t have tweezers or dislike plucking, an alternative option is waxing. However, whereas plucking pull a single hair at a time, waxing pulls out several hairs at once. With waxing, it’s easy to accidentally pull out too many hairs so use caution.

A dab of 1% hydrocortisone cream can also help soothe redness and irritation from plucking.

Your hairs will come out easier., The color should be slightly lighter than your actual eyebrow color in order to create a more natural look.Select a pencil with a fine tip, if possible. A smaller tip allows you to draw in tiny strokes that look like actual hairs.A matte eyeshadow can also be used to fill in the brows if you do not have an eye pencil. , Avoid adding too much color.

Get the recommended touch-up.",How to Get Eyebrow Microblading," A quick Google search will get you started, but you’ll need to more in-depth research than that. Depending on where you live, you may have several different options to compare or you may be making a trek to a technician, so it’s important to do your homework.Check their licenses and certificates. These should be listed on their website, but you can also call and explicitly ask.;
, The best way to guess what your own results would be like is to see the results of previous customers. Look at the technician’s portfolio online, paying special attention to those “before” eyebrow pictures that look most like yours.Check out reviews on their Yelp page, and Google their name to see if you can find any other customers.
Don’t forget, technicians create brows per their client’s preferences. If you don’t like a certain shape or style you see on in their portfolio, that may have simply been the customer’s choice.

, Microblading is not a cheap investment, and depending on where you are located, it can vary from $300 to $1,000. While comparing prices can be helpful and realistic, remember that microblading is a process that can drastically change your face. If you prefer the work of one technician but it’s a bit pricier, decide if you’re worth it.

, When you think you’ve chosen your technician, call and schedule a consultation. This is a short appointment where your technician can look at your natural brows, talk to you more in-depth about the technique, and start determining the best color and shape for your face. Many times, they’ll even use a pencil to create “preliminary” brows.

, If you have a tan on your face during your appointment, the pigment can heal darker than you desire. A tan can also affect how the lines heal.For a couple weeks before your appointment, wear hats and wear sunscreen!

, If you get chemical peels, do not get any within 60 days of your microblading appointment. Also, keep in mind that doing chemical peels after your microblading will cause the pigment to fade faster. Do not get Botox within three weeks of your microblading. Thirty days prior to your procedure, discontinue use of any products with Retinol or Retin-A., Your technician will work with you to create a shape, so don’t worry about getting them shaped prior to your appointment. If you get your eyebrows waxed, make sure you don’t do it within 72 hours of your appointment. In general, going to your appointment au natural is preferable., Both of these can increase bleeding and swelling during the application. To achieve the best results, your skin should be as insensitive to the procedure as possible. The more bleeding and oozing that occurs, the less pigment actually stays in the skin. Excess bleeding and swelling can also make the technician’s job much more difficult., If you have a celebrity “brow goal,” bring a picture (or five). It’s particularly helpful if these celebrities have a similar hair color to you. You may not be able to articulate exactly what you’re looking for, but these pictures can help your technician understand the style of eyebrow you like.

, Before your technician even applies the numbing cream, they’ll work with you to sketch out the eyebrow shape. Take your time to make sure they create the exact shape you like. Observe the inner corners, the tail, the width, the arch, and so on. If you dislike anything, tell them. Don’t worry about taking your sweet time ¬¬– you want these to be perfect, and you’re paying for it.This step is the most important of the entire procedure, so it’s important to be explicit and firm with what you want.

, After you’ve gotten your microblading, make sure to check it out in a mirror and decide if there is anything else you want done. Check for any gaps or any areas where you want a few more strokes. Make sure that you are happy with the shape when you leave the salon.

, Depending on your skin type and how your skin reacted to the procedure, you will get specific instructions from your technician. The aftercare is critically important in how your brows heal and the results you end up with. Some people are told to keep their brows dry, while others are told to put healing ointment on them. Whatever instructions you receive, follow them!, This can be hard if you’re used to filling in your brows meticulously every day, but leave them untouched for at least ten days after the procedure. You may have some discoloration, scabbing, and gaps, but you need to let that heal without any product on top of it. If your brows aren’t flawless as they’re healing, don’t worry – follow your aftercare instructions, and they will be once they’re healed., These can all affect the color and intensity of your finished result. You want the pigment to take to your skin as best as it can. It’s best to plan your microblading appointment strategically, so you’re able to follow these aftercare instructions without much sacrifice.For example, don’t schedule your appointment before a marathon or a tropical vacation.

, Microblading technicians will tell you that you do not achieve perfect eyebrows in one appointment. It is a two-part process. After the first application has healed, you will go back for a touch-up appointment. Now, the technician can observe how your skin took the pigment and how the results healed. Then, you can fix anything you’re unhappy with, darken the color, tweak the shape, and so on."

Comb out your eyebrows.,
Cut your eyebrows.,
Don't apply skin products.,
Wax your eyebrows.,
Pluck eyebrows.,
Go back and forth between eyebrows.,
Pluck or wax every few weeks.",How to Groom Brows2," You can use a small comb or a special spoolie brush to comb out your eyebrows. Brush them upwards towards your forehead and slightly outwards in the direction the hair is going.








The point of this exercise is it make sure all the hairs are aligned for trimming and waxing.
If you don't know what a spoolie brush is, ask at your local drugstore. It's just a small brush like you see in mascara, except you can buy it by itself.

, You'll need a small pair of scissors for this process. As you brush your eyebrow hairs upwards, look to see if any of them are longer then the lines you've made. Trim off the tops of any hairs that are too long, using your comb or brush to guide you.








If your eyebrow hair is exceptionally long, such as it's hanging over the edges of the spoolie brush, you can trim hairs down. Make sure you're not trimming too short, though, if you want to wax. Your hairs need to be a little longer to be pulled up by the wax, with about 3 weeks of growth.
Wipe off any hairs you trim., Before waxing, you want to avoid certain products, as it can increase the sensitivity of your skin. If you use them, waxing could hurt more. You want to skip any exfoliating or astringent product or anything with retinol in it., If you want, you can wax along the lines you've created. To wax, all you need are small wax strips designed for eyebrows. These strips only need the warmth from your hands. They do not need to be heated otherwise.








To begin, pull out a wax strip and cut it to size. Many times, you can cut strips in half, lengthwise. Only use a long enough strip to do half of your eyebrow at once.
Use your fingers to warm up the strip by rubbing it.
Take the paper backing off, and put the strip along the shape you've made on your eyebrow. Use your fingers to make sure the strip is applied securely.
Once it's on, rip it off in one swift motion to remove hairs.

, Another option for shaping your brows is to pluck them. You'll also need to pluck after waxing to catch any stray hairs. Either way, you need to find the hairs outside the line and use tweezers to pluck them out.








Look for the direction the hair is growing, and pluck in the same direction.
Make it easier to pluck by doing it after applying warm water to your face with a washcloth or after you shower.
The best way to pluck is to get as near to the skin as you can because it's easier to grab a hair from the base. You don't want to pinch the skin, though.

, When waxing or plucking, it helps to move back and forth between your eyebrows. Doing so helps you keep them even, as you are able to shape them as you go.








In addition, you might overpluck if you stay on one eyebrow. Moving back and forth can help you see the thickness.

, Some people like to pluck every day, but that can mean you end up with eyebrows that are too thin. You need to let some hairs grow in before you can see whether you need to pluck them or not.If you pluck too often, you'll find you've plucked out hairs that you need to fill in your eyebrow line. You may not want bushy eyebrows, but you don't want nonexistent ones, either.

Use a brow gel.",How to Groom Brows3," While waxing creates cleaner lines, it can create too clean a line on a man. Some stylists suggest men should pluck rather than wax because a bushier, more natural shape looks better on men.The straight lines can look unnatural on a man, like you've drawn it on instead of waxing your natural brow.
Start by plucking underneath your brow. That's often the place you'll need to pluck first. You may not need to pluck the top of your brow at all.
Mostly, you just want to clean up stray hairs and slightly define the arch.

, Once you've plucked, it's time to trim your eyebrows. Trimming on the top helps create a cleaner line without making it too blocky, which is why plucking is better than waxing for men. Start by brushing your eyebrow hair upward and outward with a spoolie brush or small comb.A spoolie brush is a mascara brush, but you can buy separate ones at drugstores.
As you trim, try to cut hairs along the top so they are even, creating a cleaner finish. You can use the brush or comb to help you trim. Use a small pair of scissors for trimming., On younger men, a unibrow can be acceptable, even sexy. However, most stylist recommend getting rid of the unibrow as you age because it will help you look younger and more polished.To remove the middle part of a unibrow, you can use wax strips. Simply buy wax strips meant for eyebrows. They warm up in your hands.
Line up the inside point of your eyebrow with the inside point of your nostrils. Place the strip over the part you want to remove. Use your fingers to rub it down, then remove it quickly., If you just want to add shape to your brows, consider a brow gel. You can use a pomade, but that will add color, too. You can find gels that are clear made specifically for your eyebrows, which you can use to give your eyebrows definition and shape.Most gels come with a brush, much like mascara. However, you'll need to add a little of the product to it first before applying.
Use the brush and gel to brush your eyebrows upwards in the direction the hair grows. Leave it in to dry.

Using a conditioner on them can make them softer and easier to work with.Start by putting warm water on a washcloth and placing it over your eyebrows. Leave it there for a minute or two, making your eyebrows damp and warm.
If you have a leave-in conditioner, simply apply a small amount to each eyebrow, making sure to rub it in well so it doesn't get in your eyes.
If you want to use a wash-out conditioner, pick one that's fairly thick. Apply enough to cover each eyebrow, and leave it on there for about 5 minutes. Try not to look up and get it on your eyelashes while it's in. Use a washcloth to wipe it off at the end, then wash your eyebrows more thoroughly. You can also do this step in the shower, but be careful about getting it in your eyes.
You can buy conditioners specifically for eyebrows, though you'll pay more for them. Some of these products promise to help regrow hair.

, Eyebrow pencils come in a variety of colors, and you can use them to shape and fill in your brows. Pick a color that matches your eyebrow hair or is slightly darker.For heavy definition, use the pencil to line the underside of your eyebrow along the hairline.
To fill in your brow, use the pencil to make small strokes across your eyebrows, following the direction of the hair. When you're done, comb your brows with a spoolie brush to even it out a little.

, Powders can also help fill in your eyebrows. You pick a powder that matches your eyebrow color, though you'll want a slightly darker color and a slightly lighter color. It will likely come with wax to apply before the powder and maybe concealer to clean up the shape.Start by brushing your brows into shape with a spoolie brush.
Use your finger to pull out a little wax. Run your finger over your brow, going with the direction of the hair.
Start with a slightly darker color at the arch. Use a small angled brush. Use small strokes to brush the powder in, moving towards the tip and going in the direction of the hair. With a lighter shade, start at the inside of the brow, moving toward the arch. Blend it in as you get to the arch.
You can set the powder by running a brow gel over it, gently.

, Pomades can provide shape and color to your eyebrows, depending on the product. Once you've brushed your brows, you can use the pomade to create a more finished look for your brows. When picking one out, choose one that matches your eyebrow hair color.Use an angled brush with a defined line to apply pomade along the bottom of the brow line along the hair line. Don't start all the way on the inside of the brow. Come a little bit in. Pull the line all the way out to the end, making it as pointed as you want it. If you want some product on the inner part of your eyebrow, choose a product that fills in lighter, and still don't go all the way to the inside. If you use a lighter color, make sure to blend it into the darker color.
Once you have a small line, use the brush to lightly pull it up into the hair.
You can also add a line to the top for more definition, especially if you have bushier eyebrows., Another option is brow mascara. Brow mascaras add body and build to your eyebrows, if you prefer yours to be bushier. They also add color.








Brow mascaras come in a tube like eyelash mascara.
To apply with a ball brush that comes in some of these mascaras, start by working from the outer edge in. That is, brush from the outer corner to the inner corner, against the grain. Then go back the other way.
Repeat if you want them even bushier.

, A mattifying gel is meant to take the shine off. When you get your hair removed, you may have shiny skin underneath. Applying this type of gel can work to take care of that shine, so it doesn't stand out against the rest of your skin.Just a apply a small amount to the skin where you've had hair removed near your eyebrows. For instance, you may want to put some between your eyebrows.

, If you're tweezers have been hiding in the bottom of a makeup bag for years, it's time to get a new pair. Old pairs aren't as sharp, meaning you will need to pluck hairs more than once.Pick a pair that has a slanted edge, coming down to a point. These tweezers make it easier to grab hairs than a strictly pointed pair.
When looking at tweezers, pick a stainless steel pair. This metal isn't irritating for most people. It's also easy to clean and long-lasting., If you don't have the money to invest in a new pair of tweezers, you can sharpen an old pair. The easiest way to do it is to rub a nail file along the edge you pluck with, which will help create a better grip.You can also use sand instead, rubbing it along the edge.
Clean your tweezers every time you use them with a bit of rubbing alcohol.

, When plucking, you need a good light to see by. If you can, invest in a good vanity light to make sure you can see. You can also do fairly well in a brightly lit bathroom, if you don't want to use a vanity light.If you have neither of these options, move to natural light. You can move over to the window to see better.
A magnified mirror can also help you see better.

Get extensions for special occasions.,
Talk to a plastic surgeon about a brow transplant.",How to Grow Bushier Eyebrows2," Your sparse-looking brows may actually be full of little white baby hairs, and tinting them a darker shade will reveal a bolder, thicker eyebrow.Tinting lasts between three and five weeks.Tinting can easily go wrong if the shade is too dark, the chemicals too harsh, or you stain your skin, so make sure you go to a professional with a good reputation., Visit a brow bar or salon for this procedure, where they will glue individual synthetic or natural hairs to your brow hair, creating the (temporary) full brow of your dreams. Unlike eyelash extensions, brow extensions will not damage your existing hair as they fall off, so they won't interrupt your progress if you're growing yours out.If you don't have eyebrows, the extensions can be glued directly to your skin, but they will only last a few days.Extensions only last a few weeks at the most, and touching, washing, or exercising can make them fall off even faster., If your eyebrow hair will no longer grow, a plastic surgeon can carefully design a brow that best fits your face and build it using your own hair. The finished look should be natural, with the new hair blending into your brow.A brow transplant is irreversible, so make sure you are thinking about what looks best on you, not what is most popular right now.Do some research and find a reputable surgeon who has experience with the procedure.

Cover the wax with a strip from the box.,
Let the wax harden.,
Remove the strip.,
Apply cold water or an ice cube if the skin swells or is red.",How to Get Rid of a Unibrow2," Waxing kits come with everything you will need to wax away that pesky unibrow. Wax kits use either cold or warm wax that will pull the hair out by the root. Unibrows that are removed with wax will stay removed for longer than unibrows that are tweezed away.


There is also the option of purchasing wax-covered strips. These are best for newcomers to the waxing world. Simply press a pre-waxed strip against the area that you wish to remove hair from. Pat the strip down, hold the skin around it down with your fingers, and swiftly pull the strip off.
Wax is notoriously painful, even though it's so effective. If you have sensitive skin, consider applying a little topical numbing cream to the area you intend to wax prior to embarking on the process., Follow the instructions on the box to make sure that you do this correctly. Generally, you can warm the wax up in the microwave, and it may only take 30 to 60 seconds. Stir the wax well to make sure it's fully melted.

, It is much easier to ask a friend to do this rather than do it yourself. However, you can certainly do it yourself if you use a mirror and have good aim. If you mess up and put the wax on a part of your eyebrow that you do not want to removed, rinse it off and try again.


Take a thin brush or pencil and hold it vertically against the widest part of your nose. The point at which the brush meets your eyebrow is where your eyebrow should begin from the center. Repeat on both sides to determine how much hair to remove., Pat it down firmly. Make sure that when you place the strip it does not cover anything that you do not want removed.

, You should follow the specific instructions listed on the box to determine how long you should way before removing the strip. Depending on the wax, this may only take another minute or so. The wax should feel cool to the touch from the accessible side of the waxing strip.


Again, asking a friend to help is a much easier way to wax your unibrow.

, Hold the skin around the strip down with one hand. Give the strip a swift and fluid yank like your are removing a band-aid.


Check your face in the mirror after removing the strip. It's possible that some hairs may get left behind; you can pluck those individually with tweezers.

, Apply an antibacterial lotion to prevent break-outs or ingrown hairs.


A small dab of hydrocortisone cream also works to reduce pain and irritation."

Test your skin to see if the cream will cause irritation.,
Apply the cream to your unibrow.,
Leave the cream on your face for the directed amount of time.,
Wash the cream off with a washcloth.",How to Get Rid of a Unibrow3," You can find this cream at your local pharmacy. This is a hair removal cream that is safe to use on the face. This cream is good for those who do not like the pain involved in tweezing or waxing. Be aware that this cream only removes surface level hair, whereas waxing and tweezing removes hair and its roots. This means that your unibrow will grow back faster when you use this cream., Place small dab of the cream on the back or your hand or some other place. Leave it on for as long as the box directs you to (this will generally be two minutes). Wash off the cream. If your skin is very red or irritated, it is probably best if you do not use the cream on your face. If it is only mildly red or there is no reaction, go ahead and use it!, Do this in front of a mirror so you can monitor where the cream goes. Make sure you do not get the cream on any part of your eyebrow that you wish to keep.To measure where you should begin, use an eyebrow pencil or thin brush to find the point of your eyebrow that vertically matches the widest part of your nostril at either side of your nose. The space in between these two points will be where the hair needing to be removed lies., The box it came in should state how long you should leave the cream on for (it is generally two minutes). Do not leave the cream on for longer than the directed time or your skin could become irritated.

, The hairs of your unibrow will wash off with the cream, as the cream will have chemically removed them. Dry your face off."

Apply a small amount of standard shaving cream to your unibrow.,
Run a razor under water.,
Wipe the shaving cream and hair off with a wet washcloth.",How to Get Rid of a Unibrow4," Shaved unibrows will come back much more quickly that unibrows that have been plucked, waxed, or had cream applied to them., You can purchase eyebrow razors at beauty stores and pharmacies.

, Make sure that you do not get the shaving cream on any part of your eyebrow that you wish to keep.You can also mark the portion of your eyebrows that you wish to shave with a brow pencil. Doing this will help you place the shaving cream only on the portion of your eyebrows that you want to get rid of.
Hold the brow pencil vertically on either side of the bottom of your nose. The point where the pencil meets your eyebrow is the center point of your brow; everything between the left and right points should be removed., Carefully shave the portion of your eyebrow that you wish to remove. Shave from your brow line to the very top of the bridge of your nose., Try to avoid getting any shaving cream in your eye. If you missed several hairs, re-apply the shaving cream and shave again.

Combine brown sugar, honey, and water.,
Microwave for 30 seconds.,
Let the wax cool slightly.,
Apply the wax to your unibrow.,
Apply a cloth strip.,
Rip it off.,
Apply hydrocortisone cream.",How to Get Rid of a Unibrow5," In a small microwave-safe mixing bowl, thoroughly mix together 2 tsp (10 ml) brown sugar, 1 tsp (5 ml) honey, and 1 tsp (5 ml) water.The honey and sugar should create a very effective ""wax"" for your eyebrows. This option will still be as painful as a conventional waxing kit, but it's useful if you don't have the waxing kit at home and don't wish to buy one.

, Microwave the ingredients on high for about 30 seconds, stirring in 10-second intervals with a spoon. It should bubble and look brown.Do not microwave the mixture too long, however. If you make it too hot, it can turn hard and unusable.
Using the mixture before it turns brown and bubbly can cause it to stay too thin, though, which will prevent it from working correctly.

, It should reach a temperature just a little warmer than room temperature. At this point, the wax should also be fairly thick but still soft.

, Use your finger or a thin spatula to apply the homemade wax to the section of hair getting removed.Hold a brush up against the side of either nostril and identify the point of your brow vertically equal to this placement. That point is where your eyebrow should begin in the center of your face.

, Press a clean rag against the gooey wax, covering as much of the wax as possible.Flannel, cotton, and similar materials should all work. Just make sure the fabric is clean before use.

, Let the wax harden and cling to the fabric for 30 to 60 seconds, then quickly rip the cloth away in one fast, fluid motion. It should remove the wax and any attached eyebrow hairs.


If there are additional hairs left behind, you might want to consider tweezing them instead of repeating the wax procedure to minimize irritation.

, Place a pea-sized dab of hydrocortisone cream over the waxed area to sooth any irritation.You can also cool the area with a little ice and apply an antibacterial cream to minimize the risk of breakouts or ingrown hairs.

Make sure that your brows look even.",How to Get a Perfect Arch for Your Eyebrows," You will need several tools to shape your eyebrows correctly.You will need sharp tweezers. One of the mistakes many people make when tweezing is they use old, dull tweezers. Replace your tweezers if yours are getting dull on the ends.
Find a magnification mirror. This will help you see smaller, lighter hairs that are harder to spot using a conventional mirror.
Get an eyebrow pencil. You will need this to reference and mark where your brows will begin and end, as well as where the highest point in your eyebrow arch goes.
You will also need an eyebrow brush and trimming scissors.;
, You should never perform any type of brow shaping without a clean tool.








Consider getting a case for them if they get dirty in your makeup case or medicine cabinet.
If your tweezers are dirty and caked with makeup from your makeup case, wash them with warm water first.
You can sterilize tweezers with rubbing alcohol.
Let them dry before you use them.

, Trim the ends of your hairs with the eyebrow trimming scissors.








Start by brushing your brows upward.
Then use the brow scissors to trim just the ends of the longest hairs. Angle your scissors horizontally and trim the tips of the hairs along the edges of the eyebrow.
Trimming the hair will reveal your brow shape and remove weight and bulk so you can see better when you are shaping your brows.
Brush your eyebrow hair back downward before you start shaping.

, This will help you decide what shape for your eyebrows will be best.








If you have a square face, the sides of your face are straight and your jawline is slightly angled with a minimal curve. Your face is nearly as wide as it is long.
If you have a round face, your face will be wider with soft angles. The sides of your face will curve outwards rather than be straight. Your chin will be rounded and your cheekbones will be the widest part of your face.
People whose faces are longer than they are wide have a long face shape. The forehead, cheek and jawline are roughly the same width and the chin has a very slight curve.
If your chin is pointed and your forehead is the widest part of your face then you have a heart shaped face.
People with oval faces will have a forehead that is only a tiny bit wider than their curved chin.

, Most people would not think to do this, but your face shape should determine what general shape your brows should take.If you have a square, angular face shape, you should opt for thick, well defined eyebrows. Cosmetologists recommend going to a bolder look if you have a face that is more or less square shaped, since your face is already so well defined. It wouldn't look natural to contrast this with a thinner eyebrow.
If you have a rounder face, cosmetologists recommend a higher arched brow shape. A higher arch will open up the eye area and make your face look longer.
For those with longer faces, beauty experts suggest a flatter, thinner eyebrow. This will help to open up your face in a sideways direction.
If you have a heart shaped face, you should opt for a softer rounded arch. This will help to balance out a sharper, pointed chin.
For those with oval faces, this face type will look good with most brow shapes. This will depend more on your personal preference.

, You can use an eyebrow pencil to help you find this landmark.








Most people dread having a uni-brow, but a common mistake when shaping eyebrows is taking off too much from the middle of the face.Most people use the nostril of their nose as a landmark for where their eyebrows should begin, but beauty experts suggest the side of the bridge of the nose is actually the correct reference point.
To find the place where your brows should start, hold your eyebrow pencil parallel to the side of the bridge of your nose.
Mark this landmark on your eyebrow with your eye pencil.

, Another mistake many people make is trimming the sides of the brows too short.








Angle your eye pencil from your nostril to the far corner of your eye.
This point is where your eyebrow should end.
Mark this point on your face with your eye pencil.

, This should be slightly right of the center of your eyebrow.








Remember, if you have a rounder face, you will want the arch to be high.
Those with a longer face should opt for a flatter eyebrow with a less defined arch.
Hold your eye pencil vertically. Line it up with the far side of your iris.
This area just to the side of center will be where the highest point of the arch should be.
Mark this area with your eye pencil.

, You will be able to see all the hairs that need to be plucked.At this point you can also use your eyebrow pencil to lightly color in the exact shape of your eyebrows. It might be difficult to do this over your eyebrow hair, but even a thin outline of the ideal shape of your eyebrow can help.
Any hairs outside of this shape will need to be plucked.
Make sure your aren't making your eyebrows too thin. One of the mistakes most people make is removing too much hair from the top and bottom of their eyebrows.
A good rule is to only remove 2-3 rows of hairs from above and below the eyebrow.

, This will clean up the beginning of your eyebrows.









Position the tip of the tweezers at the base of each hair and pull it out from the base.
Don't pluck past the landmark point you marked or your eyebrows will look too short.
Look in the mirror to make sure you haven't missed any stray hairs before moving on to the next area.

, Make sure you are angling the shape of your brows up towards your arch landmark.








Remove one or two rows of hairs. As you remove your hair you might have to remove more hair as you angle up towards your arch landmark.
As you remove hair at the apex of the arch of your brow, be careful not to make your eyebrows have a very angular and sharply angled arch.
Once you reach your arch landmark you should start angling the shape of your eyebrows downwards towards the far corner of your eye.
The ends of your eyebrows should end in a fine taper.
Try not to shape the arch of your eyebrow as a sharp angle. A smoothly curved brow will look more natural.

, You want to make sure that they look smooth and natural.








The thickest part of the eyebrow should be at the middle of your face by your nose.
The brow should then gradually taper to a point at the end by the far corner of your eye.
At the arch, you should not have a sharp angled shape, but rather a smoothly curved transition. Your eyebrows should look natural.

, You don't want one to look thicker or higher than the other.








Remove any missed hairs. By looking in your magnification mirror, you will be able to see where there are inconsistencies between your two eyebrows.
If you accidentally remove part of your brow or thin it too much, use a brow pencil to fill the missing hair.
Remember, dark brown pencil is best even for those with darker complexions as it will look more natural than a black pencil.

",How to Dye Your Eyebrows," The dye that is formulated for use on your scalp is going to be way too harsh on the skin around your eyes. You may damage the fragile skin around your eyes or even singe your brows off.Look for beard dyesor demi-permanent eyebrow dyes instead.Beard dyes often come in a wide variety of neutral tones and are designed to dye fine hairs, like the ones in your eyebrows.;
, Darkening the hair will refine the shape of your brow and can make your brows look thicker and fuller--perfect for anyone with sparse or very light eyebrows.You can try dyeing two shades darker if you want to up the drama of your look.


Try not to go drastically darker than your natural shade--your brows can look inky and fakeand your natural roots will be obvious when new hairs grown in.
Some beauty experts suggest trying to match the color of your eyebrows to the darkest hairs on your head., If your brows are black, try dyeing them a dark brown. Again, try not to stray too far from your natural shade so it won't look strange when your roots grow in.


Keep in mind that contrasting brows are on-trend right now, so you may want to keep your bold, dark eyebrows for the moment.

, No dye--even products marketed as eyebrow dye--is FDA approved for use on your eyebrows or eyelashes. You can have an allergic reaction or damage the sensitive skin around your eye. The dyes can cause irritation and, if they get in your eye, can potentially cause blindness.If you decide to dye your eyebrows, be very very careful not to get any in your eye. Apply the dye in small amounts so there is less chance it will drip off the applicator and into your eye.
Keep two bottles of sterile eye irrigation solution on-hand to flush out your eye, should you get any dye in it. Irrigate your eye with the entire bottle and, if burning continues, use the entire second bottle.Be sure to spot test the dye on your skin (the back of your neck or the inside of your upper arm will work). If your skin doesn't react in the two days following the treatment, then you can dye your brows without worrying about a reaction., Eyebrow dye should be applied to a clean area. Gently scrub your eyebrows to remove oil and dirt. If your skin or eyebrows are oily, the dye may not work as well.


Secure your hair back from your face, either by pulling it into a ponytail or using a headband or bobby pins.
Make sure you remove any makeup as well so you can clearly see the color change., Use a cotton swab to spread the petroleum on the skin around your eyebrow (but make sure you don't get any on your eyebrows). This will act as a barrier to make sure you don't dye the skin around your brow and help keep the dye out of your eye. It may also reduce skin irritation.







, Mixing instructions vary based on the brand of product purchased, but the result is the same. The mixed eyebrow dye should have the consistency of a thick paste. If the dye is runny or watery, it is not mixed correctly. The pasty composition keeps the dye on your eyebrows without running into your eyes.








If the dye consists of two tubes of product that you mix together, use only about a pea-sized amount of each. You won't need much, and you can save the rest of the dye for touch ups later.Make the dye solution right before you plan to use it.

, Eyebrow dye kits come with an applicator, but you also can use a cotton swab or a clean spoolie wand. Try building up the dye from the inside half of your eyebrow (the side closest to your nose) and working out toward the thinner end.








Make sure you cover the roots of your eyebrows and cover the entire eyebrow evenly.Cover one eyebrow completely, then do the other eyebrow.

, Brands usually suggest between 10-15 minutes to dye, but dyeing in three minute increments gives you more control over the final color.


Use a cotton swab dipped in warm water to wipe off any cream that ended up on your skin and not your hair, or to clean up areas where it appears to be dying your skin. If warm water doesn't work, you can use a little facial tonic to clean it up., Close your eyes to avoid getting any dye in them. Smooth your brows and inspect the color. If the dye didn't take, repeat the dye process for another three minutes.









Don't use the dye more than two or three times, as you may dry out or damage your skin.
When you reach the desired shade, remove the dye with a dry cotton pad. Then go over your eyebrow with cotton pad wet with dye stain remover to stop the dyeing process.
Rinse or wipe your brow with warm water.

, You can use a cotton swab to spot-treat anywhere you may have missed., It is important you don't tweeze before dying your eyebrows, as this can lead to irritation and infection.








, Eyebrow dye usually begins to fade after a week so the color won't be as intense.If you can't wait a week, brush a drop of clarifying shampoo through your eyebrows with a clean toothbrush or spoolie. Allow it to sit for 60 seconds, then rinse your brows.The clarifying shampoo will strip the oils and some of the dye off your eyebrows.









If you notice you have dye on your skin underneath your eyebrows, apply an oil or silicone based makeup remover to a cotton pad and gently wipe your brows. If there is dye on your skin it should show up on the cotton pad, and your brows should be toned down about a shade once they dry.You can also make a paste using a 1:1 ratio of baking soda and your usual shampoo. Apply this to your brows with a clean brush and allow it to sit for several minutes. It may take a few tries, but this should calm the color of your brows.,"

Brush on a thin layer of cosmetics lacquer or sealant over your new eyebrows.",How to Draw on Your Eyebrows1," Before applying any makeup, your face should be cleaned, moisturized, and dried. If you wear a full face of makeup, make sure the following steps are finished before starting your brows:


Begin with a layer of makeup primer. Primer will prevent your makeup from smudging and help it to last longer. This is extremely important when trying to maintain the illusion of natural eyebrows on bare skin.
Sponge on a light layer of foundation. Follow up by adding concealer to any problem areas you want to cover up. Blend well with a makeup sponge or your fingertips.
Many people use only bronzer or only blush, but if you use both start with the bronzer. Once these elements are ready, you can move on to drawing your brows.;
, Powder will help set your foundation and concealer. It also helps to ensure your skin is nice and dry. If there is too much moisture when you draw them on, your eyebrows may start to run. 







, You will be using this mixture to draw on the base of your brow. A combination of black with one or more shade of brown tends to look the most natural. A little bit of black powder in a light brown mix will make the lighter shade look more convincing, while some brown will soften the harshness of pure black.







, Use a small slanted makeup brush to form the base of your eyebrow. Use your brow ridge as a guide for your eyebrows' shape. Drawing drastically away from your brow ridge will make your eyebrows look less realistic. Otherwise, you can experiment with different shapes before deciding which looks right for you.









If you don't have a small enough makeup brush, you can use a cotton swab instead., Use a black-brown eyebrow pencil sharpened to a fine point. Draw small lines from the bottom of your eyebrow outline feathered away from your nose. A few stray ""hairs"" that don't perfectly line up with your brow outline will keep your eyebrows from looking too perfect and more like real eyebrows.







, The sealant will keep your drawn on eyebrows smudge free for up to 24 hours.









If you find that the sealant gives your brows too much of a shine, add another dusting of translucent powder. The powder will mattify and remove the sheen."

",How to Do Natural Eyebrows," Use water and a facial cleanser to clear make up, dirt, and debris away from your brows. Make sure your brows are thoroughly dry before you begin. , The pencil should be placed at the outer side of your nostril. Make sure to hold the pencil in a straight position. Observe where the tip of the pencil lands on your brow. This is where your eyebrow should start.


If the tip lands too far from the middle (making your nose look big), then just move the start of your brow slightly inwards to slim your nose., Angle it from the side of your nostril to the outer corner of your eye. Where the pencil lands is where your brows should end, ideally. Place a dot with a very light colored pencil at this point. This way, when you go to fill in your eyebrows, you have an idea of how far you should go.








As a general rule of thumb, the end of your brow should be at a 45-degree angle from the outside corner of your eye.

, Starting with one of your brows, brush it in an upward motion. Brushing your brows in an upward motion will help you see the shape of your brow, as well as where you need to fill it in to get a smooth, even look.







, To fill in your brow, use an eyebrow pencil that is as close to or slightly lighter than the color of your natural eyebrow hair. Using short feathery strokes, lightly fill in the gaps and sparse areas in the middle, active portions of your brow.








Do not overly fill in the inside corners and ends of your brow. These are the areas where you want to go the lightest with your pencil.

, Make sure to step away from the mirror and assess your look every minute or two while you are filling in your brow. This way you can correct your look if your brow looks too dark or if the coloring is uneven.







, After you have filled in your brow with a light pencil, go in with a darker pencil to add dimension. Using gentle pressure and short strokes, fill in the middle, active portions of your brow with the darker pencil.








Try not to fill in the inner corners and ends of your brow with the darker pencil.
Repeat steps one through four on your other eyebrow.

, To blend your brows, use a spoolie. Following the shape of your brow, brush your brow two or three times to get a blended, natural look.







, Brush your eyebrows with an eyebrow gel to set your look. The gel will hold your eyebrow hairs in place and give them a refined look.







, Dip a small, eye shadow brush in translucent powder. Then trace the perimeter of your brows. This will define the shape of your brows and give them a clean, sharp look.

Don’t pick a color that is darker than your eyebrows. Go a little lighter than your natural color if you can’t find a matching shade. Keep in mind that brown looks good on any eyebrow color.
Find what color that works best by applying swatches above your eyebrows. Figure out how darkly to apply your eyebrow pencil by applying different amounts of pressure as you draw your swatches.;

If your skin is pale and your hair is light, use a neutral taupe. If your skin and hair are darker, use a neutral dark brown instead., Use your existing eyebrows as a guide when determining a shape. Fill in your brow using small, light strokes until you're happy with your eyebrows' shape and thickness.

Purchase a false lash glue remover.,
Remove your eye makeup.,
Put the glue remover on a cotton swab.,
Apply the glue remover to your false eyelashes.,
Remove the false eyelashes.,
Remove the remaining lash glue.",How to Take off False Eyelashes1," Most false eyelash kits come with eyelash glue, but they don’t often contain glue remover. However, you can find many brands of eyelash glue remover in the beauty department of your local department store. Choose a brand that meets your specific skin requirements; when possible, choose glue remover made by the same company that made the eyelash glue you used.


Always check to make sure you’re not allergic to any of the ingredients.;
, It’s best to take off your eye makeup prior to using the lash glue remover, as the buildup of makeup on your eyelid can make it more difficult to take off your lashes. Use makeup remover or baby oil to gently wash off your eye makeup. Put a bit of the remover on a cotton pad, and wipe at your eyelid until the majority of the makeup is gone.









Don’t try removing your mascara at this point, if you’re wearing it. This can rip at the false lashes and pull the skin on your eyelids uncomfortably.
Don’t wash your face with soap and water to take off your eye makeup though, as this can damage both your false and natural lashes.

, Position yourself in front of a mirror, and get out the glue remover and a cotton swab. Put a small dab of the glue remover onto the cotton swab, so that the cotton is completely moistened. The remover may smell faintly like acetone, but this is normal.








, Gently rub your lash line with the cotton swab covered in glue remover. Brush the base of the false eyelashes with the swab several times, to remove as much of the glue as possible. Do this to both eyes, and let it set for 20-30 seconds.








, If you plan on throwing out your false eyelashes, you can use your fingers to pull them off. If you want to save your false eyelashes and reuse them later on, use tweezers to remove them. Grab the false eyelashes as close to your eyelid as possible, starting at the inner corner of your eye. Gently tug upwards on them to pull them away from the eyelid. They should remove easily; if there is tension when you try to pull them off, apply more glue remover and wait 30 seconds before trying again.








, Set aside your false eyelashes, and examine your eyelids. It is likely that there is some residual glue left on your natural lash line which needs to be removed. To do this, put a bit more of the glue remover on the cotton swab, and spread it over the glue that’s remaining. Then, use the dry end of the cotton swab to gently rub off the glue, cleaning your eyelid. Use a bit of warm water and your face wash of choice to finish off the job.

Pour some makeup remover onto a cotton swab.,
Remove the lash glue with your cotton swab.,
Pull off the false eyelashes.,
Wash your eyelids with facial soap and water.",How to Take off False Eyelashes2," If you want to save your false eyelashes to reuse them later on, choose an oil-free liquid makeup remover. If you intend on tossing out your false eyelashes after removal, then any type of makeup remover will work. Whatever type of makeup remover you choose, make sure that it is not expired and that it doesn’t contain any ingredients you may be allergic to.

, Handily enough, you can use the same product to remove your eye makeup as you can to remove your false eyelashes. Before you have a go at your lashes though, remove any eye shadow or eyeliner you may be wearing. Pour some of the remover onto a cotton pad, and gently rub your eyes to remove the makeup. Don’t remove any mascara yet though, as this might damage your false eyelashes.








, Get out a clean cotton swab and dip the end into your makeup remover, so that it is fully saturated. Position yourself in front of a mirror, so that you can see your eyelid and lash line close up.








, Gently rub your lash line where the glue is most prevalent, using the saturated end of the cotton swab. Go back and forth slowly; the glue will likely ball up as it is removed from your skin. You can use the dry end of the cotton swab to sweep away the glue as it comes off. Repeat these actions until all the glue has been removed.








, The lashes are likely to be falling off on their own at this point. Use your fingers or a pair of tweezers to gently pull them off your eyelids. Keep in mind that you are less likely to damage the lashes if you use tweezers to remove them, in case you wanted to reuse them later on.








, To finish the job, wash off the remaining makeup remover and any makeup or glue residue from your eyelids. Use a mild facial cleanser and warm water to clean it off, and pat your eyelids dry.

Pour some oil onto your hands, and rub it onto your eyelids.,
Pull off the false lashes.,
Remove any excess glue on your lash line.,
Rinse off the oil and remaining makeup.",How to Take off False Eyelashes3," Oil will very easily remove the glue used to secure false eyelashes in place, but it also coats the false eyelashes and makes them unusable in the future. As a result, you should only use oil to remove your false eyelashes if you intend on throwing them away afterwards. The most effective types of oil to use are coconut, almond, and baby oil.

, Oil naturally breaks down makeup, easily removing it from your face. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about taking your makeup off prior to removing your lashes, and you don’t have to worry about damaging your false lashes, since you’ll be throwing them out anyway. Splash your eyelids with warm water, and then gently rub the oil onto your eyelids and lash line to remove the makeup. Splash more water onto your lids to remove the makeup and expose your lash line more clearly.








, Use your fingertips or a pair of tweezers to grip the false lashes as close to the lash line as possibly. Starting at the inner corner, gently pull the lashes off from your lid. Work slowly until you reach the outer corner, and the lashes are fully removed.








, When your false eyelashes have been removed, return to your eyelids and check for any remaining glue. Apply a few fresh dabs of oil, and work it into your lash line until the glue comes off.








, Use your favorite facial soap and warm water to clean the rest of your face. Gently rub the soap onto your skin until it lathers, focusing on areas where there is still makeup. Splash warm water onto your face to remove the soap, and use a clean towel to pat your face dry.

Fill a dish with makeup remover.,
Place the false lashes in the dish, immersing them in the makeup remover.,
Rinse off the lashes.,
Lay the lashes out to dry.,
Store the lashes properly.",How to Take off False Eyelashes4," False lashes don’t have to be tossed after a single use; if you clean and store them safely, they can be reworn a few more times depending on their condition. If your lashes aren’t missing any sections, are not bent along the lash line, and are generally clean and well-kept, you can clean them and save them for a future date.

, Get out a small bowl or cup, and fill it with ½ inch to 1-inch of oil-free liquid makeup remover. The makeup remover will dissolve any mascara or eye product on your false lashes, preparing them for the next use.

, Set the lashes n the dish so that they are totally covered in the makeup remover. Leave them to soak for 5-10 minutes, so that the remover has a chance to dissolve all the stuck-on makeup.








, Turn on a slow stream of warm water in your tap, and carefully rinse off the makeup remover on the lashes. Don’t rub or scrub at the lashes too much, as this could cause some of the individual hairs to fall out.








, Place the now-clean lashes on a dry tissue or towel, and leave them there to air-dry for 15-20 minutes. You may pat them gently with a tissue to absorb some of the excess water, if they are drying too slowly.

, Keep your lashes out of your regular makeup bag where they might get bumped around, and put them in a place where they won’t become damaged. If you have the original case the lashes came in, put them back in that for storage. Otherwise, place the lashes in a small bag or small container, and store them in a dry area until their next use.

As the glue will dry fast, you're going to be applying glitter and glue in sections. To start, you should apply some glitter on the corner of each eyebrow nearest to the bridge of your noseUse the applicator that came with your glitter brow kit. Apply the glue in quick swiping motions.
Only apply glue about a centimeter into your eyebrow.

, Take the glitter that came with your glitter brow kit. Use the applicator designed to apply the glitter. You will now apply glitter to the corners of each eyebrow. Remember to work quickly, as you don't want the glue to dry before you're done applying glitter. Choose the lightest color glitter from your kit for the corners of your eyebrows.Apply the glitter using light, dabbing motions to each eyebrow.
If the glitter looks a little sparse, don't worry. You will go over the eyebrows again when you're done.

, Choose a darker color to proceed. You want your eyebrows to get darker as they move away from your nose. This creates a nice ombre effect that can look fun and festive.Keep in mind, you can do your eyebrows all in the same color if you choose. However, many glitter brow kits are designed to produce an ombre effect.

These products are advertised to increase the thickness and fullness of your eyelashes. They often contain various ingredients such as natural peptides, vitamins, and oils. Review the label on each product to see what it contains, or ask a specialist at a beauty salon or cosmetic shop for recommendations.


Look for products that contain prostaglandin analogs. These are ophthalmic solutions that many think may help with eyelash growth. However, their safety and efficacy have not been scientifically proven.Products that contain keratin, a protein that promotes cell growth, have been praised for supporting hair growth and strength.Consider trying eyelash serums that contain this protein.Some products are sold as regular mascara with additional oils and vitamins that support healthy eyelashes.;
, There are many eyelash growth serums on the market that you can buy over-the-counter. Since these are considered cosmetics by the FDA, their success rate, safety, and efficacy have not been completed evaluated.Before using an over-the-counter product, talk to your doctor or ophthalmologist to see if using these products is safe for you.

, Over-the-counter eyelash serums are typically sold with a mascara wand applicator or a small brush applicator. The small brush allows you to more easily apply the product directly to the root of your upper lash line, but the mascara wand applicator allows you to coat you upper and lower eyelashes from root to tip.


Perhaps a mascara wand applicator would be easier for on-the-go, fast application. A small brush may be great for those who wish to thoroughly apply the product to each root. Think about which applicator would be easier for you to use on a day-to-day basis.

, Over-the-counter eyelash growth serums that are sold at everyday shops and pharmacies can cost between $8 and $20. Luxury brands that are sold at salons, department stores, and cosmetic shops can cost between $40 and $100.Prescription serums can be very pricey in comparison to over-the-counter products. They can cost around $1000 each year, and most insurance companies do not cover the costs., In the U.S., Latisse (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution) is the only FDA-approved prescription eyelash growth solution.It is applied daily via a sterile, one-use applicator brush.This product was originally used to treat the eye disease glaucoma, but doctors and patients noticed that the solution promoted hair growth. Talk to your doctor or ophthalmologist to see if using a prescription serum is appropriate for you.

, Most eyelash growth serums are considered to be safe, but it is important to ensure that you will not have an allergic reaction to the product you choose. Before applying the product directly to your eye, apply a small amount of the product on your cheek, neck, or forearm to see if it causes an allergic reaction. Monitor the area for 24 hours.


If you have an allergic reaction, do not use the product.

, If you wear contact lenses, be sure to carefully remove and store them before you apply any prescription or over-the-counter eye serum.You can re-insert your contact lenses 15 minutes after you have applied the serum., Use a gentle cleanser and warm water to wash your face before applying any products onto your lashes. Make sure your face and eyes are clean and free of dirt, oil, and make-up.A clean surface will allow the serum to better adhere to your lash line.

, If you are using a prescription eyelash serum, your doctor or pharmacist will provide you with a container of solution and a set of disposable applicators. The serum should be applied to the upper eyelash line every evening with the sterile, one-time-use applicator. Remove the one-time use applicator, and add one drop of the solution onto the applicator’s brush.


Since a prescription eye serum is an ophthalmic solution, it will not cause harm to your eye. You do not need to rinse your eye if the serum comes into contact with it., Close your eye and spread a thin coating of the serum across the roots of your upper lash line, working from the corner of your eye outward.Do not apply the medication to the lower eyelid. The medication will spread to your lower lash as you blink.

, Some over-the-counter products can be applied directly onto your eyelashes using a mascara wand. Work the product through your upper and lower eyelashes. Begin at the base of your lash line, and wiggle the wand in an upward motion to completely coat each eyelash., Since the serum promotes hair growth, be careful not to apply it anywhere other than your eyelashes or lash line. Otherwise, you may experience unwanted hair growth elsewhere. Blot the corner of your eye with a tissue after application to prevent any excess serum from spreading to other areas of your skin., Use a gentle cleanser, unscented soap, baby soap, or a dish detergent and lukewarm water to clean the applicators for the over-the-counter products. Gently wash them with the soap of your choice, rinse them thoroughly, and place them on a flat, clean towel to air dry. The brushes should dry within 6 to 8 hours.If you are using a prescription serum, discard each applicator after every use to avoid eye and skin irritations and allergic reactions., Before you begin using a serum, close your eyes and take a photo of your eyelashes to document how long and full they were prior to using the product. Continue to take a photo each week to track your progress and to see if the product is working for you.


Most eyelash growth serums claim to start working within a few weeks. It is important to remember that a product that works for someone else may not work for you. Each person’s body will react to differently.You may see little to no change over a period of a few months, or you may see rapid growth within a few weeks.

, Using eye cosmetics such as mascara, eyeliner, and over-the-counter serums run the risk of causing bacterial and fungal infections, including pink eye or conjunctivitis.As you use the product, be aware of any changes to your eye or the area around your eye. If you experience red, itchy, or burning eyes, stop using the product and talk to your doctor right away.

, Some patients have reported that prescription serums have altered the color of their irises. Others have reported that their eyelids have darkened along the lash line where the product is applied. If you notice these side effects, talk to your doctor to see if continuing to use this product is right for you. The symptoms typically resolve when you stop using the product."

Get a high quality eyelash curler.,
Hold the eyelash curler up to your eye.,
Open the eyelash clamps.,
Close the clamp on the eyelashes.,
Curl your lashes in 3 sections.",How to Use a Lash Curler1," There are many brands, but some are better quality than others. Use a metal curler rather than a plastic or rubber one.
A high quality curler will be made of sturdy metal with rubber pads on the clamps.
Plastic or rubber curlers don't get a good enough grip to curl eyelashes well. These also break more easily.
Even some metal curlers can be flimsy. Cheaper products won't last as long.
Good brands of curlers include Shiseido, Shu Uemura, or Tarte.
Whatever brand you choose, make sure your eyelash curler is clean before use.;
, It might feel cold at first, but you will get used to it. 








Some people recommend heating the curler with a hair dryer ahead of time. However, you should avoid doing this.
A hot eyelash curler can sting or burn sensitive skin around the eyes.
There really isn't much benefit to heating the curler. You can get the same effects without doing so.

, You will want to put your lashes between them. Get as much of the lashes as you can between the clamps, getting down to the base of each eyelash.
Don't get to close to your skin or you will pinch yourself.
If you have lots of eyelashes already, you might have to do this in sections.

, Hold it down for 3 seconds. 








Don't squeeze the clamp shut for more than 3 seconds. This will crimp the lashes rather than curling them.
Take care not to squeeze your skin.
Make sure you are getting the clamp as close to the base of the lashes as possible.

, This will make sure you get all of them and that they will look as full and thick as possible.Start with the base of the lashes, taking care not to pinch the skin.
Repeat this with the middle portion of the lashes.
Curl the lashes one last time at the tips to put the final curl on them.

If you plan on wearing any foundation, put it on now. You can do your lips and blush as well, but hold off on the eyeshadow for right now.;
, Start by tweezing out any stray or unruly hairs. Next, take out a clean spoolie, and comb the hair on on your eyebrows, following the direction that they are naturally growing in. For most people, this would be straight up on the inner corners, outwards along the arch, and down towards the tail end.

, Filling in your brows is completely optional. If you already have thick, full brows, you probably don't have to do this. Start with a medium taupe shade; it works well with dark and light-colored eyebrows without appearing too pale or too dark. If your eyebrows are red, consider a light, reddish brown pencil or powder instead.Use a lighter shade if you have very dark eyebrows. Never use straight black. Instead, opt for a very dark brown or charcoal. It will look softer, more natural, and less harsh.Very the shades on your brows. Make them lighter towards the inner part, and darker, more defined towards the ends., You can use the spoolie that came with your tube of clear brow gel, or you can use a new spoolie. Following the same technique as before, comb the spoolie upwards at the inner part of your eyebrows, straight towards the arch, and back down towards the tail.


If you applied eyebrow pencil or powder, it might be a good idea to use a new spoolie brush each time you dip into your tube of brow gel. This way,you won't risk tinting the clear gel with any residual eyebrow pencil or powder.

, Now that you have your eyebrows done, you can finish putting on the rest of your makeup, such as your eyeshadow and eyeliner. Of course, you can always skip those if you want something more natural.

, Tweeze out any stray or unruly hairs. Next, use a clean spoolie to comb the hair on your eyebrows upwards and out., If your tinted brow gel came with a spoolie applicator, choose a thin, angled brush, and run it along the spoolie instead. You will be using the thin brush to apply the brow gel along the bottom edge of your brows first.

, Get out a thin, angled brush and pick up some of the brow gel. Outline the bottom of your eyebrow using short, light strokes. Stay within your eyebrow, and don't let the brow gel extend past the hairs. Outline from the inner corner of your eyebrow all the way to the outer corner.Use a brush with stiffer bristles, like the kind you'd use to apply lipstick. Avoid brushes with soft bristles, like an eyeshadow blending brush.
Avoid applying too much. Remember that less is more; you can always apply more layers later.

, Gently wipe off any excess brow gel from your brush. Next, use the brush and light, feathery strokes to blend the brow gel upwards and into the body of your eyebrow., Use the flat side of and angled brush and long strokes to fill in the arch and tail end.

Take allergy medication.,
Use eyedrops.,

Select the right color.",How to Create Feathered Eyebrows," To start, evaluate your eyebrows in a mirror. Before you feather your brows, you will want to fill them in as normal.Use a brow brush to brush your eyebrows upward. This will make bald spots or spots where hair is light more apparent.
Make note of where such spots occur. You will fill these areas in with a brow pencil that matches your hair color.;
, Before you begin filling in your brows, you want to make sure you know where they should start. To do this, take any straight makeup brush you have. Place it along your nose, forming a vertical line upward. Your eyebrows should start at this line and move outward., Once you've identified where your brows should start, and where the gaps are, you can begin filling in your brows. The process of feathering starts now. You want to use the right motions to create the feathered texture.As you draw lines filling in your brows, use upward motions. You want to sweep along your eyebrows horizontally, moving from the top to the bottom.
Move along the full length of each eyebrow, making swift upward swipes. This should create the feathered texture.

, Once you've filled in your brows, you can solidify the feathered look. Take a clean brow brush to feather your brows.Use upward motions. Again, brush the eyebrows from top to bottom.
Swipe your eyebrows quickly. This will help the hair move upwards, creating the right effect.

Gel will fill in your brows a bit more and make them look darker and more defined.Apply the gel using the same motions you used with your brow brush. Use quick, swiping motions to move across each eye, pushing the hair upward.

, The wrong brow brush can make it difficult to feather your brows successfully. You should not use any brow brush to fill in your brows. Opt for a thin, angled brush as you can use this tool with more precision., You do not want the makeup on your brows to look unnatural. Make sure you make enough brush strokes that any makeup fades into your natural hair color. It can take awhile to blend, so have patience.A spoolie brush, sometimes called a brow wand, can be helpful for blending.

, Make sure to select a color that closely matches your natural brow color. You should also make sure you only use a light layer of brow makeup. Too many layers can make your eyebrows look unnaturally dark."

Decide what your eyebrows should look like.,
Brush your eyebrows.,
Use an eyebrow pencil.,
Apply a powder.,
Hold your eyebrows in place.,
Trace your eyebrows with powder.",How to Get Thick Eyebrows1," Before you apply any makeup, you'll want to determine what will look the most natural on your eyebrows and the shape you want to achieve. To find the right length for your eyebrows use a pencil or something straight and make a line reaching from the outside of your nose to the outer corner of your eye to your eyebrow -- this is ideally the length you will want your eyebrows. , Using a spooly brush, brush your eyebrows upwards, following the angle of your brows, starting with the thickest part of your brow and brushing to the end of your eyebrow. This will allow you to see where your brows are uneven or sparse. 







, If you are looking to create the appearance of thick eyebrows, pick an eyebrow pencil similar to the shade of your eyebrows or a little darker, and lightly fill in your eyebrows in the areas that your hair is more sparse. Use short, dash-like strokes to mimic your eyebrow hairs. Make sure you do this so that it looks natural. You want the pencil to fade in with the rest of your eyebrows. Don't just draw on eyebrows -- blend them in.

, After you have filled in your eyebrows with pencil, pick your desired powder color (if you are looking for darker eyebrows use a darker shade and if you are trying to lighten up your eyebrows choose a lighter shade). Using an angled brush, dab the tip into the powder and then apply by wiggling it into your brow. Do this until you have the definition you want. 








Be careful not to fill in too much in one area -- you're just trying to create the most even brow.
After you have the desired color and thickness, run a brush through your brow to smooth it out and to give it your desired shape.

, You may have achieved the look you want, but in order to keep it throughout the day you might want to apply a clear or colored gel. Run the gel along the shape of your eyebrows to hold the hairs in place.








, The final step to achieving thicker, darker eyebrows is by highlighting them on your face. Taking a fluffy brush, dip it in translucent powder and then brush around the perimeters of the brows, tracing their shape. This will define the edges even more and make your eyebrows look sharp. "

Apply rubbing alcohol (70%) to a sheet of paper towel (also known as kitchen roll).,
Apply the first coat of mascara to your lashes.

,
Swipe the mascara wand through the alcohol-saturated paper towel.

,
Allow the wand to dry for a minute or two before replacing it in the mascara tube.,
Repeat the process after each application of mascara to your lashes.

,
Remember that cleaning is no replacement for using fairly fresh, bacteria-free cosmetics.",How to Sanitize Your Mascara," The fibers of the paper towel are strong even when saturated and will withstand being swiped with the mascara wand/spoolie. .


Tissues are not suitable to use for this method, as, once saturated, the tissue will tear and the loose fibres will cling to the mascara wand/spoolie.
Standard rubbing alcohol solution should be 70% alcohol (isopropanol) by volume. One might be tempted to go for a more concentrated alcohol solution such as a 90% or 99%, thinking that it will have stronger antibacterial properties, but that is incorrect. Alcohol itself is not an effective antibacterial agent, but when properly allowed to evaporate, it has an antibacterial effect because it dries out the bacterial cells, causing them to die.
70% alcohol is about as optimally concentrated as the solution can get and still penetrate the bacterial cell wall/membrane. If the alcohol is too concentrated, the cell wall hardens almost like a nutshell and keeps the alcohol from getting inside, which increases the time necessary to dry out the cell to kill it.;
,,, When allowed to adequately dry out after application, rubbing alcohol may be an effective antibacterial step to help control bacterial growth on the spoolie before it is replaced in the mascara tube. Hypothetically, this should be an effective way to help minimize the spread of eye infections such as conjunctivitis (pink eye) that are caused by sharing mascara.


The important component to highlight however is that if rubbing alcohol is used to help control bacteria, that it will only work if the surface/brush/etc has been allowed to adequately dry after application of the alcohol (which should only take 1 to several minutes).

,, The best practice is to only use relatively fresh mascara and never share it or other cosmetics applied near mucous membranes. Keep in mind that a bad eye infection can cost a much, much more than several new tubes of mascara.

For very uncooperative eyebrow hairs, consider using a spoolie to also brush the hairs downward, and use the same technique to cut the hairs that extend below your natural eyebrow shape.


Be very careful to not over trim! It’s very easy to cut your eyebrow hairs too short, so always trim less initially and then trim more if need be. If you need a reference picture, look up eyebrow shapes and find the one that describes your own eyebrow.

, Use your brow pencil to underline, and follow the bottom shape of your eyebrow. Start by using soft strokes to underline your brow; you don’t want the line to look too dramatic, and you can always add on more strokes.









You want the underside of your brow to be clearly defined and sharper looking, while allowing the top part and the rest of your brow to look naturally inexact and free flowing. If the line looks intense,use the spoolie to blend the makeup upwards.Don't pick an underlining shade that matches your brow color. Just like the head on your hair, your eyebrow hairs have different pigments and hues. Using a color that matches your brow color exactly might make your brows look too intense. Instead, opt to use a lighter shade for underlining and filling in. For example, if you have dark brown hair, consider using brown., Place your eyebrow brush (or any straight object) vertically on the “ala” of your nose. This is the part where your nostrils begin to flare, right outside of the rounded frontal tip of your nose. You can visualize where the ala is by imagining drawing a clown nose on your nose. The ala would be the part of your nose not painted, directly outside of the red clown nose. Following this point directly up, is where your eyebrow should start.Any hair extending past that straight object toward the bridge of your nose should be removed.


Keep in mind that everyone’s face shape is different along with the positioning of their eyes, and width of their nose. Therefore, this method might not work best for everyone. A good rule of thumb is to use your tear ducts (or a tad more inward toward the center of your face) as a general starting point for your eyebrows., Make a light mark (a dot) with some eyeliner to keep track of the place where your hair should start, removing any hair before that mark (meaning toward the space between your brows).


It works best to tweeze these hairs for a more accurate removal.
Be sure not to tweeze past the inside corner of your eye.
If your skin is irritated and red after tweezing, try using aloe vera gel or cortisone cream to soothe and calm your skin., Place your eyebrow brush (or your straight object) on a diagonal starting from the outside corner of your nostril, extending to the outside crease of your eye. You can even extend of as far your brow bone. This is the place where your eyebrow should end.Any hair extending past that straight object toward the side of your face should be removed.


Be careful not to tweeze the end hairs that make up the thicker part of your natural brow. Those hairs rarely grow back. Only tweeze the straggler hairs., Place your eyebrow brush (or straight object) on a diagonal starting from the outside corner of your nostril, to the outside of your iris (the colored part of your eye).The point where your straight object extends and reaches the top of your eyebrow is where the high point in your arch should be.


Underneath your brow is where you’ll tweeze away the most hair. However, that doesn’t mean that you will be tweezing lots of hairs; you may find you only need to remove a few here and there.

, Just like how your used a lighter color to underline the bottom of your brow, your skin tone should also influence the color you use to fill in your brows. For example, if you have darker skin tones, try using a color that has a little bit of red tint to it.It could help with making your brows look more natural. If you have a lighter skin tone but darker hair, try using a light brown shade of brow filler. You can always find the right color for you through trial and error., Touch your brush (a small, angled eyebrow brush is recommended) in the brow powder, tap off some excess powder on the side of the powder container, and start to lightly outline the top and bottom edges of your brow. When filling in, follow in the direction of your hair growth. Stay in the margins of your natural brow shape; you don’t want to over extend, and apply powder past where your brow hair actually is.









Try starting at your arch, and working your way down on both sides.
If your arch is too high, it can make your face have an angry look. You might need to lower your arch. The shape should be angular rather than rounded.If necessary, your may hold up a brow stencil as a guide.

, Moving from the arch, continue outlining to the very edge of your brow with light brush strokes. Without adding more product to the brush, focus on adding powder and creating volume on the outside edge of your brow rather than layering powder in the middle area of your brow. Focusing on the edge of your brow gives your brows a more natural, full look.








Remember, you can always add more, but if you start with heavy make-up, it’s harder to take off if you mess up.

, Use a spoolie brush to spread the colored powder and disperse it evenly throughout your brow hairs. This can help make your brow look less harsh and naturally defined. You can continue to add powder and brush it out until you get the intensity and shade you want.








, Place your brush on a diagonal starting from the ala or outside corner of your nostril, and check the starting point of your eyebrow. Also check the end edge of your eyebrow and your arch point, using the same steps you used to shape your eyebrow in Part 1.









Use your brush and your eye as a guide to see if your brow is too short and needs to be extended, or too long and needs to be taken off a bit.

, Use a clear brow setting formula to keep all your hairs and color in place. Starting in the middle of your brow, brush the middle hairs straight up, and then pull the brush toward the outer section (the tail) of your brow.Use a concealer around your brows to give them more definition. 








You can also use a tinted setting gel, but it’s a safer bet to use a clear gel to refrain from adding multiple different colors to your eyebrows.

Draw a line along the bottom edge of your brow.,
Pluck the strays that fall below the line and outside the marks you've made.,
Consider your face shape.",How to Shape Eyebrows1," Hold a straight edge, such as an eyebrow pencil or a ruler, vertically in front of your face.


If you want your eyebrows farther apart, line it up so that it touches the outermost of edge your nose and the inside of your eye. If you want your eyebrows closer together, line up the straight edge with one side of the septum. These lines will determine where your eyebrow should start.
Mark that spot with an eyebrow pencil. Repeat for the other eye.;
, Angle the straight edge so that it lines up with the outermost edge of your nose and the outermost edge of your pupil.



It's very important that you look straight ahead — both your face and your eyes should be looking directly forward at the mirror.
Wherever the line intersects your eyebrow is where the peak of your arch should begin at the top border of the eyebrow.
Mark that spot with your eyebrow pencil.
Repeat for the other eye.

, Angle the straight edge further so that it touches the outermost edge of your nose and also passes along the outermost edge of your eye.



This tells you where the eyebrow should end. Mark this point with your eyebrow pencil.

,











Your eyebrows should be 1/4 – /1/2 inch (0.5 – 1 cm) at their thickest.Pluck minimally above the brow — you want to retain your brow's natural arch. Only tweeze stray hairs.
If plucking isn't your thing, try shaping without it.
If your brows are sensitive, use ice to numb the areas before you tweeze.

, Certain brows better compliment specific face shapes.



To minimize the curve of a round face, direct the outer third of the brow towards the top of the ear.
If the face is square, direct it toward the middle of the ear. This helps balance the face.
If the face is long, keep the brow more straight across, directing it above the ear.
An oval face already looks balanced, but to enhance this harmony, you can direct the outer third towards the ear lobe."

Make sure you are getting the right nutrients.,
Apply castor oil.,
Use coconut oil.,
Create an olive oil and honey mixture.,
Apply milk to eyebrows.,
Use growth treatment.,
Finished.

",How to Get Thick Eyebrows2," One of the best ways to help your eyebrows grow back is by refraining from using your tweezers until you have the desired thickness. It can be tempting to tweeze those stray hairs, but you'll only continue to carry on with your current eyebrow shape if you don't let them grow back. It takes about six to eight weeks for eyebrows to grow back so try to be patient. , Use an exfoliating sponge or a soft brush daily to remove dead skin cells from your eyebrows and to stimulate the hair follicles. Taking the sponge or brush, make soft, circular motions on your eyebrows.

, If your diet is lacking in vitamins and nutrients that you need to retain a healthy body, this could be one of the contributions to your lack of hair growth in your eyebrows. Try to keep your diet rich in Vitamin B, omega-3s, iron, protein, and zinc and always make sure you are drinking enough water. You can also take a Vitamin B supplement like Biotin to help hair growth. , Castor oil is an old remedy that helps stimulate eyebrow growth. Soak a cotton swab in castor oil and apply to your eyebrows each night. Leave the oil on overnight and in the morning wash it off with some cleanser. Changes may take place in three to four weeks.








, Coconut oil has many great benefits, one of which is that it's a natural moisturizer, and it also has the ability to speed up hair growth. Apply coconut oil to your finger tips and wipe on eyebrows, leaving overnight. In the morning, wash with warm water. , Olive oil is rich in vitamin E and thus can help stimulate hair growth. Measure out 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and mix with a few drops of honey. Massage mixture into your eyebrows for a few minutes. Allow the mixture to set on your eyebrows for 30 minutes and then wash off with warm water.

, Because milk is high in Vitamin D, a nutrient that promotes hair growth, it can be beneficial to apply to your eyebrows. Dip a cotton ball in a glass of whole milk and apply to eyebrows, leaving the milk until it has dried. Then, rinse off with warm water. , If waiting patiently for your eyebrows to grow out or using natural methods hasn't produced any results, you can use a growth treatment to stimulate your hair growth. There are a number of growth treatments you can purchase for your eyebrows, so with adequate research you should be able to find one that corresponds to your desired thickness. 








Some growth treatments have been proven to work better than others. If you have done a lot of damage to your eyebrows by over tweezing, you may need to invest in a higher quality product. Latisse, Rogaine, and Viviscal are all popular treatments.
Keep in mind that while some treatments and serums are applied directly to eyebrows, some are consumed. Those consumed may help hair growth in your eyebrows, but they can also stimulate hair growth on other parts of your body so be prepared for this before you begin taking any treatments.

Using a brow brush, brush the hairs upward.
Cut the hairs that extend beyond your natural hairline.

, If your brows are too light (or dark), fill them in with an eyebrow pencil. If you don't have an eyebrow pencil, substitute matte eyeshadow.











If your brows are fair, choose a pencil two shades darker than your hair. (If you have dark hair, go two shades lighter.)
Hold your skin taut at the temple, and line softly along the upper edge of your brow. Then, line along the bottom edge.
With feathery strokes, fill in between the two edges.Remember to blend!

, Brush the hairs how they naturally lie and apply gel to set the hairs in place.











Clear mascara can double as a brow gel.
This also prevents smudging, if filled in.

, Forming good habits will make your routine shorter, day by day.











By sticking to a specific contoured shape, spotting strays becomes easy.
Consistently pluck between the brows and at the edges. These hairs grow the fastest and take away from the natural shape of your brows.

Otherwise, you may poke yourself in the eye. Just use the pads of your fingertips to gently peel off your false eyelashes.Start at the outer edge of your eyelid and grasp the edge of the false eyelash band. Then, pull gently at the band moving in towards your nose until the false lash is completely off. Repeat for your other false lash.;
, After you remove the lashes, there may still be some of the lash adhesive stuck on the lash band. Check the bands of your false lashes and gently peel away any leftover adhesive.Use your finger to peel away the leftover adhesive. Using tweezers may result in damaging your lashes if you accidentally grab the band and pull too hard.

, Use a cotton swab and some eye makeup remover to clean the lashes.

Find the place where your brows should begin.,
Find the spot where your eyebrow arch should peak.,
Determine where your brow should end.,
Determine how thick you want your brows to be.Perfect eyebrows for someone else may not be perfect eyebrows for you.",How to Get Perfect Eyebrows1," Finding just the right spot for your inner brows to start is key to creating perfect brows, since starting too far in could throw off the balance of your face.To figure out where your inner brows should start, use the following technique:









Take a pencil or another long, thin instrument. Line it up from the corner of your eye to the edge of your nose.
The place where the instrument overlaps your brow is where it should begin. Mark the spot by making a dot there with an eyeliner pencil. Repeat on the other side.;
, Most eyebrows naturally arch around the eye, and finding the place where the arch peaks is essential to making them look perfect. Use the same long, thin instrument to figure out where your arch should peak by following this technique:










Look straight ahead in the mirror.
Line up the instrument with the outer edge of your nostril and the outer edge of your iris.
The place where the instrument crosses your brow is where your arch should peak. Mark it with a dot using an eyeliner pencil. Repeat on the other side.

, Finding the right place for brow to end is as important as where it begins. You want your brows to frame your eyes gracefully. Find the right spot by lining up the long, thin instrument in this way:










Line up the instrument from the edge of your nostril to the outer corner of your eye.
The place where the instrument crosses your outer brow is the place where it should end. Mark the spot with a dot using an eyeliner pencil.

, The thickness of your eyebrows is a personal decision that should be influenced by the following factors:










The size of your eyes. If your eyes are on the bigger side, thicker brows can help balance them out. If they're small, thick brows might overshadow them, so you'll want to choose a brow thickness that's slightly thinner.
The size of your lips. A good general rule of thumb is that your eyebrows should be about the same thickness as your upper lip. This can help 'tie the look together'. If you look at pictures of models in magazines than you'll notice this is the case with many of them.
The distance between your brows and your eyes. If you have a low brow bone that is set close to your eyes, you'll want to pull up your brows a bit to lighten the area. If you have a high brow line spaced well above your eyes, heavier brows might provide a more balanced look.
Your style preferences. Sometimes thick, bushy eyebrows are in style, and sometimes more people prefer them to be thin and well-tailored. Think about what style you're going for before you dive into plucking your brows.

"
"
Brush your brow hairs up.,
Tweeze the hairs outside the dots you drew.,
Tweeze the other brow.,
Don't overpluck.",How to Get Perfect Eyebrows2," Take a small eyebrow brush or a fine-toothed comb and brush the hairs up in the direction they grow. This will make it easier to figure out which hairs need to be plucked.









, Now it's time to start shaping your brows according to the plans you laid out. Make sure you're in a well-lit area so that you don't accidentally tweeze too much. Grasp each hair firmly with the tweezers and pluck one at a time in the direction they grow.










Start with the inner brow, closest to your nose. Use the tweezers to pluck the hairs that are closer to your nose than the dot.
Tweeze the hairs that fall outside the dot on your outer brow.
Tweeze hairs above and below the arch area. Look at the place where your arch should peak and carefully tweeze around it to make the peak slightly more prominent.
Tweeze the bottom of the brow. Pluck stray hairs under your brow and shape the bottom. If you decided you want thick brows, stop after plucking the hairs that grow outside the brow. If you want thinner brows, carefully pluck the underside of the brow to lighten it up.

, Now that you've shaped the first one, take extra care to make sure the other brow matches it in shape and size. Use the same method to tweeze the hairs on the inside of the inner brow dot, the outside of the outer brow dot, around the arch peak, and on the underside of the brow. Examine both brows in the mirror to make sure they are even.









, Avoid the temptation to keep plucking hairs in order to create two perfectly even brows. You risk plucking away too much hair. Eyebrow hair can take 6 - 8 weeks to grow back, and sometimes it's gone for good. Take care of the hair you have.

Fill in the brows.,
Use a brow comb.,
Apply brow gel.",How to Get Perfect Eyebrows3," Take an eyebrow pencil in a shade close to that of your brows and make light strokes in the direction that your hair grows to help fill out your look. Eyebrow hair doesn't usually grow completely evenly, so filling in the gaps is a necessity for creating the perfect brows.










Don't create an arch where there isn't one, or try to lengthen your brows with a pencil. It will be too obvious that you drew extra parts.
For a heavier look, choose an eyebrow pencil that's a shade or two darker than your natural brow shade.

, Gently comb them into shape so that no hairs are poking up in the wrong direction. If you filled in your brows with pencil, take care not to smudge it when you comb your brows.









, This helps your brows stay in place all day, and prevents them from getting messy under windy conditions. Apply a dab to the inner part of your brow and either smooth it to the outer part of your brow with the tip of your finger or use the brow brush to comb it in.










If you don't have brow gel, you can use hairspray instead. Spray your finger with hair spray and wipe it across your brow.
You can also use a dab of petroleum jelly in place of brow gel."

Use a dab of coconut oil.,
Try jojoba oil if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin.,
Mix olive oil and witch hazel for a natural dual-phase cleanser.,
Try avocado oil.",How to Remove Mascara1," Coconut oil quickly removes regular and waterproof mascara, plus it moisturizes and smooths your skin. Because it is a solid at room temperature, rub a pea-sized scoop between your (clean!) fingertips until it becomes soft and spreadable.You don't need a special coconut oil for your face--use the same coconut oil used as a cooking ingredient.Be aware that if you get any in your eye it can temporarily blur your vision.;
, Jojoba is not actually an oil, which is great news if you have oily skin.In addition to being non-comedogenic (meaning it won't clog your pores), it is a non-allergenic and won't irritate your eyes like some oils can.Jojoba can also moisturize the skin around your eyes and condition your lashes., Witch hazel can de-puff the skin around your eyes while assisting the olive oil in breaking down your mascara.Mix equal parts olive oil and witch hazel in a small container and shake well before use.Both witch hazel and olive oil can be used on their own to remove makeup, but together they can cleanse the skin around your eyes, moisturize, and remove troublesome makeup., It is one of the most moisturizing oilsand, like other oils, easily dissolves and cuts through makeup. Look for dark avocado oil in a tinted container, which will preserve the quality of the product.Next time you make guacamole you can even try using avocado oil straight from the fruit!

Buy an eye-makeup remover formulated for your skin type.,
Try baby shampoo if you run out of your usual cleanser.,
Use a makeup-removing wipe when you just can't make it to the sink.,
Avoid petroleum jelly (also known as mineral oil), or use very sparingly.",How to Remove Mascara2," There are tons of options for makeup removers, so try narrowing down the choices by what works best for your skin. If you have oily skin or break out often, look for something oil-free. If you have very sensitive skin, you'll want a gentle, fragrance-free remover.If you have sensitive eyes, try to find out the pH of your makeup remover. A pH that is similar to your natural tears (between 6.9 and 7.5) will be less likely to irritate your eyes.Oil is a necessary ingredient when you're trying to remove waterproof mascara, because it dissolves the oils in the makeup (instead of being repelled, like water).
Dual-phase cleansers are good for everyday use, blending an oil cleanser with soothing water. Just make sure you shake the bottle first.Cleansing water works well on sensitive skin and regular, non-waterproof mascara., It's best to stick to an actual eye make up remover, since it's specifically made to be used around your eyes, but baby shampoo is an effective replacement if you run out.Use a chemical and fragrance-free baby shampoo if you can. Many ""no tears"" formulas actually have a numbing agent, which will only mask the irritating effects., Try not to use these too often, as they can be rough on the thin skin around your eyes. If the wipes are not specifically for eyes, look for a brand that is alcohol-free., Petroleum jelly is a byproduct of gasoline, and unless you know the brand you're using has been thoroughly refined and purified (Vaseline is one such brand), it's not something you want near your eyes.Petroleum jelly does not actively hydrate your skin. If your skin is clean and moisturized it can seal the moisture in and keep it from evaporating, but it is not a replacement for moisturizer itself."

Apply enough makeup remover so that the pad is just saturated.Don't use a cotton ball, as the fibers can detach and get in your eyes.If you're not sure how your skin will react to your makeup remover (whether it's coconut oil or from the drugstore), test some on your inner wrist. If you have a reaction it's better to have an inflamed wrist than an inflamed eye.

, Don't scrub or tug on your skin, just press the pad against your lashes so the remover can begin to break down the makeup., Then turn the pad over to the makeup-free side and wipe your eye with an upward motion.You can wiggle the pad a little by your lash line to help break up more stubborn mascara.Use cotton swab dipped in makeup remover to clean up any remaining mascara, like little flecks or smears that end up under your lower lashes., Removing your makeup is not the final step in your nightly skincare routine--it's the first. Getting all the makeup off your face allows the your cleanser to get into your pores, instead of mixing with makeup and clogging them.Find a cleanser that is right for your skin type and gently massage it into your face. Use warm water and a facial cloth or sponge to wipe off the dirt and grime.Washing your face also removes any remnants of your makeup remover which, if it remains on your skin, can cause dryness or even an allergic reaction., You'll pull your eyelashes out, too. It takes 1-2 months for your lashes to grow back,and since you're probably using mascara to make your lashes look thicker or longer, it seems sort of pointless if you're just yanking them out.

, If it happens once or twice, it shouldn't be a huge deal. But if you frequently fall asleep without removing your makeup, you risk clogging your hair follicles and developing a stye or eye infection.Where a clean, makeup-free lash would bend, a brittle lash, dried out by mascara, can get bent by your pillowcase and scratch your eye."

Apply the glue remover.,
Pull out the loosened extensions.,
Remove excess glue from your eyelid.,
Rinse your eyelashes.",How to Remove Eyelash Extensions2," If it's not possible to get back to the salon, try removing your lashes with lash glue remover. You can find lash glue remover at most drugstores.


If you had your extensions professionally done, ask the technician which solvent he or she uses, and see if you can just purchase it there.
Glue remover is a mild solvent with a smell similar to nail polish remover.

, This can be a delicate process, and you need to be able to see what you're doing. Prepare to remove your extensions by doing the following:


Stand in front of a mirror in a well-lit bathroom. If necessary, bring in extra lighting to prevent shadows cast over your face from interfering with your ability to clearly see your lashes.
Remove your eye makeup. Use a gentle eye makeup remover to wipe away your mascara and eyeliner. You need to be able to see where your real lashes ends and the extensions begin.

, Take the following steps to apply the glue remover and loosen the extensions:


Wet a cotton swab with glue remover. Make sure it's thoroughly damp.
Gently pull down the outer corner of one of your upper eyelids. Close one eye, and using the soft pad of your finger, gently angle the eyelid downward at the outer corner. Your upper lashes should be pointing downward, giving you a better view of the extensions.
Move the cotton swab across your lash line. Work from outer corner to inner corner in small, gentle motions. The remover should start to dissolve the glue.

, After you've been over your lash line about 15 times with a wet cotton swab, grip the end of an extension between your thumb and forefinger. It should fall out easily.

, Once all the extensions are out, do another pass over your your upper eyelashes to clear out any leftover glue.

, Splash some warm water on your face to rinse the glue remover from your eyelashes and eye area.

Go back to the salon technician who applied the extensions.,
Go to a different salon if you're concerned about the application.",How to Remove Eyelash Extensions3," Eyelash extensions are most often affixed using glues that contain cyano acrylate, otherwise known as superglue. This type of glue is extremely difficult to remove without the proper tools and chemical solution. Return to your eyelash extension if you want to remove your eyelashes for any of the following reasons:


Most of your extensions have grown out, and you have a few left that you'd like to remove. You should be able to return to the salon and have these taken out quickly, and usually free of charge.
You aren't happy with the way you look in eyelash extensions. If you have a whole set of extensions that need to be removed, it's much better to go back to your technician instead of trying to remove them yourself.
A few days have passed since you got the extensions and you're experiencing a pricking sensation. Sometimes one or two extensions get stuck together, or the same extension is glued to more than one natural lash. This is usually easy to resolve, but it requires a trip back to your technician.

, Sometimes new technicians or people without training make mistakes when applying eyelash extensions. Go to a different, well-reputed salon to get your extensions removed if you are experiencing the following problems:


Your eyelash extensions don't look professional. If they're crooked, patchy, or just not attractive, go to someone you can trust to have them fixed. You don't want to complicate the problem by accidentally damaging your natural lashes.
You are experiencing a lot of pain around your eyelashes. If the glue used to apply eyelash extensions is applied improperly, it can pull at the skin and cause severe pain around the eyes. Instead of going back to the person who applied the extensions this way, put yourself in better hands for the removal process.

, Wearing makeup can dry out your lashes, making them brittle and more likely to break or fall out. Failing to remove your makeup can also cause eye irritation or even styes.


Styes are pimples that appear on your eyelids, often around the lash line. They are caused by clogged oil glands and bacteria. The irritation caused by styes can cause lashes to fall out., Use a gentle makeup remover for your eyes. Coconut oil is a good option, as it will remove your makeup and moisturize your lashes at the same time. It also has antibacterial properties.









One good way to clean the makeup off your eyes is to gently massage coconut oil into your eyelids and lashes, and then blot the oil and makeup off with a cotton pad.
Be sure not to rub your eyes too hard while cleaning them, as this could cause some of your eyelashes to fall out.

, Once you’ve removed your makeup, use a gentle facial cleanser over your entire face, including your eyelids. This will help remove any remaining oil.









Your eyelids should already be pretty clean, so just let the cleanser lightly run over your eyes. There is no need to rub it into them.

, Try to avoid wearing makeup every day — especially eye makeup and mascara. Wearing makeup every day can dry out your lashes and irritate your eyes, which can cause your lashes to break or even fall out.If you have to wear makeup to work or school, try to take a day off on the weekend.
At the very least, remove your makeup as soon as you are home and not going out for the rest of the day/night.

, Waterproof mascara not only dries out your lashes, but it is also more difficult to remove than non-waterproof formulas. The more you struggle to remove your mascara, the more likely you are to remove some eyelashes in the process., See if you can find someone who uses natural dyes and can dye your lashes a darker color. Having darker lashes may make it easier for you to skip the mascara.


If you do decide to dye your lashes, avoid chemical dyes, as these could damage your lashes and your eyes in the long run. Some experts recommend using vegetable-based semi-permanent stains instead., Both of these things involve pulling and placing pressure on your eyelashes that could cause them to fall out. If you must use an eyelash curler, squeeze it gently a few times instead of pressing down hard.If you do use an eyelash curler, be sure to only use it BEFORE applying mascara to your eyelashes. Using it on wet eyelashes increases the chances of the lashes adhering to the curler and tearing out., Whether you’re cleaning them or trying to get something out of your eye, avoid rubbing or pulling on your eyelashes, as doing so can cause them to break or fall out.









Rubbing your lashes means applying hard pressure to them while moving your fingers or other objects back and forth, or up and down, across your lashes.
Note that rubbing your lashes is not the same as massaging your eyelids, which can actually improve the health of both your eyelids and lashes.

Choose the right mascara formula.,
Consider the mascara’s brush or wand.,
Opt for a waterproof formula.,
Keep your mascara fresh.,
Use a black mascara.,
Condition your lashes nightly.,
Curl your lashes before applying mascara.,
Start with a lash primer.,
Blot the mascara wand.,
Wiggle the wand back and forth at the base of the lashes.,
Use a zigzag motion to cover your lashes.,
Comb through your lashes after applying the mascara.,
Add additional coats if necessary.",How to Make Your Mascara Look Great," The first step in making your mascara look great is making sure to use the right formula. Mascaras are designed to do different things for your lashes, so if you use a lengthening mascara when you want thicker-looking lashes, you’ll probably be disappointed. Check to make sure that the formula you’re using meets your needs.A lengthening or defining mascara is meant to help your lashes look longer.
A volumizing or thickening mascara is meant to help your lashes look thicker.
A curling mascara is meant to help lift and bend straight lashes.
A tubing mascara contains special polymers that form tubes around your lashes that make them longer and thicker.
A fiber mascara contain fiber filaments that adhere to your natural lashes so they appear thicker and longer.
Some mascara formulas are designed to lengthen and thicken for an overall improved look for the lashes. If you’re not sure what you want out of mascara, opt for this type of multipurpose formula.
Depending on your needs, you may want to use a combination of mascaras in different formulas. For example, you may do a first coat with a volumizing mascara and then add a second coat of a lengthening mascara to separate and define your lashes.;
, In addition to the mascara formula itself, the type of brush or wand that a mascara has makes a big difference in the finished look of your lashes. Some brushes feature nylon bristles, while others are made of molded plastic. The shape and layout of the brush affects how the mascara is applied as well. Work with a brush or wand that suits your needs.For thick, fluttery lashes, look for a mascara with a brush that is thick and densely bristled.
For long, defined lashes, look for a mascara with a brush that has sparse, short bristles.
For the lower lashes, choose a mascara with a small brush head.

, If you want to ensure that your mascara looks great all day, it’s important to use a waterproof version. It holds up well to tears, sweat, and any other kind of moisture, and also helps lock the curl into your lashes. Use a waterproof mascara so you don’t have to worry about running, smudging, or flaking beneath the eyes.The drawback to waterproof mascara is that it can be tough to remove. Make sure that you have a waterproof eye makeup remover on hand to take it off at the end of the day.
If you wear contacts or have sensitive eyes, be sure that your mascara is also hypoallergenic so you don’t have to worry about the formula irritating your eyes.

, Like all makeup, mascara can actually go bad over time. An old mascara can not only cause eye irritations and infections, but it can make your lashes look clumpy. That’s because mascara dries out as it gets old so it can become thick and crusty. Make sure the mascara that you’re using is less than 3 months old.If you have multiple tubes of mascara and it’s difficult to keep track of how old they are, consider putting labels on them. Write the date that you opened the tube on the label, and stick it on the mascara so you’ll know when your 3 months are up.

, For the best, most intense look, you should use a black mascara. It does the best job of making lashes look thicker and longer, so be sure to choose the blackest mascara you can find. Save colored mascaras, such as blue, purple, or green, for adding a fun pop of color to your lower lashes.If you have extremely fair skin, you may prefer to use a black brown mascara so it doesn’t look as harsh.

, For your mascara to look as good as possible, you must start with soft, healthy lashes. You can purchase a lash conditioner product that helps moisturize your lashes. Apply it nightly after you’ve removed all of your mascara and other eye makeup to wake up with healthy lashes.If you don’t want to purchase a specialty lash conditioner, you can use petroleum jelly, vitamin E, or coconut oil. Dip a clean spoolie into one of them, and coat your lashes before going to bed.

, Your mascara will look better if your lashes are curled. That’s because curling your lashes lifts them and helps them look a little fuller. However, it’s important to use your lash curler before you apply mascara. If your lashes are wet, they can stick to the curler and you may pull some out while you’re curling.If you don’t have an eyelash curler or aren’t comfortable using one, you can apply your mascara first. When your lashes are still wet, gently push them upward to create and curl. Hold them like that for 10 to 15 seconds.

, After curling your lashes, it helps to apply a lash primer before using your mascara. A primer conditions and coats the lashes so they appear thicker and longer. They’ll also provide a base for the mascara to cling to., When you pull the mascara wand out of the tube, it will be loaded with product. If you apply it to your lashes right away, your lashes may look clumpy. Instead, wipe the wand off on a tissue or napkin to remove the excess mascara.If you don’t have a tissue handy, try wiping the wand off on the side of the tube’s opening.

, When you’re ready to apply the mascara, start by holding the brush right at the root of your lashes. Gently wiggle it back and forth to ensure that you apply a generous coat at the root.Make sure to wiggle the brush left to right rather than up and down for the best looking lashes.

, After you’ve applied mascara to the base of your lashes, move the wand in a zigzag motion from the roots to the tips of your lashes. This technique creates a more fluttery look for your lashes.For your lower lashes, hold the wand vertically so you can coat each lash individually.

, Once you’ve applied the first coat of mascara, allow your lashes to dry for 3 to 5 seconds. Next, take a clean lash comb and run through your lashes to remove any clumps and fan out your lashes.If you don’t have a lash brush or comb, you can use a clean toothbrush or disposable spoolie to comb through your lashes.

, If your lashes don’t appear as long or thick as you’d like after your first coat of mascara, apply additional coats. Keep in mind that the more mascara you add, the more likely your lashes are to clump so don’t overload on mascara.Be sure to comb your lashes after each coat of mascara that you apply to avoid clumps.

Start with a clean canvas.,
Warm up your mascara tube.,
Be gentle with the bristles of the wand when taking it out to use.,
Swipe both sides of your lashes.,
Drag your wand from the roots to the tips of your lashes.,
Angle your wand vertically to extend your lashes.,
Experiment with different colors of mascara.",How to Make Your Eyelashes Look Longer Without the Expensive Mascaras1," For best results, begin your makeup routine with a quick cleanse. Wipe off any old makeup and mascara so that your lashes are fresh. Applying new mascara is easier because your lashes will flake and look clumpy rather than long and sleek if you layer the new over old.Cleaning your face every night before bed is a good habit to have.;
, Dip your closed mascara tube in a cup of warm water from the tap. Let it sit for a few minutes while you apply your foundational makeup and do your hair. The warmth turns your mascara from a goopy substance to a liquid that spreads much easier over your lashes., You don’t want to damage them in order to extend the wand’s length and quality. Twist the wand around inside the tube instead of pumping it up and down.


As you pull your wand from the tube, gently spin the bristles around the edge of the tube’s opening. This will clear off excess mascara and keep your lashes from being weighed down.

, Covering both the top and bottom of your lashes will help to define them. First bring your wand down over the top of your lashes as you look toward the ground. Then swipe up to get the underside of your lashes.


Clean off any accidental smears of mascara on your eyelids or cheeks with a cotton swab or tissue.
Opening your mouth slightly will help widen your eyes and make it easier to apply mascara.

, Putting too much mascara on the tips of your lashes will weigh them down and cause any length to flatten out during the day. Place the wand at the roots of your lashes and slightly wiggle it side to side and then up to the tips. This motion deposits mascara at the base and allow the tips to curl without being burdened., Normally you would apply mascara by holding the wand horizontally with the bristles pointing up and down. For longer lashes, hold the wand up and down and paint a couple of lashes at a time with the bristles going sideways.


Horizontal brushing makes lashes look fuller and vertical brushing makes them look natural and long.
It’s easier to do your top lashes by holding your hand above your head and pulling the wand up over your lashes.
Place a tissue under your bottom lashes when drawing the wand down over them to keep your face from getting smudged.

, Pops of color or neutral combinations can help make your lashes look longer. “Minking” is a practical method of extending your lashes. First use a coat of black mascara, then brush dark brown along the tips, and finish up by reapplying black. This adds dimension without being obvious.You may not want to use colored mascara for every-day wear, but it’s certainly a fun alternative for a night out.
Try using a neutral color like black or brown and then tipping your lashes with a bright hue or gold and silver just to play around with how dual tones extend your lashes.
For lighter hair colors, use brown mascara. For any other hair color, use black. Complimenting your natural coloring will look more natural.

Gather your supplies.,
Put vitamin E oil, coconut oil, and beeswax into the small bowl.,
Melt the ingredients.,
Add the aloe vera gel to the small bowl.,
Break open the activated charcoal capsules over the bowl.,
Add 1/4 teaspoon of bentonite clay if desired.",How to Make Mascara1," You will need several ingredients, plus a few tools to make this mascara recipe. Before you get started, you will need:1 teaspoon of vitamin E oil
1 teaspoon of coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon of beeswax
1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel
3 activated charcoal capsules
1/4 teaspoon of bentonite clay (optional)
a small glass bowl
some hot water
a medium glass bowl
a spoon;
, Measure out one teaspoon of vitamin E oil, one teaspoon of coconut oil, and 1/2 teaspoon of beeswax and put them into your small glass bowl. Stir them together with your spoon., Fill the medium sized bowl about ¼ of the way full with hot or boiling water. Then take your small bowl and place it over the water so that it is nesting inside of the medium sized bowl. The small bowl should just float on top of the water. If the water level is too high, then pour some out.Let the small bowl sit on top of the water until the ingredients in the small bowl have melted.
Then, carefully remove the small bowl from the water. Be careful because the glass may get hot from the hot water.

, Next, measure out three teaspoons of aloe vera gel and add the aloe vera to the bowl along with the ingredients. Then, use the spoon to mix the aloe vera in with the other ingredients until they are well combined.To make a preservative-free mascara, use aloe vera gel straight from the plant, as bottled aloe often contains preservatives., Take your three activated charcoal capsules and break them open over the bowl one at a time. Then, mix the charcoal in with the other ingredients. Keep stirring until the mixture looks uniform. This may take a few minutes of vigorous stirring.Be aware that activated charcoal is not an approved colorant for eye cosmetics.If you are concerned about using activated charcoal, then you can replace the charcoal with equal quantities of an eye-safe black (or other color) mineral powder or mica., Bentonite clay is optional for this recipe, but it may help to prevent smudging. Coconut oil melts at 76 degrees Fahrenheit, so it is not ideal for warm weather. However, bentonite clay can help your mascara to dry faster and stay on your lashes.If you decide to add the bentonite clay, then add 1/4 of a teaspoon to the mascara mixture and stir until the ingredients are well combined.

You’ll also need an eyeliner pencil, or anything that you can use to mark up your brows. Using these two tools, you can create the ideal shape for your features.Hold your straight edge against the side of your nose, so that it runs parallel. The inner edge of your eyebrow should start here. Use your eyeliner to make a small dot right here, so that you have a reference when you begin plucking.
Find your perfect arch. Reposition the eyeliner pencil so that it is running diagonally from your nostril to your pupil, or the black center of your eye. Where it overlaps your brow is exactly where your arch should be.
Use your pencil one more time to determine where your brow should end. Angle the pencil from your nostril again, but this time running it to the outer corner of your eye. Where it meets your eyebrow is where your eyebrow should end.;
, It may be helpful to shade in your entire brow, outlining the exact shape you want. Then, you can see exactly which hairs are outside of this.Use tweezers to carefully pluck the stray hairs.


Only take a little bit at a time, continuously examining your progress. You can always pluck more, but you can’t replace hairs you’ve tweezed.
Make sure your brows are the same shape on both sides. If they aren’t perfectly symmetrical, that’s ok.

, Beauty is pain, and plucking your eyebrows can certainly create a reaction. Grab some cortisone cream at your local drugstore to help reduce any inflammation, and you can cover redness with concealer if you have somewhere to be.If you have trouble dealing with the pain and redness of tweezing your eyebrows, try doing it immediately after getting out of a hot shower. The warm water makes the process easier by opening up your hair follicles, helping you pull the hair out smoothly.

, Plucking your eyebrows isn’t difficult, but it certainly requires a bit of practice. If you don’t want to risk messing up, get your brows waxed, plucked, or threaded at the salon. If you know someone with enviable brows, ask them where they got theirs done.Otherwise, consult Yelp to find a great specialist.


Waxing is quick, inexpensive, and typically lasts for over a month. However, it can also be painful and you will certainly leave with redness around your eyebrows.Getting your eyebrows professionally tweezed can be helpful because a professional can ensure they are symmetrical and properly shaped. The hair grows back quickly, however, and it is a more time-consuming option.Eyebrow threading is quick, inexpensive, and typically doesn't cause redness. However, threading can cause a little bit more pain than waxing, because it is not as quick., Just like the hair on top of your head, your eyebrows can get messy and tangled. Use an eyebrow spoolie to tame your brow hairs. You should brush them out before applying any product.Start at the inner edge of your eyebrow, and carefully brush the brow hairs slightly up and out. Continue brushing outwards, until the entire brow looks sleek and tidy.

, If you have dark hair, your brow product should match your natural color. Things get a bit trickier if you have blonde or white brows. If your natural brows are super light, choose a product one or two shades darker.If you are using a brow pencil, apply the product in quick, short strokes to mimic hairs. The key is to try to make it look natural.
If you are using a powder or gel, less is more. Follow the natural arch of your brow, lightly applying the product in short strokes. After you've filled the entire brow, it's important to brush it out with a spoolie so that it looks three-dimensional again.

, As you apply the gel, try to brush the hairs up. Rather than matting them against your skin, you want to fluff them up a bit. This will make your eyebrows look textured and natural, rather than one-dimensional and fake.You can find brow gels at beauty supply stores and pharmacies. However, clear mascara works perfectly for this step as well.

, Carefully apply concealer right around the perimeter of your eyebrow using a small, angled concealer brush. Blend it out, taking care not to get any product into your eyebrow. This will help create a crisp, clean border between your eyebrow and your skin, accentuating the shape you’ve created.Take your brows to the next level by applying highlighter to the brow bone. Carefully use your finger or a small eye shadow brush to apply a highlighter under the length of your eyebrow. This will make your brow appear lifted, making your eyes look even more big and beautiful., You can purchase an eyelash curler at any pharmacy. It looks much trickier than it actually is. Hold the eyelash curler up to your eye, sliding your lashes through the clamp. Carefully bring the curler to the very base of your eyelashes so that the clamp is close to your eyelid, but not touching it.Slowly squeeze the handle of the eyelash curler so that the base of your eyelashes is clamped.
Hold the clamp down tightly, counting to three. Then, carefully release.
Slide the eyelash curler down your lashes a little bit, and repeat this process. Use the curler over the length of your lashes, and you’re all set.
If you want to add even more drama (and staying power) to your lashes, blast your curler with a little heat from your hair dryer. Just like when you curl the hair on your head, this heat will give you a curl quickly and help it last all day. Just be very careful not to burn your eyelid!, Choose a color of eyeliner that matches the mascara you will be using. Close your eye, and gently pull your eyelid taut with your pointer finger. Carefully apply the eyeliner to your lash line, from the outer corner to the inner corner. Repeat this process on the other eye.Try not to make the line too thick in order to make it look natural. If you find it difficult to create a thin line, try dipping a cotton swab into makeup remover and carefully cleaning up the line after you've applied the eyeliner.
If you are using pencil eyeliner, make sure that it is sharpened. If the end of the pencil is dull, you will have trouble creating a neat line to your lash line.
If you are using a powder or gel, apply with a very tiny brush. This will help you create a clean, sharp line.
Lining your lash line will create a solid base, giving the illusion of dark, thick eyelashes.

, Wiggle the mascara wand in the bottle to pick up the product. Before applying the mascara, examine the wand to make sure there aren’t any large clumps. Starting at the base of your lashes, apply the mascara by gently wiggling the wand as you slide it over the length of your lashes. Do this a couple of times, making sure that all of your lashes are evenly coated in mascara. Let it dry.Do not slide the wand in and out of the bottle to gather product, because that will trap air in the mascara and dry it out.
To take lashes to the next level, you can let your eyelashes dry and then apply a second coat– and a third and a fourth if you want!
If no amount of mascara will give you the length and volume that you desire, try false lashes!

Castor oil is one of the most commonly recommended oils for promoting thicker, fuller lashes. Try to buy a natural and hexane-free brand of castor oil.Cedarwood oil is a stimulator that promotes hair growth.Coconut oil contains lauric acid, which can help boost hair health and growth by preventing protein loss.Extra virgin olive oil has moisturizing and antibacterial properties that can help you achieve thicker, fuller lashes.Jojoba oil has long been praised as a natural hair growth remedy. It has been proven to moisturize and nourish hair, and may stimulate growth.Moroccan argan oil is full of antioxidants, and moisturizes and nourishes your hair.Rosemary oil stimulates your hair’s roots, improves hair growth, and increases circulation.Vitamin E oil can be taken as a supplement or applied externally to promote hair growth., Some oils such as coconut or olive oil, for example, can be applied directly to the lashes without being diluted. Essential oils, however, carry strong scents that can irritate the eyes if they aren’t diluted with carrier oils.









Extra virgin olive oil and jojoba oil are commonly used to dilute essential oils. How much you use will depend on your own tastes, but you might want to start with 2 to 4 drops of essential oil per tsp of carrier oil.

, A popular growth serum recipe is to combine 1/2 tsp of coconut oil with 2 to 4 drops of lavender essential oil. You can even mix these in the palm of your hand.If you want to make more, use the same ratio in larger quantities, and store the mixture in an air-tight container, away from light.

To rinse your eyes, fill your hands or a basin with cool or lukewarm water and lean down to place your eye into the water. Open and close your eye repeatedly, release the water from your hand, and repeat as needed until your eye feels flushed., Ideally, apply this serum to your eyelashes before bed so that your eyelashes can really soak up all the benefits.








, Be sure to clean your eyes well the next day so that your pores and glands don’t become clogged. Remember to be gentle while you clean your eyes — don't rub them!

, If you experience any irritation, stop using whatever oils you’re using on your lashes immediately.

Repeat at least 3 times a week.,
Ensure that you thoroughly clean it off your lids and lashes.,
Don’t wear petroleum jelly on your eyelashes all the time.,
Expect to see a difference in 2 to 4 weeks.",How to Make Your Eyelashes Naturally Longer5," There is actually no scientific evidence to prove the age-old claim that petroleum jelly boosts lash growth, but countless people claim to have had success with it.


Many people believe the lash-growth effect is due to petroleum jelly’s moisturizing powers, which can help condition the hairs, making them stronger and thus less likely to break before reaching their full length potential.

, Petroleum jelly (also known as petrolatum) is generally considered safe, however, concerns have recently been raised about the risks of contamination from cancer-causing chemicals that are found in the oil from which the petrolatum is sourced.Some people avoid petrolatum not out of health concerns, but out of ethical ones, as it is sourced from oil, which is a non-renewable resource.Allergic reactions to petroleum jelly are rare but possible, so use with caution. In addition, as petroleum jelly is greasy, there is also the risk that applying it to your lashes could cause the pores on your eyelids and lash lines to become clogged, causing irritation or styes.

, Vaseline is the popular brand, but you can get no-name versions as well. If you don’t want to use petroleum jelly, you can buy non-petroleum versions at health food stores like Whole Foods. Synthetic versions also exist.









You can also make your own non-petroleum jelly by combining 1/8 a cup (roughly 1 ounce) of grated beeswax and 1/2 a cup of olive oil in a small saucepan, melting them together over low heat or in the top of a double boiler, and pouring the mixture into a jar to cool., You should be able to find both of these things at drugstores, beauty supply shops, and dollar stores.


If you’d prefer a wand but don’t want to buy one, you can even go to a store that sells makeup and request one of the disposable wands used for testing out products and applying makeup during in-store makeovers.
If you get a disposable wand, be sure to clean it after each use with a gentle cleanser (baby shampoo will work) and lukewarm warm water.

, Use a gentle, unscented cleanser to wash your eyelids and lashes, being sure not to rub them or apply too much pressure. This will ensure that they are free of debris such as residual makeup.

, Dip a cotton swab in the jelly and then run it along your lash line like an eye liner, avoiding your eyes. Next, put a bit of jelly on your fingers and gently run your thumb and index finger over your lashes.








You can also just apply the jelly to your lashes as you would apply mascara, with a clean mascara wand.

, Applying petroleum jelly before bed will allow the jelly to sink into your lashes undisturbed. You can also wear it in place of mascara. It won’t be as dramatic as mascara, but it will enhance the appearance of your eyelashes.








Some people suggest wearing petroleum jelly underneath your mascara to keep your lashes moisturized and keep your mascara on longer, while others claim that the jelly will cause your mascara to smudge., If you’re only applying it before bed, try to repeat the process at least 3 times a week.








, Use a gentle cleanser to wash the petroleum jelly completely off your lashes and lids., You need to give your eyelids and lashes a break, otherwise you’ll risk getting clogged pores, which could make lashes fall out or at least stop them from growing.


If you’re wearing it in place of mascara, don’t wear it at night.
If you wear it at night, don’t wear it all day as well.

, The popular claim is that petroleum jelly can make your lashes appear longer and fuller. You should be able to notice a difference within a few weeks of using it, as long as you use it regularly.Although many people claim that petroleum jelly works to give them fuller, longer lashes, no scientific research has been done to prove that such claims are true.

Start by holding the curler with your hand below your eye, and as you move up the lashes, bring your hand gradually above your head to help guide the curler and lashes upwards.Warm the curler with a hair dryer beforehand. This will help your lashes conform to the curler better and set them, almost like a perm., A double-sided eyelash brush has one side of thick bristles and the other side has a few thin plastic teeth.The plastic teeth help to eliminate clumps of mascara and separate lashes to make them look thinner, slender, and long.A clean toothbrush is an option instead of a specialized comb.

, Take a regular table spoon and hold the edge of the spoon to your roots with the concave side facing out. Use your thumb to press your lashes up around the edge of the spoon. Move your thumb upwards on your lashes like you would a wand to smooth them out to look longer.You can use this method anywhere and anytime during the day for a quick lash pick-me-up.
Spoons have dual mascara purposes. Place the convex side of the spoon underneath your bottom lashes. This way you can brush each lash the whole way, subsequently making them look longer and protecting your cheek from smudges.

, If you have a special event or performance that you need a quick and easy boost of lash length, grab a pair of fake ones. Follow the instructions on the package since directions can vary per brand. Apply the glue onto the fake lashes with a Q-tip or bobby pin or directly onto your eyelid to make application easier.This isn’t a cheap method if you use fake lashes every day, but they’re a quick alternative once in awhile if you're budgeting.
Blend the seam of the fake lashes into your natural lash line with a similarly colored eyeliner.Put a mirror on a counter and look down into it rather than straight into a mirror. This will give you a better vantage point.
Prop your elbows and arms up on a counter of sink to stabilize yourself when applying fake lashes so that you can be precise.

Get your supplies.,
Stir together the clay and guar gum.,
Add the water and glycerin.,
Make a new batch regularly.",How to Make Mascara2," Making mascara out of clay is quick and only requires a few ingredients and tools. To make your own homemade mascara from clay, you will need:


5 teaspoons (25 g) clay (of your color choice)
1 ¾ teaspoon (10.5 ml) water
1/4 teaspoon (1.5 ml) vegetable glycerin
1 pinch guar gum
a small bowl
a spoon

, Take a pinch of guar gum and put it into the bowl. The guar gum will act as a thickener and stabilizer for the mascara. Then, measure out five teaspoons of the clay of your choice. You can also mix the colors to create your own unique shade. The clay will provide the color, and will help the mascara to dry easily. Choose a clay that has the color you are looking for n a mascara. Popular clay choices include:Bentonite clay mixed with cocoa powder for color (for more of a brown mascara)
Australian red reef clay (for a reddish brown mascara)
Australian black clay (for a black mascara)

, When you have mixed the two powders together, add in the liquid ingredients. Measure out 1 ¾ teaspoons of water and 1/4 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin. Stir the ingredients until they are well combined.


If you’re having trouble stirring the ingredients together, add more water in small increments, such as a drop or two at a time, until you get a thick, smooth liquid.
It’s important that you don’t add too much water, or the mascara will be runny and you won’t be able to apply it., Since this mascara doesn’t really have any preservatives, it’s important that you replace it every four to six months.This will prevent bacteria from growing and spreading onto your lashes.


Always wash and disinfect your mascara tube and wand before reuse.
Don’t use your mascara if it starts to smell. Get rid of it and make a new batch right away.

"

Clean and disinfect your mascara tube and brush.,
Use a syringe.,
Make a homemade icing bag for the mascara.,
Pour in small dollops.,
Reinsert the plug.,
Store the mascara in a jar as an alternative.",How to Make Mascara3," Before you transfer your mascara to the tube, make sure that the tube and brush are clean. If the tube and brush are new, ten you don’t have to do anything. However, if you are reusing an old mascara tube and brush, you will need to wash the brush and tube thoroughly with warm water and some castile soap or baby shampoo.Remove the plug from the top of the tube and place it in a small bowl of warm, soapy water.
Apply soap to the bristles and use your fingers to work the soap into the brush bristles. Then, put some soap into the tube as well. Use the brush to move the soap around in the tube.
Continue to add soap and rinse the tube and brush until the water runs clear and all of the suds have been rinsed away. Then, take the plug out of the bowl of water and rinse it as well.

, One option for transferring mascara to a tube is to use an oral syringe. Oral syringes can be found in most pharmacies and drug stores, and they make excellent injectors for filling mascara tubes.


When your mascara is ready, simply insert the nose of the syringe into the mixture, pull up the plunger to suck up the mascara, and then inject the mascara into the tube. Repeat until your tube is full, or until all the mascara is gone.
Wash the syringe with soap and water immediately after you finish using it to prevent the mascara from caking on.

, You can also use a plastic bag similar to create an icing bag and use it to transfer the mascara to the tube.Scoop your mascara mixture into a plastic bag, such as a resealable sandwich bag or a clean plastic bulk bag.
Work the mixture to one of the bottom corners of the bag.
Then, cut a small hole in the corner of the bag.
Insert the corner into the top of the mascara tube and gently squeeze the bag to push the mascara into the tube.

, Use tape to secure your mascara tube to a flat surface. With the end of a knife, scoop up a small amount of mascara. Dangle the knife vertically over the mascara tube hole and allow the dollop of mascara to drop into it.


If necessary, use a toothpick to make an air bubble in the dollop of mascara so that it drains into the tube.
Repeat until you have filled the tube.

, When you have filled your mascara tube, replace the makeup plug before returning the wand to the tube. The plug disperses the makeup evenly and removes excess mascara from the wand as you pull it out of the tube.

, Instead of trying to fill a mascara tube, consider storing the mixture in a sealable, airtight container that you can still dip the mascara wand into.To prevent mascara from drying onto the wand between uses, wash the wand with soap and water after every use.

Add 1 teaspoon castor oil to a small container.,
Add 1 teaspoon coconut oil to the container.,
Add additional oils, like jojoba, sweet almond, or a Vitamin E capsule.,
Mix the serum with a small spatula or toothpick.,
Apply the serum to your lashes with a cotton swab or a spoolie brush.,
Apply the serum every night before bed so it can soak in overnight.,
Wipe the serum off your eyes in the morning.",How to Make an Eyelash Serum to Grow Long Eyelashes1," Many people use castor oil on its own as a hair-growth treatment. Castor oil's anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties help break down clogs and buildup that might be slowing hair growth.Castor oil also contains Vitamin E, proteins, and Omega fatty acids that condition, strengthen, and moisturize hair.Look for cold-pressed castor oil and avoid anything meant for industrial use.;
, Coconut oil is often a solid at room temperature, so you may want to heat it in the microwave for a few seconds so it liquefies and is easier to mix.


Coconut oil is a highly effective moisturizer that is quickly absorbed by the skin so it can begin working faster.Coconut oil reduces protein loss in your hair to repair and nourish your eyelashes.The medium chain triglycerides found in coconut oil may also help waterproof and protect your hair from drying out when you use products that can sap the moisture from your hair., The castor and coconut oils create the base of your serum, and you can add different oils or vitamins to further enhance the effects of your serum.


Jojoba oil is an emollient that is also very efficient in unclogging hair follicles that may not be growing hair or growing hair inefficiency.Sweet almond oil contains biotin, a B vitamin that is believed to strengthen hair and increase growth.Vitamin E is often sold in capsules. Pierce the capsule with a needle and squeeze it into your serum. Vitamin E is said to keep your hair follicles healthy by increasing circulation and strengthening hair.

, Make sure all the ingredients are incorporated and there is no separation.

, Wipe off any excess serum so it doesn't drip into your eye or onto your skin. Focus most of your attention on the roots of your eyelashes so your skin can absorb the oils.


Swipe the cotton swab over your lashes or run the spoolie brush through your lashes. Make sure your lashes are completely coated with the serum.
You can also apply the serum with the tip of your fingers (this may help liquify the coconut oil if it has solidified). Just be sure your fingers are clean so you don't get any dirt or germs in your eyes.
These ingredients won't harm your eyes if a little of the serum drips into them, but your vision may be temporarily blurry.

, It will take several weeks to see results. The ingredients in this serum work because they strengthen and condition your eyelashes so they look thicker, healthier, and can reach their full length potential. It is important to note, however, that genetics determine how long your lashes can ultimately grow. So if your eyelashes are healthy but still short, it may be that they simply do not grow any longer naturally.Prescription growth serums work by tricking your hair follicles into a longer growth period. With a longer growth period, your lashes may in fact grow longer than your genetics would normally allow. These serums do have some severe side effects, so discuss these with your doctor before asking for a prescription.
Vitamin E is very rich and can clog pores. If you are prone to breakouts or oily skin, you may want to try another ingredient or just be extra careful not to get any on your skin. , Carefully remove the serum when you wake up, or your skin may look greasy. The oils in the serum may also keep your makeup from adhering to your skin or lashes, so make sure it's completely wiped off before applying makeup.

Trim your excess glue and lash.,
Curl your false eyelashes.,
Decorate your lashes.",How to Make False Eyelashes1," You'll be able to make your false eyelashes more quickly and without interruption if you have the materials you need on hand.;
, A previously used strip of lashes can work well as your width guide. If you don't have one you can hold a length of thread up to your eye. Look in the mirror and lay the thread across your natural lash line from corner to corner.After moving the thread away from your eye, trim your thread to the length of your lash line so you can use it to create your seam.

, This will be the base of your lashes, or the ""seam."" If you have false lashes on hand, you can use these to determine the width of your seam, but if not, use the string that you've trimmed to the length of you lash line.


You will need to wait about two minutes for the eyelash adhesive to dry until it is tacky., Cut a section off your brush at the base and spread its bristles until you have achieved your target fullness.Press these into your glue, and use a spatula or popsicle stick to apply firm pressure. Switch between using your finger and spatula, removing any glue residue from your spatula as it forms.


As your bristles stick to the adhesive, you may notice that your false eyelashes aren't as thick as you intended. Add bristles to your seam until you've achieved your desired thickness.

, Once you have the lashes appropriately thick, carefully spread a thin layer of glue over the top of the bristles to seal your seam. Allow the glue to dry completely, which usually takes about five minutes.

, Once the eyelash adhesive is completely dry, carefully peel the strip of glue from your plastic surface. Carefully cut away excess glue to form a slim seam. Now you can shape the ends of the lashes in your favorite style.


You can cover any visible glue with eyeshadow. It's best to use a color that matches the color of your false eyelashes.

, Using tweezers to protect your hand from the heat of your curling iron, press your lashes against the hotplate until you achieve the right amount of curl. Now you can use hairspray to help hold the shape and then brush each with an eyelash comb.


You may need to repeat this process to achieve the best curl for your lashes.

, If you want to add extra spice to the lashes, you can add a personal touch. Think about adding sequins, glitter, or other craft materials to give your eyelashes extra wow-factor.

Finished.

",How to Make an Eyelash Serum to Grow Long Eyelashes2," The idea here is two-fold: you are distributing healthy, natural oils along the length of your lashesas well as stimulating circulation at the root of your lashes. Combing your lashes will remove any lingering mascara or other product that could be drying out your lashes.


Separating your lashes by combing can also make them appear longer.

, As with brushing, massaging your eyelids will stimulate circulation, increasing the flow of oxygen and nutrients to your hair follicles.Use the pads of your fingers to very gently rub the base of your lash line. Use circular motions and don't tug or pull on the skin.

, A coat of Vaseline will seal the moisture into your eyelashes, preventing them from drying out. Though this doesn't necessarily increase the length of your eyelashes, it can make them thicker and healthier, which can make them look longer.

, Brew yourself a cup of green tea and use a cotton swab to apply the (cooled!) tea to your lashes. The flavonoids and caffeine in green tea are said to stimulate new hair growth., Though they will temporarily make your lashes look long and voluminous, removing them can destroy your eyelashes. When you remove the lashes, you will pull out some of your existing lashes. Plus the glue and the solvent that removes the glue can be harmful to your eyes.If you are constantly pulling out your eyelashes as you remove the false lashes, you can actually cause traction alopecia, which means your lashes will no longer grow., Leaving mascara on your lashes overnight can cause them to dry out, bend, and break.Not only does this cause a sparse lash-line, but a bent eyelash can actually scratch your eye in the night.


Try to avoid waterproof mascara, as it can dry out your eyelashes, which makes them more prone to breaking., Your hair is made of protein, and without it your body won't be able to create new, healthy hair. A healthy diet will give your body all the building blocks to make and nourish your eyelashes.Eat dark greens like broccoli, kale, spinach, and Swiss chard for vitamin A and C. Vitamin deficiencies can actually cause your eyelashes to fall out.Proteins like turkey, chicken, nuts, beans, lentils, eggs, yogurt, and cheese will give your body the building blocks it needs to grow new hair.Bananas, beer, oats, and raisins contain silica, a mineral that may increase hair thickness., Whether it's a nervous habit or a method of mascara removal, pulling on your eyelashes is a major don't. You may pull out or damage your eyelashes and may actually cause trauma to healthy hair follicles, which can make them dormant so they won't grow new hair.If you have stubborn mascara that won't come off (like a long-lasting or waterproof mascara), try an oil-based makeup remover to break it down. Gently rub the oil over your eyelid, then hold a cotton pad against your eyelid for about 30 seconds. Swipe the pad downward and this should remove most of the mascara.
Rubbing itchy eyes can also cause damage to your lashes. Try allergy-fighting eyedrops instead and keep your hands in your lap!

, Take a length of string and run it along your lash line. Looking in a mirror, measure your lash line from one corner of your eye to the next. Trim your excess thread so you have a length of string that is the total width of your lashes.


If you happen to have saved pre-made eyelashes that you've used before, you can use these to determine your lash-width.

, This can be anything from a subtle trapezoid to gigantic wavy lashes. Using your lash line length thread, be sure that your paper is the right width for your lash line.


You should use your sharp pointed object or a pair of fine scissors to shred the paper to give a realistic look. Be sure to leave a 1-2 millimeter base, otherwise your lashes may not hold up very long.
You may need to experiment with the shape of your paper lashes by gently holding it to your eye to see whether or not the shape you have chosen works.

, Make sure any edges that were created when you cut the lashes are covered. Apply your marker gently to the ""hair"" part of your false eyelashes, as too much ink may cause discoloration or drooping.

, You can use a length of string to measure the width of your lashes. Simply run your thread from one corner of your eye to the other, looking in a mirror as you do so to ensure you are properly following your lash line.


Trim excess string so that it is the exact width of your eyelash line.

, The width of your fabric will be the same as that of your measuring string, but the length of your fabric rectangle will determine the length of your false lashes. The longer you make your strip of fabric, the longer your lashes will be.


You can always trim down the length of your false lashes when you are finished, so it is better to cut your fabric longer and trim it down later.

, Using your scissors, cut your fabric in very thin strips from one end to the other. You will need to leave about 1-2 millimeters of fabric uncut at the base of your false lashes.This is where you will apply your adhesive to attach your eyelashes to your eyelid.

, You can attempt to curl your lashes by holding the 1-2 millimeter strip you left uncut and applying your hot plate to the ""hair"" part of your false eyelashes. If you have trouble getting the desired curl, you may need to lay your false lashes to a round, heat-resistant surface and then apply your hot plate. This will cause your false lashes to curl along the rounded edge of whatever object you are using.You may need to apply product to your false lashes to help maintain this curl.

, Cloth eyelashes are great for a feathery, delicate look, so why not add a small, delicate feather in the corner of your false eyelashes?Glitter and sequins are also good options to give your lashes a unique touch.

If your goal is to make them look natural, you want to avoid the dramatically long, the unnaturally spiky, and the outrageously full ones. If you want them to look real, bigger is not necessarily better. Choose a pair that look like your dream natural eyelashes.


If you can’t find any that look natural in the store, check online. You will endless options if you order online, and you can also read reviews from others who have tried particular brands or styles.;
, For most people, your false eyelashes won’t be ready to go right out of the box. First, you’ll need to trim them so that they fit your own, unique eye perfectly. Before applying any glue to them, hold them up to your eyelid and determine how much you’ll need to trim off the end. Use small scissors to carefully cut the lashes. The finished lash strip should be the same length as your natural lashes.If you skip this step, the extra length will rub against your skin as you blink and cause the eyelashes to come loose. Not to mention they won’t look very natural!

, There is a bit of a debate about which eyelash glue is best, so you can weigh your options. Some pairs of eyelashes come with glue, but often you’ll need to buy your own. Eyelash glue is sold at pharmacies and beauty supply stores in small tubes that you can use for many applications.


The most common type of eyelash glue comes out of the tube white and then dries clear. If you’re skilled at applying false eyelashes, you can apply them carefully and avoid any clumps of glue showing.
You can also purchase black eyelash glue. This works well if you line your lash line with dark eyeliner before applying your lashes, because any black glue will blend into it.

, Using dark brown or black eyeliner, line the entire length of your lash line. This helps your false eyelashes look more natural by giving the illusion of thick, full roots. The eyeliner will create a base for your false lashes and help them to blend into your natural ones., Read the instructions on whichever lash glue you are using to make sure you are applying it properly. For most lash glues, you will apply it evenly along the strip of eyelashes and then wait for about a minute while the glue becomes tacky. Once the glue has thickened up on the lash, it is time to apply it to your lid., Once the glue is tacky, carefully hold your lashes by the tips and line up the strip with your natural lash line, starting at the outer corner. Gently press the strip down, curving the band along the natural curve of your eyelid. Once you’ve pressed the entire strip down, double check to make sure that they’re lined up properly.







, Once you’ve confirmed that your lashes are in the right place, press down on the glued strip with more pressure so that the glue dries securely. As you’re pressing down, pinch your false lashes and natural lashes together. This will help to ensure that your false lashes dry in the correct position, lined up with your natural lashes.








Let the glue dry for a couple of minutes before you move on to the next steps.

, Once the eyelash glue is completely dry, grab an eyelash curler. You’ll want to curl your false lashes and your natural lashes together so that they look most natural. Gently insert all of your lashes through the curler, and press down on your lashes firmly at the base. Hold for a couple of seconds, and release.







, This is the final step to make sure your eyelashes are blended together. By applying mascara to your false and natural lashes at the same time, they will bind together with the makeup. You can help to darken up your natural lashes and give them a little bit more volume and length to camouflage them into your false lashes.

Opt for a thick, wet mascara because it makes it easier for the lashes to stick together.Mascaras that are advertised as having a volumizing or thickening formula tend to be thicker and wetter than lengthening formulas.
Mascara tends to dry out as you use it because air gets inside the tube. When you want a clumpy lash look, you’re better off working with a new mascara that’s only been only for a month or so.;
, Instead of a traditional brush that features bristles that are all the same length and positioned at the same angle, use a mascara brush with both short and long bristles and a combination of straight and slanted bristles. That will ensure that the mascara coats every lash for maximum clumping.Some mascaras also feature brush heads that are slightly curved to make it easier to get mascara on every lash.
You can also find mascaras with spikes at the edge of the brush that allow you to get mascara even on shorter lashes or any lashes that you may have missed.

, Black is the classic mascara option, but some people like to use black brown or brown mascaras for a more natural look. When you want clumpy eyelashes, though, use the blackest mascara that you can find to make sure that the spider-y look of your lashes really stands out., To ensure that your clumpy lashes stand out, you need to choose the right eyeshadow shades to pair with it. Choose a light lid shade so that your clumpy lashes will stand out against it.Depending on your skintone, ivory, cream, beige, tan, and peach can all work. Even a light pink or lilac can work.
If you really want your clumpy lashes to make a statement, consider skipping eyeshadow completely. When mascara is the only eye makeup that you’re wearing, your lashes are usually the first thing that people will notice.

, When you go for a clumpy lash look, it can create gaps at your lashline that look strange if you don’t fill them in. To avoid any gaps, apply a black, waterproof liner in a thin line to help thicken up the look of your lashes.You can use your favorite eyeliner formula, such as a pencil, liquid, or gel. Liquid liner tends to offer the most precision, though.
Be sure to apply your eyeliner before your mascara. It can be difficult to get it right at the lashline if your lashes are already clumped together.

, A lash primer isn’t necessary for everyday wear, but when you want clumpy lashes, it coats them so they appear thicker when you apply your mascara over it. Choose a conditioning lash primer and apply one coat of it before you put on your mascara.Some mascaras come in double-ended tubes with the mascara on one side and a primer on the other, which makes it easier to find your primer when you need it.

, When you apply your first coat of mascara, hold the brush horizontally as you normally would. Comb through your lashes starting at the base and ending at the tips to ensure that you cover all of them.There’s no need to wipe off your mascara brush as you might normally to do to avoid clumps. Applying more product than usual actually helps the clumpy lash look.

, When you go in for your second coat, continue to hold the brush horizontally. Start at the base of your lashes again, but this time, wiggle the brush back and forth at the roots so you can be sure that your lashes aren’t just clumpy at the ends.Make sure to dip the mascara brush back into the tube before your second coat so there’s plenty of mascara on the bristles.

, When you go in for the third coat of mascara, turn the brush so you’re holding it vertically. Use the brush to push the mascara onto the ends of your lashes and form noticeable clumps.Dip the brush back into the mascara before your third coat too, so you have enough product to clump your lashes together.

, After three coats, check to see if you’re happy with how clumpy your lashes are. If you’re not, apply a fourth coat, holding the wand vertically as you did for the third coat. Focus on the ends of your lashes to maximize clumpiness."

You can apply it before bed, if desired, and sleep with it on, or you can apply the petroleum jelly during the day.


Petroleum jelly coats and seals each eyelash, protecting the lashes from drying agents and other harmful substances in the air. As a result, your lashes stay moisturized more effectively, thereby growing out to be stronger and healthier.;
, There are a few different oils frequently suggested, but each one works the same way by providing a protective coat over each lash, thereby blocking out drying agents or other harmful airborne debris. Oils are a natural eyelash conditioner.


Olive oil, vitamin E oil, castor oil, and emu oil rank highest on the list of recommended oils because of the nutrients they contain.
Carefully dab a small amount of oil along the upper lash line using a cotton swab. If applying before bed, let them dry slightly before you go to sleep.

, Egg whites are packed with protein. Some people wash their hair with an egg white treatment regularly, and to the same end, you can use egg whites on your eyelashes to fortify and strengthen them.Mix one separated egg white with equal parts castor oil.
Use a lash brush or cotton swab to apply roughly two drops of this mixture to the right and left upper lash lines.

, Applying a commercial lash conditioner or accelerator on a daily basis can cause your lashes to look longer and healthier in only a few weeks' time.


The specific ingredients found in these products vary depending on the brand, but they often include things like peptides, vitamins, and aloe, or other nutrients that can help your lashes becomes stronger and longer.

, A balanced diet should keep all your bodily functions running properly, including the body's ability to grow eyelashes. For an added boost, though, make sure to consume plenty of B-complex vitamins, especially biotin. Some dieticians claim that B vitamins can help eyelashes and the hair on your head grow.In fact, some evidence suggests that a biotin deficiency is one possible cause of premature or rapid eyelash loss.
Biotin can be found in natural food sources, including nutritional yeast, liver, cauliflower, salmon, bananas, carrots, egg yolks, sardines, legumes, and mushrooms.
You should also look at getting more silicon into your diet to promote better hair growth overall. Silicon can be found in asparagus, cabbage, cucumbers, olives, green beans, beer, rice, and oats.

, Many standard times of mascara can make your eyelashes look great, yet ultimately damage them. Eyelash primer should be used beneath these lashes to protect them from the harsh ingredients of your mascara and eyeliner


Look for primers that contain pro-keratin. This nutrient can protect and strengthen each eyelash you apply it to.

, As a general rule, less is more when it comes to mascara and eyelash health. The less often you use mascara, the quicker and stronger your eyelashes will grow. When you do decide to put a little mascara on, though, there are some choices that are better than others.


If you have sensitive eyes, you might want to consider investing in hypoallergenic mascara to reduce irritation. When your eye becomes inflamed, you are more likely to lose lashes.
Avoid waterproof mascara. These formulas are very potent, and the ingredients used to get the mascara to stick to your lashes can cause damage to weak eyelashes.
When you do wear mascara—or any eye makeup, for that matter—make sure to thoroughly and completely wash your face before going to bed. All of the eye makeup should be gone. Otherwise, you could cause more damage to your eyelashes.
Remove clumps of mascara when the mascara is still wet since doing so will be far easier at this stage. Removing dried clumps may result in the loss of an eyelash or two.
Discard your old mascara after three to six months to protect your eyes and eyelashes against germs that could cause painful and/or lash-damaging infections. You should also discard mascara after you suffer an eye illness, like pink eye.

, Most people do not intentionally yank out their eyelashes, but you might be doing just that without even realizing it. Eyelash roots are especially delicate, so they can break off without much force.Tugging at your lashes with your fingers or a lash curler is a big no-no, and you should also make a conscious effort to stop rubbing your eyes.
When washing off any eye makeup, you should pat or dab at your eyelids instead of rubbing, scrubbing, or pulling.

, Brushing the hair on your head can stimulate circulation and the hair follicles beneath the scalp. In a similar manner, gently combing your eyelashes can stimulate eyelash growth.


Make sure that you do not tug your lashes as you comb them, however, since doing so could cause further damage.

, Massage stimulates the hair follicles along your lash lines, causing them to become more active and improving their ability to grow stronger eyelashes faster. It also stimulates blood flow, which can help, as well.


Gently rub along the lash line and entire eyelid using small, circular motions. Use your pinky finger to avoid applying too much pressure to the eye accidentally.
Massage for 5 to 10 minutes daily to see results.

, As previously noted, using mascara can give you the appearance of longer, fuller eyelashes, but some standard mascaras can actually do more harm than good in the scheme of things. The best type of mascara to use for eyelash grown is a lash-enhancing kind, while lengthening mascaras are the best to promote the look of longer lashes immediately.


A lash-enhancing mascara contains special lipid complexes that are actually capable of strengthening your eyelashes as it coats them. Wearing this type of mascara is less likely to damage your lash line, but you should still make sure to clean it away gently to avoid accidental damage.Volumizing or lengthening mascara can give you a great look, but if it does not contain lash-enhancing properties, using too much of it or using it too frequently can still cause damage to your lashes.

, While eyeliner spends less time clinging to your eyelashes than mascara does, it still touches your lashes at the root, giving it plenty of opportunity to help or hurt new lashes as they grow in.


A ""lash grower"" liquid liner should be applied directly to the base of the lash line. The peptides in the product strengthen your lashes at the base.

, Lacquer is formulated to give your eyelashes more volume and shine without becoming clumpy. If your eyelash area looks especially vacant, you can swipe some on over your favorite mascara for an added boost.


While lacquer does not damage eyelashes as much as a traditional mascara does, it can still have a negative effect if abused. For best results, use the lacquer over lash-enhancing mascara or primer.

, As you brush the cosmetic over your natural lashes, these extensions are deposited on the ends, making your eyelashes look fuller and longer.


Some of these cosmetics also contain hyaluronic acid and vitamin E, so they condition your eyelashes while giving them an added visual boost.
These cosmetics should only be applied toward the tip of your lashes, though. Applying them near the root can cause irritation, since the fibers can come loose and get into your eye.

, Some beauty salons now offer eyelash extensions. Synthetic lashes are individually glued in between your natural lashes, creating the appearance of a full, healthy lash line.


The process can take a few hours, but the results last for several weeks.
You will also need to get a 30-minute touch-up every two to three weeks if you want to keep the look going.
Sleep on your back to avoid accidentally pulling out the extensions.
One downside of eyelash extensions is that, for some women, they can actually cause your own, natural eyelashes to fall out more rapidly and ultimately thin out.
Another disadvantage of eyelash extensions is the cost. The procedure can set you back $300 or more.

, Fake eyelashes can give you the appearance of long, lovely lashes, but they usually need to be changed out daily and might cause long-term damage to your eyelashes if used too often.


The part that causes the most damage is removal. As you peel the fake eyelashes away, you might take some of your natural eyelashes along for the ride. Since you have to change your fake eyelashes so often, this damage can seriously build up over time.

,


The medication is applied along the upper lash line, eventually stimulating longer, thicker, and darker lashes, but you should not apply it to the lower lashes.
Usually, doctors instruct you to take the medication daily for two months or more.
Possible side effects include itchy or red eyes, dry eyes, darkened eyelids, darkened brown pigmentation in the iris, hair growth around the eyes if the medication continually runs off the eyelids and onto the surrounding skin.

, There are a variety of health conditions and disorders that could be responsible for your loss of eyelashes. If you have one of these conditions, the only real way to grow eyelashes long-term is to treat the underlying condition.


Eye infections, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, eyelid inflammation, and trichotillomania are all conditions that could be to blame.
Doctors may recommend a special cleaning routine for eyelid inflammation and infections. An infection may also warrant the use of antibiotics.
Hypothyroidism needs to be treated with thyroid replacement drugs.
Trichotillomania is a psychological condition that causes you to pull your eyelashes out. You might be treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and certain mood-stabilizing drugs.
Autoimmune diseases are often treated with various immuno-suppressants.

Talk to your doctor.",How to Grow Back Your Eyelashes After They Fall Out," There is very little you can actually do to make your eyelashes grow faster. Your best bet will be to simply keep the eyelashes from falling back out again, which means your focus should be on prevention and maintenance. Expect that it will take awhile for your lashes to grow back in and that in the mean time, you will need to work to maintain that growth.;
, If you know the cause of your eyelash loss was from something like chemo or hormone problems, don't worry about this. However, if your loss was unexplained, you will want to avoid wearing makeup around your eyes. There are two reasons for this. The first is that makeup does expire after awhile and the bacteria it grows can cause your eyelash loss. Another reason is that some people are allergic to the ingredients in makeup and this make have aggravated your skin enough to cause the hair loss.


Wash it off every night if you do wear makeup. This will keep it from irritating your skin and lashes any more than necessary.

, Eyelash loss is often caused by an overgrowth of bacteria around the eyelids and face. Wash your face every day with gentle soaps designed for the face in order to keep bacteria under control.


You also don't want your skin to dry out, since the micro cracks that can form can cause even more infections.

, If you are eating a particularly limited diet, this can have an effect on hair growth and health. Not getting enough vitamin D, vitamin A, and complete proteincan cause or worsen hair loss. Eat a well balanced diet with a wide range of foods in order to make sure that your body has what it needs to make healthy hair.


Foods rich in these nutrients include fortified cereals, milk, carrots, kale, fish, and nuts.

, Overusing or incorrectly using an eyelash curler can accidentally pull out your eyelashes, especially if the hair is already weak. Don't use your eyelash curler for awhile and see if this helps keep your eyelashes in place.

, There is a sea of bacteria on your hands and when you touch your face (to scratch, pick, wipe, etc), you're introducing this bacteria to your skin. Your eyes are very sensitive to bacteria and can easily become infected. By keeping your hands away, you'll help ensure that your eyes (and thus your eyelashes) can stay healthy.


If you find that you have trouble breaking this habit, try keeping a piece of tape towards the end of your main fingers. This will make you more aware of when you're doing it and help you to break the habit.
Find other ways to keep your hands occupied, such as playing with a rubber band on your wrist.

, Before using makeup and other products to cover your lash loss, make sure that these products are not causing your lash loss to begin with. Talk to your doctor or experiment by not using any makeup for several weeks and then slowly introducing one type of makeup at a time, with about a week's worth of use for each product before moving on to another.

, Liquid eyeliner, applied thickly and right at the lash line, can make it look like you have lashes when you do not or when you only have very little. Try to use a color that compliments your natural coloring. For example, black will look best with dark coloring, where brown will look best if you have light-colored hair.

, If you have some lashes, you can use mascara to make the lashes you have look thicker and longer. Try to use a conditioning mascara to keep your lashes as healthy as possible.


You can even add extra volume by applying baby powder between coats of mascara.

, If you don't have lashes you can add to, try using false eyelashes. These are cheap and readily available at drug and beauty stores. All you need to do is apply the lash glue (which may be included) and then place the eyelashes with a pair of tweezers.


You can even use false eyelashes if you have some eyelashes already. This is particularly useful if you lost eyelashes in just one small spot. Cut just a piece of the false eyelash and glue it where needed.

, Use makeup and makeup techniques that draw attention to other parts of your face. This will draw attention away from your eyes and toward your other features. For example, you can wear really bright lipstick to draw attention to your mouth instead. Another option is to use blunt bangs right at the level of your eyes. The bushy hair around your eyes will make it appear that you have more lash than you do.


You can use props too. Try wear bright, thick framed glasses to distract from your eyes on the other side of the frame, or a bold necklace to draw attention down to your chest.

, One of the common causes of eyelash problems is an infection called blepharitis. This is an overgrowth of bacteria on the face and can have many causes, from poor hygiene to parasites. The best thing that you can do to prevent this problem is to wash your face regularly.


If your face is exposed to bacteria, such as if an animal licks your face or you wipe your face while preparing food, wash your face immediately.

, There is a relatively common disorder, similar to OCD, in which people feel compelled to pull their own hair. For most sufferers that means pulling the hair on their head, but some also pull their eyelashes or eyebrows.This disorder is called ""trichotillomania"". If you think you might have this, talk to a therapist. There are medications and behavioral tricks which can help you stop and feel more relaxed.


Even if you don't think you have this disorder, it's best not to pull your own hairs out for any reason. If you find you can't stop, reconsider if you have trich.

, Sometimes loss of eyelashes can be the result of physical problems far below the skin's surface. You might be affected by thyroid or hormone problems that limit or inhibit hair growth.Usually, you will see hair loss in other areas of your body as well, but it isn't guaranteed.


If you are young, you might have a serious health condition that is causing problems with your hormones. However, if you are older, above your 40s or 50s, this is probably normal. Even for normal hair loss, however, there are medications you can take so talk to your doctor.

, If you have hair loss only on your lashes, you probably have an infection. However, if you notice patches of hair loss elsewhere on your body (especially at the sides of your head), you may have a condition called alopecia. This is a relatively common disorder and causes hair loss all over the body. Talk to your doctor about treatments that might be right for you.

, If this problem is ongoing or reoccurring, you should absolutely talk to your doctor. Some eyelash loss is normal but excessive loss of lashes is usually a sign of other health problems. Some health problems can be very serious, such as problems with your thyroid. Because of this, it's best to talk to a doctor if the problem returns or goes on for a long time.

That said, if you have sensitive skin or eczema, you may want to try a different treatment, as the solution applied to your eyelashes may cause irritation. Furthermore, eyelash lifts may not be as effective on people with shorter lashes. You may want to consider having an eyelash lift if:


You have straight lashes and want them curled.
Eyelash perms or curlers have not worked for you in the past.
You have hooded or mature eyes.
You don’t want to reapply mascara every day.;
, Lash lifts are very similar in technique. A serum or proprietary mixture will be applied to each individual lash before the lashes are curled. That said, there are a few different treatments on the market. Some of the more popular treatments include:



Keratin Lash Lift: A five-step method that involves the application of special pigment, keratin, and enzymes to the eye lashes. They cost around $150, and they can take up to two hours to apply.Dreamlash: This method claims to use a gentler formula and more flexible curling rods. If you are concerned about reacting badly to the chemical serum, you may want to look into this.Length-Volume Lift (LVL) Enhance: A serum is applied to the root of the lashes to curl them, and the lashes are tinted to give an effect similar to mascara. This treatment, which is currently only available in the UK, costs around £50., As a relatively new treatment, you may find it difficult to find places that offer eyelash lifts. You can try searching on the internet for salons in your area that offer the treatment. You can also look at beauty treatment centers that specialize in eye and brow treatments.


Ask if the technician performing the treatment has received training in eyelash lifts from a program such as Sugarlash Pro, Nouveau Lashes, Dreamlash, or YUMILashes.
Read online reviews before you choose a salon to make sure that it is reputable, clean, and safe. Yelp, Google Reviews, Facebook, and Foursquare can help you find reviews.
Some salons may offer eyelash perms instead of lifts. Eyelash perms apply similar solutions to your eyelashes, but they use a different type of curler. Perms offer a more dramatic curl while lifts tend to look more natural., Once you have chosen your salon, call to make your appointment. You may want to put the appointment in your phone calendar or schedule to remind you when it is.


Eyelash lifts can take between 45 minutes and two hours. You may want to plan to be free for slightly longer than two hours just in case.If you are worried that you will have a bad reaction, you should ask ahead of time if you can patch test the formulas. If the salons do not offer you a sample, you may not want to go through with the procedure.

, Some salons may give you samples of the serums or formulas used so that you can test them for any potential bad reaction. Two days before your appointment, apply the serums to your shoulder. If a rash or stinging sensation develop, call the salon to cancel your appointment. You may have to find an alternate treatment., On the day that you have the procedure done, you should not wear mascara, eye shadow, or any other eye makeup. It may be best to go in with a bare face to ensure that your eyelashes are as clean as possible when you go in. Your lashes should be completely clean so that the technician can properly apply the serums.

, The technician will take you to the room where you will have the treatment done. While the procedure can vary slightly, generally, you will be asked to lay down on a chair and close your eyes as the curlers are attached. You will have to lie very still throughout the duration of the treatment. Try to avoid blinking, moving your head, or touching the curlers., Slight irritation from the serum is normal, and the curlers may be slightly uncomfortable. The technician may be able to relieve your discomfort by using a fan or by cleaning your lashes. If the irritation is severe or you are experiencing pain, swelling, or burning, ask the technician to stop., The technician will advise you to remain still for a certain amount of time. This can be anywhere from thirty to ninety minutes. The technician may reapply serums during this time. When the time is up, they will remove the curlers and wipe away any remaining product that is on your face.Your vision should not be blurry afterwards. If you have any product in your eye, ask the technician to help you flush it out.

, It can take up to twenty-four hours for the serums to set. During that time, you should not touch or rub your eyelashes, and you should avoid getting them wet at all costs. If you can, take a bath instead of a shower. When washing your face, take care to avoid the eye area. In addition, for twenty-four hours after the lift, you should not:


Swim
Receive other beauty treatments
Visit a sauna
Steam your face, Putting mascara, eye shadow, concealer, or any other type of makeup near your lashes can interfere with the curl. It may reduce the duration of the curl. Do not wear mascara, eyeliner, or eyeshadow for up to forty-eight hours after you have the procedure done. While you can wear foundation, concealer, and moisturizer around the rest of your face, avoid placing anything under your eyes or near the lashes., Long-term reactions are rare, but you should still be watching for signs of irritation up to forty-eight hours after the procedure. If you notice swelling around your eye area or if severe itching develops, you may want to contact a doctor.


If you continue receiving eyelash lifts after having a bad reaction, the result may worsen over time., Eyelash lifts generally last between eight and twelve weeks. During this time, you will not need another treatment. If you are satisfied with the results after this time period, you might consider booking another appointment to extend the curl."

If successful, your mascara should be less clumpy the next time you apply it.You can use your mascara right away after using this method.;
, If simply dipping the wand in hot water is not successful, you can try a more intense method. Boil a pot of water big enough that you can completely submerge your sealed tube of mascara in the water. Let the water come to a rolling boil before reducing the heat to a simmer.Place the mascara into the simmering water. Allow it to sit for a few minutes.
Take out the mascara using tongs. After the mascara has cooled to the touch, check the mascara to see if it's more liquid-like and does not clump as much.

, If your mascara is still a little clumpy after being submerged in the water, add a few drops of olive oil in the mascara tube. This should loosen up the mascara further and restore it to its original consistency."

Choose an eyelash dye.,
Mix the dye.Each lash dyeing kit should come with instructions and these instructions may vary.,
Do a sensitivity test.,
Apply a barrier.,
Load the wand.,
Brush the dye onto your lashes.,
Wipe stray dye off your skin.,
Wash away the excess dye.,
Repeat every few months.",How to Dye Eyelashes1," Never use standard hair dye when dealing with your eyelashes. Instead, look for a dye specifically formulated for use with lashes and brows.


Standard hair dyes use chemicals that are dangerous to apply near your eyes, so you should never use one on your eyelashes.
You'll have a few different colors to choose from. Black and brown are the most common, but there are also color-tinted options, like deep blue. Most of these color tints are not very noticeable, however, so they generally won't make your eyelashes look too unnatural.;
, Usually, however, it is as simple as adding combining the color and the activator.


Most kits come with a tube of dye, a bottle of activating solution, a mascara style wand, a stirring wand, and a mixing tray.
Squeeze 2 inches (5 cm) or so of color onto your mixing tray and add a few drops of activator. Stir the mixture until it thickens.
Adding too much activator can make the dye too runny. Thin, watery dye will not stay on the applicator wand well.

, Apply a small amount of prepared dye to the skin behind your ear or inside the elbow. Let the dye remain on your skin for 30 minutes before washing it off, then wait another 8 to 24 hours before proceeding further.


You need to monitor that spot you applied the dye to. If it begins to itch, burn, or become inflamed, you are likely having an allergic reaction to the dye. If you do have an allergic reaction, you should not use the dye on your eyelashes. As long as no allergic reaction develops, though, it the dye should be relatively safe for you.

, Use a cotton ball or pad to apply petroleum jelly around your eyes. Get the barrier underneath your eyes, applying it as far down as your lashes extend when you blink. Also apply it to the outer corners of your eyes, the upper lash lines, and the lids.


The dye is not supposed to stain your skin, but the barrier of petroleum jelly will make it much easier to wipe stray dye away afterward and further protect you from unsightly stains.

, Dip the side of the applicator wand into the prepared dye, turning the wand several times so that all sides pick up the dye.


The applicator wand is essentially the same sort of wand you use when applying mascara. If you already know how to apply mascara, you can use that knowledge here. You need to load the wand and apply the dye in the same way you would load and apply mascara.

, Use your loaded applicator wand to get a little of the dye on the upper and lower lashes of both eyes. Go back through and touch up your work after applying this base coat.


Look in a mirror as you apply the dye.
Begin with the upper lashes. Brush the dye onto the top of your lashes and onto the undersides.
Squint your eyes and gently blend the dye into your lower lashes, getting both the tops and undersides.
Get as close to the roots of your eyelashes as possible.
Take your time and keep your hands steady. The dye will sting if it gets into your eyes and may cause some irritation. If you do get dye in your eyes, wash it out immediately before doing anything else.

, Use a clean cotton ball or pad to blend away spots and smudges of dye that got onto your eyelids or cheeks.


Work carefully to avoid smearing the dye on your lashes.

, Wait 15 to 20 minutes to let the dye set. After you're certain that it has set, wash the wet dye off with warm water and cotton pads.


Dip the cotton into your warm water, close your eyes, and wipe your lash lines. Rinse the pad and repeat three or four times.
If your eyes still sting upon opening them, shut them tight again and rinse a few more times.
Use a clean, dry cotton pad or cotton ball to dry the area and touch up any remaining splotches.

, These dyes typically last for 30 to 45 days. If you like the results, you'll need to repeat the process after a month or two to keep the look going.

Finished.

",How to Curl Your Eyelashes Without an Eyelash Curler1," Use a regular teaspoon-sized spoon, and not a large one. You want it to fit neatly over your eye, so that the curve of the spoon will match the curve of your eyelid.;
, Warming up the metal will create a better curl by transferring heat to your eyelash hairs. It will have a curling iron-like effect on your lashes. Dry the spoon once it's warmed up.

, Position it horizontally and rest it gently against your lid. You want the bottom of the spoon to be against your eyelid, with the bowl of the spoon facing out. Align the edge of the spoon with your upper lash line., Use your finger to press them over the edge of the spoon and into the bowl. Hold them there against the warm metal for thirty seconds.Check out the curl you created. If you want a more defined curl, repeat the process for another thirty seconds. You can also use this method to curl your bottom lashes.
Do the same to the lashes on your other eye. You may need to warm up the spoon again before starting.

, Using either clear or black mascara will help the curl stay in place for the rest of the day.

, Use an eyelash comb to separate and define your lashes. Don't comb too much, or you'll lose the curl.,"

"
Use an appropriate sized wand.,
Do not pump your mascara.,
Discard mascara when it goes bad.",How to Fix Clumpy Mascara3," If you have mascara wands that did not come with the mascara container, avoid using wands bigger than the tube. If you struggle to force the wand into the tube, air will get pushed into the tube. Too much exposure to air causes mascara to dry out and clump., Many people pump the wand to get more mascara on the brush. This pushes more air into the container, causing mascara to dry out faster. Stick to one motion to remove mascara to make it last longer.If you're continuously not getting enough mascara on the brush, and you've had the same tube for awhile, it may be time to get new mascara.

, No matter how well you care for it, mascara will dry out over time. If none of the above methods restore your mascara, you should invest in a fresh tube. Mascara usually lasts around two to three months."

Head back to the salon as needed.",How to Dye Eyelashes2," Find a salon with a beautician who knows about dyeing eyelashes. Discuss your options with him or her and listen to any recommendations the beautician may have about color choice and other related matters.


The procedure is relatively quick and only takes about 20 minutes, but you should still call ahead and make an appointment.
Not every hair stylist at every salon will be able to perform this procedure. The salon needs to have special brow and lash dye on hand since standard hair dye is too harsh. Professional lash dyes are vegetable-based and semi-permanent.
To avoid the risks associated with eyelash dyeing, make sure that you go to a salon that only uses these FDA-approved, semi-permanent vegetable-based tints. A salon that claims to use permanent eyelash dye likely uses a product that has not be deemed safe.

, After the beautician seats you at a work station, he or she should apply petroleum jelly around the perimeter of both eyes. The beautician will also apply a protective pad on the skin below the bottom lashes.The petroleum jelly and protective pads are used to help prevent the dye from staining your skin.

, Unless you are instructed otherwise, close your eyes at the start of the procedure. The beautician will mix the dye and apply it to your lashes as your eyes remain closed.


Avoid opening your eyes as the dye is applied, unless your beautician tells you to do so. Even a trained beautician can accidentally get dye into your eyes if you open them when he or she does not expect it, and the dye will sting your eyes if it gets inside.

, The dye needs to process for seven minutes. At that point, a second coat may or may not be applied. If a second coat is applied, the dye will need to process for another seven minutes after that.

, Wait as the beautician removes the lash pad and cleans the area with wet cotton pads. During this time, the petroleum jelly and the excess wet dye should both be removed.


Typically, the beautician will also give you a saline solution for your eyes. Saline solutions mimic natural tears, and applying the solution to your eyes after this procedure ensures that no dye residue will remain stuck inside the eye.

, Even salon quality eyelash dyes are only semi-permanent. If you want to keep your new look, expect to head back to the salon after four to six weeks.

Evaluate the condition of your natural lashes.If your eyelashes are naturally short and thin, dramatically long or thick extensions won’t last long and may damage them.,
Choose the type and design you want.There are three types of extensions – synthetic, silk and mink.,
Select extensions in several different lengths.,
Buy an eyelash extension kit.,
Consider having the extensions professionally applied the first time.Your lash line and the surrounding area are very sensitive places.",How to Apply Eyelash Extensions1," Before selecting extensions, examine your own lashes. The longer and healthier they are, the more weight they can withstand.


If you’ve never applied extensions before, consider starting with a half set to see how your natural lashes hold up.
You can always add more extensions later if you want a fuller or more exaggerated look.;
, Mink is the most expensive and synthetic is the least. The lengths usually range from 6mm to 17mm.Extensions also come in a variety of thicknesses, curls and colors. Think about what your ultimate goal is before making a choice.


For example, if your goal is to create a natural look, you could select medium length extensions in brown black.
If you are buying extensions as part of a costume, or if you’re going for a unique look, explore different color options and thicknesses.

, Once you’ve settled on a basic length and thickness, choose individual lashes that vary slightly in length. A subtle variation will provide the most natural looking results.Three sizes in a similar length range should be sufficient. The shortest extensions will be used to fill in any gaps in the lash line and keep the overall appearance from looking unnatural and crowded.

, If you plan to apply the extensions yourself, get a kit from a beauty supply store. A kit will include different sized lashes (usually short, medium and long), along with all the tools you’ll need for application – tweezers, adhesive, adhesive remover and an eyelash brush. If you’ve never applied extensions before, buying a kit will make the process a lot easier.


Each kit is different. Read and follow the instructions included with the kit carefully.
Check the ingredients on the adhesive. Make sure it doesn’t have formaldehyde listed as an ingredient.

, Applying eyelash extensions on yourself can be risky, since the adhesive can irritate your skin or damage your natural lashes if not applied properly. If you don’t feel comfortable applying extensions yourself, find a certified professional to do it for you the first time.


After going through the process once, you’ll probably feel more at ease doing it at home.
Start by researching technicians in your area. Make sure they’re licensed and find out how long they’ve been doing this professionally."

Invite a friend over to help you.,
Prepare your natural lashes.,
Cover the area under your bottom lashes with a white adhesive pad.,
Select the length you want to use on the outermost corner of your eye.The extensions come in little bundles of eight or nine individual lashes.,
Place the first extension gently onto your natural lash.Close your eye and move it as little as possible as you place the extension.,
Apply two to three more long extensions to the outermost edges.Work your way inward as you place each piece.,
Place the medium length extensions in between the long ones.To add volume while getting the most natural-looking results, place one medium extension in between each of the long ones.,
Begin placing medium extensions to the middle part of your eyelid.Now that the outermost corners of your eyes are completed, repeat the same process for the middle part.,
Apply the shortest extensions to the inner eyelid area.After completing the middle section, use the short extensions to get as close to your inner eye as possible.,
Allow the extensions to set completely.",How to Apply Eyelash Extensions2," If this is your first time applying extensions, it’s a good idea to have a friend nearby to help you out. The application process requires that you juggle several different tools and, when it comes to actually gluing the extensions on, you need to be completely still. Your eye also needs to be completely shut when you glue it on, and all of this is difficult to do with just two hands.


The application process will go much faster and more smoothly with an assistant.
It will also be a lot safer for you. There is a higher risk of getting adhesive in your eye and other mishaps when you’re working alone.

, For the adhesive to stick properly, your natural lashes must be clean and free of makeup residue. They also need to be completely dry. Start by applying makeup remover to a cotton pad and gently swiping it across both eyes. Remove every trace of makeup around the eye area. Rinse the area with lukewarm water.









Allow your eyelashes to dry before you begin applying the extensions.
Comb your upper lashes with an eyelash brush to smooth and separate them. This brush, which looks like a mascara wand, should come with your extension kit.

, Your extension kit should include some sort of gel pad or tape to help pat down the bottom lashes. This will protect your skin from the adhesive. The adhesive pad also makes it easier to see and work on the individual lashes. When your eyelid is closed, the upper lashes will be against the white color, emphasizing the areas where you’re working.








, Since you’re starting at the outermost corner of your eye, your longest extensions will be used first. Squeeze a dime-sized amount of lash adhesive onto a smooth surface that’s easily accessible for you. Then use the tweezers to grab your first cluster and carefully dip the knotted end in the adhesive.









You only need a tiny amount of glue. If you use too much, the end result will look messy., Slowly drop the synthetic lash onto your natural lash, as close to the base of your eyelashes as possible. The glue should only touch your lash, not your skin. Once the extension is dropped onto your natural lash, you will have about 60 seconds to situate it before the glue sets.









After you do one eye, do the same for the other. You will work back and forth to ensure both eyes look even.
The glue can cause eyelid irritation if it touches your skin. Make sure the glue touches your natural lashes only.

, For the most natural look, the longest extensions will go on the outer edges. Continue until you’ve applied three to four of the longest extensions to the outer third of both eyes. Make sure the extensions aren’t too close together, since you will be filling in between them with shorter pieces.









Use the tweezers to adjust each extension as needed within the first 60 seconds of dropping it.

, Work from the outside corners inward, just as you did before. Be sure to do one eye, then the other. Work back and forth so both eyes look even.









As you work, use the tweezers to periodically push the applied extensions down onto your natural lashes. This will help you keep everything in place.
Take your time. Extension application is not a quick process.

, Use the medium length extensions and place three to four of them on your lashes. Continue to work from the outside in. Cover the middle third of your eyelid on both sides.








, The short ones can be a little harder to work with, so just go in as far as you can. Then use the shortest extensions to fill in any empty spaces you see in the middle sections of both eyes.








, Do not apply any mascara or eye makeup for several hours after application. If possible, try not to touch the extensions at all. Give freshly applied extensions at least 12 to 24 hours before getting them wet. The life of your extensions will vary based on the type and how well they were applied, but they should last anywhere from two to eight weeks.Professionally applied extensions should last through one growth cycle. This varies from person to person, but it’s usually about six to eight weeks.

Comb them out every day.Extensions take daily maintenance to keep them looking their best.,
Avoid applying too much mascara to the extensions.Most people find that mascara isn’t necessary with the extensions, but if you want to give your eyes a little extra pop, apply mascara very carefully to the tips of the extensions only.,
Remove your makeup carefully every night.,
Replace the pieces that come off.The extensions will naturally start to fall off during your normal lash growth cycle.",How to Apply Eyelash Extensions3," Use an eyelash brush or a clean mascara wand to gently brush them out every morning. Try to sleep on your back at night. This will cut down on the amount of time you need to spend every morning combing them out.








, Mascara applied to the base of the extensions usually ends up getting clumpy.


Do not curl your eyelashes before you apply mascara. This can pull the extensions out.
Avoid water-proof mascara completely. It’s too hard to remove.Do not wear oil-based mascara with eyelash extensions, as this can loosen the adhesive.

, Invest in a high quality remover that requires that you rub as little as possible. Use the makeup remover or pre-moistened wipes to completely remove your makeup every day. Avoid oil-based makeup removers, which can loosen the adhesive. Makeup must be removed very gently to avoid pulling off the extensions.








, If you lose any pieces very early on, try to use a bit of mascara to conceal the gaps. A touch up every three to four weeks will keep your extensions looking full and at their best. You can also do maintenance as needed, adding new pieces on as you lose the originals.

Removing the lashes.",How to Apply Individual Eyelashes," Individual lashes can be purchased at most drug stores or makeup counters at department stores. Individual lashes from the drug store sometimes come in kits with a pair of tweezers and eyelash glue. Kits can be helpful for packaging all the needed materials together.


If you decide to only purchase a package of individual lashes, be sure to also buy eyelash glue.
Be sure to purchase lashes that match your natural lash color. Lash colors can come in blonde, brown, and black shades.;
, Before you apply the individual lashes, use makeup remover to take off any lingering makeup on your eyes. There is some debate on whether to apply makeup before or after applying lashes, but more often than not, you want to work on a clean surface and allow the lashes have a sticking surface free of dirt, oil and makeup., On a small square of aluminum foil, pour out a small droplet of lash glue.You don’t need a lot of glue to apply the lashes, but a small drop of glue will make it easier to coat the bottom portion of the lashes.


The color of eyelash glue comes in either black or white.
Buying black glue might be helpful if you are planning on applying heavy makeup, but white glue dries clear and might be the better choice if you are going for a more natural look.

, Before you apply your glued lashes, pluck a lash (or grouping of lashes) from the packaging with your tweezers, and hold the lashes in the spot you want to apply them. This will help you decide where to place the lashes before you add the glue, so they look the most flattering and natural.


Since eyelashes vary in length, individual eyelashes come in a variety of lengths as well. In a lash package there are normally small, medium, and long length lashes.
The smaller lashes are intended for the inside corners of the eyes and filler, while the medium and longer lashes are meant for the middle and outer edges of your eyes.Keep this in mind as you apply the individual lashes.

, Individual lashes can come in single, or a small grouping of 2-5 lashes. However your chosen lashes are packaged, use tweezers to grip near the base of the lash or lashes, and gently pluck it free from the packaging. The base of the lashes should be facing you, while the ends of the lashes should be facing away. Carefully dip only the base of the lashes in the small droplet of glue on the aluminum foil.Always follow the gluing instructions that come on the packaging of lash glue.
The amount of glue should be enough that you are confident the eyelashes won't fall off, but not so much that you’ll have a large glob on your eyelid.
Consider waiting about 15-30 seconds before you apply the lashes to your eyelid. This will help the glue become tackier, allowing it to adhere better on your lid.

, With the help of a mirror, bring the tweezers up to your slightly opened eye, and stick the lashes right above roots of your real eyelashes, starting in the middle of your top eyelid.Once the lash is on your lid, you can use the tweezers to gently “brush” the lash upward, so it mimics the curve of your real lashes, and doesn’t droop down into your line of sight.


Individual lashes can be applied to both the top and bottom lashlines, but false eyelashes look most natural when only applied to the top eyelid.
Some people use their fingers to apply the glued lashes, but it’s really all about personal preference. If it is your first time applying lashes, using tweezers might offer more precision.
If you make a mistake, you can easily remove the lash and try to reposition it before the glue dries. If the glue is very tacky and the lash is already glued into place, wait for the glue to completely dry. This may take about ten minutes. Then use your tweezers to remove the unsatisfactory lash, remove any glue residue, and try to glue the lash on again.

, It is normally easiest to apply lashes to one eye, and then the other. Depending on how thick you want your eyelashes to look, you can apply just a few lashes, or most of the lashes that came with the package. Apply the lashes starting from the middle of your eye, and work your way outward to the corner of your eye.As you move outward, use longer lashes. Then, fill in the inner corner of your eye with the shorter lashes in the package.


Working from the middle of your eye outward will gradually build up the thickness of your lashes.

, After about 10-15 minutes, the lash glue should be completely dry. Use your finger to softly touch the top of your lashes and check for stickiness. Once thoroughly dried, consider using an eyelash curler to gently curl and blend the false eyelashes with your natural eyelashes.Be sure you don’t pinch the curler too hard, as this could dislodge and take off some of the individual lashes.

, Add the rest of your makeup when the individual lashes are completely dry. Apply any eye shadow, and eyeliner you were planning to add to your eyes. Liquid liner looks best with false eyelashes, because it is very effective in hiding glue bumps.Finally, apply mascara to both eyes to blend in the lashes even more.


At this point, your lashes should look long, full, and natural.

, When you are finished wearing your individual lashes for the day, use an oil-based makeup remover to remove the lashes.The oil-based make up remover will soften the lash glue, and then you can start pulling the individual lashes off your lid beginning at the outer corner, and working your way in.

Remove your mascara every night with an eye makeup remover.",How to Apply Mascara," There is a mascara for just about any kind of lash enhancement--curling, volumizing, lengthening, defining, faster growth, waterproof--plus many products that combine these effects. Take a look at your lashes and decide what sort of enhancement they need.


For sparse lashes, look for a thickening or volumizing mascara with a large, round brush with lots of bristles. You can also find a combination primer and mascara formula, which is perfect for bulking up lashes and keeping them healthy.If you have short lashes, look for a lengthening mascara with a smaller brush with thick bristles. A small wand will allow you to get very close to your eye and make sure you coat each lash.If your lashes are full but you want length and definition, choose a lengthening mascara, but one with a long brush with evenly-spaced bristles to separate your lashes.To curl your lashes, try a mascara with a curved brush.For a natural, everyday look, find a mascara with a rubber brush and evenly spaced bristles. Lots of drug store brands have these types of brushes. Waterproof mascara will likely last all day.If your lashes are uneven in length or damaged, check the ingredients on the mascara. Phyto-keratin and panthenol can help your lashes grow. Use a fatter brush on your lashes.You should only use mascara for three months before replacing it, so go ahead and experiment with different brands and formulas until you find your perfect mascara.;
, For the most part, black is the way to go. It gives the illusion of thickness and length and can really make your eyes pop. If your lashes are red or blonde, however, make brown your go-to shade, wearing light brown for everyday and a dark brown to amp up the drama.Experiment with colored mascaras. Green can bring out violet in blue eyes, purple can enhance green eyes, and blue and purple can brighten your complexion., If you're serious about getting knock-out lashes, an eyelash curler is key. This will lift your lashes and allow more light to hit your eyes so they look bigger and brighter.It may not seem like it, but an eyelash curler can make a huge difference.


Look for a curler with a rounded rubber pad, which will help curl your lash instead of bend it at a sharp angle., Apply the curler to the base of your lashes and gently squeeze for about 10 seconds. Then slide the curler to the middle of of your lashes and squeeze for 10 seconds. Finally, curl the tips of your lashes with another 10-second squeeze. This will ensure you have a natural curve instead of lashes that are bent at a harsh angle.If you don't have a curler or you're too afraid to use one, use your fingertips to push up and curl wet lashes., Twisting will allow the brush to pick up the mascara, which is what most people think they are doing when they pump the brush in the tube. What they are actually doing is forcing air into the tube, which dries out the mascara., Too much product can lead to clumping. Giving the wand a little wipe will leave you with just the right amount., You should still be able to see yourself in the mirror out of your peripheral vision.


If you are afraid you are going to blink when you approach your lashes with the wand, open your mouth. It's harder to blink when your mouth is wide open., You want the most product to be applied to the roots, which will make your lashes look longer and keep them from getting weighed down on the tips.The wiggle will also help lift and curl your lashes., The zig-zag adds length and volume, and can reduce clumping., Try to leave it at that--do a third coat at the most. The more you layer on the mascara, the more likely it is the mascara will dry on your lashes and cause the new coat to clump.Mix mascaras if you want--do one layer lengthening, then a layer of thickening on top., A lot of times, people apply mascara only to the very center of their eyelid, which can actually make your eyes look narrower.Make sure you apply to the inner, middle, and outer lashes.


If you are having trouble reaching your inner lashes with your brush, you can very carefully bend the brush to a 90 degree or right angle (don't worry, you can bend it back). This will make it easy to brush those inner lashes without getting mascara all over your face., This will allow you to apply mascara without getting it all over your skin., If you have a very small wand, you'll want to use that. It will be easier to control the application and get close to your eye.If you have brown mascara, consider using that on your lower lashes, even if you used black on your upper lashes. It's not quite as heavy as black and can add some dimension to your look., If you get mascara on your face or eyelid, allow it to dry so you don't smear it and make things worse. Once dry, press the tip of a cotton swab to the spot and spin. This should remove the spot without messing up your eyeshadow., Either use a disposable wand or repurpose an old one (wash it thoroughly with soap and water first). Comb through the top and bottom of the lash, spinning the brush as you sweep forward. This should remove clumps and give your lashes definition.Try to comb through your lashes while the mascara is still wet.
If you don't have an extra wand on hand, try using a clean toothbrush to comb out any clumps., If you don't feel like you're getting the thick, voluminous lashes you want, try this trick. Apply one coat of eyeliner, then dust your lashes with translucent powder or baby powder (you can use a makeup brush or a cotton swab dipped in powder). Then add another coat of mascara.The powder gives the mascara more to cling to, which allows you to build more volume., It might not seem like a big deal, but it can dry out your lashes at night and cause them to become brittle and fall out."

In general, if you favor a more natural look (instead of seeking out mascara that looks like false lashes) and like avoiding infections, cake mascara ought to be something you consider.


Cake mascara has a long history. The fact that it's been around a long time gives it a cute vintage vibe. Because it’s dry and doesn’t sit in a tube, it doesn’t clump up, and you can take it on a plane as a carry-on.Cake mascara is also more hygienic than cream mascara. The dark, wet interior of a mascara tube is a perfect place for bacteria to grow, but cake mascara is dry and doesn't encourage this.There are some drawbacks, too. Cake mascara is difficult to source, has a slight learning curve, and is not as easy to throw in your purse as cream mascara. It’s up to you to decide if the pluses outweigh these minuses.;
, Most mascara you find in drugstores and behind beauty counters is a cream formulation. If you’re having trouble locating cake mascara in a brick-and-mortar store, you may have to Google for shops that will ship the cosmetic to your area.


Sephora started carrying Besame Cosmetics cake mascara online in 2016. This brand is well-recognized, and though it’s pricy, it won’t expire like cream mascara will.
Many smaller indie brands offer cake mascaras, too. Try Clean-Faced Cosmetics or KeepingItNatural.

, Usually, your cake mascara will come with its own brush. It should look sort of like a toothbrush, with stiff bristles lined up along only one side. If your mascara didn’t come with a brush, you can use the brush side of an eyebrow/eyelash comb (like this one) or a cleaned brush from an old tube of cream mascara.

, You can use cake mascara for many other applications other than darkening and lengthening your lashes. It also works to fill in your brows (if you’re dark-haired), and as a stand in for gel liner.If you’d like to make your mascara multitask, you’ll have to have the proper tools.









If you want to use cake mascara to fill in your brows, a small angled brush is great. You can use it to fill in sparse spots, or create an entirely new shape. You can also use a spoolie to comb the powder through your brows, which will make them look more natural.
Small bent or angled brushes are best for eyeliner application.

, This step is optional, but it will open up your eyes and make the final look more striking. For best results, concentrate on the eyelashes in the outer corners of your eyes. Crimp the eyelash curler on the roots for a few seconds, then on the middle of the lash, then finally on the tips.You can heat your eyelash curler by running hot water over it, or turning a blow dryer on it for a few seconds. To make sure it’s not too hot, press it on your wrist before putting it near your eyes.Never curl your lashes after mascara, even cake mascara. The makeup can stick your lashes to the curler’s pads, which will rip them out.

, For a dramatic look, place a drop of water onto the mascara cake. It should sink in, creating a dark paste. If you’d like a subtler look, wet the brush with a bit of water instead.








You can use a drop of contact solution as well. This is sanitary, since saline is sterile, and convenient., A little mascara goes a long way. You want to pick up a bit of pigment on the brush’s bristles, but not too much. If you see clumps or excess makeup on the brush, tap off the extra on the side of the cake and start again.







, Once you have the moistened cake mascara on the brush, the motion for applying it is similar to that of applying cream mascara. Open your eyes and raise the brush to them. Start at the roots of your upper lashes, then slowly pull the brush through them. Wiggle the brush a bit so it coats every lash. Dip the brush back into the cake, then repeat on the other side.









If you find yourself blinking reflexively, open your lips a bit when you put the brush near your eyes. This will inhibit your blinking reflex.Don’t apply cake mascara to your lower lashes. It’s not waterproof, so it runs easily, and makeup that drags the eye down is often unflattering anyway., Cake mascara isn’t gooey like cream mascara, so it won’t clump up on your eyelashes. Therefore, you can keep layering it on to your heart’s content. Try one coat for a subtle look, two coats for a more striking daytime look, and three coats for evening. While you’re at it, go ahead and experiment with the mascara as a liner or filler.








, Use an eyelash comb to ensure that each lash is coated and separated from its neighbor. If you’ve smudged a little extra mascara on your face, don’t worry. The easiest way to remove it is a cotton swab soaked in water, makeup remover, or micellar water.Just check yourself before you go out, and your cake mascara should contribute to a retro, fresh-faced look.

",How to Apply False Eyelashes," Before gluing the lashes on, you will need to make sure they are not too wide for your eye. Hold the lash strips up against your eyelid, and trim them down on the sides if necessary.









If the lashes are too long for your personal taste, consider trimming the individual lashes down to achieve a more natural look. Lashes should be longer toward the outer corner of the eye.;

Use eyeliner to accentuate your eyelashes.,
Apply mascara.,
Curl your lashes.,
Apply fake lashes.,
Get eyelash extensions.",How to Get Longer Lashes1," Use an eyeliner color that's a little darker than your natural eyelash color. The idea is to make it look like there is more hair at the roots of your eyelashes than there actually are. This will create the illusion of thicker eyelashes.


Apply a waterproof eyeliner at the waterline under your eyelashes to add the illusion of length without using up eyelid space. With a small push liner brush, push black shadow into the root of the lashes of the upper eyelid. This will give the illusion of a dark lash line. If you subtly extend the line at the outer corners of your eyes, it will also make your eyelashes look longer.
If you want to try something a little more difficult, consider “tight-lining”. This technique takes a skilled hand and involves applying eyeliner between each individual hair at its base creating a subtle line along the edge of your eyelid.;
, In general, mascara will make your lashes look thicker and longer, as long as you use high quality mascara that doesn't clump. Use a mascara that says “voluminous” on the tube like 'Voluminous Butterfly by Maybeline.









A great way to get the impression of thicker, longer lashes is to work on the base of your lashes, and then slowly work your way up to the tip. Apply a little mascara to an eyeshadow brush and gently brush it onto the roots of your lashes. This creates thickness and your lashes will appear fuller. To make your lashes look really full put on a coat of mascara then use some compressed powder. After that, use another coat of mascara. The powder will make your eye lashes look fuller.
Some mascara brands also carry what's called ""eyelash primer,"" which is usually a white-colored product that you apply exactly like mascara. It is used before the actual mascara to enhance length, conditioning, and color of the mascara (important for people with fair colored lashes).
As an added bonus, some mascaras like Rimmel London have serums designed to help grow eyelashes faster., Flat eyelashes look short, even if they're not, simply because of the angle at which they're seen. An eyelash curler will give your eyelashes some extra bounce, but do it carefully and gently. The last thing you want to do is tug your lashes at the roots and cause them to fall out prematurely.









Start at the base of the lashes. Clamp down at the base for 10 seconds. If you want more of a curl than a sharp bend, squeeze and hold your lash curler in the middle of your eye lashes as well. If you do it too many times, your eye lashes will curl all the way back to your eyelid. This is not a good look for anyone.

, If you look closely at pictures of celebrities, you'll notice that many of them wear fake (albeit skillfully applied) eyelashes. Admittedly, there's a steep learning curve in applying false eyelashes so that they look natural and stay put. Once you get the hang of it, however, your lashes will look dramatically longer.









The first step is to curl your fake eyelashes. You want them to look perfect before you apply them. Trim them with a small pair of scissors. You want them to be even and not too long. You want a natural look. If your fake eyelashes are too long, they’ll look fake. Then take the adhesive that comes with the lashes and place 2 to 3 drops along the bottom strip. Leave there for 5 to 6 seconds before applying. Install from the outside corner of the eye and work your way inwards. Lastly, be sure to blend your natural eyelashes in with the fake ones. This can be accomplished with most mascaras.To remove your fake eyelashes, use the removal serum provided or apply a couple of dabs of petroleum jelly to the edges of the lashes. Wait about 10 seconds and then slowly pull from the edges towards the center. Do not rip off your fake eyelashes. You might accidentally remove your normal eyelashes.

, If you can afford them, professionally applied eyelash extensions are a beautiful, natural-looking way to enhance your lashes. The process usually takes a couple hours and costs around $100 USD, but the extensions will last for months with only occasional touch-ups.If you decide to go this route, know that it will be more difficult to wash your face. You cannot place too much pressure on your lash extensions without causing them to fall out. You’ll have to wash around your eye or use a cotton swab to clean the actual lashes."

Consult a dermatologist.,
See a plastic surgeon.",How to Get Longer Lashes2," Growing eyelashes starts with hygiene. You want to remove grease, dust, or makeup that clogs your eye-lash follicles. Makeup, more than anything else, tends to cause eyelash loss and reduce your eyelid’s ability to regrow lashes.









Remove eye makeup gently and thoroughly before you go to sleep. Letting makeup sit on your eyelashes for extended periods of time isn't good for your eyelashes and will make it more difficult to follow the above steps over time.

, Especially during allergy season, be sure not to rub your eye lids. Use Visine or another allergy medicine to ease irritation and redness. Periodic rubbing can loosen your lashes and cause them to fall out at a higher rate. In addition, this will add more dust, dirt, and other follicle clogging matter to your eye lids necessitating additional cleaning. If you want to massage your eyelids, this is ok, but be sure your hands are clean first and then try not to rub too vigorously.








, Apply a thin coat of olive oil, caster oil, coconut oil, or vaseline (petroleum jelly) to your lashes before you go to bed at night.Oils and commercial products such as DiorShow Maximizer will measurably increase the volume, length, and curvature of your lashes with regular use.









Dip a clean, mascara-free wand (or a Q-tip) in the oil and gently brush your eyelashes from the base to the tip. If you like, try warming up the oil before use. Make sure that it is slightly above room temperature and not excessively hot. If the oil is too hot, you could scald yourself.
After you apply the oil to your lashes, lightly pat them with a tissue or cloth to remove excess oil. Leave on for a couple of hours or overnight depending on how dry your lashes are. Do this every couple of weeks. If you do it too frequently, you may clog your follicles with oil., If you decide that oils are not your cup of tea, then why not try putting green tea on your lashes before bed. Take a cotton swab, dip it in some green tea, and then cover your lashes with it. In the morning, wash thoroughly. Do this for 2 weeks, every night, for noticeable results.








, Vaseline Jelly has been a mainstay of the home beauty toolbox for decades. Apply the petroleum jelly just before bed and wash it off in the morning. If you aren’t a fan of the petroleum variety, Vaseline also makes a non-petroleum jelly mix — found at Whole Foods.







, A healthy diet is key. Focus on eating foods rich in protein and vitamins. Foods like fish, eggs, beans, soy protein, and yogurt will help your eyelashes grow.Salmon is a great source of omega 3 fatty acids, which helps to grow strong nails, shiny hair, and long eyelashes. A lot of women also take a vitamin B complex known as Biotin for longer and healthier eyelashes and hair.

, They may prescribe Latisse, the only FDA approved eyelash growth medication.The only reported side effects are eye irritation, general redness, and itchiness. Most of the time, a dermatologist will only prescribe Latisse for those whose short or non-existent eyelashes are considered a health hazard. Remember that your eyelashes' primary purpose is to keep dirt and other foreign materials out of your eyes.


Over the counter solutions are available and might be prescribed by a dermatologist. Many of these over the counter solutions actually work just as well as Latisse for a fraction of the price. These include products such as Rapidlash, Revitalize, and Prolash.

, This is the most extreme method used to get longer eyelashes.Plastic surgeons can transplant hair follicles from your scalp to your eye lids. While this will give you longer eyelashes, recovery is incredibly painful and can impair your vision for several weeks. Since the hair follicle is different than normal eyelash follicle, some patients report needing to trim their eyelashes after their surgery. "

Use an eye make-up remover.,
Use baby shampoo.,
Apply cold cream.,
Avoid using petroleum jelly.",How to Remove Waterproof Mascara1," There are many products on the market that are specifically designed to remove waterproof mascara. A good waterproof eye make-up remover will remove all vestiges of mascara quickly, safely and effectively. If you wear waterproof mascara a lot, investing in a good remover is definitely worth it.


Always use hypoallergenic products, even if your skin is not sensitive. The ingredients in hypoallergenic products tend to be less harmful to your skin.
Go for a well-known brand such as Lancôme, Clarins, Elizabeth Arden, etc. The quality will be higher, and thus less likely to irritate your eyes.;
, Baby shampoo can be effective in the removal of waterproof mascara. Baby shampoos are usually fairly safe to use around the sensitive eye area, as most brands are color and fragrance free, and are hypoallergenic.


Use only a very small amount of baby shampoo and apply it onto your eyelashes. Avoid getting any baby shampoo directly in your eyes.
Never use regular shampoo, as it will irritate your eyes.

, Use a brand like Pond’s Cold Cream to remove any stubborn makeup, like waterproof mascara. Cold cream is also good for removing an entire face of makeup.








Wash your face with your regular cleanser, pat it dry and then apply the cold cream as a deep conditioning treatment.
Let the cream soak into your skin for a few minutes before wiping it clean with a warm washcloth.

, As petroleum jelly is a gasoline by-product, it is not the ideal substance to use around the eye area.Use it only as a last resort and avoid getting it directly in your eyes.

Remove your eye makeup with olive oil.,
Use coconut oil.,
Make a solution of water, witch hazel and almond or jojoba oil.",How to Remove Waterproof Mascara2," Since the mascara is waterproof, use the opposite of water: oil. Oil breaks down the waterproof properties in your mascara, helping it slide off your lashes with minimal scrubbing and wiping.Pour olive oil on your fingers and rub your eyelashes with your index finger and thumb until your lashes are coated with oil. The mascara should then come off easily., Coconut oil does a great job of breaking down your mascara and leaves the delicate skin around your eyes hydrated, too.Put a dab of coconut oil on a cotton ball and gently sweep it over your eyes.

, This solution has a shelf life of 6 months and will not sting or irritate your eyes.Combine 2 tablespoons witch hazel, 2 tablespoons of jojoba oil or almond oil, and 2 tablespoons water in a clean container or dispenser.
Shake up the solution to ensure it is properly combined. Wipe the solution on your eyes with clean fingers, or apply it to a cotton ball or makeup pad to remove the makeup.

Use cotton balls, makeup pads or q-tips to remove the mascara.,
Close your eye and position the cotton ball on the bottom side of your lashes.,
Hold the cotton ball against your lashes for about 10-20 seconds.,
Slowly move the cotton ball along the length of your lashes.,
Check your progress in the mirror.,
Use q-tips to remove mascara from the base of your eyelashes.,

",How to Remove Waterproof Mascara3," When removing waterproof mascara, it is important to use the right materials in order to remove all of the product and to prevent the eye area from becoming irritated.


You can also use hypoallergenic baby wipes, or a clean, damp face cloth.

, This should be the side where you’ve applied the mascara.









Once the cotton ball is underneath your lashes, apply gentle pressure so that the underside of your lashes are pressed against the cotton ball.
Always remove the mascara carefully and gently. If you rub too hard, you will end up pulling out some of your eyelashes and irritating the skin around your eyes. You also risk getting product in your eyes, which could lead to an eye infection.

, Doing this allows the makeup remover to start dissolving the mascara.

, Minimize tugging by always “wiping” your lashes in the same direction.








, If you still have quite a bit of mascara on your lashes or if your mascara is being stubborn about coming off, continue to gently wipe the undersides of your lashes with the cotton ball.








, Dip a Q-Tip into the makeup remover and use it to gently “scrub” the roots of your lashes to get out any remaining mascara.








, Now that your eyes are makeup free, use a gentle face cleanser to remove any last traces of makeup and any oily residue that may be left behind by your makeup remover.









Be sure to rinse your face well with plenty of lukewarm water.

, After washing, make sure to apply an eye-cream or all-over facial moisturizer, as makeup remover can dry out your skin.

Consider false lashes.,
Apply the false lashes properly.,
Curl your lashes.,
Add eyeliner to the base and underside of your top lashline.",How to Lengthen Eyelashes Without Mascara1," The most common way to lengthen your lashes without mascara is to apply false eyelashes. You can find false lashes in full strips that fit your entire lashline or individual clusters that you can place exactly where you want extra length.Full strip false lashes offer the most dramatic look, so they work best if you want major length for your lashes.
Individual lashes work best if you want a more natural, subtle look.
You may need to cut or trim strip lashes to fit your eye shape. Always test a pair before trying to put them on.;
, To secure the lashes to your lid, apply lash glue to the false lash band or cluster. Let the glue sit for 30 seconds to 1 minute so it dries and becomes slightly tacky. Set the lashes just above your natural lash line starting at the outer corner and pressing inward to secure them.When you’re applying your lashes, it helps to set your mirror below you and tilt your chin downward so you can place the lashes at the right angle.
After you’ve applied the lashes to your eye, let them sit for another 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure that the glue has bonded with your skin.
To remove the lashes at the end of the day, simply peel up one of the edges and gently pull the lashes off. You may need to use eye makeup remover to take off any glue residue that may be on your lashes or skin.

, When your lashes are perfectly straight, they tend to look shorter and more sparse. Curling them helps lift the lashes so they have a longer appearance. Use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes along their entire length for the longest look.You can purchase an eyelash curler at drugstores, beauty supply stores, or any store that sells cosmetics.
Start with the eyelash curler at the base of your lashes, and hold it closed for approximately 3 seconds. Next, move the curler to the center of your lashes and hold it closed for another 3 seconds. Finally, place the curler at the end of your lashes and hold it closed for a final 3 seconds.
If you don’t have an eyelash curler, you can use a clean toothbrush to help curl your lashes. Run the brush under hot water and then dry it lightly with a clean towel. Next, run the brush through your lashes, starting at the base and holding it at the tips for several seconds to create the curl., If you want to skip mascara, using eyeliner strategically can help make your lashes appear longer. Instead of applying the liner to your lid, trace it right along the base of your lashes. Next, gently pull up on your eyelid to expose the underside of your lashline, also known as the tightline, and apply liner there as well to make your lashes appear thicker and longer.Use a dark eyeliner so it blends in with your lashes. Black is usually the best option, but if your lashes are light, you may prefer a brown liner.
For the liner at the base of your lashes, you can use pencil, powder, liquid, or cream eyeliner. For the tightline, use a pencil or cream liner.

Get plenty of sleep.,
Eat the proper foods your skin needs to thrive.,
Drink a lot of water.,
Reflect beauty from within with a smile.",How to Have a Pretty Face1," It is very important for your overall health to get at least eight to nine hours of sleep every night. A lack of adequate sleep will translate through your face with dull skin and dark circles under your eyes. Also, once you miss a night of sleep, you cannot make it up later by over sleeping because the damage is already done. In order to keep your skin looking fresh and bright, create a regular bedtime schedule.


Plan your sleep schedule accordingly so you can fit in the recommended amount of sleep every night.;
, By following the FDA regulated food pyramid, you are setting yourself up for a healthy inside as well as a healthy, glowing outside. What you decide to put into your body reflects on the outside through your skin and face. Our skin gets its nourishment from the vitamins and minerals in the foods we eat so be sure to eat fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins, which are especially essential to our skin because it is what our skin is made up of.


Proper nutrition will help your skin steer clear of acne and pimples, whereas too much sugar can cause your skin to breakout.

, Water helps cure many problems associated with skin. It clears breakouts, creates more vibrant skin, softens and hydrates skin and helps even out skin tone. The minimum amount of water recommended per day is eight glasses, but if you can, drink even more. This is a vital step towards having a pretty face.Always carry water by your side throughout the day. This will encourage you to drink more water.
Water helps skin become supple and promotes healthy cell rejuvenation.

, A smile is one of the best ways to achieve a pretty face. The first thing people see is your face and the first thing they notice is your expression. Let everyone see your inner beauty by wearing a smile on your face as much as possible and laughing often.


When you greet someone or are having a conversation, flash them a smile to show them you are confident and happy.
Happiness radiates, and often a person's personality will come through as physical attractiveness to others.

Get eyelash extensions.,
Have your lashes permed.,
Tint your lashes.",How to Lengthen Eyelashes Without Mascara2," If you want to lengthen your lashes without mascara for more than just a day, lash extensions are an ideal option. At a salon or other venue that offers beauty services, you can have individual lashes bonded to the tips of your natural lashes with medical-grade adhesive. Lash extensions usually last 4 to 6 weeks.When you’re wearing lash extensions, it’s important to be careful when touching your eyes, such as rubbing them when they’re itchy or washing your face at the end of the night. If you’re too rough, you may loosen the adhesive.
Lash extensions can be fairly costly, so they’re not the best option if you’re on a budget.
Some people experience an allergic reaction to the adhesive used to attach the extensions. Ask the esthetician to a patch test with the adhesive on your skin before applying the extensions.
Getting lash extensions too frequently can lead to breakage for your natural lashes, so it’s best to just get them when you have special events coming up.

, If you’re tired of curling your lashes with an eyelash curler to make them appear longer, you may want to consider an eyelash perm. Just as with traditional hair perms, chemicals are applied to your lashes which are then wrapped around foam rollers to curl them. Your lashes will remain curled for 1 to 3 months.Lash perming must be done by a trained professional.
Because lash perming utilizes chemicals, there is the possibility that your eyes and the skin around them may become irritated afterward. Leaving the perm solution on too long can also cause your lashes to break or fall out. Make sure to visit a reputable salon where the esthetician has experience performing lash perms.

, If you have light colored lashes, they probably look shorter than they actually are. Instead of using mascara, though, you can darken your lashes to help lengthen their appearance by having them tinted with a vegetable-based dye. Visit a trained esthetician to have your lashes tinted, and the results will typically last 4 to 6 weeks.As with any type of lash treatment, there is the possibility of an allergic reaction when you have your lashes tinted. Ask the esthetician to do a patch test on your skin before using the dye to ensure that you aren’t allergic to the dye’s ingredients.
Just as with lash extensions or perms, it’s important to visit a reputable salon with trained professionals to have your lashes tinted.

Use a lash growth serum.,
Condition your lashes with oil.,
Take biotin supplements.",How to Lengthen Eyelashes Without Mascara3," If you don’t want to bother with mascara ever again, you may want to invest in an eyelash growth serum. These products use peptides and other ingredients to help extend the growth phase of the lashes. However, prescription treatments are typically the only ones that work. Over-the-counter formulas usually just contain conditioning ingredients that may not necessarily help with growth. See a dermatologist to talk about your options.You won’t see overnight results from a lash growth serum. It may take 2 to 6 months to see any results.
In order to see results, you must apply the serum nightly. It’s also important to apply the serum right at the lashline. The hairs that make up the lashes are already dead, so applying it to them won’t make any difference.
Be aware that there are possible side effects associated with prescription lash growth serum. It has been known to discolor both the the lid and iris of the eye.

, Lashes may break and fall off if they’re not properly moisturized and conditioned. Natural oils, such as olive, coconut, castor, and jojoba, are believed to help moisturize and strengthen your lashes so they can grow longer. Apply some to your lashes every night as part of your skin care routine.When using a oil to condition your lashes for added length, consistency and patience are key. You won’t see results overnight. Condition your lashes every night, and give your lashes at least 2 to 3 months to respond.
To apply the oil to your lashes, you can dab a small amount on your fingertips and run them over your lashes. However, to ensure that all of your lashes are coated, it’s better to dip a clean spoolie into the oil and then run it through your lashes like you would with mascara.
Petroleum jelly can also work well as a lash conditioner to help your lashes grow longer. You can apply it to your lashes in the same way that you would an oil.

, Biotin is a vitamin that is thought to help strengthen weak, brittle hair, so it is often suggested for hair health. Taking a biotin supplement daily may help your lashes grow longer and thicker, but it can take several months to see any results.Biotin is water-soluble, so it passes out of your system fairly quickly. That means it’s unlikely that you could take too much of it. However, you should always speak to your doctor before starting any supplements to ensure that they’re safe for you to take with your other medications and to determine the proper dosage.
If you don’t want to take biotin supplements, you can incorporate certain foods in your diet that are high in the vitamin. Almonds, pecans, bananas, egg yolks, and whole grains all contain biotin.

After you take a shower, it's a good idea for males and females to apply lotion -- it will keep your skin soft and supple.;
, Make sure your hair stays clean and not greasy. Shampoo strips your hair of sebum, your natural, necessary oil.Even so, you should make sure that your hair smells fresh, feels clean, and is free of dandruff.


You can easily buy shampoos or conditioners created for your specific hair type. Check the descriptions on the bottle and try several brands to see which works best for your hair.
Don't overuse heat products or hairspray because it can damage your hair and make it very dry and difficult to manage.

, Toothpaste, a toothbrush, mouthwash, floss, and a visit to your dentist should do the trick. Brush your teeth and tongue regularly to prevent bad breath and cavities.


Replace your toothbrush every three months to make sure you are actually cleaning your teeth instead of rubbing them with a filthy old brush., If you shower regularly, this shouldn't be too much of a concern. However, always use deodorant or antiperspirant.


You may want to try foot powder to combat sweaty foot odors.
If you choose to use cologne or perfume, use it as an accent - don't try to mask an odor with these products. Remember to use a very light touch with these products in order to keep the smell from becoming overwhelming. Be aware that some people have allergies. If you can smell it from more that three or four feet away, then you are wearing too much.

, This can be a challenge for men and women alike.


If you're a guy, shave daily. If you have a mustache, make sure no hair is covering your lip, and never let it get bushy. If you're going to have facial hair, always make sure it is kept short and neatly groomed. You may need to get electric clippers to keep everything trimmed.
Wax that upper lip. Some women get a little fuzz too. A little bit above the mouth is not that uncommon. Waxing the hairs is a good way to remove the hairs, or you can bleach them to make them less noticeable.Pluck your eyebrows. Two eyebrows are better than one. Men and women alike can benefit from some attention to the eyebrows. Get a pair of tweezers and pull out those pesky facial hairs.

Keep your skin clean.,
Practice weekly exfoliation treatments for beautiful skin.,
Use baking soda to exfoliate for extra soft skin.,
Stop touching and tugging at your face.,
Be consistent with face moisturizer.,
Wear sunscreen every day.",How to Have a Pretty Face2," When your skin isn't properly washed, it becomes clogged, patchy and develops dark spots. Always remove blackheads, dirt, and oil to maintain clean skin. Your skin is the foundation of a pretty face, so it is important to take great care of it.








Use a cream cleanser that suits your skin type and is for daily use. Get in the habit of washing your face every morning and every night.

, Exfoliation removes dry, dead skin cells that keep your face looking dull and uneven. Dead skin cells don't reflect light like fresh skin does, leaving you without a healthy shine. Whether you use a scrub cleanser, mask, or wash cloth, be sure to consistently exfoliate.









Be gentle when exfoliating by applying light pressure and using circular motions. Also, always stop when your skin starts to feel uncomfortable.
It is best to limit exfoliation to once a week, especially if you have sensitive skin.

, When you mix baking soda with warm water, you will create a great exfoliating treatment that is safe and gentle on your skin. All you do is mix equal parts of baking soda and water and rub it on your face using circular motions. Keep massaging for about one minute and then wash it off with warm water.Finish the process with a great face moisturizer to hydrate you skin. Skin can become dry after you cleanse or exfoliate it, so be sure to replace any moisture lost back into your skin.

, There are certain times when it is impossible not to touch your face, but it is important to limit how much contact actually happens. Every time you put your chin in your palm, pop a pimple, or even rub your tired eyes after a long day, you are damaging your skin. Our hands clog our pores with dirt and oil and all of those rubs and tugs create fine lines, wrinkles, and micro tears on our faces.

, No matter what your skin type is, you should be using a facial moisturizer to hydrate and nourish your skin. When choosing the best face lotion, find products with all natural ingredients that are oil free. This will give your skin the benefits of essential botanicals like aloe vera, but it won't clog your pores.








Use a hydrating lotion within two minutes after getting out of the shower or bath because the skin becomes porous and better absorbs lotion.
When applying, be gentle and make sure you rub the lotion in completely. Don't forget to use the lotion on your neck too.
Dry winters, air conditioners, makeup, and wind can all lead to dry skin, so make sure you replenish your face with moisturizer everyday.

, If you leave your skin exposed and unprotected for too long, it can cause irreversible damage because of the UV rays that come from the sun. The sun causes wrinkles, dark spots, and skin cancer that will slowly develop over time. An easy way to wear sunscreen every day is to buy a face lotion that also has sunscreen in it. Look for lightweight lotions that use natural ingredients.


Lotions that contain sunscreen are easy to wear underneath your regular makeup and will give you the protection you need.

Experiment with face contouring.,
Wear mascara to open up your eyes.,
Try shaping your eyebrows into a flattering arch.",How to Have a Pretty Face3," Certain foundations and bronzers can be very thick, causing dry skin and clogged pores. These products can also use unnatural ingredients that tamper with skin's natural chemical balances, causing uneven complexions.









The best method to create an even skin tone with makeup is by using a lightweight tinted moisturizer. It will give you the natural looking coverage you crave and also hydrate your skin.
Remember to always wash your face at night and remove all traces of makeup to keep skin clean and clear.

, Finding the right color blush for your skin type can be very flattering. It adds a healthy flush to your skin and helps the apples of your cheeks stand out.

Find the apples of your cheeks by smiling in the mirror and applying the blush to the roundest part of your cheeks. Only add enough to give you a healthy glow.
If you have cool toned skin, try using a pink or cranberry colored blush. For warm toned skin, peach and red colored blushes will look best on you.

, The skin underneath your eyes is very thin and sensitive, and this often leads to dark circles that can make you look tired. To help them blend in with your regular skin tone, lightly apply an under eye concealer to disguise discoloration. These concealers contain green undertones that help cancel out the purple hues underneath your eyes.








Rub your finger in the eye concealer and dab it under your eyes. Always start from the outside corner of your eye and work your way in to prevent wrinkles.
Never rub the skin under your eye when applying. This will also lead to wrinkles and broken capillaries, which causes even darker circles.

, You can play up or play down certain features on your face with a brush, a brown bronzer and a makeup highlighter. Contouring can help your cheekbones stand out, redefine your jawline, or even make your nose look smaller. Contouring can be tricky at first, so to help you along, try watching a makeup tutorial to get you started.








Makeup highlighters are used to bring attention to features that you want people to focus on such as your cheekbones or jawline.
Bronzers help to shape under your cheekbones to slim down a face.

Begin with a brush that has lightly been brushed into bronzer. Dust off the extra bronzer and start by applying the brush at your temples and working your way down to your cheekbones using circular motions.
Keep going until you reach the middle of your jawline and then stop. This is an easy step to give you beautiful cheeks.



, Black mascara is flattering on everyone and is easy to apply. It pumps up thin lashes and helps lengthen short ones. For a softer look, you can try using a brown mascara.









After you apply mascara, curl your lashes with an eyelash curler that will open your eyes up even more.

, Well groomed eyebrows will enhance your natural cheek and eye curvature, which brings out beauty and femininity. Head to a saloon so that a professional can wax your eyebrows to give you the best shape for your face.









You don't want to pluck your eyebrows too thin or too short. Keep the natural lines of your eyebrows to help create definition in your face.
If you need to add to your eyebrows, purchase an eyebrow pencil that will fill in or darken areas on your brow to give a fuller look.

Coordinate your outfits.,
Wear clothes that fit well.,
Don't wear old, faded clothing.","How to Have a Neat, Clean Cut Appearance2"," Some clothes like jeans can be worn several times before washing, but wash your undergarments and socks after each use. If you are wearing clothes more than once, check for any dirt or stains on them before going out of the house. Don't wear wrinkled clothes or anything covered in pet hair.


If you have a pet, keep a lint roller handy. It will pick up pet hair, bits of fuzz, and anything else that sticks to your clothes.

, While you might not have a big clothing budget, you can still match the clothes you have. Put a little more energy into putting an outfit together, then take a minute in front of the mirror to see how you look.


Do not mix styles. Don't wear sweatpants with your blouse or dress shirt. Avoid wearing white socks with your dress shoes.
Avoid wearing colors that clash. Avoid pairing colors with different intensity or undertone. Colors have different properties that will determine if they are complementary to the eye or if they clash.You can use color wheels to help learn to identify various color properties, or simply wear a lot of neutral colors that can make it easy to coordinate with your colored clothing.

, Avoid anything that is too baggy or too tight. Pants shouldn't be drooping down so low that your underwear is showing. Likewise, clothing that is too tight can be seen as too revealing or sexual. Find a size that fits you comfortably.


Wearing a belt or suspenders can help keep your pants where you want them to be.
Make sure any clothes that button up, like shirts and blazers, don't pull or gap across your chest or stomach.

, Avoid any outfits with holes in the fabric and clothes that went out of style ten years ago. When clothes start to seem stretched out or don't quite fit you anymore, it's a good idea to get rid of them and pick out some new clothes. Even if you don't have a big budget, a few new items like a nice pair of new pants and a couple neutral color shirts can go a long way to work with the rest of your wardrobe.


If your closet's full of things you never wear, but they're in pretty good shape, you can donate them to a charity shop. Don't donate things that are worn out (and don't donate undergarments at all).

, If you carry a briefcase or purse, make sure your papers and materials are all in order. If you have crumpled papers, candy wrappers or old receipts falling out of your bags, you will look messy and disorganized.


Keep your bag looking neat outside as well as inside. If it's made of fabric, wash it every so often. If it's leather, keep it polished.

, A person with poor posture is perceived as unhealthy, tired, and possibly unable to function at work.Standing and sitting up straight will make you look better and feel better. It may seem unnatural at first, but it will come to be second nature. This is an excellent habit. It increases body circulation and helps you think more clearly, as well.


Focus on proper body alignment to improve your posture.Feet should be flat on the floor with toes forward. Line your hips vertically above your knees, the center of the rib cage aligned with your hips, shoulders aligned with the center your ribs, and your ears should be aligned with your shoulders. When sitting, you should stay forward on the chair so your spine supports your weight instead of the back of the chair.

, Smile and make yourself approachable.You will be amazed at the effect your smile can have on other. Smiling will make you feel better about yourself and can make you seem more approachable and trustworthy to others.


Avoid crossing your arms or making nervous gestures that can give a negative impression.
Make good eye contact when having a conversation. Show that you are focused and attentive.

, If you have freckles, love them! Freckles make you look sun-kissed. But if you don't like them, use sunscreen or try washing your face with lemon juice.


Get rid of all acne by washing your face twice everyday and giving yourself a facial once in a while. Keep your face soft by using an oil-free moisturizer.







, You don't need a lot, but you should get a tinted moisturizer (works as a foundation), concealer, blush, bronzer, lipgloss and mascara. These items will really make a difference in your look.

, For fingernails, give yourself a manicure every two weeks by soaking, cleaning, cutting, and filing them, and then either apply nail polish or leave them plain.


A french manicure always looks good on fingernails. For toenails, do the same thing except make sure you paint them a color, which always looks better.
Keep your hands and feet soft by applying lotion too.







, Shop 'til you drop! Get some cute items and make sure your style is neat, tidy, and it can really affect your summer makeover!

Be confident.,
Be compassionate.,
Be happy.",How to Have a Major  Makeover During the Summer2," One of the most important way to change your attitude and become a better, more popular person is to have confidence in yourself.


Confidence is so important -- it allows you to get involved with things at school, make new friends and take more risks. It makes you feel good about yourself and reminds you that your opinion matters and your voice should be heard.
However, gaining confidence is not the easiest thing in the world if you're a naturally shy person -- so fake it til you make it! Push yourself to get out there more and soon the confidence will come.
Giving your appearance a makeover (like in the section above) will also help you to feel good about yourself and gain confidence.

, Being compassionate for others is another important attitude trait, especially in school where it can be easy to get carried away and unintentionally hurt another person's feelings.


Make an effort to think about what you're about to say before you open your mouth. Try to imagine being in the other person's place and how you would you feel if someone said something unkind or inconsiderate to you?
However, being compassionate extends beyond words -- you should also be compassionate in your actions. If someone's sitting alone at lunch, ask them to join your group. If someone drops their books in the hallway, help them to pick them up. Treat others as you would like to be treated.







, No one wants to be around a sad, lonely person, so brighten up a bit and you'll find it much easier to make new friends!


Try to smile more -- studies have shown that smiling makes you both more attractive and more approachable to other people -- so flash those pearly whites. The more you smile, the more you'll see people smiling back at you.
Try to get involved in things you enjoy and that will make you feel happier overall. Join a karate club, take an acting class or do some volunteer work -- whatever floats your boat. You'll feel much happier and fulfilled as a result, and other people will notice

",How to Get a Beautiful Complexion," Some studies indicate that a balanced, vitamin-rich diet that is low in processed carbohydrates, fats, and sugars can help promote a healthy complexion.Avoid crash or fad diets.Stay away from sugary drinks or junk foods. Instead look for foods that are rich in fiber, water content, protein, healthy fats, antioxidants, and vitamins. These foods are essential to overall health as well as skin health.Such foods include:


Almonds
Avocadoes
Berries
Dark, leafy greens
Fish
Tomatoes
Broccoli;
, Dehydration can make your skin look and feel dry and saggy. Be sure that you drink at least 8 glasses of water each day. Steer clear of drinking too much alcohol or caffeine: these can dehydrate you and your skin., Sleeping on your side or stomach can lead to the development of lines and wrinkles over time. If you sleep on your back, you will avoid putting consistent pressure on your face, minimizing skin damage over the long term., Sun damage and sunburn is bad for your health and for your complexion. Always wear sunscreen, even if you are not planning on being outdoors for long. Look for an SPF 15 sunscreen or higher. Reapply as necessary throughout the day.Use at least 1 oz. of sunscreen, and don't forget your feet, hands, and ears. Take special care to apply sunscreen when you are near water or other substances that reflect the sun such as snow or sand.


If your skin is prone to acne or blemishes, look for a noncomedogenic (or non-oil based) sunscreen to minimize the clogging of your pores., The sun is at its strongest and most damaging between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Take care not to be exposed to the sun during these times. If you must be outside, make sure you are wearing sunscreen, protective clothing (such as a hat and sunglasses), and stick to the shade as much as possible., Beauty rest is not a myth: it is a fact.The more you sleep, the more your skin will be able to repair itself and look more youthful. Sleeplessness can cause your skin to appear patchy, baggy, or uneven in skin tone. Be sure that you get at least 8 hours of sleep each night to ensure that your skin looks youthful and rejuvenated.

, It has been known for a long time that regular exercise can help improve overall appearance by increasing muscle tone, which makes your skin seem more elastic and youthful. However, recent studies show that exercise might also make your skin healthier and younger.Exercise also increases blood flow to your skin, which helps nutrients reach your skin cells. Be sure that you engage in at least 20 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 times per week. Try running, biking, or swimming.


If you choose to exercise outdoors, be sure that you are protecting your skin from the sun.Wear athletic clothing that wicks moisture to prevent skin irritation, rashes, or blemishes.Wash your athletic clothing and towels after each use to prevent skin conditions common to athletes such as athlete's foot, fungus, or infection., Smoking makes your skin less elastic, leading to more wrinkles. Smoking also harms your blood vessels, meaning your skin is deprived of key nutrients it needs to repair itself. Many smokers also get unsightly wrinkles around their mouths from where they purse their lips. Quit smoking in order to allow your skin to repair itself, and to encourage your complexion to be as youthful and healthy as possible., Stress can lead to acne breakouts, sleeplessness, and other skin-damaging behaviors. Minimize stress in your life in order the minimize stress on your complexion.Try deep breathing techniques, meditation, or visualization exercises to keep yourself calm. Exercise is another great way to keep yourself relaxed.

, Wash your face every morning and every evening before bed to keep your skin clean and healthy. You should also wash your face after exercise or excessive sweating. Do not wash your face more than that, since that can strip your face of key oils and damage healthy skin cells.Be sure that you use warm or lukewarm water when you wash: hot water can dry out and damage your skin.Only use your hands and fingers to wash: do not use scratchy cloths, loofahs, or sponges.If you wear makeup, it is essential that you remove all products before bed. Leaving makeup on overnight can clog your pores and encourage the spread of unhealthy bacteria on your face., Harsh cleansers and perfumes might dry out your skin. These products are also more likely to irritate sensitive skins.Avoid products with alcohol in them, since that is a drying agent. And if you have oily skin, look for products that are noncomedogenic (or water-based instead of oil-based). Look for unscented products that are suitable for sensitive skins.

, Do not rub your skin after washing. Patting or blotting yourself dry will help keep your skin moisturized and healthy. Use soft towels--not harsh or scratchy cloths--to dry yourself., It might seem counterintuitive, but moisturizing is necessary in order to prevent skin blemishes and conditions. When your skin is too dry, it actually increases your skin's oil production. By keeping your skin properly moisturized, you avoid the overproduction of oils that cause blemishes.A moisturizer can also help minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, though a moisturizer cannot prevent these lines from occurring.Look for a noncomedogenic moisturizer if you are prone to oily skin.By purchasing a moisturizer with SPF 15 or higher, you can kill two birds with one stone.Moisturizer is most effective when used on damp skin, fresh from washing or showering., Many skin types benefit from exfoliating creams and scrubs. When you exfoliate, you are removing dead skin cells that clog pores and cause blemishes. Exfoliating can make your skin look and feel softer, younger, and healthier.However, exfoliating can also be harsh on those with sensitive or dry skin, and exfoliation is harmful to those with acne. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist to determine whether exfoliation might help or harm your skin.Other conditions that can be exacerbated by exfoliation include rosacea and eczema. If you have these conditions, talk to a dermatologist about your skin care options.

, Facial scrubs that exfoliate often have microbeads or small pieces of fruit pit or nut shell that can reach into your pores to clear out dead skin cells and oils. There are different kinds of exfoliating scrub for different skin types.In general, scrubs made with plastic microbeads are better for those with sensitive or dry skin. Scrubs made with fruit pit or nut shell are better for those with very oily skin that is not sensitive.Most people are better off using exfoliating scrubs that have a low acid concentration. Read the labels of all the products you buy, and ensure that the concentration of salicylic acid are lower than 2% and that the concentration of glycolic acid is less than 10%., Using warm--not hot--water, gently wet your face. Then apply the exfoliating scrub with your fingers and gently rub your skin for 60 seconds or so. Then rinse your face completely. Resist the temptation to over-scrub or to leave the scrub on your skin for more than a minute or so: a gentle touch is necessary to get the maximum benefit from an exfoliating scrub.

, Regular exfoliation will keep your dead skin cells from mixing with oil and dirt and clogging your pores.However, over-scrubbing and exfoliating too often can dry out and harm your skin, leading to even more blemishes and clogged pores. Be sure that you limit your exfoliation to just 1-2 times per week to ensure that you benefit from exfoliation without harming your complexion., Many anti-aging treatments can work to minimize the appearance of wrinkles or age spots. However, there is no miracle cure for aging, and most anti-aging treatments are only temporary, cosmetic fixes.Still, if you wish to have skin that looks more youthful, there are many products and treatments on the market that may give you a fresher, less wrinkled appearance., Because anti-aging creams are considered to be cosmetics and not medicine, they have not been as thoroughly tested as most prescription products. However, there are certain ingredients that can promote a more youthful complexion.Be on the lookout for products that contain:Retinol
Vitamin C
Niacinamide
Coenzyme Q10
Hydroxy Acids
Anti-inflammatories such as tea extracts and grape seed extract

, Many anti-aging treatments include petroleum jelly or sulfates. While these ingredients might have a small effect on the appearance of wrinkles, they also can lead to blemishes or dried-out skin. Avoid these ingredients if you want to benefit fully from an anti-aging cream., Do not pick at them.Picking at a pimple can lead to infection, scarring, or the spread of pimple-causing bacteria.If you want a beautiful complexion, you have to be willing to let your pimples clear up over time.

, Using warm water and a gentle cleanser, wash any acne-prone areas every morning and evening.Resist the urge to use hot water or to scrub harshly: a gentle touch is needed in order to see an improvement.


Shampooing every day or keeping your hair tied back can also help reduce the amount of oil that spreads from your hair to your face., Certain environments and professions that involve exposure to grease might exacerbate blemishes. If you are worried about blemishes or have blemish-prone skin, you might want to steer clear of jobs where you would work with grease, such as working in fast food., Items such as hats, stuffy clothing, headbands, and phones can make your skin produce more oil and can also spread acne-causing bacteria.Try to keep any blemish-prone skin areas clear of objects that might spread oil and bacteria. Wear breathable, loose fabrics to help avoid clogged pores on your body.

, It might be tempting to exfoliate skin that is particularly prone to blemishes. However, you must resist the urge to use harsh exfoliating treatments on this delicate skin. You risk damaging your skin, and exfoliating treatments will not improve the acne.

, These are the most common ingredients in over-the-counter anti-acne topical treatments.They will help reduce the amount of oil on your skin and will help prevent acne outbreaks. Follow the instructions carefully, and be on the lookout for possible allergic reactions to these products. However, it is normal to experience some initial redness or peeling in the first month of use.


Be aware that many over-the-counter topical treatments will make your skin even more susceptible to UV damage from the sun. Take especial care while using these medications that you use sunscreens and wear UV protective clothing., A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in the skin. If home remedies and over-the-counter treatments are not improving your skin condition after a month or two, a dermatologist might be able to provide some specialized advice on how to deal with blemishes properly.

, Your dermatologist might recommend that you use stronger topical treatments than are available over-the-counter. Many of these prescription products to treat acne include retinoids (which prevent your pores from clogging), antibiotics (which kill blemish-causing bacteria on the skin), and oil-clearing agents.Be sure that you follow your doctor's instructions carefully, since some of these medications might cause side effects or allergic reactions.

, There are other prescription medications available that can help prevent pimples. Many women report that oral antibiotics improve the quality of their skin. Oral antibiotics are another option to help keep the skin clear of acne-causing bacteria. In very severe cases, your dermatologist might also recommend harsher oral medications such as anti-androgen agents or isotretinoin--however, these medicines have much more severe side effects and should not be used casually., If you are still experiencing unwanted blemishes after making lifestyle adjustments and using a variety of topical and oral treatments, there are a few other kinds of therapies that might help improve your complexion. Talk to your dermatologist about whether these might be a good fit for you. They often have side effects, and they might be more costly than other options. They also require a significant time investment, since most therapies must be done in the doctor's office.Such therapies include:


Light therapy
Chemical peels
Steroid injections
Extraction of blemishes

Find out what causes damage.,
Cut out the cigarettes.,
Remove makeup daily.,
Avoid tanning.,
Avoid pollution.",How to Get a Better Complexion1," Many of our daily routines and rituals can end up damaging the skin. Too much sun, a poor diet, over or under-washing, and your general environment could be wreaking havoc on your complexion. Some things that we do daily, which cause damage to the skin, are:Too much exposure to UV rays
Wearing too much makeup
Smoking
Living in an urban environment
Eating greasy foods;
, If you are a smoker, you are probably already aware of the damage it can cause to your complexion and appearance. In addition to damaging the lungs and impacting oral health, smoking causes premature aging and wrinkles in the skin as well as clogs the pores, creating pimples and blackheads. If you are serious about improving your complexion, you may need to kick your smoking habit first., Some people, mostly women, wear makeup to improve the appearance of their skin. Other people, such as actors or TV personalities, wear makeup for their jobs. Whatever your reasons are for wearing makeup, make sure you take the necessary steps to remove that makeup thoroughly and allow your skin to breathe freely.Realize that many makeups and facial products are designed to stay on the skin when exposed to water. Because of this, washing your face with soap and water is not an adequate measure for removing makeup and other facial products from deep in the pores. Purchase and use a reliable and effective makeup removing wash, scrub or pad to remove applied makeup., Many people desire a nice tan or bronze color for their skin. Unfortunately, not everyone can achieve this color without first doing extensive damage to their skin caused by UV rays. If you are not happy with your complexion and regularly go tanning, stop. Your skin will look much better in its natural color and avoiding the sun or tanning bed can prevent premature wrinkles and aging., The air we live in is not clean. Dirt, smog, smoke, and dust surround most of us on a daily basis. However, reducing your skin’s exposure to these pollutants can go a long way in making your skin look younger, brighter and healthier. If possible, limit your exposure to environments that are loaded with pollutants and use products designed to remove these pollutants from your pores."

Eliminate certain foods.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Get more vitamin C & E. Vitamin C is loaded with antioxidants, helps boost the immune system and fights off bacteria related to skin problems.,
Chew the fat.,
Stock up on zinc.,
Stay hydrated.,
Avoid excessive alcohol consumption.",How to Get a Better Complexion2," Pimples, wrinkles, and dull or bad complexions are often associated with certain types of foods. Limiting the amount of sugar you eat is critical to improving your complexion. In addition to foods that are high in sugar, you should also try to cut out the following items:Milk- Milk, being a pasteurized product, is full of active bacteria. Even after ingestion, the bacteria slips into the blood stream and has been linked to increased oil production.
High Glycemic Index foods. Eating a lot of “refined” carbohydrates, often found in junk food and snacks like chips, candy, and greasy foods, basically quickens the aging process, leading to the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.Margarine. Margarine is high in trans fats, which can be good for skin. However, margarine has been linked to a lack of hydration that can damage your skin and cause premature aging., Fruits and vegetables are high in antioxidants, which help combat the free radicals that damage your skin. Eat at least five portions of fruits and/or vegetables a day to maximize your skin’s healthy appearance., Vitamin E supports healthy skin growth and reproduction of skin cells by preventing “oxidative cell damage”.You can find vitamin C in foods like strawberries, kiwi fruit, oranges, broccoli, papaya or sweet potatoes, among many others.Good sources for vitamin E are sunflower oil, corn oil, hazelnuts, pine nuts, avocado and almonds., Foods that are high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually improve a person’s complexion by increasing collagen production and contributing to proper hydration. Foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids are good, so eat more fish, avocado or nuts., Zinc can improve your complexion by naturally stimulating oil production in the glands, helping to repair damaged skin while also providing a barrier for your pores from dirt and bacteria. You will find zinc in lean red meats, poultry, shellfish, and whole grains., Drinking plenty of water is critical for maintaining healthy, beautiful skin. Obviously, water contributes to moisture. Having properly hydrated skin helps it stay flexible, resilient to damage, and helps maintain a healthy color.The recommended amount of water intake is anywhere from 9 and 13 glasses daily, depending on your body size and gender., Drinking too much alcohol on a consistent basis can cause damage to the blood vessels, particularly in your cheeks and nose. This will cause a permanent flushing or redness in the color of your skin. So, limit how much and how often you consume alcohol."

Cleanse and tone morning and night.,
Moisturize every morning and night.,
Invest in a good foundation.,
Invest in a good concealer.",How to Get a Better Complexion3," Cleansers and toners come in liquid forms, pads or wipes. You must always cleanse and tone, as this removes hidden dirt and unblocks your pores. You can buy cleanser and toner from your local pharmacy or any place health and beauty products are sold.

, Sometimes you will need to moisturize during the day as well, if you have particularly dry skin. It is important to use a good moisturizer all over the face. If you want to remove the appearance of wrinkles, get an anti-wrinkle moisturizer. Make sure you moisturize before you put on makeup and after you take it off, to replenish any moisture you might have lost during the day.


Make sure your moisturizer is suited for your skin type, e.g. dry, oily, normal, etc.
Make sure that, if you have dry skin, you get a foundation and concealer that is suited for dry skin. If you use a certain foundations on dry areas, the foundation may start to flake off and look even drier.

, Whether it is a liquid, powder or mousse, purchase a good foundation. Make sure you get the right shade to match your skin tone. Liquid is usually best for covering up uneven skin tone and to smooth the skin out. Powder is effective for covering spots and blemishes. Some makeup artists use both, but it is up to you. Foundation doesn't block pores, if you get a good one. So, try finding a foundation that is rich in minerals.Look for ""non-comedogenic"" or ""non-acnegenic"" foundations, as they don't block up your pores.
Loreal Paris and Maybelline offer a wide range of foundations with many different shades to suit all skin tones.
Avoid any foundation that claims to suit all skin tones, as it most likely will not.
Always buy the right shade of foundation and make sure to test it in natural light on your face, not on the back of your hand. Otherwise, you might end up looking like a tangerine or a ghost.

, Concealers cover up any spots or blemishes that your foundation hasn't covered. They can also reduce the appearance of dark circles under your eyes if you didn't get much sleep overnight."

Apply your makeup as normal.,
Collect your materials.,
Place dots of eyeliner on your nose and cheeks.,
Use the brush or beauty blender to make the freckles subtle.,
Enjoy your freckled face.",How to Fake Cute Freckles1," The freckles will be one of the last steps in your make-up routine, so its important to get the rest of your make-up just right before proceeding with the freckles.


If you normally wear foundation, powder, or concealer, apply those now as you normally would. If you wear blush, you can choose whether to apply it before or after the freckles depending on how prominent you'd like the freckles to appear. For more obvious freckles, apply blush now and then apply freckles on top of them. For less obvious, more natural looking freckles, wait to apply blush after you've applied the freckles, but be careful not to smear the freckles.;
, You'll need light brown cream eyeliner (a few shades darker than your natural skintone), a blush brush or beauty blender, and a cotton ball.


Do not use liquid eyeliner; it smudges easily and looks less natural.

, You can use the tip of the eyeliner itself as long as its a very fine point.









Make more dots for a more dramatic look, or less for a subtle look. You can place them on your shoulders, decollete, and neck as well if you want to.

, You do not want to rub or smear the freckles, but rather press on them gently, which will help them to look more natural.









Take your finger and press on them a bit, but not too much or else they will disappear. Remember that natural freckles vary in size, shape, and shade, so press on some a bit more firmly than others in order to vary their appearance. But do it randomly or it will look unnatural.

, You can even wear these to school. They look very realistic!


Remove using make-up remover or oil. To take off, put 1 or 2 drops of water on your cotton ball and wipe away to have a clear face again! If you are wearing waterproof eyeliner as freckles, you may need to use an oil-based make up remover (or coconut oil) to remove the freckles.

Prep your face.,
Find a sunless tanning product that dries fast and streaks easily.,
Apply a thin layer of sunless tanner all over your face.,
Using a small eyeliner brush, take a very small amount of sunless tanner and dab tiny dots onto your nose or cheeks in the natural areas you would get freckles.,
Try splattering on the sunless tanner.",How to Fake Cute Freckles2," The benefit of using a sunless tanning product for freckles is that they can last for up to a week. But since your skin naturally secretes an oily substance, you must prep the skin in order to make the sunless tanner adhere.


Wash your face using a gentle foaming cleanser, then exfoliate your face thoroughly. Use a toner to remove any remaining residue or oiliness.
Do not apply any lotion or other products to the skin once its nice and clean. Just allow it to dry thoroughly.

, Spray tan works very well, or try a foaming mousse. You will want to get a product that is at least several shades darker than your skin tone.


Dispense a small amount of tanning product into a small dish or palate.

, Be sure that you avoid eyes and lips, blend at hairlines, and extend down the neck.


Since natural freckles are darkened areas of your natural skin, this layer of self tanner applied across your face will help the freckles to appear more natural because they will be in the range of your skin's coloring.
Allow this layer to dry briefly before proceeding.

,


Start with just a few, and add more until you get the look you want.
Press gently on the surface of the dots with your index fingers to help them appear more natural and less regular and round in appearance. Vary the pressure to make some appear darker and some lighter, as natural freckles would.
Allow to dry thoroughly. To extend the life of your freckles, do not exfoliate your skin for at least a week, or until the freckles fade naturally.

, If you're feeling extra bold or want a very obvious freckle look, you can take a cue from the fashion runway and literally splatter the sunless tanner over your face.You'll probably want to enlist the help of a friend to get this look right without making a huge mess!


Dispense a pump of self-tanner into a shallow bowl (foam tanner works great for this method). Using a large kabuki-style makeup brush, dip the bristles in about half an inch then gently blot it on a paper towel once to remove excess drips.
Be sure you are either nude or wearing junk clothing you don't mind staining.
Standing in a shower or outside, have your friend splatter the sunless tanner toward your face and decollete. The more splattering, the more dramatic the look.
Use just enough sunless tanner to splatter but not enough for it to drip down your skin! Try practicing on a piece of newspaper or even on your thighs to be sure you have the right amount of product. (Thighs are great because you can just blend the tanner in after practicing!)

Choose a light brown eyeliner pencil.,
Apply your makeup as usual.,
Apply the eyeliner to your cheeks and nose or wherever you'd like freckles.,
Choose a cream concealer a shade or two lighter than your skin tone.",How to Fake Cute Freckles3," This will be used to make the freckles on your cheek.


To choose a color, compare to any naturally occurring freckles you have. If you don't have any freckles, look for moles or sun spots on your skin and choose a color similar to those.
Do not use liquid eyeliner-- the results will not look like freckles!

, The freckles will be one of the last steps in your make-up routine, so its important to get the rest of your make-up just right before proceeding with the freckles.


If you normally wear foundation, powder, or concealer, apply those now as you normally would. If you wear blush, you can choose whether to apply it before or after the freckles depending on how prominent you'd like the freckles to appear.

, This should be done in a very light handed, dabbing motion, mixing pressure while dabbing so that some freckles are darker than others.


You can use a tiny brush to apply the eyeliner, or you can use the pencil itself, as long as you do not press too hard or make the circles too big.
Don't try to make perfect circles; just make small, unevenly sized polka dots. Remember, freckles aren't big.
You can just make them on your cheeks, across the bridge of your nose, or both. Its a good idea to just do a few very light ones on your first try until you get the hang of the technique.

, Put a very small amount of it on your fingertips, and gently pat it onto the freckles you just made.


Continue patting the freckles with your fingertips until they have reached the shade you prefer. The more you pat, the more subtle they will ultimately appear.

Pat your face dry.,
Apply a moisturizer with sunscreen.,
Time your treatments.",How to Exfoliate Your Face1," If you have long hair, pull all of your hair away from your face and secure it with a hair tie. If you have bangs, you may need a headband to hold them back away from your face as well.;
, The water should be hot, but not so hot that it burns your skin. Place the washcloth on your face for one to two minutes to open your pores. Alternately, take a hot shower first and soak in the steam for several minutes.

, You don’t need to scrub hard, you just want to have a nice clean face to exfoliate.








, Before you use a new product, you should do a patch test to make sure that you do not have an allergic reaction. Choose a one-inch square along the side of your face or chin. Dampen the area, and apply the exfoliant. Wait about five or ten minutes. If the area starts to burn, wash it off quickly. Do not continue using that product. If there is no reaction, you can use it on the rest of your face.

, Whatever exfoliant you’re using, have it ready to go. Maybe you decided to make a scrub at home, or maybe you’ve purchased a product at the store. Either way, apply the exfoliating paste to your clean, wet skin. Use two fingers or a clean washcloth wet with warm water. Gently rub the paste in circular motions over your entire face to get rid of dead skin.









If you’re using an exfoliating brush or sponge, use short light strokes for about 30 seconds.Don’t exfoliate if you have open cuts, wounds, a sunburn, or a herpes outbreak.

, Wash off all the exfoliating paste with warm, not hot, water. Then splash your face with cold water to close your pores. Make sure you’ve removed all of the scrub, otherwise your face will be sticky or grainy from the leftover scrub.

, Use a fresh, soft, clean towel to gently pat dry your face. Do not rub your skin. Your skin may be a little more sensitive after exfoliation, and you do not want to irritate it further by rubbing it.








, After you are done exfoliating, use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen to preserve your skin’s smoothness, avoid breaking out, and protect it from harmful UV rays.It’s easy for fresh skin to be damaged by the sun, so be sure to wear sunscreen if you’ll be spending time outdoors.









Use a moisturizer with at least SPF 15 sun block.

, If you have oily, tough skin, you may be able to exfoliate daily without any problem. On the other hand, those with sensitive or dry skin should limit at-home exfoliating to 1-2 times per week.If your skin becomes red or irritated, cut back on how much you’re exfoliating and consult your doctor.

Identify your skin type.,
Choose the right ingredients for your skin type.,
Choose beads for sensitive or dry skin.,
Try an electric exfoliating brush.",How to Exfoliate Your Face2," Determine whether you have oily skin, normal skin, or dry skin before purchasing an exfoliating product. Dry skin is often flaky or itchy, whereas oily skin can feel greasy or look shiny. Many people have a combination of the two types in different areas, in which case use products for normal skin or products for the type of skin you have most of.

, If you have oily or normal skin choose a product that contains either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These ingredients can help to improve and prevent breakouts. You can also apply an alpha-hydroxy-acid cleanser, which helps remove dead skin cells. Use a product with retinoic acid to balance out skin tone and reduce wrinkles.


If you have dry skin, avoid using the above products and strong exfoliants that contain glycolic acid. Generally avoid any chemical products and opt for physical-based products that are less invasive.
Stay away from products that have higher than 10% glycolic acid or 2% salicylic acid.If you are allergic to aspirin, you should not use any product containing salicylic acid.

, If you have sensitive skin, look for products that are labeled as suitable for sensitive skin. Choose a product with smooth, synthetic exfoliating beads. These products are good for dry or easily irritated skin, too. If your skin is on the oily side, choose a product with coarse, rough beads that will exfoliate more aggressively.

, Brands like Clarisonic have developed tools that can be used to remove the outer layer of dead or dry skin from your face. These brushes use sonic frequency to remove dirt and debris from your face without irritating your skin. Though not as effective as a professional microdermabrasion treatment, these tools are much less expensive."

Soothe and nourish with an oatmeal scrub.",How to Exfoliate Your Face3," Baking soda is a gentle exfoliant.Let it sit for 10 minutes and then wash it off using warm water and a washcloth.









You can also try a honey and baking soda mix.For sensitive skin, try baking soda and aloe., Mash up an avocado and mix it with two tablespoons honey and one tablespoon sugar. The sugar will provide a soft exfoliation while the honey and avocado will nourish your skin.If you have oily skin, add in one to two teaspoons of fresh lemon juice to help tighten skin and dry up pores.
Allow the mask to sit on your face for 15-20 minutes before washing it off thoroughly.

, There are several different options you can choose from when it comes to selecting an oil to mix into your exfoliant scrub. Choose nut-based oils that are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids to tighten and rejuvenate skin. Mix about two tablespoons of oil into one tablespoon of brown or white sugar and use a washcloth to apply to your face, scrubbing in small circles.Rinse with warm water. Some commonly recommended oils include:Coconut oil
Almond oil
Olive oil
Grapeseed oil
Chamomile oil
Avocado oilSafflower oil

, Combine two to three tablespoons of either cornmeal or some sort of ground nut meal, such as almond or walnut meal, and a small amount of water. You want the scrub to be a pasty consistency. Apply a generous coating to your face and allow it to sit for about 15 minutes before washing off with warm water.Don’t use this if you have a nut allergy.

, Caffeic acid has anti-inflammatory properties and helps increase collagen production, leaving your skin smooth and healthy.








Mix one tablespoon of ground coffee with one tablespoon of water or olive oil and apply it to your face. If you have particularly oily skin, use plain water instead of olive oil. Allow the mask to sit on your face for about 15 minutes and then wash it off with warm water.
Be sure to use freshly ground coffee beans, not instant coffee. Instant coffee will dissolve in water immediately.
An alternative is to steam you face for 20 minutes to open up the pores. Then mix 1 tablespoon coffee powder with milk or honey to form a thick paste. Apply this paste on your face in a circular motion. Leave it on for 20 minutes and wash off with cold water to close the pores.

, Particularly beneficial for people with dry skin, oatmeal scrubs can exfoliate while nourishing your skin.








Mix two tablespoons ground oatmeal (not instant) with one teaspoon salt or sugar and one tablespoon water or olive oil. If you have oily skin, opt for salt and water as additives. If you have dry skin, opt for sugar and oil to help hydrate skin.
Apply the mixture to your skin and allow it to sit for about 15 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water."

Treat yourself to a spa facial.,
Get a professional microdermabrasion treatment.,
Try a chemical peel.",How to Exfoliate Your Face4," Make exfoliating your face part of a relaxing spa day. Spas offer many dermatological services during facials from exfoliation to deep cleansing treatments. Every once in a while enjoy a relaxing day of pampering. While you’re there, treat yourself to a massage, too!








, Also referred to as mechanical exfoliation or micro resurfacing, microdermabrasion uses a mechanical suction tube with an exfoliating tip to get rid of dead or dry layers of skin.It cleans out pores and rejuvenates skin, though the process does need to be repeated every few weeks to maintain the positive effects.


While it can be relatively expensive, microdermabrasion is non-invasive and performed in-office by a dermatologist.
A common treatment routine would be every 2-3 weeks with at least 6-10 treatments to achieve lasting results.
Don’t do microdermabrasion if you scar easily or have used the medicine isotretinoin within the past 6 months.If you are on any type of acne medication, ask your dermatologist before getting any microdermabrasion treatments.

, If you do not have dry or sensitive skin, you may be a candidate for getting a chemical peel from a dermatologist every 4-6 weeks. Chemical peel solutions contain high concentrations of salicylic acid and retinoic acid that help to speed cell regeneration. Your skin will peel for a few days after a chemical peel and then it will begin to heal itself and generate fresh, smooth skin.


These treatments usually can cost between $150 for a light peel and $6000 for a deep peel.
Chemical peels can be done at light, medium or deep levels depending on your desired results. Deeper peels take longer to heal.Redness typically occurs after a chemical peel. Other less common risks include scarring, changes in skin color, and infection. Deep peels have a risk for damage to your heart or liver because of a chemical used.Talk to your doctor about your health history and whether you should have a chemical peel. They’re not a good idea for everyone."

Consider the pros of chemical exfoliators.,
Try to use a scrub instead.,
Choose your tools.,
Learn about common household exfoliators.,
Exfoliate at least once a day.,
Scrub your body vigorously after a shower.,
Exfoliate your face.,
Focus on dry and discolored skin.,
Avoid over exfoliating.,
Seek professional advice.,
Stay away from junk food.,
Protect your skin from the sun.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Exfoliate for Smooth Even Toned Skin," Chemical exfoliators include acids like Glycolic Acid, Alpha Hydroxy Acid, and things like and the enzymes found in Papaya and pineapple. These products do not require a lot of effort. You simply have to apply them and they will remove dead skin on their own.One plus to chemical treatments is that they're less labor intensive. More natural exfoliating agents need to be scrubbed into the skin.
If you have sensitive skin, your skin may react poorly to chemicals. Watch for an allergic reaction if you choose to use a chemical exfoliant.;
, When it comes to evening skin tone, many people prefer scrubs. You can target specific areas on your body that are discolored or uneven.With a scrub, you have a tool you use to scrub an exfoliant into your body. You can use a pumice stone, an exfoliating brush, scrubbing gloves, a loofah, or any items with a somewhat rough surface.
Usually, you need a grainy substance to exfoliate. Exfoliating gels are sold at most beauty stores and drug stores. These scrubs have a harsh texture. When worked into the skin, they can help remove dead skin cells.

, You usually need a brush or sponge to exfoliate. Select your tools prior to beginning to exfoliate for smoother skin.When it comes to brushes, you can buy an electronic or manual exfoliating brush. A mechanical cleansing brush runs on batteries and moves in a way that dislodges skin dead cells and removes dirt and oil. This can be more expensive, however, and you can exfoliate manually with a regular brush as long as you scrub hard enough.
If you prefer, try a sponge cloth or buffing cloth. You rub cloths on your skin to dislodge skin cells and loosen dirt. If you have rougher skin, a buffing cloth may be a better choice.

, Many people are adverse to store bought exfoliating chemicals. They often contain micro beads, which have been shown to produce a lot of pollution. If you're looking for something more natural, consider making an exfoliating agent out of household items.Essentially, all you need is a grainy household product to rub into your skin. Salt, sugar, oatmeal, and baking soda are all used in homemade exfoliators. Baking soda may be your best option for discolored skin, as some people believe it has the power to whiten skin and remove blemishes.
When working with baking soda, you would simply mix water with baking soda until you have a thick paste. This would then be applied to your skin.
If baking soda does not work for you, experiment by making a paste with salt, sugar, oatmeal, or another grainy household product.

, This will assure optimal results. People who claim to have seen smoother, more even skin with exfoliation claim to exfoliate at least once a day. The process does not take long, and you can work it into your regular morning routine.Keep in mind, however, not everyone's skin takes well to daily exfoliating. If you develop a rash or skin irritation in response to exfoliating every day, try cutting back to a few times a week.

, The best time to exfoliate is when your skin is still damp from the shower. This will make it easier to dislodge dead skin cells.Take your chosen exfoliating agent and the scrub brush you're using. Work the exfoliating agent all over your body. Use long, hard strokes to really focus on dislodging any dead skin cells and scrubbing out discoloration.
You should target your shoulders, back, legs, feet, and chest.
Scrub until your exfoliating agent has more or less dissolved. You should not have to wash any of the agent off yourself at the end of the exfoliating process.

, Your face is where you have a lot of discolorations and blemishes. You should also apply your chosen agent to your face. If you're using a brush on your body, you will probably want to transfer to a smaller tool for your face. You can use a rough cloth, for example.Remove any makeup you're wearing. Use your regular facial cleanser to wash and cleanse your face prior to the exfoliating process.
Apply your exfoliating agent to the tool you're using. Scrub the exfoliating agent, using circular motions, across your entire face.
When you're done, rinse your face off with lukewarm water.

, While you should exfoliate your whole body, pay particularly close attention to troublesome areas. You may want to exfoliate dry or discolored skin slightly more often, or use more force when exfoliating these areas., This is especially true if you're using chemical cleansers, as these can be harsh on the skin over time. Dermatologists advise against overusing chemical products. This can remove healthy skin, leaving your skin sensitive and overexposed.If you plan on exfoliating daily, go for household cleansers over chemical ones.

, It's best to consult a dermatologist before beginning an exfoliation regimen. A qualified dermatologist will be able to tell you if exfoliation is right for you, and recommend the best method. If your skin is dry or uneven, talk to a dermatologist about your issues before attempting to exfoliate., This can cause skin problems, like acne, for some. Take steps to cut the junk food out of your diet if you want smoother, more even-toned skin.Do not buy junk food to have at home. This will only tempt you to eat it.
If there is junk food at your place of work, bring in healthy snacks, like fruit and nuts. Fill up on these foods so you'll resist the temptation of going for junk food.
If you're really having a craving, try indulging yourself once a week. You can have a set day when you're allowed to have a candy bar or a bag of chips.

, Sun can definitely cause skin discoloration, and too much sun can have health risks. Always wear sunscreen when going out, even on overcast days.At minimum, your sunscreens should be SPF 15. However, a sunscreen of SPF 30 will offer optimal protection.
Make sure any sunscreen you use has UVA or UVB protection.

, Water is good for your overall health, and may lead to better looking skin. Make a point of drinking water throughout the day to get even toned skin.Take a water bottle with you at all times. Keep one by your desk at work, and carry it in a bag when you're running errands.
When you see a water fountain, always stop and take a sip.
Drink water with meals instead of juices, sodas, and other drinks.

Clean your chin and face.,
Apply the foundation in a line along your jawline.,
Blend the bronzer along your jawline using the brush.,
Keep your back straight and your chin up in photographs.,
Avoid taking pictures from a low angle.",How to Eliminate a Double Chin1," Start with a clean palette by using your normal face washing routine, followed by moisturizing. Then, get out your makeup and brushes. You will need:


A foundation that is one shade darker than your normal foundation.
Bronzer. If you have medium to dark skin, use a gold-toned bronzer and if you have fair skin, use a rose-toned bronzer.A large makeup brush;
, Use your fingers to put on a light amount of foundation along your jawline, just above your neck. Do not use foundation that is too dark — it should only be one shade darker than your normal foundation. Dark foundation may end up accentuating, rather than hiding, your double chin.

, Using a small amount of bronzer, use your makeup brush to apply the bronzer in a downward motion along your jawline. Blend it so there are no obvious lines or marks and the bronzer mixes well with your skin.


Once you have blended the bronzer well along your jawline, move on to applying the rest of your makeup. Play up your eyes with eyeliner, rather than put bright lipstick on your mouth, to avoid bringing attention to your chin.

, This will improve your posture and minimize the appearance of your double chin. Avoid dipping your head down in photographs, as this will only highlight your double chin. Instead, tip your chin out and up to extend your neck and jawline., Low-angled photos can highlight your double chin and are flattering for almost no one. Instead, take photographs that show off your profile, or one side of your face. When someone is taking a picture square on you, tilt your head up and to the side and look beyond the camera or just to one side. And of course, don't forget to smile."

Tell your child not to lick their lips.,
Make sure your child drinks 8 to 10 glasses of water a day.,

Seek medical attention if pus comes out of your child’s chapped lips.,
Take your child into your doctor if there are white patches on their tongue.,
Get your child checked for lip eczema.",How to Fix a Toddler's Chapped Lips," Your child has a tendency to lick their lips when they feel dry. When saliva comes in contact with the lips, it evaporates quickly, leaving the lips drier instead of more moist.So, always remind your child not to lick their lips whenever you see them do so as this will not improve their chapped lips.;
, Offer them water at mealtimes and play times throughout the day to prevent dehydration., The air coming from their mouth will constantly pass over their lips and dry them out.If your child has a cold and cannot breathe through their nose, consult with your doctor to properly treat the cold.

, Toothpastes that contain an active ingredient called sodium lauryl sulfate causes the lips to dry and can even irritate them, leading to chapped lips.Make sure your child uses a toothpaste that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate.

, Toddlers are fond of putting objects into their mouth. If they come into contact with objects containing nickel such as paper clips, they may put them into their mouth and this can lead to chapped lips. An allergy to nickel can further irritated their lips and cause other reactions.

, These weather conditions will contribute to the drying of your child’s lips by making their lips lose moisture.Wrap a scarf around your child’s mouth so their lips are not be exposed to the cold, dry air. In a cold weather, try to get your child to play indoors.


You can also install humidifiers in your home or in your child’s room to prevent the air from becoming too dry.

, The acid in citrus fruits has a tendency to irritate the lips and can cause your child’s lips to become sensitive to sunlight. As a result, the moisture from their lips quickly evaporates in the sun, leading to chapped lips.Citrus fruits to avoid include lemons, oranges, grapefruits, mandarins, pomelos, and limes.

, Use a clean cotton bud to apply balm on their chapped lips, just enough to cover the affected area, twice a day: one in the morning and one before going to bed. Look for a balm or ointment that contains ingredients like petrolatum, castor seed oil, shea butter, or sunflower seed oil.Basic home essentials, such as Crisco or petroleum, are also effective in healing chapped lips.Avoid waxy balms that come in sticks, as they aren’t as effective at locking in moisture.As well, use a lip balm that has SPF 15 if you and your child are planning to go outside as sun exposure can also dry their lips.Don’t use any flavored or scented lip balm, as this can further encourage your child to lick their lips.
You can purchase lip balm at your local pharmacy or drugstore. The effectiveness of the lip balm depends on the severity of your toddler’s chapped lips.

, Pat the wet cloth onto their chapped lips as often as possible. Do not rub it against your child’s lips as this can irritate and further damage the affected area.Wetting their lips with water works better than allowing them to lick their lips because the pH of water is neutral (usually a pH of 7), meaning it is not an acid or a base. Saliva has digestive enzymes that are acidsthat will further irritate rather than moisten, their lips.

, If your child’s lips are sore and pus is draining out of them, this may be caused by touching their lips with dirty hands and putting dirty things in their mouth like toys or dirty pacifiers. Harmful microorganisms can then be transmitted into the chapped lips, especially their lips have open wounds., White patches on their tongue, coupled with chapped lips, can be signs that your child has a Candida or yeast infection. Your doctor may recommend the application of an anti-fungal cream to treat the infection., Persistently chapped lips may be a sign of lip eczema, a common condition related to dry skin. If your child has lip eczema, your doctor should be able to recommend a stronger course of action or prescribe stronger treatment.

Try chin exercises.,
Commit to a weekly exercise program.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Create a seven day meal plan.,
Drink water instead of sugary drinks.",How to Eliminate a Double Chin2," Keep in mind that it is not possible to burn fat in one area of your body. In fact, full-body exercise is the best way to lose weight in all areas of your body, including your chin and neck.That being said, doing chin exercises can stretch the muscles in your jaw, neck, and throat and help with your posture.Do chin lifts. Stand or sit with your spine straight. Tilt your head towards the ceiling. Squeeze your lips together as you look towards the ceiling. Only engage your lips and relax your other facial muscles. Keep your lips puckered for a count of five, then release. Repeat this exercise five to ten times. These can be surprisingly effective in strengthening and toning the neck muscles.
Do neck rolls. This exercise is great for releasing tension in your shoulders and neck. Stand or sit with your spine straight. Inhale and turn your head to the right. Let your chin touch your shoulder. Look towards the right. Exhale and roll your head towards your chest. Keep your spine straight and your shoulders squared to the front. Inhale and lift your head so it touches your left shoulder. Look towards the left. Repeat five to 10 times for each side.

, Lose weight in your entire body to help reduce the fat around your neck and chin. Most exercise plans recommend 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity five days of the week, or 150 minutes each week. Depending on your current fitness level, you may want to commit to doing light exercise every day or more intense exercise every other day. Rather than overdo your workouts, focus on being consistent and sticking to an exercise plan that is realistic and specific to the needs of your body.Create a workout schedule so you are exercising at the same time every day. This could be every morning at the gym before work, every other day during lunch, or every night several hours before bed. Look at your schedule for the week and pencil in workout time so it is part of your day and you cannot miss it or forget about it.
Always start every workout with light cardio to prevent stretching or putting stress on cold muscles. Do a light five to ten minute jog in place or use a jump rope and jump in place for five minutes.
Start out slow and build on your intensity and timing especially if you are severely out of shape and condition. Check with a doctor if you are older and make sure your heart is healthy enough for physical activity.

, Many people develop a double chin due to weight gain from an unhealthy diet.Adjust your calorie intake so you are not overeating or eating empty calories. Most dietitians will recommend that you stick to a 1,800–2,000 calorie a day diet if you are trying to lose weight. Determine your calorie intake per day and try to maintain a diet that gives you enough energy to do exercise. Never go below 1,200 calories a day.


Consume more vegetables, healthy fats, and lean protein. Shape your meals so they contain one protein source, one low fat source and one low carb vegetable source. Your carb intake should be in the recommended range of 20–50 grams per a day.Cut out carbs, sugars, and animal fats. Foods high in carbs and sugars cause your body to secrete insulin, which is a main fat storage hormone in your body. When your insulin levels go down, your body can start to burn fat. It also helps your kidneys shed excess sodium and water, which will help you reduce any water weight.Avoid foods high in starch and carbs like potato chips, french fries, and white breads. You should also avoid consuming foods high in sugar like soft drinks, candy, cakes, and other junk food.

, This meal plan should include three main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), scheduled at the same time of day, as well as two small snacks (between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner), also scheduled at the same time of day. This will ensure you eat at a consistent time for all seven days and do not skip or miss a meal. Eating fewer calories each day, combined with daily exercise, can lead to healthy weight loss.Make a grocery list based on your meal plan and go food shopping for the week on Sunday. Stock your fridge with all the necessary ingredients to make your meals for the week so you can prepare each meal easily and quickly.Try using an app like MyFitnessPal to track your calories and make sure you stick to your allotted calories for the day.

, Water will help your immune system stay healthy, keep your skin looking great, and keep you hydrated during your daily workout.Replace sugary drinks like soda and sports drinks with water flavored with slices of lemon or lime or zero-calorie drinks.
Unsweetened green tea is another good substitute for sugary drinks. Green tea contains a good amount of antioxidants, meaning that it helps your body fight against free radicals, which enhance signs of aging in humans."

Talk to a plastic surgeon about laser liposuction.,
Speak to a plastic surgeon about a neck lift.,
Ask your doctor about Kybella, an injection that helps remove neck fat.",How to Eliminate a Double Chin3," This type of liposuction is also called Slim Lipo, Smart Lipo, and Cool Lipo. It uses the heat from a laser to liquefy fat, such as neck fat. Because laser fiber is small, 2.5 mm tubes are inserted under your skin to remove fat. The heat from the laser can also cause double chin skin to contract and tighten.Laser liposuction is less invasive than neck fat removal and can have a quicker recovery time. Always have a consultation with a certified plastic surgeon before getting liposuction of any kind. Laser liposuction for a double chin costs around $7,500 USD.

, If you have loose or sagging neck skin as well as visible bands of fat, you may consider a neck lift. During a neck lift, a certified plastic surgeon will remove fat around your chin and tighten any sagging neck muscles. She will also remove loose skin from behind your ears; however, neck lifts are expensive procedures, and can cost between $5,000 to $10,000 USD.You may experience bruising around your neck after getting laser liposuction or a neck lift. You will need to cover your chin, neck, and head with a compression garment for about a week. It will take about 10 days to two weeks to recover and for bruising to go away.

, In April 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a fat-reducing injection called Kybella to help with the removal of neck fat. The injection contains an active ingredient called deoxycholic acid, which dissolves fat without having to use invasive procedures like surgery or liposuction.During the treatment, your neck area will be injected with several small needles that contain Kybella. You will need to commit to two to six month sessions that take about 20 minutes. Side effects of Kybella include swelling, bruising, and mild pain in the neck area. Most symptoms will clear up within 48 to 72 hours.
The injections must be done properly by a certified plastic surgeon or a doctor trained in the procedure. The price for Kybella is not yet set, but it will likely be much more affordable than liposuction or a neck lift.

Move to arms and then torso.,
Dry brush sensitive areas.,

Keep track of when you dry brush.",How to Dry Brush Your Skin," Dry brushing, like many wellness trends, boasts a variety of health benefits; however, not all the buzz is scientifically sound. Know the facts going in so you don't dry brush too often or unnecessarily.


While the effects of dry brushing on blood circulation are debated, dry brushing does exfoliate the skin. Exfoliation is a process by which dead skin cells are cleared away; however, if you're in your teens or twenties it may not be necessary to exfoliate regularly. Your skin is young enough to automatically clear away dead skin. Beginning in your 30's, dead skin may not fall away on its own and dry brushing can help.Dry brushing can affect cellulite but it does not remove or even reduce it.Dry brushing temporarily lessens the appearance of existing cellulite due to factors like skin plumping and swelling; therefore, dry-brushing before a day at the beach can be a great way to look and feel better, but the effect will wear off within 24 hours.Many beauty and wellness sites advise dry brushing twice a day, but this can be harmful. When skin is brushed too harshly or too often bristles cause micro cuts. These can easily become infected. Also, dry brushing more than once a week breaks down protective barriers in the skin. This leads to dryness and irritation.Dry brushing does affect skin conditions. People with eczema or chronic dry skin should avoid dry brushing as they're more prone to the above complications; however, if you have a condition called keratosis pilaris, in which the skin is inflamed with rough, red bumps, dry brushing could potentially remove the dead skin cells that cause such bumps.;
, If you've weighed the pros and cons and have decided dry brushing is right for you, you'll need to select the brushes you will use.


You will need a natural, non-synthetic bristle brush with a long handle. You can find a bristle brush like this at a health food store or at a beauty salon.The longer the handle, the better. You'll need to access hard-to-reach areas like your back.Choose firm bristles. Cactus or vegetable-derived bristles are ideal for the process of dry brushing. If you're not sure, ask an employee for advice.For delicate areas like your face, abdomen, and breasts, select a no-handle brush with slightly softer bristles., Before you begin dry brushing, you'll need to make a decision about what time of day to dry brush.


Many dry brushing advocates advise dry brushing in the morning, before a shower. This is because dry brushing allegedly energizes the body and some people believe this will give you an added energy boost at the beginning of the day.Remember, do not dry brush too often. While many fans of dry brushing do it daily, or twice daily, this is not necessary and can actually lead to skin infection, dryness, and irritation. Dry brushing bi-weekly is the safest option.

, Before you begin dry-brushing, you should get on a tiled surface. Most people prefer dry brushing in their showers. Dead skin flakes will fall away from your body during the process and you want a surface that can easily be cleaned or rinsed after the process., Use your long-handled brush for this portion of dry brushing. Dry brushing begins with the bottom of your body and moves upward. By starting on the bottom of your body and moving upward, it is thought that you increase drainage to the lymph nodes and increase circulation to the heart. This may help remove unwanted toxins from the body and improve blood flow.


Use long, smooth brush strokes. Work backwards, each stroke moving towards the heart.If balance is an issue, prop your leg up on a foot stool or on the side of the bathtub.Pay extra attention to rougher areas, like your ankles and the soles of your feet. Brush these areas several times to ensure any dead skin falls away., Continue to work with your long handled brush. After you've worked your way up your legs, move on to your arms. Remember, the process is very similar. You're moving towards your heart with each stroke.


Start with your hands and move towards the shoulders. Once again, use long and smooth brush strokes.Give rough areas, like the elbows, extra attention. Make sure dead skin falls away.Move on to the back. This can be difficult, as some areas of the back are hard to access. Make sure your brush handle reaches far enough to touch your mid-back and other hard-to-reach areas. Move from the buttocks up to the shoulder blades.Finally, move on to the torso and sides. Brush up your rib cage, moving towards the heart. On your sides, move from your hip to your armpit., Set aside the long-handled brush and get your softer bristled brush. Move on to more sensitive areas of the skin.


Dry brush your face, using somewhat smaller and gentler strokes. Move from the forehead to neck.Nipples or breasts should also be dry brushed with a softer brush to avoid irritating more sensitive skin.If you want to go over your whole body again, it might be better to use the softer brush this time around to avoid undue irritation., Even if you do not dry brush in the mornings, it might be a good idea to shower after dry brushing. Any lingering dead skin can be washed off in a shower.


Some people recommend alternating between hot and cold temperatures to further enhance blood circulation, although this is not necessary. If you'd rather just take a normal shower using tolerably hot water, this is also okay.Pat your skin dry rather than rubbing it dry after a shower. Your skin might be extra sensitive after dry brushing and you don't want to encourage skin irritation or infection.Apply a natural oil to your skin to replenish any oils lost in the dry brushing and showering process. Rosehip oil and coconut oil are good options., After you finish dry brushing, you should clean the area where you dry brushed as well as the instruments used.


If you dry brushed in your shower, cleanup is easy as dead skin will probably flow down the drain afterwards. On other tiled surfaces, sweep up dead skin flakes and dispose of them.
Your dry brushes should stay dry. Do not hang them in the shower, where they will get wet and be exposed to mildew. Store them away from standing water.Periodically, your dry brush will need to be washed. Use a small amount of shampoo or liquid soap. Wash the bristles and blot out as much water as possible afterwards. Hang the brushes to dry somewhere safe, away from any further exposure to water., Remember, dry brushing can cause a litany of skin problems if done too often. Make a note on your calendar or phone of the date of your dry brushing session. Do not dry brush again until at least a couple of weeks have passed.

Treat your hair with protein.",How to Repair Hair Breakage1," Trimming your hair can get rid of breakage immediately.Have a professional stylist cut your hair to remove all of the damaged ends. If you blow dry your hair regularly and spend a lot of time in the sun, your hair should be trimmed every eight weeks.Trimming is especially important if you have split ends. The split will continue to travel up your hair shaft and your hair will break off on its own.
If you trim your ends yourself, only use hair shears. Twist your hair into one inch sections around your index finger, and cut off any of the ends that pop up.;
, Antioxidants can correct hair damage caused by the sun and chemical treatments. Products containing rice extract and artichoke extract can make your hair shinier and smoother and repair your hair cuticle.Products containing Vitamin E (panthenol) increase the water content of your hair and make it more elastic.Improved elasticity keeps your hair from breaking when it is being manipulated.


These ingredients can be found in shampoos, conditioners, and hair serums.

, Plant based biopolymers help your hair maintain moisture and fill the outer layer of your hair shaft that is broken. Look for products that contain carob tree extract, Cystoseira compressed seaweed extract, and Lepidium meyenii extract. Out of these three ingredients, carob tree extract works best for smoothing the hair cuticle.Botanical extracts are particularly effective if your hair breakage is due to chemical treatments.
These ingredients can be found in shampoos, conditioners, and hair serums.

, Put coconut oil on your hair every day as a pre-wash treatment. Coconut oil will coat your hair and protect your hair from losing protein when you wash it. This will strengthen your hair and improve its appearance.The quality of your hair will improve with long-term use of coconut oil.


If you wash your hair in the morning, you can apply coconut oil before you go to bed and wash it out in the morning.
If you wash your hair at night, apply the oil as a post wash treatment so it can penetrate your hair before you wash it again., Always apply a rinse out or leave in conditioner after washing your hair. Use conditioners that are formulated for dry or damaged hair. Conditioners containing silicones will increase shine and smooth your hair. Well conditioned hair is easier to comb and detangle. Having smooth hair will protect you from further damaging your hair during the styling process.If your hair is extremely damaged, consider using an intensive conditioner. These conditioners are only used once or twice a week and should be left in for longer periods of time.

, Choose a gentle shampoo that is designed to moisturize your hair.Harsh shampoos can lead to dry, brittle hair that is more prone to break. Read the ingredients before you buy the shampoo and look for shampoos that contain silicones, panthenol, and amino acids.

If you have oily hair and need to wash more frequently, try skipping just a day., Your hair is made up primarily of proteins.

Pay attention to how your hair responds to the protein treatment.

Be gentle with your hair.",How to Repair Hair Breakage2," Your hair needs proper nutrients to grow and be strong. Protein is a big component of hair, so eat foods (e.g. beans, peas, meat, poultry, seafood, eggs)that are rich in protein for strong hair. Also drink plenty of water to keep your hair hydrated from the inside out. Dark leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, shellfish, chicken, turkey, and salmon are also good for hair., Blow-dryers, flat irons, and curling irons are very damaging to the hair. Air dry your hair when you can. If you plan to use heat, apply a heat protectant before you start.If you must use heat, use the lowest heat setting you can to get the job done. It may take you a little longer to finish your hair, but it will be worth it.


Use flat irons and curling irons with adjustable temperatures. Do not use temperatures greater than 375°F/190°C., Perms, hair straightening treatments, bleach, and hair dyes are the most damaging things you can do to your hair. These treatments change the actual chemical structure of your hair making it weaker and more likely to break.If you do any of these treatments, make sure they are done by a professional. Limit chemical treatments to only two or three times a year.If a chemical treatment is being reapplied to your hair, the stylist should only apply the products to your roots that have not been previously treated., UV rays from the sun can cause your hair to become dry, brittle, and damages the outer layer of your hair. This can lead to split ends and breakage. If you are going to be out in the sun, wear a hat or use a leave-in conditioner that contains zinc oxide. Zinc oxide will protect your hair from the UV rays.Protecting your hair from the sun is more important in the summer months when your hair is exposed to UV light. Adjust your hair care regimen to the weather.

, The products you use on your hair should be moisturizing and be formulated to improve the condition of your hair. Look for shampoos and conditioners that impart moisture.Products that are for dry and damaged hair are more moisturizing.


You should also deep condition your hair every 2 weeks.

, Pools contain chlorine and bleach that causes dryness and breakage. Some pools also contain copper which is damaging as well. A swim cap can protect your hair from contaminants in the water. Shampoos and conditioners that contain trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinic acid will remove copper from your hair.You probably will not know if your hair has come into contact with copper unless you have light colored hair. For example, if you are blonde, your hair may have a greenish hue after its been exposed., Excessive brushing and combing or rubbing when shampooing and towel drying your hair can cause damage as well. Detangle your hair from tips to roots and go slowly. Your hair is more susceptible to damage when it is wet. Use a leave-in conditioner or detangler to prevent damage.


Detangle wet hair with your fingers before you use a comb or brush.How you style your hair can also cause damage. Tight ponytails, braids, and cornrows, can lead to hair loss and breakage.Your hairstyles should never give you a headache or put stress on your hairline. If it feels too tight, it probably is.
Wearing your hair in the same style all of the time can also cause breakage. For example, if you always wear your hair pulled back, change the position of your ponytail."

Decide if short hair is right for you.,
Choose a hairstyle.,
Dye your hair.Once you have a hairstyle that suits you, you can choose to dye it if you think it fits your aesthetic.,
Experiment with your hair.",How to Rock Short Hair1," Whether or not you're likely to suit short hair depends on the shape of your face.Generally speaking, longer faces favour longer hair, and rounder faces are most suited to shorter styles. If you do have a longer face, you still shouldn't dismiss the possibility of having shorter hair; the bottom line of the matter should depend on your personal style and sense of aesthetic.


Measure the length from the bottom of your ear to your chin. If it is less than 5.5cm, short hair is most recommended.Keep in mind that this is a very simplistic test and shouldn't be taken as a final indicator whether or not you should change your hairstyle.;
, Taking the plunge and cutting your hair will be a big move, but it can be just to think to revitalize your look if you think your style is growing stale. Potential hairstyles are plentiful, and it can be overwhelming to find one that suits you. Go online and check some online galleries that specifically showcase short hairstyles. With each style that appeals to you, try to imagine what you would look like. Spiking hair, slicking it back, and waving it with your fingers are effective ways of crafting a hairstyle.


Ask a hairstylist. If you're any bit unsure what you should do with your hair, you can always enlist the help of a hairstylist. Hairstylists see a wide range of different hair and face types over the course of their day, and an impartial perspective may help you figure out what you should do.

, Rocking short hair is sometimes considered a daring move, and it's all the moreso when you add dye to the mix. An unnatural hair colour, like orange or magenta, will bring attention to your new 'do.


It is arguable that dyed hair is actually easier to pull off with shorter hair. It's also quite a bit cheaper, due to the fact you'll have less hair to colour.

, The great thing about hair is that it grows back; of course it's not recommended to treat it lightly or mess with a hairstyle you're already super happy with, but you can always experiment in more subtle ways. Trying out different hair colours, parting or setting your hair in difference ways, or even recutting it will give you a chance to get the hair that matches your personal preferences.


It definitely helps to keep a few online gallery tabs open. Use other persons' examples and eye down a style that suits you best; this is much easier than trying them all yourself!
If you want to go through a number of hairstyles in a short period of time for testing's sake, start with the longest hairstyles, and trim it down until you reach a hairstyle you're comfortable with keeping.

Give your hair some post-shower styling.,
Spruce your hair with extra volume.,
Wear a headband.Headbands are easy to wear, and can give your head an instant look of class.,
Accent your face with makeup.,
Dress to suit your hairstyle.,
Maintain your hair.,
Be confident!",How to Rock Short Hair2," You'll never know the regular look of your hair until you give it a good soak in the shower. Once you get out and dry off, you should have a better indicator what you'll look like. With each new hairstyle, you should try applying different products (like conditioner and mousse) and drying it different ways. Gel is helpful if you're trying to make it spike, and the way you blow-dry your hair can even help determine how it will set throughout the day.

, Adding volume is usually associated with longer hairstyles, but even short hair can benefit from added lustre. Treating your hair with a dime-sized dollop of mousse is a quick and simple way to give your hair volume.If your current hair routine doesn't include something for volume, consider looking into it for your new hairstyle.

, Headbands with short hair are arguably most closely associated with the gamine style from the 1920s and 30s. Adding a headband to your wardrobe is a good move if you're going for a more vintage look.

, Makeup is and always should be considered optional, but many find it to be especially effective in the case of a short hairstyle. Short hair will bring added emphasis to your face, and giving your eyes more vibrance with the help of mascaras or eyeshadows. Think of your hair as a frame or your face; look at yourself in the mirror, pick out what features stand out the most, and emphasize them further., A hairstyle is but one aspect of your overall look, and dressing to be consistent with your hairstyle will leave a stronger impression on people. Casual short hair on women is sometimes seen as tomboyish; playing into that conception can be seen as cute, but you can choose to dress very feminine if you're looking to work against it.Aim for tighter-fitting clothes, as bagginess doesn't work near as much with short hair.

, Trimming your hair regularly is a must if you're interested in having a short hairstyle. Depending on the length and the style you're keeping it at, a couple weeks of natural hair growth can change (or hinder) the look you're going for. Give it frequent attention, and develop a firm eye for how you think your hair should look., Now that you've got a new hairstyle, it's time to show it off to the world. Keep in mind, however, that no amount of style can act as a sufficient replacement for believing in yourself and sporting some confidence on the side. Confidence can be a tricky thing for a lot of people, but it doesn't have to be for you. Take a long look at yourself in the morning and know that you rock that hairstyle. If there's anything you're still dissatisfied with, you can always change it.


If you are worried about looking less feminine with short hair-- don't. Hair length has little to do with femininity. It's all about carrying yourself in a way that lets people know that you love being you.

Take care of your body.",How to Reduce Frizz on Relaxed Hair," Sulfates are notorious for drying out hair. Using a sulfate-free shampoo on your relaxed hair can help combat the dryness and lead to less frizzy hair. These kinds of shampoos typically use natural oils (like coconut oil) as a base rather than a harsh cleanser.Look for ingredients like coco glucoside, lauryl glucoside, decyl glucoside, capryl glucoside, and disodium cocoyl glutamate.
Consider using sulfate-free shampoos like World Clean Hair & Skin Cleaner, Nature Clean Pure-Sensitive Shampoo, or Yarok Feed Your Volume Shampoo.;
, These kinds of products help keep your relaxed hair moisturized by closing the hair cuticles that are lifted by the relaxer process. Moisturized hair is less likely to be frizzy.Look for products that include aloe vera juice, lactic acid, or citric acid to help tame the frizz on relaxed hair.

, Frizzy hair is usually the direct result of dryness. To avoid this, try spraying your hair with a liquid product containing protein and amino acids – like Ouidad Botanical Boost or ApHogee Keratin & Green Tea Restructurizer Spray. Then add a moisturizing agent like coconut oil to seal in the moisture.These products can be used as often as needed, whenever your hair seems frizzy or dry.

, Overexposure to direct sunlight can lead to dry hair and frizz, especially with relaxed hair. Try to avoid being out in the sunlight for long periods of time to avoid the frizzy effects.If you must go out into the sunlight for an extended period of time, try to wear a loose-fitting headscarf or hat to protect your hair from the damaging effects of the sun.

, Vigorously rubbing your hair with a towel after showering can cause tangles and breakage that often leads to damaged and frizzy hair. Try gently squeezing the excess water out of your hair by twisting it slightly inside the towel, rather than rubbing your hands on it roughly.Try using a clean cotton t-shirt instead of a bathroom towel to dry your hair. The fabric is much softer and gentler on your hair. This can help prevent breakage and frizz.

, Brushing your hair can cause your strands to tangle up or break off. The smaller teeth of the brush apply too much pressure to your hair, and more breakage leads to more frizz. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb to comb through your hair and prevent tangles.Small-toothed combs can be similarly damaging, so try to avoid these too.

, A relaxing product should only be applied by a professional, as improper application can lead to serious hair damage. Go to a professional salon with a qualified hairstylist, preferably one with good online reviews or recommendations from friends.If you apply relaxers at home and it damages your hair, this can lead to more breakage and, as a result, worse frizz in your hair.

, If you let your relaxed hair get too long, the tension can cause it to break. More breakage means more frizz for your hair. Make sure to consult with your hairstylist about how often you need to cut your hair, or what length is best for maintaining healthy, strong strands.If you start noticing more breakage than usual, it might be time to consider a shorter haircut – or at least a trim.

, A healthy body does a better job at producing healthy hair. Take care of your body and try to minimize the stress in your life in order to prevent frizzy relaxed hair.This means that you should drink plenty of water and exercise regularly. You should also consider taking vitamin supplements like a daily multi-vitamin and an Omega-3 Oil.

Wear fitted jackets and coats.,
Wear cardigans.,
Accessorize minimally.,
Wear minimal makeup.,
Wear the attitude.",How to Dress Parisian Chic," You might see a lot of people around Paris wearing black, navy or grey, and with good reason - those colors tend to be slimming and flattering on most people. Consider adding the following pieces to your wardrobe:


Knee-length pencil or A-line skirts. Mini skirts or super-long skirts are more difficult to pull off, and might not look as Parisian. Wear dark colors in the winter, and consider light colors or delicate floral prints for summer.
Slender or skinny-cut trousers in dark colors. They can be cropped or full-length.
A dark-wash skinny jean with no visible rips or tears.
Crisp blouses in neutral colors such as white, beige, cream, navy, grey, or black. Make sure they fit you well and don't sag around the waist.
A ""little black dress"" for formal occasions. It doesn't necessarily have to be black (though it should be in a darker, more slimming color). The hemline should fall somewhere between mid-calf and mid-thigh.





;
, Flats, riding boots,thin sandals, and pumps are all appropriate Parisian shoes. Avoid trainers, flip-flops, or heavy boots (such as Uggs).


If you're going to do a lot of walking (or your balance in heels just isn't great), stick to flats or boots. They are cute and you can wear them anywhere

, Trench coats, pea coats, feminine leather jackets, and cropped or fitted blazers all look chic without being fussy. Avoid sweatshirts or anything with a loud label.

, They go with skirts and pants, and they are light enough to wear in spring and summer.


Tie-front cardigans are okay, just make sure you wear a white or differently-colored camisole beneath them.

, Don't wear too much jewelry. Remember: wear pearls during the day and diamonds at night (real or fake). You can also wear a scarf, a cute headband, large sunglasses, or a sophisticated handbag.

, Parisian women aspire to look fresh-faced and healthy, but not overly made-up. Try sticking to powder foundation, a light dusting of blush, undereye concealer, and one coat of mascara on the upper lashes.

, Dress with confidence, and carry yourself proudly. Try to greet the world with a sense of politeness and calm.

Avoid styles that pull the hair.,
Avoid weaves and hair extensions.,
Go “no-hold.” Another pitfall for hair loss is using styling products for long-lasting hold, like certain kinds of gels and hairsprays.,

Wrap your hair with a towel to dry.,
Air-dry your hair before combing or brushing.,

Use a wide-tooth brush or comb.,
Use products with vitamin E. Buy topical products that include vitamin E; you can find shampoos, conditioners, and lotions available online or in stores.,
Strengthen your hair.",How to Prevent Hair Loss from Excessive Styling," Some hairstyles are much harder on the hair and scalp than others, because they pull and can cause breakage. Cornrows, braids, ponytails, top-knots, or buns can all do this, especially if they are worn continuously or too tightly.Choose a style that doesn’t pull or put tension on the shafts of your hair. Too tight ponytails and others can cause traction alopecia on the sides of your head; braids around the hairline can easily cause damage the hair there.
If you really like your hair up, at least give it frequent rests. Pick a style that you can let down at the end of the day.;
, Hair “enhancements” like weaves and extensions can make your hair fuller and longer in the short term. However, they can also pull at the hair fibers and roots and, over time, contribute to hair loss. Sometimes, this damage is permanent.Prolonged pulling of the roots can cause inflammation and lead to scarring, which may permanently destroy them.
Only get weaves and extensions at salons that specialize in such products, and make sure that they are light-weight.
Don’t wear weaves or extensions for more than 2 or 3 months at most. Keep up your normal scalp hygiene and switch hair styles periodically.
Rest your hair for a few weeks in between hair extension applications., The thing about these products is that they coat the hair and add friction when you comb or brush, all of which increases the risk of breakage.Styling your hair after using a hold product can lead to hair loss over time. Choose an everyday style that doesn’t need styling product, instead, if possible.

, Do you color, perm, straighten, or bleach your hair? All of these procedures involve chemicals that erode the integrity of hair fibers and can eventually make your hair dull looking or frizzy or even break off, thinning your hair.Most people should wait 6 to 7 weeks between hair coloring or, in the winter, 8 to 10 weeks. Those with naturally strong hair may be able to go every five weeks. For a perm, wait at least 1 to 2 weeks before repeating.Only have one treatment at a time. If you have a perm, for example, wait at least 2 weeks before coloring your hair.
Make sure to do deep conditioning on your hair every few days to help it recover from these chemical processes.

, Traction alopecia can be prevented, especially if you recognize it early on. If you think that your hairstyles might be damaging your hair, look out for the following signs:A sense of relief when you untie your hair
Tenderness of your scalp
An itchy scalp
The need to take painkillers because of a headache caused by your hairstyle

, Overheating hair can cause it to become brittle or to crack, split, and break off. It can also strip the hair of moisture, making it dull. You’ll want to avoid over-using heating tools to prevent hair loss, but especially blow dryers and irons.Don’t apply the blow dryer directly to your hair. Direct heat can burn or weaken hair. Limit your use of blow dryers each week, as well.
Flat irons and curlers can also damage your hair with heat. Limit your use of them to no more than every other day. Leave irons in place only for a second or two.Never use a tool like this on wet hair, because it can easily burn it. Use irons on dry hair at a low or medium setting.

, To avoid the harsh effect of a blow dryer, consider wrapping your head in a towel “turban” to dry. While toweling your hair might seem like a good idea, the friction can actually damage your hair, too. Create a turban with a regular or microfiber head towel, instead – you’ll feel like you’ve just been to the spa.First, pat (don’t rub) your hair dry with the towel. Bend over so that your hair hangs down over your head.
Place the towel over the center of the back of your neck and drape it over your hair.
Fold the towel around your head and hair and twist the ends of the towel, making sure that the hair is inside.
Stand up and bring the twisted end of the towel back over your head. Slip the end under the nape of your neck to secure the turban.

, Partially air-dry your hair before you style or comb it. This will help you on two fronts: you’ll end up blow-drying it less, for one. But you’ll also protect your hair from wet styling, when the hair is weaker and more prone to damage.Most people should avoid styling wet hair, as it breaks more easily when brushed or combed.
An exception to the rule is people who have kinky or tightly curled hair. For them, brushing the hair when wet will decrease chance of breaks. Just be gentle!

, Over-treatment is the number one cause of hair damage. Pulling too hard at your hair while washing or brushing can put a lot of stress on the hair fibers and strip off the “cuticle,” which is the tough protective outer layer of the hair. Hair with a weakened cuticle will split or break off more often.Don’t brush your hair aggressively.
Shampoo and rinse your hair gently, too. You don’t need to worry about washing frequency if you use care, however. Washing your hair more often shouldn’t cause you to lose hair., People used to advise giving your hair 100 strokes a day to make it shine or to boost blood flow to the scalp. Both of these ideas are wrong. In fact, brushing this much will cause split ends, break hair shafts, or even pull it out. You’ll end up with more hair if you’re not so zealous.Brushing causes friction on the hair. Too much of it will make your hair lusterless or frizzy.
Brush minimally, maybe once per day, in order to detangle or style.

, Something else that can cause friction on your hair and lead to damage is the wrong tool. Using a wide-tooth comb or brush will let you detangle and style your hair gently, without putting too much stress on it.Buy a wide-tooth comb/brush at your local pharmacy or salon. Some are designed specifically for detangling and they usually cost less than $20. You can also try a paddle brush with plastic-tipped bristles.
Avoid brushes made from boar’s hair. Natural bristles tend not to be uniform and can be hard on your hair and scalp.

, Vitamin E is an antioxidant and potent moisturizer, so it can help reduce inflammation from hair follicles and promote circulation that will improve the growth of your hair.

, Hair loss can be a result of weak hair, which itself may result from a poor diet or lack of certain vitamins. To strengthen your hair, make sure that you are getting all the necessary nutrients and eat well.Include fatty fish like salmon in your diet, for example. Salmon contains omega 3 fatty acids, which your body needs to grow hair and keep it full and shiny. Make sure to eat protein, too, the basic building block of hair. Try yoghurt, nuts, and lean meats like chicken.
Leafy greens can also help your hair, as they contain needed nutrients like vitamin A and C, plus beta carotene and folate.
Get enough iron, as well, from things like grains, lentils, beef, and organ meats. Iron deficiency can lead to hair loss.
Finally, condition, condition, condition. Use conditioner after every shampoo to keep your hair strong.

Take precautions before you go to bed.,
Apply a dry shampoo to your hair before you go to bed.,
If your hair is naturally a little curly, like many people's, you can shower before you go to bed.",How to Prevent Frizzy Hair1," You can get your brush a little bit wet with ice cold water. then gently brush your hair until it is smooth. then just put you hair in a very loose low ponytail, and overnight your hair should stay smooth and non frizzy. If you are wondering how this can possibly work... well, its because when the cold water is brushed through your hair, it settles the roots and all loose, split ends. Causing them to lay flat overnight.;
, You can buy it at a pharmacy, your local salon, or borrow it from a friend. It's not too expensive so don't worry. Just use the directions on the bottle, and apply to your hair. Then again, place your hair in a loose, low ponytail. Overnight, your hair will relax and frizz may appear more easily; this is why when you wake up, you need to re-comb through your hair, and it will be good to go.

, But when you are applying your conditioner, you need to use a little more than you usually do. A good conditioner will smooth your hair more easily than other products, without having to worry about the overnight frizz re-appearing.

,
You should always have a whistle on a lanyard with you while on duty.,

Condition correctly.,
Let your hair dry naturally if possible.,
Follow directions on the bottle.",How to Prevent Frizzy Hair2," If your frizz is appearing after you shower, there's an approach that can help. When applying conditioner, many people don't have enough time to do it how you are supposed to. But people who care about their hair, can always make time. Rather it's in the morning before school or work, or before bed when you are the most tired, you can always find time to improve your hair. First, apply your conditioner. But don't rinse out; leave it on for 2-3 minutes at tops, and then take a comb, and comb through the conditioner. Especially if you have really thick hair, it helps to get the conditioner through all of your hair. Then when you rinse, your hair shall be smooth as can be.

, If you are someone who likes to get right to their hair in the morning, this may not be good news for you. Blowdryers, curling irons, straighteners, and other styling tools, are not good for your hair. In fact its the opposite, although it makes your hair look good throughout the day, it's really slowly ruining your hair. Try to naturally let your hair dry after a shower, by letting it loose. Don't wrap it up in a towel after a shower; this really damages hair by breaking the ends off that are twisted. Also, don't iron it everyday; this will slowly burn the hair and fry its ends, causing broken and damaged hair.

, If you use a lot of store-bought products, make sure you read the fine print. Many products are for after showering, and many aren't. Just like how many products are for dyed and colored hair. Never use those on natural hair; it will ruin the texture and natural look to your hair. Make sure you get a product for wet hair; it will help maintain the frizz in wet hair, not dry.

Take precautions for sun exposure.,
Make sure to use the least amount of hair spray you can.,
Find some child's detangling spray.",How to Prevent Frizzy Hair3," If you live in a warm place where it is always sunny, you may want to protect your hair from being damaged by the sunlight and heat. Make sure to wear a scarf  or hat when in the sun. Not only will it protect your skin from getting sunburned, it will also keep your hair from turning a different shade of color, especially in colored hair. Besides, you can always make a hat or scarf go cute with an outfit. This should also help the frizz be maintained throughout the day.

, It may help your hair stay in place for a while. But there are many chemicals in it that are bad for hair. Many hair sprays have been proven to make frizz worse, so investigate and try different products. Use these to get rid of frizz, while keeping your hair in place.

, It may have not worked so well when you were little but it does help in tangly, frizzy hair. Just find some and spray it in the frizzy parts of your hair. Just comb it through, and soon your hair will be frizz free.

Wet your head.,
Rub a protective layer on your locks.,
Wear a swim cap.,
Wash out lingering chlorine and product.,
Condition your hair.,
Rinse off before you get in the pool.,
Avoid protective barriers on skin.,
Shower as soon as possible after you swim.,
Apply a moisturizer.",How to Protect Your Skin and Hair from Chlorine," As tempting as a dive into the pool might be, take a minute to wet your hair in the shower before you swim. Wet hair is less likely to absorb chlorinated water than dry locks.Soak your hair in the shower until it is entirely saturated. This may feel like your head is heavy.
Consider rinsing with cool water if you can. Warm water opens up the hair’s cuticle while cool water helps keep it closed. Using cool water may expose your hair to less chlorine.;
, Your head will likely be in the water all or most of the time you’re in the water. Putting a protective barrier of a hair product or even coconut oil can keep too much chlorine from seeping into your strands.Cover all of your hair with a product such as an oil or silicone-based conditioner. Hair serums also work well. If you prefer a natural product, coconut oil is a great alternative.
Recognize that protective layers of hair product or coconut oil will not leave a residue in the water.

, They aren’t the most fashionable swim accessories, but swim caps are another easy way to protect your hair from chlorine. A cap won’t keep all water or chlorine off of your hair, but it can minimize how much seeps into your locks.Purchase a latex or silicone swim cap. You can get these at sports stores, large retailers, and swimming stores.

, When you get out of the pool, it’s important to wash your hair. This will remove lingering barrier product and chlorine from you hair. It also prepares your hair for deep conditioning.Rinse your hair for a minute or two to remove the barrier product and any chlorine. This will allow any shampoo and conditioner to better penetrate your hair.
You can also try an apple cider vinegar rinse to help get the chlorine out of your hair. After shampooing and rinsing your hair with plain water, rinse it again with a mixture of one part apple cider vinegar and two parts water. Then rinse your hair with plain water again., Rinsing your hair with water and using a protective barrier is a great way to minimize the amount of chlorine your hair absorbs. But these still allow some chlorine to leech into your hair. This can strip it of its oil. Using a conditioner after shampooing can add moisture back to your hair. It may also minimize itchiness or irritation you may experience.Use a product designed for deep conditioning. You can switch back to regular conditioner on the days you don’t swim.
Consider spraying on a leave-in conditioner so that your hair gets the benefits of moisturize throughout the day.

, Just like your hair, wet skin absorbs less chlorine than dry. When you wet your hair in the shower before you swim, make sure that the water hits your skin—and swimsuit—as well. This can offer some measure of protection against chlorine on your skin. It can also keep the color of your swimsuit fresher for a longer period of time., Unlike your hair, a protective layer won’t keep chlorine off of your skin. This includes even the heartiest barriers such as petroleum jelly. Protective skin barriers can also react with the water’s chemistry by producing more molecules that can irritate skin and hair., Although you can’t protect your skin against chlorine as well as your hair, you can minimize any potential dryness and irritation. Taking a shower as soon as you get out of the pool can get the chlorine off of your skin.Consider getting a shower gel or wash with vitamin C. This can help further neutralize the chlorine on your skin and get it to wash away.

, Since chlorine strips your skin of its natural oils, preventing further dryness is the best way to protect your skin. Applying a moisturizer after every swim can add oil back to your skin and help keep it moisturized. Moisturizer can also minimize your risk for irritated skin or rashes.Use a moisturizer that is high in antioxidants such as vitamins C and E. These are not only very high in moisture, but can further neutralize any lingering chlorine on your skin.
Select a moisturizer that is a heavy cream instead of a lotion. Thicker products are generally more moisturizing than thinner ones.

Rock a rugged attitude.",How to Dress Rugged (Men)," Great rugged outfits start with the right pants. Shop for jeans, khakis and canvas with straight-cut legs, and avoid any flashy graphics or loud colors. Also, make sure you try on pants to ensure they fit comfortably. Rugged styles are about utility, so the pants shouldn’t be extremely tight or extremely baggy: look for “relaxed fit” or “straight-cut”.Buy denim. Denim is a staple of rugged looks. Buy jeans in dark or medium wash, and make sure they fit well. Look for “vintage” brands or cuts, as they often have a little extra room around the ankles and inseam.
Look for khakis. Buy a few pairs of good khakis. Khakis come in many different colors, and many of them complement rugged styles. Look for rich brown or grey khakis in comfortable fits, but avoid bright colors. Also avoid front-pleats: they’ll make you look more like an office worker and less like an outdoorsman.
Consider canvas pants. Canvas work-pants look great with rugged styles. Remember, rugged styles are all about utility and working-man aesthetic: work-pants help you look like you’re ready for a hard day’s work. Search for comfortable work-pants in khaki, navy or green.
Buy one pair of jeans with holes. Rugged clothes often appear “well-used”, so buy a pair of jeans with holes. You don’t want all of your clothes to have holes, but swapping a pair of “holey” jeans into your outfits can give your wardrobe a rugged look. Make sure not to take the look overboard, and buy jeans with only a few holes in them.;
, While pants are the basis for a rugged look, shirts emphasize and accent the style. There are many types of shirts to help round out a rugged look, from base layer t-shirts to thick wool sweaters. As with your pants, rugged shirts will need to be comfortable and straightforward, not overly tight.Buy plain t-shirts. Buy some v-neck or crew-neck shirts in plain colors. Plain shirts in white, black, navy and earth tones (brown, red-brown, dark green) create a good base-layer for your look. Many retailers sell plain t-shirts at very low cost, and you might get a discount for buying more than one. Make sure the shirts fit comfortably, and remember that they may shrink a size in the wash.
Look for Henleys. Henleys are comfortable shirts with buttons at the neck but no collar. They come in long sleeve and short sleeve versions, and are a great addition to rugged wardrobes. Buy a few in neutral colors or earth tones.Buy some flannel. Flannel shirts have been a staple of rugged looks for years, and they mix well with other rugged wardrobe pieces. They come in a variety of colors and patterns, so look for versions that go well with your undershirts and pants. Dark green/blue and red/blue combinations are classics, but you can find new and interesting colors as well. Try orange/red or navy/white to mix up the color palette of your wardrobe.
Add some wool. Wool sweaters add texture to your outfit, and they come in a variety of colors. Look for large knit sweaters in neutral colors like cream or grey. Make sure that they’re not too tight, and that they coordinate well with other items in your wardrobe.

, Outerwear helps tie your outfit together. Vests, blazers and coats put the finishing touches on an outfit and give you a further look of utility and preparedness. Look for canvas, leather and tweed pieces to pull your outfit together.


Buy some vests. Vests are great additions to your wardrobe and help give a simple t-shirt and jeans look some class and variety. Vests come in many styles, from thin wool vests to down-filled outerwear vests. Look for vests in canvas, wool, tweed or denim and pair them with coordinating pants and shirts. Also look for workman’s vests from Carhartt or Dickies in brown or khaki colors: these will give your outfit a no-nonsense vibe.
Get a blazer. A tweed or dark colored blazer can be used to elevate your style when you need to dress up. Pair an earthy colored tweed or navy blazer with a flannel, henley or thick sweater.Shop for coats. There are many options available for outer jackets. Consider a military-themed jacket or a shearling jean jacket. Many “classic” outerwear pieces like pea coats, canvas hooded parkas, or leather jackets work well too. As with all of your clothing pieces, look for neutral or earth tone coats in solid colors.

, Bright, neon colors will throw off your rugged look. Rugged fashion takes clues from classic pieces and stereotypical “masculine” styles. Overly bright colors are a recent fashion development and won’t mesh well with a rugged look. Similarly, loud graphics like animal prints or large logos are garish and distract from a rugged, classic vibe.

, Much of the best rugged clothes have a “well-worn” feel. Thrift stores often have a great selection of thick-knit sweaters, flannels and classic jeans. Check out local thrift stores or garage sales for gently used clothes and accessories. Thrift stores will also help keep down the price of a new clothes, and you can donate your old clothes once you're finished building your new wardrobe., While you won’t want too many accessories, a few understated items of wristwear can help round out your look. Watches are a classic style accessory, and come in a variety of great styles. You can also add a few leather or woven bracelets to your wardrobe.Shop for watches. Watches can be expensive, but a good watch will last your whole life. Look for plain, leather banded watches with classic analog faces. Avoid plastic watches, flashy watches with too much “bling”, or watches with oversized faces. Take your watch game further by buying two or three, then mixing or matching them with different outfits.
Buy bracelets. Bracelets are an inexpensive way to mix up an outfit. Look for dark or black leather bracelets, or bracelets woven from neutral-colored cord.
Don’t overload on jewelry. Too much jewelry will clash with a rugged look. Rugged style is about plain, classic styles, and an overload of “bling” will throw off the look. Avoid gold chains, multiple rings or other gaudy jewelry.

, Shoes are a great way to finish off your outfit, and they’ll help pull the look together. Leather, suede and canvas will make up the majority of your wardrobe, so look for those materials in shoes as well. Choose a few pairs of shoes to go with different outfits, then mix and match them to create new looks.Buy leather boots. Leather boots are a staple of “masculine” fashion, and they come in a variety of styles that will work for your style. Look for brown or black leather lace-up boots, and choose between low or high-rise ankles. Both will look great with your outfits, and the choice comes down to your preference. Tuck your pants into your boots or leave them out, depending on your preference as well.
Look for moccasins or chukkas. Moccasins and chukka boots look great with rugged, outdoorsy styles. Moccasins are low-rise, Native American inspired shoes made from leather or suede, while chukkas are higher-rise suede boots with only a few lace-holes. Look for dark or medium-brown moccasins or chukkas, and make sure your moccasins don’t have any ornamentation or fringe.
Get a pair of dress shoes. A nice pair of oxfords or brogues will go well with your rugged style when you need to dress it up. Look for shoes in dark browns or bright, earthier browns.
Avoid tennis shoes. Some sneakers may come in browns or suedes, and they’ll look alright with a rugged style. However, most styles of gym shoes feature bright colors and synthetic fabrics that will clash with your look.

, Brown leather belts with simple buckles are important to a rugged look. Not only will they hold your pants up, but they’ll also give your outfit a simple and classic vibe. Look for a plain belt that matches your shoes or boots., Socks are an often-overlooked part of your closet, but they can really help round out your style. Look for wool knitted socks at an outdoor store. These will pair well with your moccasins or boots. Thick dress socks in neutral or earth tones go well with brown brogues or oxfords., One of the most important parts of any style is learning how to properly layer and combine pieces of clothing. Most rugged clothing pieces go together without much planning, but there’s still an art to mixing and matching. Start by choosing a pair of pants, then add a shirt that goes well with the color and style of the pants. Then layer on a sweater, vest or blazer. Pay attention to the textures of the clothes: the more textures you add to an outfit (wool, canvas, cotton), the more rugged and versatile your outfit will look. Then add a pair of shoes and socks that complement your outfit. Finally, add your wristwear., Hair is a very important part of rugged style. If your hair is short, sweep it back with bit of pomade. If you have longer hair, use a matte finishing paste to give your hair some choppy waves. Remember, rugged fashion takes cues from classic styles, so don’t go too outlandish or long with your hair.Grow some facial hair. If you’re able to, try growing a bit of scruff. A small beard can help you give off a rugged vibe. Make sure to trim it up a bit though: rugged doesn’t necessarily mean unkempt.

, Ruggedness isn’t just about clothes. If you really want to pull off a rugged look, you’ll have to delve into stereotypical “masculinity” a bit to round off the look. “Rugged” men aren’t afraid to do some hard work and get their hands dirty, so try to adopt and incorporate this mentality into your daily life. Also, though it’s certainly not required, consider hitting the gym. A little muscle under your shirts will go a long way to add to your rugged persona."

Skirts or dresses that are too short. If the skirt is anywhere above the knee then it is too short.






Clothing that is too tight. Clothes don't have to be overly baggy or ill-fitting to be ""modest"", but they should not cling to your body. It can be fitted but if the cloth has to stretch for you to put your hand under it, it's a bit too tight.






Shirts that are see-through. Pair these with a modest t-shirt or other top underneath if you wish to wear them. Use your best judgment.






Sleeveless shirts. Capped sleeves are okay, just no halter tops, or shirts with straps. (If you really want to wear a dress or shirt that has straps then a great alternative is to wear a cute coat or sweater over it. It will cover your shoulders and keep you modest. Just make sure to keep it on the entire time!)






Any shirt that is too low cut in the front or back. Also, it is inappropriate to wear t-shirts with slogans on them, especially to church. Also, don't wear any garments that have lots of skin showing or bra backs or straps. Also, no shirts that will expose your body when you bend over or lift your arms.

Otipet developed in the city of Ensha around 2010, as a response to strict social class norms that prevented the lower middle class from wearing any ""flashy"" clothing. This only furthered the divide between economic classes.
In protest, many teenagers started wearing clothing that would be normally considered plain and normal, except coordinate them or modify them in strange ways. For example, they would pair a long, loose wrap top with a skirt modified to be knee length. In other words, they would wear clothing that's otherwise boring and wear it in a flashy way.;
, Black is considered the default, humble color. While other colors such as brown and dark green are occasionally acceptable in small amounts, it's very hard for a beginner that doesn't understand the culture behind it to pull off.

, Embellishments include buttons, visible zippers, beads, laces, embroidery, frills, tassels, studs, and everything similar. Everything you wear should be purely fabric.

, Unless it's extremely simple and made of cloth (like cloth wristbands), it isn't allowed.

, Skirts are required (no pants), so invest in some good plain, black maxi skirts. If you're feeling daring, get some knee length or shorter skirts as well. Make sure that everything is black and plain, Also, other commonly worn items are:


A plain, long black scarf.
Simple cloth wristbands (often homemade; worn in Chusha by all classes to make the wrists appear smaller).
Head wraps/scarves.
Solid black tights.
Plain canvas shoes.
Easy to layer socks in various shades of black.
Plain black shirts.
Plain black shawls.

, They're such a common feature in Otipet that they're deserving of their own step; get a large variety, from chunky knit mittens to long, soft arm warmers. As long as they're plain black and lack embellishments, they will be useful.

, Big, chunky braids, hair carefully teased to be bigger, and dreadlocks are most common. Regardless of social position, in Chusha, the bigger the hair the better!


Hair must be as long as possible, for both boys and girls. It's a sign of health and beauty.
Don't dye your hair an unnatural color. If you already have, dye it back, or if you really must keep it, at least try to fade it.
Consider dying your hair a few shades darker.

, For example, wear your aforementioned chunky knit gloves with a long, flowing skirt. Wear a different kind of sock on each leg. Wear a short skirt with a modest shawl. The point is to follow the ""rules"", yet still be contradictory and flashy in a roundabout way.

, Have too many maxi skirts? Cut the hem of one to make it asymmetrical. Accidentally tear the feet of your tights? Modify them to be a shrug instead.

, In Chusha it is still pretty normal for women to go completely topless, or at least to wear revealing tops. There's nothing strange about it. While most women will not be able to go topless, they still will be able to wear something that defies Western notions of modesty without going against traditional Chusha modesty norms.


Chusha fashion is androgynous, and the men and women wear the same type of clothes. While some Otipet elements are borrowed from Western female fashion, they would not seem strange at all worn in Chusha and should not be too feminine when worn properly by a man.

Draw inspiration from Kylie's muses.,
Add your own flavor.",How to Dress Like Kylie Jenner," Kylie usually chooses loose-fitting (and sometimes low-cut) shirts like might be found at American Apparel. Occasionally, Kylie opts for a bare midriff or a tucked-in look paired with high-waisted shorts. In terms of tops, Kylie's taste is all across the board. She's known to casually wear oversized hoodies and retro boyfriend-style tees, but when the occasion calls for it, she's just as comfortable in a stunning blazer or a multi-colored blouse.


Add some variety to your tops. Even though Kylie's known for wearing her signature loose-cut tops, she's been seen wearing halter-top ensembles and tight, sleeveless tees. Keep a few outfits that don't fit your typical style to add spice to your wardrobe.
Kylie has expressed a love for overalls. She's been spotted wearing them out and about paired with a tighter-fitting undershirt and she's even designed a denim pair for her fashion line.;
, Whether you're looking at a shady paparazzi picsor a pro red-carpet photos, it's hard to find shots of Kylie where she's not wearing black, white, or both! Black and white go with almost any color and never go out of style. What's not to like? Keep a selection of black and white pieces in your wardrobe and use them generously in your outfits for a classy, timeless look.








, Kylie wears her shorts and skirts high-waisted and well above the knee. She's been known to sport this summertime look even well into the fall months.Pair some cutoff shorts with a low-cut top and some boots for a flirty cowgirl look that's totally Kylie!









Don't be afraid to show off your legs, but keep things reasonable! Too short, and your shorts will start to look like underwear!
Kylie rocks distressed denim as her preferred short fabric.
Kylie sometimes pairs an uber-short pair of shorts with an extra-long t-shirt. Sometimes, this can give a ""pajamas"" look.If you're bold (or just want to pretend you're sleepwalking), go for it!

, Kylie generally wears her pants tight all the way through the calf. This is a bold choice in any outfit, but it's also surprisingly versatile! Depending on your other fashion choices, this style of pants can fit nicely into anything from a ""club-ready"" to a ""job interview"" type outfit.


For instance, when Kylie and her sister appeared on ""The View,""Kylie paired a tight red pair of dress pants with a broad-shouldered white blazer for a mature, elegant look. However, wearing a similar pair of pants while out and about, she look much more casual with a loose black top., Kylie has been know to wear form-fitting, classic dressesas well as ""out-there,"" oversized pieces.There's no one Kylie Jenner dress - she's very versatile when it comes to donning dresses. Kylie shows a preference for her trademark black and white, though she's no stranger to neon dresses.With her sister, she's even modeled puffy, flowery dresses, rhinestone-studded gowns, and flowing, Cleopatra-inspired numbers. Go crazy with your dress choices!


Experiment! Kylie's taste in dresses is diverse - the only common variable is that it's always changing.

, The Jenner sisters have been known to wear a wide variety of shoes depending on the occasion. On the red carpet, Kylie usually wears pumps or even platform heels for an elegant look (and an extra inch or two!) On the street or hanging with her friends, Kylie wears stylish sandals, boots (cowboy-style or high-quality leather), or skater-inspired sneakers (Vans, Converse, etc.)


When dressing for fancy occasions, Kylie sometimes pairs abstract, out-there heels with an outfit that's otherwise very low-key. The effect is striking, but unless you're already a celebrity, it might not make sense to invest in experimental, high-fashion footwear you'll only wear once.
Kylie's casual shoes come in a variety of patterns and styles - everything from leopard-print low-tops to understated black skater sneakers. Keep it fun and functional - no matter how cool a shoe looks, it's no good if you can't walk in it.

, Your style choices don't have to end with the clothes you wear. Consider your purse, earrings, jewelry, bracelets, and more when putting your outfit together. This is a great chance to be creative - if you're going for the classic Kylie black-and-white look, almost any color of accessory will go with your outfit.


The Jenner sisters especially like oversize black leather purses and handbags. However, at red carpet events, they've been known to bring along small, swanky pocketbooks that match the color of their dress.

, Good makeup can be the cherry on top of a perfect outfit. It's rare to see either of the Jenner sisters overly-made-up, so keep the mantra ""less is more"" in mind when applying your own makeup. Kylie likes to go for a minimally-made up with light highlights around the eyes and some shiny lipgloss. Occasionally, she'll go bold with some bright red or crimson lipstick - if you want to go for the 1940s pinup look, go for it!


When in doubt, skimp on the makeup when applying it and bring it with you - you can always put more on later!

, Not surprisingly, Kylie and Kendall's biggest fashion role-models are their sisters!Kourtney, Kim & Khloe are international fashion icons in their own right - watch ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" or any of its spin offs for plenty of fashion ideas from the Jenner and Kardashian sisters!


Warning - ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" began airing in 2007. Fashion trends have changed substantially since then - in the sisters' own words, fashion choices in the early episodes were not always good ones. ""Kylie would wear zebra-print leggings with bright blue shorts and a bright blue colored shirt and Converse that went up to ,"" says Kendall of Kylie's early wardrobe., Kylie and Kendall may be fashion icons at 16 and 17 respectively, but that doesn't mean their sense of style should overrule your own fashion instincts. For a truly unforgettable look, inject your own creativity into your outfits. Experiment with clothing and accessories that the sisters wouldn't wear. Remember to be yourself! It's fun to imitate the looks of our favorite fashionistas, but it's also important to cultivate our own identities. Use common sense and don't take fashion too seriously - a girl is much, much more important than her clothes!

Wear the right shoes.,
Wear the right underwear.,
Wear the right clothes.,
Wear the right accessories.,
Wear the right makeup.",How to Dress Like a Stripper1," The most important thing is to pick heels a minimum of 3 inches, preferably 6. These will be the most flattering for your legs and stomach. If you really plan to wear these for stripping, look for shoes with plastic 1-piece soles and heels, as these will be most durable and forgiving. Sticking no-slip pads on the bottom is also a good idea.Don’t overstep yourself. If you’re not comfortable walking in heels, work your way up to them, rather than going straight to 6-inch heels.
Use a blow drier to mold plastic shoes to the shape of your feet. Soften the plastic with the warm air, and slip the shoe on when it is pliable but not hot. Use your hands to gently mold it to your foot, and let it cool.Look for the most comfortable heels you can find. Heels are by nature not the most comfortable shoes in the world, but your feet will thank you if you keep comfort in mind as you shop.;
, Many strippers purchase dancing bottoms designed specifically for that purpose, instead of normal underwear or bikini bottoms.If you are just dressing up for fun or fashion, though, a thong will work just fine.


Neon colors and lace are always good choices.
Not many real strippers wear G-strings, because many state laws require a certain amount of skin to be covered. Of course, no one is going to call you on that if you’re just dressing up for fun.Erotic dancewear, which is more durable and flexible than underwear or bathing suit bottoms, can be purchased from websites like Spurst, BodyKandi, or Yandy.
Incorporate your personal taste—wear what makes you feel sexy!

, There are lots of ways you can go with this, and as always, the most important part is to pick something that makes you feel hot. There are a number of other factors to consider, however.



Fit: The biggest priority is to pic something flattering. Tight-fitting things are great, as are low-cut tops, and short bottoms.

Color: Neon colors are always popular, and black or red can be very dramatic. You should of course take into consideration which colors look best with your skin tone and hair color. If you really plan on stripping in a club, avoid white. Most strip clubs have black lights, and white clothing can be problematic.Fabric: Distressed denim is a classic, whether you’re wearing Daisy Dukes or a denim miniskirt. Jersey, lycra, or other fabrics that allow you to move without restriction will make dancing easier. You might also consider wearing something see-through.

Style: Dresses are the most natural choice, as they are easiest to remove quickly. You might also consider wearing a low-cut shirt with a miniskirt, leggings and a crop top, shorts and a bikini top, or a leotard with a garter belt and garters, if you’re looking for a more burlesque look., Many genuine strippers don’t wear much in the way of jewelry, as it tends to get in the way or create a distraction. There are some options to consider, however.


Piercings can be fun, as long as they don’t get in the way. Consider getting one in your navel or nose. Studs or very small hoops will be the least likely to get caught on things.
Glitter adds sparkle to you look without adding clunky jewelry.Hair extensions will let you flip your hair around in a sexy way.A garter belt can give you that old-school pinup girl look.
A collar or leather choker could be a good choice if you are going for a kinky, bondage vibe.
Fishnet stockings are a sexy classic.

, Of course, there is no one way strippers make themselves up, and the most important thing is to find a style that makes you feel sexy. There are thousands of makeup tutorial videos available to watch online if you want to improve your makeup game.If you’re already a makeup pro, there are some simple ideas to consider.Dark, smoky eyeshadow
Cat eyes
Thick mascara, or fake eyelashesThin, highly arched, penciled eyebrows
Glossy lips
Liberal layers of foundation and concealer to hide any flaws in your skin (consider applying these to your body as well as your face—one thing that sets strippers’ beauty routine apart from that of other women is the extent to which they apply makeup to their bodies)"
"
Wear briefs.,
Wear short, tight clothes.,
Invest in some tear-off clothes.,
Think twice about body hair.,
Consider makeup.",How to Dress Like a Stripper2," Boxers are not form-fitting enough, and for whatever reason, many people are not particularly attracted to men in thongs.Buy contoured, well-fitting briefs that accentuate your body.

, There are fewer clothing options out there for men, and this tends to be a less important part of male strippers’ lives.The most important thing to remember is to show a lot of skin, and to wear clothes tight enough to show off the muscles underneath., This is one of the defining qualities of the clothes worn by male strippers. While you can buy pre-made tear-off clothes, any clothes can be turned into tear-off clothes. Purchase clothing 3 or 4 sizes too big, and install Velcro along the outer seams. If you are crafty you can do this yourself, but if not a tailor will easily be able to help., Some strippers cultivate a persona for which facial or body hair is appropriate, but as a general rule most strippers are pretty hairless. Consider keeping your face shaved clean and getting your chest waxed.

, Not all male strippers use makeup, but if you are performing in a club you may find the stage lights wash out the definition in your facial features. If so, one way to increase your tips might be to start applying a little stage makeup. If done right, this should enhance your features, rather than making it immediately apparent that you are wearing makeup.


If you do have facial hair, use an eyebrow pencil to give it definition.
Apply a neutral foundation under your cheekbones to exaggerate their shape.
Line your lips with a neutral foundation. You may also want to apply some lip balm to keep them from drying out.
Brown eyeliner can make your eyelashes appear thicker. Stop before you get to the corners of your eyes—if the lines meet, the effect will be too obvious.
Lightly mist yourself with a glitter spray to draw eyes to your muscles.

Shave with oil.,
Wash your face well.,
Smell good.,
Take care of your nails.",How to Dress Like a Stripper3," This will help prevent red bumps, and will help keep your skin moisturized. Coconut oil works especially well, and will make you smell good too. If it is solid, rub it between your hands to warm it up before applying it to your legs.


To get extra smooth skin, exfoliate your body before shaving.Remember, when shaving your legs, shave against the grain; when shaving your bikini zone, shave with the grain.
You will probably want to keep your bikini zone close to hairless, so it may be better to skip shaving and get it professionally waxed.
A little oil goes a long way. Don’t use too much., Washing your face is an important part of anyone’s routine if you want to avoid breakouts or oily skin. It is especially important, however, if you tend to wear a lot of makeup.


Wash your hands first. You can’t get your face clean with dirty fingers.Use makeup remover to ensure you skin is totally clear.Exfoliate gently. Scrubbing aggressively can damage your skin, rather than cleaning it.Rinse with warm water.Dry your face with a clean towel.Use a cotton ball to apply toner to problem areas., You want your presence to be alluring and intoxicating. People should want to be near you. That means you have to smell good.


Wear perfume. Find something subtle and sweet. Most importantly, it should be something you like. You’ll be inhaling more of it than anyone else, after all. That said, pay attention to people’s responses. If you get a lot of wrinkled noses, retire that perfume.
If you are allergic to perfume, or just plain don’t like it, moisturizing with coconut oil and washing your face with a fragrant soap will give you a more subtle sweet smell. Make sure not to overdo it with the scents, as this can be incredibly off-putting., This is a surprisingly important part of your overall presentation, and it can make a big difference.A stripper with sloppy nails will seem much cheaper than one with well-manicured nails.


Leave it to a professional. Unless you are very good at doing your own, go out and have a professional work on your nails.
Remember your feet. This is especially important if you wear open-toe shoes.Treat yourself to a pedicure every so often. If you are a real stripper, however, make sure not to let them remove the callouses on your feet—you need them!You don’t need to go crazy; you don’t want your nails to be a distraction. A neutral color with French tips will do just fine.

Sites like GQ, Esquire, and Fashion Beans are full of what’s currently trending and offer you style tips.To dress like a male model, your look should have some basics that are versatile and show off your style.
Items you should have in your closet: A suit, jeans, chinos, button downs, plain t-shirt, sweater, dress shoes, boots, and sneakers.If you like the preppier look, go with colorful items. Opt for more chinos than jeans; oxford button downs over lighter woven cotton.
If you’re opting more for the street style, then stock your wardrobe with different shades of the same color. Opt for jeans over chinos and trousers, and a slimmer fit.;
, Clothes that fit your body correctly can make you seem taller, thinner, broader, or more evenly proportioned.


If you have broader shoulders and a smaller waist, go with straight or slim cut pants to balance out your proportions. V-neck shirts will help narrow your chest, balancing your body out. When it’s time to wear a jacket or blazer, an unstructured one with slim lapels will widen your torso, without adding too much volume to your shoulders.
If you have wider hips and narrower shoulders, focus on straight cut clothing that fits closely to your body. When wearing a blazer, a well structured, single-breasted one will broaden your shoulders and slim your torso.
Getting clothes that fit you correctly involves more than just wearing the right size. You have to factor in how the cut of a garment works with your body type as well.
Consult a personal stylist to give you advice on what types of colors, cuts, and styles fit your body type the best.
Don’t wear something just because you like how it looks. If it doesn’t look good on you, then it’s not right.

, From accessories to the patterns on your socks, getting the finer points right makes a huge difference. Add the right finishing touches and you’ll look like you stepped right off the runway.Roll up your jeans and pair them with something as simple as a nice t-shirt, colorful socks, and some loafers for a stylish look that pops.
The right tie, socks, belts, and shoes tie your whole outfit together. Stick to similar colors and patterns, i.e., brown belt and brown shoes.
If you feel so inclined, add some bracelets, necklaces, or earrings. Just don’t overdo it. Smaller items are meant to be small statement pieces, not in the foreground.

, You can look like model a t-shirt, jeans, and boots; or in a three-piece suit. Dressing like a model really comes down to feeling confident in your look and owning your style.









Emulate the style of your favorite celebrity for inspiration.
Play around with different combinations of pieces to find a look that’s unique to you. Try Blazers with jeans. Swap out your suit jacket for a cardigan. Dress down a formal outfit with nice sneakers.
Overall, dressing like a male model is about wearing outfits that accentuate your physical strengths leaving you feeling confident in how you look.

, When the occasion calls for more of a sophisticated look, like your job, take pride in dressing up. Ditch the wrinkled, oversized button down and pleated khakis. Instead, wear a tailored blazer with chinos or trousers.









You can wear a tailored suit and tie, or deconstruct it to go more relaxed. Pair the jacket and tie with dark wash jeans, or forget the tie altogether for a classy, yet carefree look.
Your jacket should be cut so that it makes you look slim and gives your torso a nice trapezoid look that’s wider at the shoulders. Your sleeves should come down to your wrist bone so that the cuff of your shirt peeks out about half an inch.
Your trousers should drape nicely with clean lines from your waist. Avoid pants that bunch up in the back. Depending on your personal style, you want the break of the pants to just kiss the top of your shoes.

, When it comes to work and other events where you are expected to be dressier, don’t be afraid to boldly mix things up. You can easily add, subtract, or swap pieces to change your style instantly.


Need to go straight from the office to an after-work event? Wear a blazer, oxford shirt, and chinos. If the office has a stricter dress policy, wear a tie with a tie-clip during work. Then, ditch the tie, and loosen a button on your shirt.
Keep the loafers or wingtips on if you’re heading somewhere upscale, or swap them for a pair of clean sneakers if you’re going for drinks.
Coordinate your colors to give you a polished look that’s perfect for work and play. Navy and beige work well together. A black blazer pairs perfectly with gray legwear.

, Whether it’s the weekend or a day away from the office, take a more relaxed approach. Leave the structures of your day job, and your suit for the work week and throw on a sweater or jacket.


You want a well-fitting shirt that doesn’t have loud patterns and a crew neck sweater that fits without exposing the buttons underneath or bunching up. Pair with your favorite sneakers and any type of legwear.
If you want more of a street look and less of a prep school vibe, swap the sweater out for a denim jacket. Pair the jacket with beige or dark green chinos.
If the buttoned up shirt isn’t your style, try layers. Start with a thin henley, and add an overshirt. An unbuttoned overshirt in buffalo check or solid color will add weight to your look and isn’t as heavy as a jacket.

, Sometimes, an event calls for formal wear, like a gala or wedding. On these occasions, your best look is a suit or tuxedo. While you don’t always have to go all the way, if you’re going to a casual wedding, it’s best to start more formal and work your way down.


When wearing a tuxedo, the same rules of tailoring and fit apply. The jacket should be broader at the shoulders and slimmer through the waist.Slimmer men can stand out with a short peak lapel on a double breasted jacket. The peak lapel has a pointed cut that extends past the collar, giving you a broader look.
The notch lapel is perfect for any occasion and any body type. However, a slimmer notch will give you a more fashionable, modern look.
The shawl collar is the most formal of the three lapels and is reminiscent of smoking jackets and gentlemen's clubs.
You can go more formal by adding a vest under your jacket. Or, take the look down a bit by keeping the vest and taking off the tie.

, When the sun’s out and the weather doesn’t allow for many layers, you have a lot less to work with. In these months, dressing like a model can be simple with the right colors and items.


If you want the rugged model look, a white or beige t-shirt or henley is a great place to start. Pair with dark blue or black jeans and black boots. Swap out the pants for a a pair of non-pleated shorts that land just above your knee. Take off the boots and put on a pair of loafers, boat shoes, or canvas sneakers.
Go bold with statement stripes. Stripes are a staple for spring and summer, and will make you stand out. Pair tailored striped shorts or pants with a solid colored button down, thin long-sleeve shirt, or vise-versa. Try bolder stripes to switch up your look. If you’re broader, go vertical, and if you’re slimmer, horizontal.You can also sport floral if you’re feeling extra bold. Make your floral piece the focal point of your look, pairing it with subdued neutrals.

, Autumn and winter allow you to really show off your runway style because you can add layers for more robust looks. Jackets, sweaters, and darker legwear are some staples to start with.


Grey and navy blazers and suits are versatile. Wear as a suit or paired with chinos, jeans, or trousers. If you want to keep warm and still suit up, consider a light vest under your blazer. This is a stylish look that lets you flaunt your wardrobe in the fall without freezing.
Dark colored cardigans are a perfect replacement to your suit jacket when the weather turns. If you want some color, opt for mustard yellow, or maroon. If you’re feeling really bold, sport a checked blazer for an upscale English style.
Flannel shirts and lighter vests are another great combination for when you feel like a relaxed look.
For outer layers, a raincoat, or fitted pea coat are always fashionable.
In these colder months, boots are your friend. Hiking boots are great for a weekend cabin look. Chelsea boots can be dressed up with wool trousers, or dressed down with jeans. Brogue and desert boots are versatile enough for anywhere in between.To complete your look, scarves, leather gloves, and minimal wool hats tie the look together.

, Depending on the season, you want to incorporate certain fabrics that will keep you cool when it’s warm, and warm when it’s cold.


While cotton is a year-round fabric, it really works in the spring and summer. Not only does cotton breathe, but it holds its shape, whatever the type of garment. White or beige lightweight cotton works for a t-shirt, or when you need to dress up, with a blazer.
Linen is a durable summer fabric that won’t make you feel like you’re in a sauna. Linen suits are perfect for a summer wedding or cocktail party. Linen knitwear, like a light sweater, can be perfect for those cold mornings and nights.
Wool is your most valuable fabric in colder weather. Merino wool sweaters are great when you want an extra layer but need something light. Cashmere is great for pairing with a suit when the occasion calls for more formal dress. Worsted wool suits are best for colder months and add a stylish texture to your look.
Flannel is another great option for shirts and trousers. A plaid flannel shirt is a staple for a casual day. Flannel trousers kick up your look a notch and feel extremely comfortable.
Try a monochrome palette for a year round street style look. Pick items that stand out more for shape than color. Try a look that’s all black, or gray, or blue. For this look you want to avoid bright “loud” colors.

Keep in mind the guidelines of 1860s dress that were very strict.,
Put on a chemise.,
Don a corset.,
Tie the corset.,
Put on your stockings.,
Put on your pantalettes.,
Lace up your shoes.,
Tie on your hoop skirt.,
Don your blouse.,
Put on your skirt.,
Put on gloves.,
Style your hair.,
Put on a hat.,
Have good posture, a warm smile, and an open heart to being a Southern belle!

",How to Dress Like a Southern Belle," A few rules that were always followed:


A lady never showed anything below her collarbone before five o'clock PM.
A girl under the age of twenty-one never wore red.
A hat or bonnet was always worn outdoors.
A lady never removed her gloves, even on the dance floor. Eating with gloves, however, was considered extremely rude.
Hair was to be kept at the nape of the neck, with the bangs pinned back. The only exception, again, was on the dance floor.
Post-style earrings, or any earring besides fishhook-style earrings, were not invented.
Sleeves always extended to a lady's wrist, unless of course, she was on the dance floor.
Unmarried women never wore feathers in their hair.;
, Though your undergarments don't necessarily have to be authentic, a chemise is necessary to keep your corset from digging painfully into your skin. An authentic chemise would be similar to today's short-sleeved cotton blouse. If you're in a pinch for time, don't like the feel of chemises, or simply don't want to fork over an extra thirty dollars to be ""authentic"", you can use a short-sleeved white T-shirt or white tank top instead. Remember, since you're wearing a corset, you won't need to wear a bra under your chemise unless you feel it is absolutely necessary.

, To put on a corset, unlace it completely. Then thread the string through the bottom pair of holes and make sure an even amount of string is on each side. Pull the corset over your head. There are many different types of corsets, and many ways to tighten yours up. If you have a plain canvas corset with no shape, you can lace it in the front. This is to your advantage. If you have a custom-made corset, or a corset with boning, you will have to lace it in the back. It will probably be helpful to have a friend lace it for you. Hold on to a doorframe or bedpost and allow your friend to lace up the back, much like you would a sneaker.

, To tie it, first tie a plain knot at the top after the corset is laced. Press your finger on the knot as hard as you can, and have a friend tie the string in a bow as tightly as they can. If your corset slips down, you will be constantly annoyed. This is why you may also want to safety pin the top and bottom of your corset to your chemise.


Remember, a corset is optional. If you're flatter-chested or thinner, you may be able to go without a corset. Simply wear a bra and chemise. Keep in mind though, that while this is the more comfortable option, a corset will give you a smoother look and help keep your posture in check.

, Any stockings will work, so long as they go past the knee. Modern dress stockings from any department store will suffice. Pull the stocking as high as it will go. Then, slide a garter up your leg until it is about one inch underneath the top of the stocking. Fold the top over the garter, and then roll the stocking and the garter down to just below your knee. This will keep your stockings up throughout the day.


Many ladies chose to put ankle socks over their stockings to avoid blistering. This is up to you.

, Pantalettes are a lady's version of pantaloons. They are basically capri-length, very light cotton undergarments. Back in the 1860s, all pantalettes had a drawstring tie, but many that you will find today will simply have an elastic waistband. The more authentic version of pantalettes have no crotch, but again, many you find today do have a crotch. Most women also choose to wear panties with their pantalettes, although real Southern belles did not. Simply pull your pantalettes up to wherever you like to pull your jeans to, and tuck your chemise into them. In a pinch, or in order to save money, you can simply buy an inexpensive pair of capri-length pajama pants to use as pantalettes.

, The shoes worn at the time would have been an unattractive lace-up boot, likely in black or brown. They lace like sneakers, but take a large amount of time to put on. If you are going only to dance, you may wish to wear anything from white house slippers to pink ballet shoes to flats.

, A hoop skirt may have anywhere from three to eight bones (plastic hoops running through the fabric), though the typical one Southern belles would have worn would have had six. There are many variations on the hoop. Some hoops are covered in ruffles or tulle, while others only have thin cotton stretched tightly between the bones. Tie your hoop as tightly as possible in the front or back, and pin it to your chemise to keep it from sliding.

, Simply put it on and button it in either the front or back, depending on the style. Remember that Southern belles generally wore cotton blouses, similar to the ones often worn today, though the patterns and colors may have varied. Don't forget to always cover everything from the collarbone and wrists up.

, Simply pull it over, tuck your blouse in, and button. Remember that a lady's hoop would never show. Your skirt should fall about 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) from the ground, without dragging.

, There are many variations on gloves, and almost no set rules. Gloves went to the wrist, and usually had one button or no buttons. They could be silk or cotton of almost any color or pattern, so long as it complimented a lady's dress. Some gloves had fingers, while others did not. Still other gloves were made of ""fishnet"". Some fishnet gloves have fingers, some do not. All of these gloves should be readily available to you. Department stores should carry plain silk gloves in the winter if this is the easiest buy for you.

, Hair was almost always worn with the front section rolled or braided back, and the rest twisted and pinned in a roll at the nape of the neck. Hair was never worn more than two inches or so above the neck.

, In the summer, ladies wore Palomino (straw) hats with ribbons or flowers that matched their dresses. In the winter, ladies wore bonnets made of thicker material. Straw bonnets may also be worn in the summer. A lady is never outside without a hat on, or inside with a hat on, unless she happens to be in church.

You don't want to be exactly like one certain model, but using a specific model (or models) is a great way to get inspiration and develop a style plate for your own wardrobe. Some models that you could draw inspiration from are Kate Moss, Ashley Graham, Iman, and Shaun Ross.Go to public runways. Around fashion week, there are sometimes a public runway, so everybody can see the newest trends. Fashion weeks for women are held in February and September/October. Fashion weeks for men are held in January and June/July.;
, Models often go for a simple and clean look. This is because model scouts and agents like the blank canvas look. A simple look usually means that there aren’t a lot of wild designs, colors, or accessories. Choose simple designs with muted colors. A classic basic outfit is an all black outfit.A simple black outfit may include a black blazer, black T-shirt (crew or V-neck), and black skinny jeans. Or, you could wear a black dress and leggings.
Another example of a basic outfit could be light denim skinny jeans with a basic white T-shirt and a pastel cardigan.

, A fitted jacket is a staple of a model’s wardrobe because it can be dressed up or down. You can wear it during warmer weather, or wear it during colder weather underneath a heavier jacket. Look for a jacket that is high-quality and fits you very well. The material you choose doesn’t matter, but a fitted leather jacket is common.If you can’t find a jacket that fits perfectly, consider taking it to a tailor.

, Skinny jeans show off your body shape and can be paired with a variety of outfits. For a casual outfit, look for a pair of light denim jeans. Black skinny jeans will go with almost anything. To make your legs look longer, wear a pair of cropped skinny jeans that show a bit of your ankle.Wear your skinny jeans with a pair of ankle boots.
You can wear skinny jeans with a very long dress-like shirt, sweater, or a crop top, depending on the occasion and weather.

, Layers are popular with models right now. You don’t have to wear thick layers that will make you look bulky. Instead, wear light layers. For example, wear a thin camisole with with a mesh top over it and a long, tasseled vest over the mesh top.You can also layer by wearing a camisole with a long shirt over it and a sweater over the long shirt.
Layers usually include items of clothing like shirts and sweaters, not jeans and leggings.

, If the basic style is not for you, then consider mixing prints. You don’t have to match perfectly to dress like a model. Fashion is all about experimentation, so mixing prints is encouraged. For instance, wear striped pants with a polka dot shirt and animal print sweater.Another example of mixing prints is wearing a shirt with pineapples, a plaid cardigan, and striped pants.

, Though they are not for everyone, high heels are a staple most commonly for female fashion models. High heels can make you appear taller, slimmer, and give you better posture. A pair of black stilettos can go with a variety of outfits, from skinny jeans to little black dresses. You can also wear heels like wedges and platforms, but stilettos give off the model vibe the most.High heels are hard on your body, especially if worn for long periods of time. Only wear them if they are not painful to you.

, You don’t have to exclusively wear high heels to be a model, especially if feminine fashion is not for you. You can also choose to wear loafers, ankle boots, or even tennis shoes. Doctor Martens are also especially popular right now. Boots are a great way to add edge to even the simplest outfits.Some other examples of flats are ballet flats, moccasins, Oxford shoes, and Mary Janes.

, Models are often seen wearing designer shades out in public. You don’t, however, have to purchase expensive designer sunglasses. Wear any type of sunglasses that make you feel confident. You can choose from styles, like cat-eye, aviators, and rounded glasses.Sunglasses are not only stylish, but they protect your eyes from the sun’s harsh rays.

, If you like to carry purses, bring a simple clutch or chain handbag. A chain handbag is ideal because it is small and stylish. If you prefer backpacks, look for a simple leather backpack.You can also carry a tote bag or a purse in a fun shape (like lips or a spaceship).

, To liven up a simple outfit, wear quirky socks. Quirky socks work best when they can be seen. For example, wear them with cropped skinny jeans or a skirt. You can wear socks with unexpected things on them, like breakfast foods, or choose a funky, bright pattern.The socks don’t have to have patterns, you can also wear socks with lace ruffles in a variety of colors.
You can also wear quirky socks with sandal heels.

, Good posture is not only good for your back, but it also makes you appear confident. Walk with your shoulders pressed down and back. When you sit, maintain good posture. Sit with your ankles crossed, or your feet parallel to each other on the ground., Maintaining good health is great for your body, and it will help add to your model appearance. However, remember, that you don't need to be a size zero to look beautiful. Simply take care of yourself. Hit the gym two or three times a week. Eat healthily. Take Care of Your skin, and drink plenty of water.Instead of going to the gym, you can follow videos on YouTube for yoga at home or take a jog outside.
Invest in a good cleanser, day and night moisturizer, and sunscreen. Ask a skincare consultant at your local beauty shop for advice for your specific type of skin.

, This is a crucial step when dressing like a model. It's important to know that you look and feel good in what you are wearing, whether it's high-end fashion or a bargain bin find. If you feel you look great in it, then you will look great., Being a model isn't always about following the trends, it's about showing off what you think looks good. Don’t be afraid to take a chance on wearing an outfit that you think is not trendy. Showing off what you enjoy wearing can inspire others to do the same."

Jeans are the most versatile pant. They should be worn an inch or two lower on the waist than chinos or corduroys, about three to four inches below your navel. Jeans should have a consistent fit throughout the leg. Avoid jeans that are too tight in the thigh and loose under the knee. Slim-style jeans flatter most body types.

Sweatpants are the most casual pant, usually worn in athletic or relaxing situations. When wearing sweatpants out in public, try brands that also make formal pants; they're more likely to fit slimmer and look better than the typical gym sweatpants found in discount stores. Pair sweatpants with other well-fitting clothes and a pair of high-end sneakers to avoid looking too aloof. ;
, Formal pants are important for presenting a clean, conservative look- perfect for the office and special events.



Suit pants and dress trousers are the most formal pant option. The top of the pants should come to the top of your hip bone. They should fit well enough in the waist that you don't need a belt, but drape more loosely over the legs. Avoid wearing pleated pants, as they can add the illusion of extra weight, especially in the seat.

Chinos and corduroys offer a more casual look than suit pants, but can still be worn in most professional environments. These should fit slimmer than suit pants and worn an inch or two lower on the waist. If you're wearing chinos in a conservative setting, opt for a slightly looser fit. If wearing casually, you can size them slimmer. You can tell when these pants are too tight if the pockets don't lay flat against the pants, creating ""pocket flares."" When shopping for chinos, keep in mind that the waist and seat tend to stretch with wear.

, Casual shirts, despite their informality, can look great when sized and worn correctly. They can be worn with chinos, jeans, or sweatpants.



T-shirts and long-sleeved shirts are more casual than button-ups and sweaters. They should fit looser around the neck. If a shirt has a V-neck, the cut of the V should go no deeper than your sternum. A t-shirt or long-sleeved shirt should have a slim fit through the torso, a little looser than a button-up. The shirt should be long enough to cover the belt loops of your pants without going past the pants zipper. Longer, looser T-shirts are best for a laid-back vibe, while more fitted, shorter T-shirts look sleeker. Many T-shirts and long-sleeved shirts are made primarily of cotton, which shrinks easily when washed. Size up or hang dry your shirts to avoid shrinkage.

Undershirts should be worn under other kinds of shirts. They should fit tighter than a T-shirt, and have the same kind of collar as the shirt you're wearing over it. Choose a color like gray that will match most kinds of shirts and be inconspicuous under other clothing.

, Dress shirts are another necessary staple in the male wardrobe. A well-fitted dress shirt rounds off an outfit to create a crisp, professional look.Button-up shirts can be worn for professional and casual situations. The collar of a button-up shirt should fit as closely to the neck without constricting it. The sleeves should fit well, without being too tight or too loose. The shirt cuff should come to where your wrist meets your hand. The body of the shirt should fit closely to your torso, without being skin-tight. A button-up should come down just past the belt loops in length. They should be worn tucked in to pants for a refined look; however, they can be worn untucked with jeans or chinos in a more informal climate.

Sweaters can also be worn in both formal and informal settings. They should fit slim throughout the body. Thin sweaters can fit tighter while chunky sweaters can fit a little looser. Thin sweaters should be worn to your belt loops; thicker sweaters and cardigans can be worn long. Crew neck sweaters should allow plenty of room for your neck and a collared shirt underneath. The neckline ofV-neck sweaters should dip down no further than the middle of your sternum. Turtleneck sweaters should fit tighter in the neck, while shawl neck sweaters are loose in the neck. No one kind of sweater is considered more or less formal; they all can be worn in a variety of situations., Different clothes flatter different body types and have ways of making you look more masculine.To hide wider hips and thighs, wear tapered pants.
To hide a bigger chest, wear tops with prints and asymmetrical patterns.
To look taller and thinner, wear vertical stripes.
To look less lanky, wear horizontal stripes.
To slim your waistline, wear a belt.
To look thinner, wear monochromatic colors.
No matter the body type, buying clothes that fit properly will ensure you look your best in any men's outfit.

, Shoes can make or break an outfit, and are especially important to pair correctly with dress clothes.Oxfords- Lace-up shoes worn below the ankle, usually made of leather. Work best with a two-piece suit.

, Buy men's shoes in a size and a half smaller than what you wear in women's shoes. For example, if you're typically a size 7 in women's shoes, try a 5.5 in men's shoes., Hats are a great way to hide your hair and add to your outfit. Different occasions and environments call for different types of hats.A baseball cap is commonly worn among men, and generally considered to be informal. It can make a specific statement about who you are if it contains a sports team logo or company name.

A cowboy hat works well in a ranch setting or somewhere with a Southwestern feel.

, Belts serve the functional purpose of keeping pants in place, as well as tying together the top and bottom half of an outfit. The belt you wear should match in formality with your outfit. Try a leather belt for more formal clothing and a canvas belt for more casual threads .

, Generally speaking, men don't wear a lot of jewelry. If you want to wear jewelry, keep it simple. Often a singular piece, like a watch or a chain, will do. .

, Most men prefer shorter hairstyles. If you're not ready to give up your long, feminine locks, try tying them back in a ponytail or sporting a ""man bun.""

Dispense with your teenage clothing.,
Clean your clothes regularly.,
Keep shoes in mind.Although girls already tend to put an emphasis on what they wear on their feet, guys often see shoes purely as a thing of comfort.,

Keep an eye out for sales.",How to Dress in Your 20s," At some point, everybody needs to grow up. This idea should apply to your wardrobe as well. If you want to dress well throughout your 20s, you should probably think about throwing some of the clothes you had as a teen away. You are a different person than you were then, and the fashions have definitely changed.


It's a better idea to donate old clothing rather than throwing it out. Chances are someone else will get good use out of it. Consider giving your old clothes to a consignment store.When you're there, you can pick out clothes that better suit you.;
, Even if you have the best set of clothes, you'll be giving off the wrong impressions if you don't take care of maintenance. Wearing clean clothes makes you look more desirable and professional. Make a regular habit of using the washing machine or hitting up the laundromat. Staying clean is a good look regardless of the style you choose for yourself. Make sure to wash clothing according to their type. Check labels if you're unsure.This is especially important if it's hot outside. At higher temperatures, you're bound to sweat more, and this can leave stains and an unpleasant odour.

, This shouldn't be the case if you want to dress well. Although shoes may not have been a big thing in high school, everyone from potential dating prospects to employers will judge you in part based on footwear.Generally speaking, you should have at least two pairs of shoes. One should be casual (such as sneakers), while the other should be more aesthetically based. While one is worn primarily for comfort, the other prioritizes fashion. While many people try to get by with the comfort wear alone, shoes can make or break an impression in social settings.
Shoes are especially important if you're the athletic type. It's recommended you get a few different pairs of shoes to serve different purposes and situations., Men should consider buying a full suit. Women should buy a few dresses that would fit a formal occasion. If you're going to be on the lookout for work soon, you should buy clothing for the interview, as well as a few sets of clothes to wear at the workplace itself.

, When you were younger, you could slip by in casual wear for most every circumstance. As an adult, things are a bit different. You can't rely on a single style or outfit to get you through every circumstance. Rather, a really well-dressed and self-aware individual will dress himself based around the situation he's planning for.It goes without saying that you should dress well for a funeral or a wedding, but the same goes for less formal social situations as well.


There is also a risk of overdressing for a relatively casual occasion. Although it's arguably not as bad as coming underdressed, you'll still end up sticking out in a bad way.

, In your 20s, it's a good idea to make connections with people who will make sure you look your best. Many people have years-long relationships with these fashion professionals. The sooner you start, the sooner they'll have you looking good, and the quicker they'll know exactly what you're looking for in a style.The same advice should apply to finding a hairstylist. Hair is an important part of any fashion, so it makes sense to invest in it., As a general rule, the fashion ideas promoted in magazines should be seen as a springboard for your own decisions, rather than a total authority on what you should or shouldn't wear. With that said, it doesn't hurt to look at a few magazines and see what kind of stuff is considered hot these days.Although you're already familiar with seeing other people's outfits in your day-to-day life, it's less common to see people who really know how to bring out the best in their features. Fashion magazines are perfect for this, and looking into one or two will set you on the right path.


Some fashion magazines specialize in a certain type of fashion. If you already have an inkling where your tastes lie, don't be afraid to make a more specialized choice.

, For most people in their 20s, this will be the best physical shape of their lives.It's a good idea to dress so as to maximize this fact. Clothing should be all about decorating and showcasing the body. Choose clothing that is going to flatter your shape. Depending on your gender, you probably fall into a common body type. The clothing you choose should try to even out your figure.Clothing with patterns will attract the eye to the area with the pattern. If you have a part of your body that looks particularly good, you can use patterned clothing to emphasize that part of you.
The tightness of clothing should ultimately decide on your body type. However, really baggy clothing has never been a good look on anyone, and will add unwanted years to your look.

, The colour wheel is familiar to every fashion designer. Some colours complement others better than others. If you want to have a truly impressive sense of style, you need to factor colour into consideration when planning out your outfits. The colour wheel offers an easy visual representation of what generally works and what doesn't.On the other hand, you can intentionally try to match colours that normally conflict with one another. Ultimately, each outfit plays by its own rules, and you can experiment to your heart's content if you so choose.

, Whether you're a boy or a girl, you can say a lot about yourself through accessorizing your look. A single piece of jewelry can say a ton about someone. The same goes for a pin or a small tattoo. Small additions to your clothing can be a big help if uniqueness is important to you.Look into getting patches and pins for clothing like handbags, backpacks and jackets. Something simple like a band patch could be enough to strike up a conversation between you and a future friend.

, Fashion changes fast. Although you should never try to keep up to date with all of the trends, you shouldn't hesitate to switch up your style from time to time. If you notice a new trend you think looks good, you should try to work it into your appearance. If something in your wardrobe is getting boring, you can set it aside and switch for something else. This will keep you feeling refreshed in your fashion decisions. What's more, people who see you on a regular basis will be giving you a renewed look if your style's always in flux.

, At the end of the day, you should dress as you see fit. Though you may have to make concessions in some cases like work, you should always try to work a bit of yourself into whatever outfit you choose.

, Many people in their 20s unfortunately don't have much money to work with. This is why a swap party can be useful. A swap party is a gathering where people bring clothing they don't wear much anymore and trade it with other people for their used sets of clothing.You can spruce up your wardrobe with fresh things at no cost to yourself besides things you no longer wear.

, Consignment stores are essentially trading posts for clothes. You can sell your old clothing and buy clothing used. While it may sound less-than-desirable for somebody who is wanting to look their best, you might be surprised what sort of finds you can fish out in a consignment store. Consignments are especially good if you want to be fashionable on a budget. Better still, you can sell old clothes you don't use as a discount for your new batch.Alternatively, there are thrift stores and bargain clothing shops you can visit for similar finds.
Not all bargain clothes shopping is necessarily used. Outlet stores often emphasize sales, and you can find unworn clothing at a discount by visiting.

, If you're young and running on a tighter budget than you'd like, it can help a lot to wait for great sales. Big department stores will usually have at least a few great sales a year where they try to sell as much product as possible. Sometimes you can get new clothing for as much as 50% off. Being a smart shopper will save you bundles in the long run, regardless of the age you are.


This rule applies to online shopping as well. Sales such as Cyber Monday are specifically catered to the online marketplace. While you should be wary of size issues when it comes to getting clothes online, you can get a wider variety of clothes more conveniently than by shopping in person.

Think about where you live.,
Know who your clients are.,
Understand who you work for.",How to Dress Like a Lawyer1," There are big differences in dress codes and expectations depending on where you live. Different regions of the United States have different expectations and dress codes. Before you go to work on day one, try to understand the norms where you are and follow them. If you are not sure, be cautious and dress formally and conservatively. If you are making a court appearance, always wear a suit or other professional business attire.


In places where the weather is warm and/or where the culture is more laid back, you may find that it is appropriate to dress casually. For example, in San Diego, lawyers often dress more casually because of the warm weather and laid back atmosphere.
If you live in an area that is colder or where the weather is more unpredictable, you may dress in layers and maybe even more formally. For example, in Washington D.C., the weather can be unpredictable and cold so more people may wear a suit and jacket.
In places where a suit and tie are the norm, you may be expected to follow along. For example, in New York City, most people always wear a suit and tie to work. In all likelihood, you will be expected to do the same.
Think about the culture of where you work and live. In some places, lawyers may have a reputation for dressing formally and luxuriously. In other places, lawyers may be expected to dress conservatively. For example, in New York City, many lawyers dress extremely formally and wear very nice clothes. You may even see lawyers walking around with expensive suits and bags. However, in a place like rural Iowa, you may be more likely to dress professionally but conservatively. While you may wear a suit, it may not be a name brand and you may not want to be flashy.;
, Apart from making wardrobe decisions based on the climate, attorneys also make wardrobe decisions based on their clients. For example, in big law firms in New York City where clients are often wealthy business people, you may be expected to dress formally in order to match the attire of your clientele. In contrast, if you work in Silicon Valley and represent young tech executives, you may be expected to dress casually and comfortably (there are even jokes that tech people do not trust someone wearing a tie).

, Different work environments have different dress codes. Know what your employer expects before you go to work. For example, if you work in a big corporate law firm, you are likely going to be expected to wear a suit and tie to work every day. However, if you work for a nonprofit organization, you may dress more casually and comfortably. Even better, if you work for yourself, you may be able to wear whatever you like.

Wear a suit.,
Opt for a smart dress.,
Always have a blazer at hand.,
Consider one luxury item.,
Wear smart but practical shoes.,
Lean towards being conservative.,
Don’t overdo the make-up.,
Consider shorter hair.",How to Dress Like a Lawyer2," For appearances in court, and important meetings and consultations, you will generally be expected to wear a suit. This could be a trouser-suit, or you could wear a smart skirt with a blazer. If you opt for a skirt, be sure that you understand if there are any particular expectations in your office. In some instances, skirts should fall within two or three inches of the knee.


Bare legs might be a problem, so pay attention to those around you and just wear some tights if necessary.A dark suit with a light shirt is a fool-proof option for a professional look.

, Instead of wearing a suit, you could choose a smart dress. It’s important to maintain a conservative and professional look, but a sheath dress combined with a blazer is perfectly acceptable in most cases. If you are wearing a sleeveless dress, be sure to have a blazer or at least a cardigan handy to cover your arms and avoid exposed straps.As with skirts, there will often be an expectation that dresses are around knee-length and are not overly tight.
Stick with dark colours to start with while you get a handle on the culture and expectations of your office.

, For women, just adding a blazer will immediately make you look more professional. You can wear a blazer over a skirt, dress, or with trousers. Having a dark blazer hung up in your office is a good way to be sure that you can smarten up quickly if you have an unexpected meeting or a client comes in for a consultation.Black, charcoal, dark grey, and navy are all good options for an all-purpose dark blazer.

, Smart and somewhat conservative clothes will help you look professional and reliable, but you can add a luxury item to help you look successful. Consider one expensive designer bag, scarf, or something else, from a recognisable luxury brand. Research suggests that when people see somebody wearing a luxury brand they tend to think of them as successful and well-suited to a job.Maintain balance and don't gratuitously cover yourself in designer logos.
Try to tie one luxury item in with the rest of your outfit, so it looks natural and not deliberate.

, You might think wearing big heels will help you look confident and powerful, but if you can’t move freely or you are putting yourself in pain, then the benefits are lost. Opt for shoes that are smart and professional, but also practical. Kitten heels, wedges, and flats are all perfectly good choices for a lawyer.


If you want to wear high heels for a meeting or consultation, but not throughout the day, just keep a smart pair of flats under the desk that you can subtly change into., A lawyer spends a lot of time meeting clients and prospective clients, so it’s important that you make a good first impression. For this reason it’s advisable to lean more towards conservative dress if you are in any doubt. This is especially true if you are at the beginning of our career and are still trying develop your reputation.


You want people to remember you for your talent and competence, not for your clothes.
Doing something simple like slipping on a cardigan if you are wearing a sleeveless dress before meeting a client can make a difference.
Once you gain more experience, confidence and greater understanding of the culture of your workplace you can begin to branch out a little., How you present yourself professionally extends beyond your clothes, so you should try to be consistent and use make-up sparingly. You will have to use your judgement and learn from your colleagues as you go, but as with clothes, try to avoid anything that will distract from your professionalism.


For example, if you opt for red lipstick, make sure the rest of your make-up is subtle.Find the right balance and talk to colleagues that you trust if you are in any doubt.

, Your hairstyle is another factor that can influence how people respond to you. Just as you aim for clothes that give you a professional, smart and somewhat conservative appearance, your hair should do the same. Although you will have to judge what suits you, one basic rule is to keep your hair shoulder-length or a little shorter.


Excessively long hair may prompt clients to think of you as inexperienced and potentially unreliable.
A shoulder-length cut kept tidy with hair spray might be your best option."

Wear a suit.,
Don’t forget the tie.,
Shine your shoes.,
Create a strong overall impression.,
Keep facial hair in check.,
Take out any facial piercings.",How to Dress Like a Lawyer3," Dressing like a lawyer for men is relatively simple. If you’re going to court, meeting a client, or going to an event, you should be wearing a well-cut suit. Generally dark suits in black, navy or grey will be the staples of your lawyering wardrobe. Combine a dark suit with a lighter shirt for a smart look. You can’t go wrong with a classic dark suit teamed with a white shirt and a plain coloured tie., You are not completely dressed until you have put on your tie. Although the requirement to wear a tie in the office might be diminishing in other areas, for lawyers it is still an important part of dressing appropriately. The tie does give you the possibility to add a little colour or pattern to your outfit, but avoid jokey or comedy ties at all times., The basic rule for footwear is to have well-polished smart leather shoes. People do notice what’s on your feet, and anything other than properly looked after leather shoes will simply not do. Brown and black are the basic colours that you should stick to in most instances.You can opt for matte leather if you don’t like especially shiny shoes.
If you take care of good quality shoes they will last a long time.

, You should think about how to present yourself beyond what clothes you wear. Law is an incredibly competitive industry, so the first impression you make is crucial. People will be judging you, and even if you have a sharp suit and immaculately polished shoes, an unhealthy and unkempt appearance could put people off.An un-ironed shirt, a two-day beard or an extravagant haircut will not necessarily make you appear as professional as you would like.
Make sure you are well groomed as well as well dressed.

, There’s no problem with a well-kept beard, but avoid stubble and soul-patches. You don’t have to make yourself look identical to every other lawyer, but you do have a responsibility to conform to certain standards of presentation. Always pay attention to how your colleagues dress and present themselves., Piercings and tattoos are becoming much more common than they were even a few years ago, but it's still advisable to opt for a more conservative look at work. For male lawyers, facial piercings are in most instances still considered inappropriate.Respond to the culture in your office, and respect staff who think a nose ring presents an unprofessional image.
If you have to remove facial piercings, just think of it as part of getting dressed for work.

Wear skinny jeans.,
Throw on a pair of leggings.,
Keep it short.,
Try a maxi skirt or high-low skirt.These long flowing skirts are ultra feminine and create an interesting contrast when paired with sporty wedge sneakers.,
Mix neutral colors with bolder colors.Since the wedge sneaker is such a statement piece on its own, it is generally considered prudent to avoid overwhelming your look with too much wild color or pattern while wearing them.,
Opt for a dressier wedge sneaker for semi-dressy bottoms.",How to Wear Wedge Sneakers1," Wedge sneakers are large and a little clunky, but they can still look stylish as long as the rest of the leg looks slender and long. To that end, when wearing jeans, you should opt for a sleek pair of skinny jeans that hug your leg over classic styles like straight-leg or boot-cut. Create an even narrower line by tucking the jeans into the sneakers.;
, Like skinny jeans, leggings make the leg line look slimmer, which helps to balance out the large shoes on your feet. In some ways, leggings are a little less versatile because there are certain types of tops you do not want to pair them with. Short tops do not work as well with leggings because the leggings are a little too form-fitting, so your panty-line will show if your top is not long enough to cover it. Leggings are an excellent choice for long tunic tops, dresses, and skirts, though.


You could also try wearing shorter leggings with your wedge sneakers. Full-length leggings can be tucked into the sneaker, but 3/4 or 1/2 length leggings can make your leg look just as sleek and balanced.

, Short capri pants, shorts, and short skirts are all fantastic options for wedge sneakers. These bottoms draw the eye upward, limiting the amount of weight on the bottom of your leg. Since you have a lot of weight on your foot, keeping additional weight or emphasis off the bottom portion of your leg leads a more balanced and well put together style.


Note that this also applies to dresses. Structured dresses should have as high a hemline as you can afford based on body type and modesty demands. At the very least, dresses and skirts should fall at or a little above the knee. If you do opt for a longer skirt or dress, it should be of a looser, more casual style.

, High-low skirts work especially well since they come up in the front enough to show off your legs, helping reduce the amount of perceived bulk toward the bottom of your leg.

, If you have a wedge sneaker in a plain color, like tan, brown, gray, or black, you can spice things up a bit with a funky red skinny jean or patterned legging. If you have bright neon wedge sneakers, however, you should stick with classic washes of denim and solid brown or black leggings.

, If you want to create a more feminine, chic look, pair a wedge sneaker in a neutral or muted color with a structured skirt or pinstripe trouser. The wedge sneaker is casual enough to add a dose of playfulness to your apparel, but a muted color will keep dressy clothes looking somewhat dressy.

"
"
Try an ordinary fitted tank top or t-shirt.,
Make things classy with a fitted button-down shirt or blouse.,
Balance yourself out with a looser top.,
Add structure with a blazer.",How to Wear Wedge Sneakers2," You can wear wedge sneakers like you wear normal sneakers in this regard. An oversized t-shirt is not recommended, but a fitted t-shirt or tank top paired with a simple bottom and your favorite wedge sneakers makes for an updated take on daily casual wear.

, If you plan on wearing neutral wedge sneakers and a structured jean, trouser, or skirt, a fitted button-down shirt that nips in at the waist can complete your look, providing you with an appropriate “Casual Friday” type outfit. The same can be said for a fitted blouse.


Alternatively, you can also pair a plain white button-down with denim skinny jeans and a bright, single-color wedge sneaker to add a pop of color and playfulness to your outfit. This look is best accented with other pops of color in your accessories.

, While the general idea is to keep your figure looking slim and tall to balance out the additional weight of the wedge sneaker, it can also be appropriate to wear a slightly looser, free-flowing blouse, tunic, or dress over skinny jeans and leggings. This is especially true for women with thicker legs who may feel the urge to draw attention away from their legs and to another part of their body. A flowing top can look feminine, and separating it from the sneakers with a snug bottom can still lead to a balanced look.

, A tailored blazer can add just the right amount of structure and form, accentuating your curves without causing them to compete for attention with the wedge sneakers. For a more professional or chic look, stick with neutral colored sneakers and blazers. For something a little more interesting, throw over a brightly colored blazer with muted wedge sneakers.

Layer accessories on the top half of your body.,
Keep things fairly simple.,
Avoid clashing patterns and colors.",How to Wear Wedge Sneakers3," In order to balance out the weight and bulk of wedge sneakers, you need to add a little weight and bulk to the upper part of your body while keeping it away from the lower half. Avoid flashy belts or bulky dangle bracelets. Instead, opt for colorful fashion scarves, decorative hats, large earrings, and long strands of necklaces.

, While it is generally a good idea to add decoration to the top half of your body to balance out the appearance of wedge sneakers, you should not get carried away. Wear one or two of pieces at once, but do not wear them all at the same time. This is especially important if you opt for shoes that are bright are patterned, since the shoes themselves can act as an accessory.

, If you do have a pair of wedge sneakers in a color or print, avoid wearing hats or scarves in bold colors or prints that may clash with your shoes. If you have a bold leopard print wedge, for instance, you should opt for a solid color scarf instead of a scarf with bold polka dots.

Make a knot at the nape of your neck.",How to Wrap a Turban1," It should be about 1.5m by 0.75m. A large, lightweight scarf works best. The bigger the material you use, the larger the turban will be, so choose accordingly. Also, thinner materials will be easier to handle.;
, First, fold your scarf until it's about two to three inches thick. Center it at the nape of your neck. Pull the ends toward your temples. Cross the ends over each other on your forehead and make a knot.Make sure the fabric only goes around the sides of your head, and doesn't cover the top of your head. This is the primary difference, appearance-wise, between a half and a full turban.

, Pull the ends tight and wrap them around the sides of your head to where the fabric is in the back. Tie a knot at the nape of your neck. If there is too much excess fabric, you can tuck it underneath the knot where it starts to wrap around the sides of your head."

, If your scarf is square, fold it into a triangle shape. If it is rectangular, fold it in half, length-wise. Place the scarf on your head so that the center is lined up with the nape of your neck. If you've folded your scarf into a triangle, the point should lie over your face., Take the ends of the scarf and pull them tight across your temples. Cross the two ends over one another over your forehead. Make it tight enough to stay in place but not too tight to be comfortable., Pull the scarf ends back around to the nape of your neck. Tie a tight knot. If you started with a rectangular shape, either tuck the excess fabric under the knot, or around the sides and into the front fold, depending on how much fabric is left. If you started with a triangle shape, tuck the excess fabric under the back of the turban, and tuck the point in the front backwards into the front fold."

Use the face cleanser.,
Gather your supplies.,
Pour the oil and aloe juice in the container.,
Shake the aloe makeup remover.,
Use the aloe vera makeup on cotton wipes.",How to Remove Makeup with Aloe," You'll need 1/4 cup of aloe vera gel, 1/4 cup of raw honey, and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of an oil of your choice (extra virgin olive oil, jojoba oil, almond oil, avocado oil, apricot oil, argan oil, or coconut oil). You should also have a small container to store the cleanser.You can use a 4 to 6 ounce jar or soap dispenser. Just make sure it has a good lid to keep the cleanser well sealed.
Try to buy an aloe vera gel with few preservatives or other ingredients. You can find high quality aloe vera gel at most health stores.;
, Measure your ingredients into your clean and empty container. Stir them together until the honey is completely dissolved into the gel and oil.If you can't easily stir the mixture in your container, you can mix them up in a bowl and transfer the cleanser to your container.

, You can keep the aloe vera makeup cleanser at room temperature if you bought the aloe vera gel at the store. This is because the aloe vera gel will have preservatives. If you used aloe vera gel directly from a fresh plant, you'll need to refrigerate it and use the cleanser within a few weeks.You can store the cleanser at room temperature for several months.

, To use the aloe vera face cleanser, scoop out a spoonful from your jar or squeeze a pump from the soap dispenser onto your hand. Rub the face cleanser over your makeup and let it sit for a minute. This will help the cleanser work deep into your skin. Remove the cleanser by wiping it off with a damp cloth.The cleanser should be thick like a gel, so you may need to rinse your cloth several times while removing the makeup and cleanser.

, Aloe vera makeup wipes only contain oil and aloe vera juice. You'll need 1/2 cup of a high quality oil (like extra virgin olive oil, almond oil, avocado oil, apricot oil, argan oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil). You'll also need about 1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) of aloe vera juice. Find a clean 16 ounce bottle or jar with a tight-fitting lid and get a package of cotton face wipes.You can buy aloe vera juice at most health food stores. Look for pure aloe vera juice that doesn't contain other ingredients.

, Pour the aloe vera juice into your empty and clean container. Pour the oil of your choice into the bottle and screw on the lid so it's tight.








You can use a glass bottle or plastic squeeze bottle. If you plan on squirting the makeup remover onto a cotton wipe instead of dipping it, consider using the squeeze bottle.

, Shake the container of aloe vera juice and oil vigorously. The mixture should combine for several seconds, but you'll notice it separate if you set it down for long. This is normal since the oil will always float on top of the juice.









Store the aloe vera mixture in the refrigerator when you're not using it. Try to use the mixture within a month, since the aloe vera juice is water-based and may spoil over time.

, To use your makeup wipes, simply shake the bottle of the aloe vera juice and oil to combine them. Moisten a clean cotton face wipe with the a little of the mixture and wipe it over your makeup. Rinse your face with clean water to completely remove the makeup and traces of the cleanser.








If you don't shake the mixture well enough before using it on the wipes, the wipes will only contain the oil and not enough of the cleansing aloe vera juice.

Saturate a cotton pad with eye makeup remover.,

Turn the cotton pad over and use the clean side to wipe your eye with an upward stroke.",How to Remove Makeup1," A dual phase eye makeup remover works for most eye makeup. It combines the dissolving power of an oil-based remover with the gentle, soothing qualities of cleansing water. This is a good choice for heavy eye makeup--just make sure you shake the bottle thoroughly before use, as the formula tends to separate.If you use waterproof mascara and liner or very stubborn eye makeup, use an oil-based cleanser. It will dissolve the waterproof makeup so you don't have to scrub or pull on your skin or lashes.Cleansing water works well for extra sensitive skin and should easily remove lighter makeup and liquid liner.;
, Don't scrub your eye at all, just hold the pad in place and allow the make up remover to dissolve your makeup. This will allow you to wipe your makeup off with ease and as little rubbing as possible., Use multiple strokes with light pressure.









Place the fingertips of your free hand against your eyebrow and pull up slightly as your other hand sweeps down. This will prevent you from pulling too hard on the skin around your eye.

, The oil in the petroleum jelly is dissolving the oil in your lip color, which is what makes it so effective. It is drawing the oil out of your lips instead of repelling it, like water would., You can wipe your lips in a small, circular motion, but try not to move the pad too much--you don't want to wipe the jelly all over your face., Most, if not all, of the lipstick should come off on the pad.Repeat if necessary.

Organize your evening hours well.,
Decide if you are absolutely ready and comfortable enough to wear one now.,
Determine if you can be ready to fall asleep.,
Make sure to provide a serene setting in which you can encase yourself into a blanket sleeper again.,
Assemble the calm and collected things you have chosen to do during these hours to pass the time by in an easy-to-reach place such as in your sleepers pockets (if they have them) or nearby the chair you wish to use prior to falling asleep.,
Have some great reasons ready for why you are wearing them, should other people - family, friends, relatives or others - come over to see you in your house or apartment that evening and find you wearing them.,
Don't complain about your body when you have them on.,
Sit down on a padded seat, take a cleansing breath in and release your breath after a few seconds have elapsed.,
Utilize your bed for a few moments.,Proceed to do your calm down activities in the house, that you were supposed to set up before you got yourself dressed for the evening hours.",How to Wear an Adult Blanket Sleeper in the Evening Hours," Make sure the evening can include mostly non-constructive tasks that can keep your off your busy daytime doings yet subtle enough in keeping your mind ready to drift off to dreamland. While blanket sleepers can help drift you back to sleep just before bedtime, they also have a secondary life during the evening hours shortly after most people get off the dinner table in which can get you ready to sleep with it on. Plan around the blanket sleeper's use wherever you are settling in that evening - whether that be at home, at a neighbor, friend, or relative's house or at another dwelling elsewhere.


Blanket sleepers can surely help you lounge around the house while watching TV or reading a book or doing something that won't involve much work or thought behind the action.;
, Many people struggle to find just ""that right time"" when they feel competent and ready to wear one and most struggle at first to get into one - and others to stay in them - during the evening and nighttime hours. It's often a chore that most blanket sleeper wearers dread - especially at first. Don't think about the garment as being a child-like blanket sleeper - think about them being just your ordinary night wear pajama that you love to wear each night - one that keeps you coming back to wearing them time and time again., Whether it's just a few hours off or it is only a few minutes off, evening hours means chilling and relaxing and getting ready to enter that state of sleep mode for most blanket sleeper wearers. Although most people begin to wear blanket sleepers only during the night, some tend to wear them non-stop throughout the evening and even into the next morning somewhat - and that's actually a good thing. Many wearers feel good enough to leave them on until they must remove them for other projects that are less comfortable and that they need to devote more attention to during the course of their normal day.

, Close all your drapes, turn on some ambient lighting and - if you'd like to - set the room's music level to some low-action ""romantic-like"" (almost towards a classical genre) music for which you can perform this one evening's tasks in. Keeping the mood peaceful and out of the thought of the wearer and on the action at hand will be your best thoughts towards achieving a great wearing time during the evening.

, If your sleeper contains pockets, stick in some of these items into the pockets so you don't have very far to reach when they are necessary to be used. Whether that low intensity item is a television remote control, landline and/or cellular phone or a small or other short book (such as a Harlequin romance book or similar short novel) or something else that will help you adjust to this piece of loungewear (and thereby get yourself ready for ""sleep mode""), it's best that you get everything ready for the evening hours.

, Be sure to state to yourself the reason why you chose to do so. Even though you'd be escaping those hours when daytime use yields problems and escaping those hours that night-only use proves challenging to endure, evening use may prove to be difficult to ensure when others may end up coming over unexpectedly.

, You tried them on and found out that you could be courageous enough to wear one, and don't complain. Becoming courageous is something many people can't seem to muster, even though most people's minds are set to remove something that's seen as childlike, fairly-quickly. Embrace your inner child every night if you are not courageous enough to show it off to yourself and others.

, At this point, you don't need to have them in your hands accomplish this cleanse into trying them on for the night. This will provide for a more-confident feel on your body, knowing that you are now ""at peace"" with your mind, body and soul. Don't scream or do anything harsh that would make you want to remove the blanket sleeper onwards until the next morning when most people take off the sleeper., Change yourself into your blanket sleeper, as if you were your own children. Most adults will have to drape their legs over the edge of their bed because they are much larger than that of a child, to ensure they are wearing their sleeper for these evening hours.

Dress up your sweaters with your footwear.",How to Wear Oversized Sweaters," If you’re going to be wearing your oversized sweater with jeans, you can wear basically any length sweater you want. However, if you want to pair your sweater with a dress, skirt, shorts, and any other shorter garments worn on your bottom half,, you probably want a slouchy sweater that still ends around the waist. If you’re going to be wearing an oversized sweater as a dress, you definitely want something long that covers you!


Oversized sweaters go in and out of fashion, but when they are very stylish, in both men's and women's departments -don't be afraid to explore both sections – oversized sweaters are a fantastic, gender neutral wardrobe pieces.;
, Monochrome sweaters, especially those in neutral colors, are great additions to your wardrobe because they can be paired with all sorts of other clothes and accessories. Patterned sweaters can be fun statement pieces, and you can effortlessly create an outfit just by pairing them with neutral trousers, leggings, shorts etc.


There is a time and a place for both bold patterns and solid neutrals. Consider your collection of pants, jeans, skirts, leggings, dresses, and so on when deciding which kind of sweater to add to your collection.

, This will help you decide if you want a thick, chunky sweater, or a more lightweight sweater. If you’re looking for a sweater to wear over layers, you may want to get something a bit less chunky – otherwise, you’ll feel like you’re wearing a sumo suit. On the other side, you don’t want something so sheer that you’ll see the bottom layers right through it.


Lightweight, oversized cardigans are great to throw on over warm weather outfits, and big chunky sweaters look great with winter outfits. It’s all about visualizing the outfits you want to create!

, Weather permitting, this is a great combination. Wearing a big, chunky sweater over a flowy dress can create a really interesting, trendy contrast. Transform summer dresses into fall and winter dresses just by topping them with a warm sweater. For this look, it’s best to wear oversized sweaters that are cropped at the waist, so it doesn’t completely cover your dress or skirt.Wearing oversized sweaters with maxi skirts can create the ultimate bohemian silhouette. It can be hard to pull this look off without looking like you’re drowning in clothing, though. This look works best on tall people, but that doesn’t mean you can’t rock it if you’re short.

, When it comes to wearing oversized clothing, the general rule is one thing at a time. If you’re going to wear a big, baggy sweater, avoid wearing big, baggy pants too. Instead, pair your sweater with tighter jeans, pants, or leggings. The largeness (and coziness) of the sweater is balanced out by the form-fitting bottoms., There is no rule that you have to wear bottoms at all! If your sweater is long enough, pair it with tights and call it a dress. This is perfect for those cold days when you want to look chic but also want to be snug and warm. Pair it with tall boots and you have an effortlessly chic outfit.


Add a bit of structure to your sweater dress by wearing a tailored blazer over it.

, The one downside of oversized sweaters is that they certainly don’t show off your figure. If you want to accentuate your waist, there’s an easy solution. Pop a belt around your sweater and cinch it tight. Now, you have all the coziness of the big sweater, but you also have created a flattering silhouette., Big sweaters pair perfectly with big jewelry. Big, bold watches, bangles, and other bracelets look great against big, chunky sweaters. This is an easy way to add a bit of color or sparkle to a neutral sweater, or add a bit of fancy flair to a slouchy, more casual sweater. Cuff the sleeves of your sweater to show off your bracelets or watch.

, You can easily transform a big, comfy sweater into dressy work attire simply by adding a beautiful statement necklace. You can soften up a cable knit sweater by pairing it with a dainty necklace. Playing around with your jewelry can really change an entire outfit, so don’t be afraid to experiment. The lounging, weekend sweater can transition to business professional with some strategic styling.

, Pairing big, oversized sweaters with casual footwear is a no-brainer – they go perfectly with sneakers, snow boots, and moccasins. However, you can style them in a completely new way with different footwear. Try pairing an oversized sweater dress with over-the-knee boots for a fierce, eye-catching look. Take that slouchy, neutral sweater from movie night to party night by wearing it with sky-high wedges or heels.Men can pop on some dress shoes to instantly take the look from cozy to professional.


The key to styling your oversized sweater is to get creative, and get bold. Get inspiration from fashion magazines, Pinterest, and television, and try combinations you’ve never considered before. Oversized sweaters are more versatile than you may think!

If you are not courageous enough to show off your entire ""inner child"" at night, you are definitely not even close to ready to show off your ""inner child"" during the day.;
, Nightwear - let alone a blanket sleeper - is the last thing people would like to see someone wearing. Most people are under the impression that blanket sleepers are only designed for infants and toddlers and that isn't at all true - and these people will go to great lengths to try to make these people depressed to the point that the wearer won't want to wear them during the day.

,, Keep your body clean and smelling fresh. If you need to use deodorant to keep yourself smelling good, go for it - blanket sleepers are completely washable.

, You can use the same method on yourself, as the method used when you change your kids into them at night. However, due to most adult's length measurements, the wearer may have to drape their legs over the edge of a flat surface (such as a bed or soft-carpeted floor)., Just because you are wearing something designed for night, doesn't mean things in your daytime have to stop. As long as the blanket sleeper is super-comfortable (which it should be), you should continue to do things as normal around your house.

There are three general styles of thong: the traditional, the g-string, and the tanga/samba.


The traditional thong will have full coverage in the front and likely as a wide waist-band, but narrows to a strip of fabric 1-inch wide or narrower that is slid between the buttocks.
A g-string is a thong that has a very narrow waistband, typically a strip of elastic ¼-inch or narrower. The ‘thong’ part of the g-string is also very thin, so the only fabric is pretty much a small triangle in the front.
A tanga/samba thong is like a regular pair of panties crossed with a traditional thong. They typically have fabric that covers the upper half of the bum, leaving the bottom of your buttocks exposed (preventing a panty line). The rest of the underwear will vary depending on style, but typically has a thick waistband and lots of coverage.;
, One of the many concerns by non-thong wearers is - isn’t it uncomfortable? Although the idea of fabric being slid up your butt sounds mostly like a bad wedgie, most thong-wearers agree that the initial discomfort is overcome almost immediately. Thongs are often considered one of the most comfortable styles of panties, especially g-strings, because there is so little fabric to become bunched up, loose, saggy, or uncomfortable in any way.


Keep in mind that thongs aren’t comfortable for everyone, and they may take some getting used to.
If at first you don’t love the feeling of your thong, don’t give up right away. It is a typical experience for first-time thong-wearers to dislike the feeling first, but after a few days of wearing thongs, to fall in love with them., Not all thongs are made alike. Just like regular panties, there are a plethora of fabrics, colors, and patterns to choose from. When it comes to thongs, it is generally recommended that you look for thongs made of cotton, as these are the most breathable. However, lace, silk, and satin are all common options. Lace thongs work well for minimizing a ‘muffin-top’ over the elastic, as the lace is very stretchy and forgiving in appearance. Silk and satin thongs are typically reserved lingerie-type use, but are certainly an option for those days you want to feel sexier than usual.


G-strings have the highest likelihood of giving you a ‘muffin-top’, because the elastic is so thin and likely to dig into your hips.
If you wear a lace thong, keep in mind that the texture of the fabric may show through your tight bottoms, therefore countering the point of wearing a thong (to hide your underwear).

, Thongs are typically worn for the purpose of avoiding a panty line in tight pants, dresses, or skirts. The problem with most underwear is that no matter how thin the material, you can almost always see the outline of the hem through tight bottoms. A thong remedies this situation, as pants are rarely so tight in the front that you see the front outline, but in the back the hem is safely tucked away by your bum.


If you’ve never worn a thong before, try starting out with the tanga/samba style. This will hide your panty line without giving you the ‘wedgie’ feeling some people complain about.
High-waisted thongs help prevent the appearance of panty lines on the hips, which is helpful when wearing a tight dress.

, Sit down, bend over, squat, and do other similar movements in front of a mirror to test whether or not your thong becomes visible. If ‘whale tail’ is a recurring problem, you might need to try a different size or model, avoid low-rise jeans, wear a belt, or simply cover that area with a long shirt. Even so, it’s good to be prepared for making quick adjustment while you’re in public. As you sit down, subtly reach around to the back of your belt line and check if your thong is sticking out. If it’s exposed, quickly tuck it back in pull your shirt down to cover the area.

, One of the problems that sometimes occurs with wearing thongs, is that they may spread bacteria faster than regular underwear, which can cause infections. Because the thong is touching both the anus and the vulva, bacteria can travel much easier between the two, especially when your thong shifts in position throughout the day. This isn’t a problem for most women, but if you experience yeast or bacterial infections frequently, you may need to switch thongs more often.Choosing a thong a size larger than what you normally wear may improve both the comfort and the sanitary experience of your thong.
Cotton thongs will prevent bacterial spread better than other types of fabric, so if you’re afraid of infection, try going for thin cotton.

, For the same reason that you should change your thong on a regular basis, you should avoid wearing your thong every day. Bacteria can easily travel up the fabric of the thong, which means wearing one every day can make you more prone to infections. Try wearing thongs only during the day or times when they are a needed fashion piece. Wear full-coverage panties at night, when you work out, and when you are wearing heavy jeans or other bottoms which won’t show your panty line.

, If you’ve decided thongs are your go-to underwear for daily wear, don’t toss out all your other panties just yet! When you’re sick, typically with diarrhea or food poisoning, you won’t want to be wearing a thong. This can spread germs and fecal matter (definitely not cool), and be a bit more uncomfortable when your nether-regions are feeling sensitive. You may want to avoid thongs on your period as well, as the blood and discharge will spread easier on a thong than in bikini bottoms.


Although nobody likes to consider it an option, a thong won’t provide much protection should a leak occur.

, It’s true, no one likes to talk about their bathroom wiping rituals. But if you’re wearing a thong, you can actually greatly increase your chance of a bacterial infection by wiping the wrong way! Wipe your bum from the front to the back; this will push any bacteria or fecal matter away from your vulva, where it could become infected. Some people prefer wiping with a damp wipe rather than dry toilet paper, but this isn’t required. Most importantly - make sure you’re clean! You’ll probably be uncomfortable if you don’t clean yourself well enough and then put on a thong."

If you'll be moving around a lot, for example, comfortable shoes are a good idea.Dressier shoes can include heels, flats, dark leather shoes, and boots.
If the occasion is casual, a pair of sneakers can suffice. You can also try canvas sneakers and desert boots. On a warm night, sandals or flip-flops are a good option. Keep in mind, however, flip-flops are only appropriate for very casual settings, such as a cookout on the beach.
Make sure you pick a pair of shoes that compliment the color and style of your outfit. Glittery, clunky heels, for example, will look better with a cocktail dress than dress pants and a blouse.;
, The top you select will depend on where you're going. Make sure to pick a top appropriate for the formality of the setting.A casual top can work for just a night out with friends. A collared button down top, a t-shirt, a polo shirt, or a sweater can be fun.
If you want something fancier, go for a nice floral blouse. A nicer button down shirt can also work. You probably have a few nice white dress shirts you can wear with a tie.

, If you're going for pants over a dress or skirt, you have a lot of options. For a casual night, a nice pair of jeans usually works best. However, you may want to go with something a little different.Sleek black dress pants would work great for a more formal outfit.
Corduroy pants may work well for a slightly more casual look. They can pair well with a sports jacket. You can also go for cargo pants if you want something casual. Gray or black trousers may work if you want a more conservative look.
Try wearing leggings out. These can work well with longer tops, but are usually only appropriate for casual settings.

, For a night out, you may want to dress up a bit. You can select a nice dress or skirt for the occasion.A more formal occasion may require an evening gown or a long, fitted dress. You can opt for a shorter dress, or something like a sundress, if you want something more casual.
There are a wide variety of skirts to choose from. A nice leather skirt may work great for a date. A miniskirt may be appropriate for a more casual occasion. Formal skirts should generally be longer.
Skirts and dresses come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, so feel free to pick something that suits your mood that night. You should also pick something that flatters your figure. If you're feeling fun, go for something like a casual, colorful dress. If you want something more serious, go for a conservative skirt paired with a formal blouse.

, Make sure you and your friends or date have a plan for the night. Double check a few hours before you leave about when and where you're meeting.


If plans are a little uncertain, try suggesting something solid. For example, you could choose a bar or restaurant where everyone can agree to meet.

, It's very important to have a plan to get home, especially if you're drinking. Driving under the influence can be very dangerous.Make a plan to get home before you go out.


Try to have a designated driver if others will be drinking. You can also use public transportation, if you're not out too safe. You can also take a cab, lyft, or uber home if you've been drinking.

, You do not want to leave the house with your hair tangled. Run a brush through your hair before leaving for a night out. If you normally add gel or other products to your hair, apply them now.


You can use hairspray to make sure your hair does not get messy as the night goes on.

, You may want to shave your legs, armpits, or face before going out. If you shaved recently, you can skip this part. However, if necessary, give yourself a quick shave before going out.Use shaving cream to avoid cuts and hydrate your skin. Make sure to get any skin wet before you start shaving.
Make sure to use a high quality razor. Cheap razors are more likely to cut your skin. You should also use a new razor if yours is old. Dull blades make for a rougher shave.

, This can help you smell fresh throughout the night. Even if you already used deodorant, apply a fresh layer before going out.Make sure you select a deodorant that has a pleasant scent. If you have a deodorant that dries fast, this may be a good option before you go out.
Select a deodorant that fights both odor and sweat.

, This includes things like your cellphone, your keys, your wallet, and an ID. If you need anything extra, pack it as well. For example, if you volunteered to bring chips to a party, make sure you have them before going out the door.It can be helpful to pack ahead of time. If you pack up the night before going out, it'll be less to worry about the next day.

, A nice jacket can compliment any outfit. As you head out the door, see if throwing on a jacket can help your look.A jean jacket can be a nice touch, but make sure not to wear it with matching denim. It's better off paired with slacks or corduroys than blue jeans.
A long overcoat can look great if you're going out during colder months. A peacoat can also be a nice touch.
A sports jacket is a simple way to add some flare to your outfit. You can throw a blazer or sports jacket over a nice button down t-shirt. This adds a bit of class and formality.

, Watches can be great accessories. If you have a decent watch laying around, add it to your outfit. A good watch can compliment your clothes and style.A dress watch generally has a leather or metal band. They can be pricey, so be careful if you choose to wear one. Tighten it sufficiently so it does not accidentally slip off during the evening.
A more casual watch can be great for a casual event. You can try to find a colorful watch that matches your outfit, for instance.

, Wraps and scarves can add a bit of color and flare to an outfit. If you have a nice scarf or wrap lying around, try throwing it on and see how it looks with your outfit.A wrap can help with an elegant look. If you want something more formal, this may be a better option than a scarf.
A scarf can be a great way to add color to an outfit. If your outfit is a neutral color, like brown or black, you can shake things up with a colorful scarf. You can also choose a scarf with a pattern on it to add variation to plain clothing.

, A nice pair of stockings can compliment an outfit. If it's cold out especially, stockings under a dress or skirt can be a great way to keep warm while looking cute.Like a scarf, stockings can add flare. If you're wearing a plain black dress, for example, stockings with sequins can add some color and design.

, If you wear jewelry, select earrings, necklaces, and other accessories to compliment your outfit before you leave. You may want to play around with different combinations of jewelry to find one that suits your mood and outfit.Long, dangly earrings, sometimes called statement earrings, can be great for a night out clubbing or dancing. If you want something more formal, look for something like classic gold ball earrings or something similar.
A large, clunky, and bold necklace can be great for a casual event. Something plain, like a gold chain, may work best for a more formal occasion.

, A belt can be an excellent accessory. Choose a belt that matches your outfit. If you want to add some variation to a plainer outfit, a patterned belt, or a colorful belt, may be a good option.If you're wearing a looser dress, try fastening a belt around your waist to highlight your figure.

, Liquid eyeliner can be messy to apply. Instead of using a liquid liner, you can use a wet makeup brush and a dark shade of eye shadow.Take an eyeliner brush and get it damp. Dip the brush into a darker shade of eyeliner.
Run the brush along your upper eyelid, just above your eyelashes.

, If you're going out at evening especially, a brighter blush is important. You want to make sure your blush shows up in a darker, dimmer atmosphere. Opt for a blush a few shades brighter than your regular daytime blush., These can make your eyes and eyelashes look bigger and bolder. They can be fun to use if you're going out for the night, especially for a more casual occasion.You can buy false eyelashes at a drugstore or beauty store. The box they come in should have directions for application.
Be careful when applying fake lashes. You do not want to get the glue from the lashes in your eyes.

, If you're going out at night, the lighting may be dim. Therefore, a powder applied over foundation may look chalky. After applying your regular foundation, skip the powder and move on to the rest of your makeup."

This, however, is not a guarantee that the eyeliner will be comfortable for sensitive eyes. Make sure eye makeup is formulated without sulfates or parabens, which can cause skin irritation. Talc and kohl should also be avoided to prevent irritation. Fortunately, numerous makeup products are now formulated without these potentially harmful ingredients., If you have sensitive skin, it’s important to test a potential eyeliner on your hand before applying it to your eyes. The skin around your eyes is thinner and more sensitive than other areas, so this test is not foolproof, but if you have an allergic reaction, you will know not to apply the product to your eyes.


Check for contact dermatitis. Although people experience allergic reactions differently, cosmetics may cause contact dermatitis, typically in the form of a red rash. This can happen right away.
Watch for the symptoms of an allergic reaction. You also may develop a reaction in a different area of your body. If you have had reactions in the past, it may be a good idea to talk to a dermatologist before starting to use a new brand. It may take up to 24 hours for a reaction to develop, so wait at least a day before applying a new eyeliner to your eyes., Having to press down or stretch the eyelid can cause your eyes to water when applying eyeliner. When testing different eyeliners, be sure to choose one that provides enough color with a light touch. You shouldn't need to press too hard to get a smooth line.

, Long-wearing eyeliner pencils stay put and tend to be easy on sensitive skin. They are less likely to smudge or run, and they are easy to sanitize to prevent infection or irritation. NARS and Urban Decay offer excellent, smooth pencil eyeliners., Gel eyeliner is applied with a brush and is generally long-lasting. A brush liner may require less pressure than a pencil to apply. Bobbi Brown Gel Liner is easy to apply, and L'Oreal Lacquer Liner is also a good choice for sensitive eyes.

, With liquid eyeliners, you run the risk of smearing if you flinch or blink while applying the product. However, liquid eyeliners with a felt tip are easier to apply lightly while avoiding smudging rather than liquid liners with a brush. They also are less likely to run and drip into your eyes because nothing is worse for sensitive eyes that getting makeup directly in them. Lancome, Kat Von D Cosmetics, and Stila make liquid liners with felt tips that don’t budge.

, If applying makeup causes your eyes to water, you may be tempted to try waterproof eyeliner. However, this style of cosmetics is more difficult to remove and may require you to rub harder upon removal, which may cause irritation.

, Eye creams and natural oils can make the eyelids greasy, which prevents eyeliner from staying put all day. You can use a makeup wipe, such as the ones sold by Aveeno, Olay, or Simple, to prime your eyes. If you prefer liquid makeup remover, choose an oil free brand, such as Lancome or Clinique., Put on eyeshadow before applying eyeliner. However, if you are just learning to apply eyeliner, it may be best to skip the eyeshadow until you get the hang of it. It may be more difficult to apply eyeliner on top of eyeshadow, but doing it in reverse will cover the eyeliner.

, The waterline is the inner edge of the eyelid. It’s easy to transfer makeup into the eye, and the proximity to the eye can cause irritation. Plus, it may not last long if applying it causes your eyes to water. Instead, stay outside the lash line on both your upper and lower eyelids. Aim for just underneath the eyelashes on the lower lid. Nearly any style can be applied this way, including a cat eye or a simple line., Try not to drag the eyelid because it can distort the line when you’re done, and it also may increase irritation. With a gel liner or liquid eyeliner, you may be able to just wink your eye shut without pulling your eyelid.

, Start the line just away from the the inner corner to minimize discomfort from wearing makeup. Move the line outward toward the outer corner.

, Some beauty websites recommend using tape as a makeshift stencil for a classic cat-eye look, but this may not be the best idea for people with sensitive eyes. Instead, you can hold a business card up to the corner of your eye to make a sharp, straight line. This also helps you avoid apply a too-thick line or spreading eyeliner outside the area you intended to apply it., If you accidentally get eyeliner in your eye, thoroughly rinse it. If you wear contacts, take them out and clean them. Do not put contacts back in while your eyes are still irritated., Although it may seem like a no-brainer, be sure to remove your eye makeup before going to bed because it can lead to irritation otherwise. Because the eye area is prone to sensitivity more than the rest of the face, be sure to choose a gentle makeup remover that won’t cause discomfort., If you use eyeliner pencils, be sure to sharpen them before every use. Not only does this help you get a cleaner line, but it removes the outer layer of the pencil, minimizing the potential for irritation in case any debris has settled on the tip. This also helps the product last longer.

, If you use gel eyeliner, rinse excess eyeliner off the brush after use or before using again. Wash them once a week to prevent eyeliner from building up. Although commercial brush cleaners are available, you can use water and a small amount of baby shampoo to scrub the tips. Let them dry before using again., Eye makeup is prone to collecting bacteria. Pencil and liquid eyeliner can be used for up to year unless the pencil is stubby. However, for sensitive eyes, you may want to replace more frequently. Replacing eyeliner every two to three months helps you avoid eye infections., Avoiding bacterial buildup is especially important if you have sensitive eyes. Although sharpening essentially sanitizes pencil liners, you can buy a sanitizing mist for other types or use a small amount of rubbing alcohol in a tissue to gently rub the tip.

Look for a color that compliments your eye color.,
Pair very bright shades with a neutral outfit.,
Consider more than one color.,
Add very light liners to a smokey eye.,
Go for darker neons for a played down look.",How to Wear Neon Eyeliner1," With neon eyeliner, do not just choose your favorite color. As the eyeliner is so bold, it's important it compliments your natural eye color.Green shades work well with hazel eyes, especially olive greens.
Blue shades work well with blue.
Green eyes look great with deep purple. Hazel eyes that have hints of green also look nice with purple.;
, If you selected your outfit first, look to that for a guide. When wearing something very neutral, opt for a brighter shade. Bright neon eyeliner can make your look more dramatic if you're wearing something more played down.For example, say you're outfit is mostly brown or black and you have green eyes. Select the brightest purple neon you have. This will compliment your eyes and add some flare to a neutral look.

, If you're struggling to decide, you can pick more than one color. Your upper lash line can use one color, while you water line uses another. This can help if you have eyes that would match for more than one shade. For example, for hazel eyes with flecks of green, you can use a combination of green and purple., If you're doing a smokey eye for your main makeup and it looks dull, grab some neon eyeliner. With smokier makeup, brighter colors can help really outline your eyes and make them pop. Go for something like white neons if you're doing a smokey eye., If you want to use neons, but do not want something dramatic, go for darker colors. Rather than choosing a bright fluorescent yellow, for example, choose a yellow that falls more on the mustard yellow side. This can allow you to have a little fun with neon colors without creating an overwhelming effect."

Stick to simple clothes and jewelry.,
Keep your eye shadow light.,
Add a small amount of mascara.",How to Wear Neon Eyeliner2," If you're choosing your outfit after your eyeliner, remember that neons are dramatic. You should wear neon eyeliner with a plainer outfit, such as solid colored ensembles in duller shades like browns, beiges, grays, and blacks. You should also keep your jewelry minimal. Your eyeliner is your main accessory, so you do not need too much extra.Stick to very basic items of jewelry that do not draw too much attention. Something like stud earrings and a simple gold chain could pair well with neons. Stay away from anything too bright or shiny.

, Neons work best when paired with played down eye shadow. You do not need big, bold colors of eye shadow if your eyeliner is already so bright. Stick to neutral shades of eyeliner that highlight your eyelids without adding too much color. For example, go for a light layer of beige for your eyelid over a bright color like blue., Mascara can help bring out your eyes, but you do not need a lot if you're already using neon eye shadow. Stick to a single layer of brown or black mascara if you're going for neon eyeliner.Avoid colorful mascara if you're already wearing neon eyeliner.

Add a line of eye liner to your lash line.,
Do a cat eye if you want.,
Add makeup to your waterline.",How to Wear Neon Eyeliner3," To start, use the tip of the pencil or brush to add a layer of eyeliner to your upper lash line. This is the line just above your eyelashes. Trace the line using the pencil or brush to draw a thin line of neon running just above your eye.Some people prefer to start with a thin line near the corners of the eye and broaden it as you reach the tip. This can be helpful if you want to add a cat eye.

, A cat eye is a small wing on the end of each eye. To draw a cat eye, extend the line of neon slightly outward after you reach the end of your lash line. Then, draw a small triangular shape sticking out of the corner of your eye. Bring the triangle back into your lower lash line by drawing a line connecting it to the bottom of your eye., Your waterline is the small patch of skin inside your lower lash line. Use the brush or tip or pencil to color this line in a neon shade.Not all eyeliners should be used on your waterline. Refer to package instructions to make sure your eyeliner is safe to use on your lash line.

, Pick colored or sparkly fishnet stockings for something outside the norm. Try pulling a color from your outfit for the hue of your stockings. Wear glittery fishnets with a dress or under ripped jeans for a night out., Opt for micro-sized fishnet if you want them to appear more subtle. Choose a small diamond pattern for an elegant look.

Small, thin patterns work well for daywear or evening wear.

, Cut holes or rips in your stockings if you want an edgy, grunge style. Opt for a small-scale print to keep the look fashion-forward rather than trashy.This is a great way to reuse snagged stockings.

, Avoid open-toed sandals and pumps with fishnet stockings. Wear closed-toed pumps or boots for a dressy look. Choose loafers or even canvas shoes to mix in a casual feel.For instance, pair tennis shoes with fishnet stockings and wear loose, high-waisted shorts.

, Don’t overpower your fishnets with other patterns. Keep the rest of your look simple. Stick to a single patterned piece that isn’t too loud if you want to vary from solid colors.For example, tuck a black-and-white striped shirt into solid black shorts. Wear fishnet stockings and casual shoes.

, Wear tights under stockings in neutrals for a classy look. Wear shorts with layered stockings to avoid showing a lot of leg. Pair cutoff shorts with large-hole fishnets over opaque tights in a vivid color.For example, wear nude fishnet stockings over chocolate tights. Add nude pumps and a tiered, above-the-knee, summery dress.

Pick the right color.,
Do not overwhelm your look with garish or childish colors.,
Choose your formula.,
Embrace your choice.,
Keep the rest of your makeup simple.,
Get close to the lash line.Colored eyeliner really works best when it is as close as possible your lash line.,
Keep the line thin and precise.It’s easier to add to your lined eyes rather than remove the liner.,
Have fun with bold looks.",How to Wear Colored Eyeliner," Go beyond your favorite color and pick a color that compliments both your eyes and your outfit.Try not to outperform the color of your natural eyes by using the same color as your iris. For example: If your eyes are blue, grey or silver is a smarter option over a matching blue. If your eyes are hazel, opt for a color that’s mostly brown but has a pop of green. Staying away from a pure green eyeshadow will prevent the makeup from overpowering your eyes, that is, showing people how plain they may be.
Opposites attract. For example use a warm purple, lavender or pink if you have brown eyes. If you have blue eyes, use bronze, or rusty colored eyeliner.Look at a color across from your eyes on the color wheel. Pick a color adjacent to the opposite for optimum pop.;
, Draw attention to your natural eye color by using similar eyeliner to shade the inner rims of your lower lids.


For example, if you have blue eyes, use a deep pearl blue; for grey eyes, use a matte silver; for green eyes, use olive green, for hazel eyes, use dark brown; and for brown eyes, use a rust color., With many different formulas available, texture matters. If you’re a novice, use a pencil or gel liner, as liquids are reserved for the more seasoned-users.


Maximize your control with pencils. This is especially useful when rimming your inner lashline with a firm hand.Add a dramatic line with liquids, as they are easily layered to become a thicker line. Liquids need a steady hand for application but give you the most pigment. Pens are easier to apply, and dry faster, but give less pigment.Gels glide on smoothly and evenly. Gels are often used as a stepping stone from simple pencil to difficult liquid. The look is often very intense and the gel allows smooth application A mixing medium (water) and an angled brush can be used to make any colored eyeshadow into a matching liner.

, If you find something that looks amazing and you feel great about it, go for it! Research pictures of people with similar eye color and see what works for them and test whether you feel comfortable with the same look.


Stay comfortable. It may look better in the magazine and that’s okay. Start slow and stay comfortable. Feeling in your element is more important than pushing your limits.

, When wearing colored liner, apply very subtle eye makeup. You don't want your face to conflict with your eyes, so keep your face makeup minimal. Perhaps skip blush and go for a strong highlight and contour.


For example, you wouldn't want to wear blue eyeshadow, with bright pink blush and red lipstick.
Let people focus on your liner. You don’t want the eyeliner to be a distraction from your pink lips and crazy hair, but rather, a statement and focal point to your look.

, Try to prevent skin showing between your lashes and liner. Start by lining your way from the top inner corner, line as close to the lashline as possible. Work your way outwards and use smaller strokes to create an even effect. Next, do the bottom line in the opposite direction. Start from the outside corner of your eye and gently stroke inwards to your desired location.Start small if you feel overwhelmed. First, line your eyes with a soft black pencil. After your liner looks great, line your eyes with your colored pen. Line the colored pen right atop the black. Afterwards, take a cotton swab and gently smudge the two liners together. You’ll end up with a richer shade nearing on black. This will help give you a small amount of color without it being too obnoxious or gaudy.
Move the liner rather than your head to get a clean, even line. Also, resist the urge to pull your eyelid back taut, because when you release it the line will be rippled and ugly. , If you’re unsure, keeping the line thin and precise is a good way to see if you can pull it off. After you’ve mastered your first look, expand to other styles such as cat eye, double winged or smudged kohl.Cotton swabs are your best friend. Remove excess eye makeup cleanly to prevent smudges.Never slather the colour on, and don't wear it all the time (if you really want a special effect). The less you see of something, the more valuable it becomes. If you're wearing eyeliner for a special someone, or a group of friends, be tasteful about the amount.

, Update your look by experimenting with different color combinations.


Navy blue and grey is one of easiest to pull off because it presents a smoky look during the day. Lightly swipe the navy on your lids and the grey in the creases.
Use purple and brown to complement each other. Use your fingers to blend the colors together as both look good either on the lids or creases. Try what works best for you. Similarly, use turquoise and green during warm weather for a bright summer look. For that all around sun-kissed look, use bronze and peach."

Show off your new look.",How to Use Colored Pencils as Eyeliner," Eyeliner comes in a few different varieties including pencil, crayon, gel, and liquid. Every company is required by the FDA, though, to make sure its formula is safe to use for its intended purpose. Colored pencils are not tested for safety on the skin.Color additives in colored pencils do not have the same intended use as those in cosmetics. They are therefore not tested for safety in the same way.
These color additives may be non-toxic, but they cannot be said to be safe for use on the eye, and may cause negative side effects.;
, Cosmetic eyeliner uses specific preservatives to keep microorganisms from growing on the product. Since colored pencils are not intended for use on the skin, they do not contain the same preservatives.The process of converting colored pencils into eyeliner involves submerging them in warm water. These warm, moist pencil tips provide an ideal environment for bacteria to grow and multiply. This, in turn, might increase your risk of infection according to some optometrists., Look at the way an eyeliner pencil glides onto the skin. Notice how soft the wood of the pencil and the eyeliner core are. Compare that to a pointed, hard colored pencil with wood that more easily splinters and peels.

Placing colored pencils near your eyes may allow them to chip, peel, or break off into your eye. This could cause irritation or abrasions in the eye as well as along the skin of the eyelid., No colored pencil is meant for use on the skin, but choosing new pencils from trusted brands such as Crayola can help minimize the risk. Avoid using old pencils or those from bargain or overseas manufacturers.

Old pencils may foster bacterial growth, making them unsafe to use around the eyes.
Imported pencils may not have to follow the same standards to be considered non-toxic, and may use bargain ingredients that are more likely to cause irritation.

, There are a number of possibilities with colored pencils. You could choose bold or thin lines, a single color or multiple colors, a cat eye, or anything else that you can imagine.

Look at photos and YouTube tutorials online to find inspiration from others who have tried the trend.
Experiment with different looks and color combinations to see which one you like the most.

, If you are using a pencil with a sharp tip, consider dulling it before application. This prevents you from putting yourself in the dangerous situation of having a fine-pointed rigid tip next to your eye.


Scribble on a piece of blank paper until the tip wears down to a smoother, rounded end.

, The water should be hot to the touch, but not so hot so as to melt the pencil lead. Let the pencil sit for about 5 minutes. After that is done, take the pencil out and pat it with a dry paper towel.If you want a thick eyeliner, leave the pencil in hot water for 7-10 minutes.
If you notice your pencil lead melting or running in the water, immediately remove the pencil and allow the water to cool slightly before retrying the process.

, Use the converted pencil the same way you would a normal eyeliner pencil. Glide it on across your eyelid and fill it in to achieve the look you want.


To get a steady line, dot the liner along your eyelid, then go back and fill in the line to make it solid. Use the dotted line as a guide.

, Make your look a bit bolder by creating a wing. Extend the line out beyond your eyelid to make your eyes look wider and make your new liner color more visible.

To get a good wing, extend your line beyond the base of the lid at a slight upward angle toward the tip of your eyebrow. Stop once your liner is about a third of the way to your brow.
Create a triangle by drawing a straight line down from the tip of the wing to your eyelid.
Fill in the triangle.

, Use different colored pencils in the same design to get a bold, creative look. Try one or two colors to compliment your outfit, or go for a whole rainbow.

The pencils have a limited time of malleability, so work with one at a time. Don’t start on the red until you are done with the yellow.
Try a dark color on your eyelid and a bold one on your waterline for just a touch of color.
Go all out and try a rainbow look by blending colors along your eyelid starting from the inner corner and working your way out to edge of your eye.
Use a cotton swab to help you blend colors and create softer transitions.

, Put it all the way into the sharpener, but do not force it. Do not press extremely hard or force the pencil in. The pencil should slide easily into the hole.

, Turn the pencil in the sharpener a couple times (at least one full rotation). Sharpen your eyeliner over a trash can so that the shavings fall into the trash can.

, If you are happy with the sharpness of the tip, stop sharpening. If it still looks dull, keep sharpening. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the sharpness of the pencil.


Eyeliner pencils do not need to be extremely sharp. They are, after all, going to be touching your skin!

, In a pinch, you can also sharpen eyeliner with a knife, such as an X-acto knife or a pen knife. Hold the pencil in your non-dominant hand, and the knife in your dominant hand. Point the pencil downward. Hold the knife perpendicular to the pencil, with the tip an inch or so from the point of the pencil. With the thumb your non-dominant hand, push the knife to the end of the pencil (to the tip). The shavings should come off in thin strips. Repeat this process all the way around the circumference of the pencil. Repeat until sharp., Draw a small line of eyeliner on the back of your hand. Make sure that you are happy with the line it makes. If it’s too thick, sharpen your pencil more. If it’s too thin, draw on your hand or a on piece of paper until the tip becomes more blunt. You should have a small but rounded tip., Sharpen in smaller increments to get just the right tip. Make sure that there are no sharp edges on the tip. It will be touching your eye. When you are finished, try testing the eyeliner on the back of your hand again, and then on your eye.

, Open the sharpener. Throw away the shavings into a garbage can. Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol, and, again, clean the blades and the inner compartment of the eyeliner sharpener. Put the sharpener back together."

Hook the band.,
Lean down to place your breasts in the bra.,

Make the bra look natural.,
Limit the length of time you wear the push up bra.",How to Wear a Push up Bra," The first step before buying a push up bra is to determine your bra size. This is extremely important for every type of bra you wear. Start with the band size. To determine your band size, use a cloth measuring tape and wrap it around yourself under your bust. Make sure to exhale before doing this to get a proper measurement.Another way to achieve this is to bring the measuring tape around the back and up under the armpits across the top of the bust. For either of these measurements, if you get an odd number, make sure to round up to the nearest even number.;
, To find out your cup size, wrap the measuring tape up over the fullest part of your bust, over your nipples. Make sure the tape isn't too tight, but is snug. Round up to the nearest inch if it's not exact.


Subtract the bust measurement from the band measurement. Each inch will determine a cup size. For example, 1 inch is an A, 2 inch is a B, and so on., Push up bras come with underwire, padding, or both. Some women find underwire uncomfortable, while others don't like extra padding. Choosing this is entirely a personal preference.Padding can help make your breasts look larger, while underwire can help lift. Knowing which of these things you want can help you choose.
Go to the store and try on different kinds of push up bras to determine which kind works for your body type and for your comfort level.

, Push up bras come in different shapes. The shape of the push up bra you buy is based on the outfit you will wear with the push up bra.


Demi-cup bras and plunging neckline bras are great for low cut tops.
Strapless, one strap, or razorback bras are good for evening gowns or outfits without sleeves or backs., Push up bras come in many different styles. Some have lace, others beads, and others are plain. Push up bras work best when you can't tell you are wearing one. That means don't wear intricately designed bras underneath thin blouses, and make sure the outfit you wear the push up bra under is the right outfit for the bra.Go for seamless over ornate ones.


Push up bras look good under v-neck shirts and sweaters.
Make sure whatever push up bra you wear doesn't bulge under your clothes. It should be flat and unnoticeable.

, Put the band around your bust and hook it. You can do this in the front and slide it around. Or you can put it on the way you will wear it and hook it in the back., For a push up bra, it is important that you have your breasts sitting on top of the padding or underwire. Lean down and lift your breasts to properly place them in the cup.


When you straighten back up, readjust the bra to make sure the breasts are sitting in the right position and that you don't have any breast spillage over the top of the bra.
If your bra is properly fitted, you will not have any part of your breast spilling out of the side of the bra.

, Once your breasts are properly inside the cups, fix the straps. They should not be twisted, but instead flat against your skin. The straps should sit snugly on your shoulders, but not dig into your skin or fall off your shoulders. Adjust the straps if they are ill-fitting.


The band across your back should lay horizontal. It should not be pulled up your back. If you had your bra properly fitted, you shouldn't have any problems.

, One key to wearing a push up bra is to make sure the bra looks natural. You don't want the bra's cups too be too stiff with padding that it looks hard. People should be paying attention to you, not your bra.


When wearing tight clothes, make sure your padded bra is seamless so that it looks smooth under your clothes.
If your bra fits well, you should not have any unfortunate breasts or skin hanging over the bra and straps.

, Because push up bras fit tighter than other bras, limit the amount of time you spend in the push up bra. If the bra becomes uncomfortable, take it off and wear your regular bra for a few days.

Flick the corners out into cat eyes, or use tape as a guide to draw the outer edges, tapering off towards the tips. Finish the look with dark mascara to your upper lashes.Try touching the sticky side of clear tape with your finger first, so that it isn’t too sticky.For an even more striking look, line your upper lash line the second time with liquid white eyeliner.

, Instead of black or brown liner, draw white liner thickly on your upper lids, beginning as close to the lash line as possible. Top off this dramatic style with mascara to your upper and/or lower lids, if desired., Line your upper lids with white, twice as thick as you typically would apply your liner. Draw another shade of eyeliner, such as black or brown, over half the thickness of the white.For stark contrast, you can also try the opposite: line your upper and lower waterline with black liner, then trace your lash lines with a shimmery white liner.If you want a costumey look, try drawing white eye liner in between two other shades, such as black (near the lash line) and blue (above the white).

, Apply the shadow to your top lids, and your bottom lids below the lash line. Blend the edges with a makeup brush or sponge. Then draw in your lower waterline with white eyeliner. Use clear mascara, if desired."

Understand how the closing mechanism works.,
Know that some bras attach in the front.",How to Unhook a Bra1," A typical bra has two horizontal straps that fasten in the back. One strap has several pairs of eyelets. The other has one pair of hooks that attach to the eyelets. To undo a bra, you must pinch both sides together and slide the hooks out of the eyelets.









Occasionally you may come across a bra that only has one eyelet and one hook, or five eyelets and five hooks. While two or three eyelets and hooks are standard, all of the eyelet-hook bras can be undone in the same way.;
, While these types of bras are not as common as bras that clasp in the back, they do exist. These types of bras have cups that connect with a clasp at the front. So, if you’re trying to undo a bra and can’t seem to find eyelets and hooks at the back, chances are the bra connects in the front.

It's advisable to also wear your top while you stuff so that you can make adjustments accordingly.
Depending on how large you want to go, you may need to use a bra that is two to three cup sizes larger than you usually wear.;
, Put your hand into the bra and gently cup your breast tissue, moving each breast up and towards the center. This creates the cleavage that your socks are going to hold up.

, The sock thickness and size depends on how much you want to increase the appearance of your breasts.


Use thick socks for maximum boost. This is great for parties or for dramatic cleavage.
For a subtle boost, try using thin hosiery socks. This may be preferable for everyday use, formal occasions or slinky dresses that require just a bit more bust.
Whatever thickness you choose, try to use soft socks to avoid chafing.

, Again, how you fold may depend on the type of sock. A good rule of thumb is that the sock should be folded in on itself once.









Fold the sock in half with the heel at the center.
Tuck the toes into the top of the sock enough so that the fold is the right size to fit into the bottom of your bra cup.
Adjust the fold so that it's flat.

, The sock should nest in the bottom of the cup, where the bra already has padding.








The heel should go into the lower corner towards your armpit., Make sure that both sides are even. Adjust the position of the socks if necessary.

Place one hand on each side of the clasp.,
Pull one side of the clasp up and the other side down.",How to Unhook a Bra5," It should be in between the two cups of the bra. Generally clasps are plastic or metal pieces where one side fits down into the other side. When the clasp is flattened, it snaps in place and locks together.








, Lift the edges of the bra up and toward you so that the clasp unlocks. You should see the two metal or plastic pieces unsnap.








, Bras vary on which side of the clasp will go up and which will go down. If you find resistance when you pull one side up, try the other side. The two pieces should come apart so that the bra can be taken off.

, Repeat this step on the other side.


Use one piece of tissue per cup. If you add more, they're more likely to bunch up and ruin your silhouette.
If you're not satisfied with the amount of boost, try thicker tissues or 3- or 4-ply toilet paper.

A small package will do, as you don't need very much., Just like with the fabric, you will cut a strip of moleskin large enough to patch the hole. You may want it large enough to go over the edge of the bra for more stability. Also, try to round off the corners so the fabric won't poke you., Find the place the wire is sticking out. Push it all the way back in, so you can't see the wire anymore. You may want to cover it up a bit with the fabric from the bra. Just stretch it out a bit and use the one side of the rip to cover it up., Peel the paper backing off the moleskin. Put the strip sticky-side down over the hole, and bend it over the edge of the bra if you need to.

Find the right top to wear with the bra.",How to Wear a Bra as a Male Crossdresser," The key to a flattering bra is finding the right fit. Using a soft measuring tape, measure around your ribcage about 2 inches (5 cm) below your nipples. This measurement determines the band size of the bra.;
, The band size refers to the numbers preceding the lettered cup sizes, such as 34B or 36D. Sizes are even numbers typically running from 30-42. Sizes are generally grouped as follows:
27 inches (68.5 cm) = size 30
28-30 inches (71-76 cm) = size 32
31-33 inches (79-84 cm) = size 34
34-36 inches (86-91 cm) = size 36
37-38 inches (94-96.5 cm) = size 38
Past 38 inches, sizes are calculated by rounding up to the next even number. So at 41 inches (104 cm) you would wear a size 42.

, As a man without actual breasts, choose whichever cup size gives you the look you prefer, from small to large. Size AA is the smallest cup size while DD tends to be the largest that is easy to find. Choose a cup size that best fits your body type. If you are thin and petite, a smaller cup size would look more natural.

, Bras are available in virtually any color and fabric. Decide which style best suits your needs and personal taste, from basic white to red lace. Also decide if you would like a bra with an underwire or padding. This can provide a better shape but might be less comfortable. For best results, try on several bras to see what looks and fits best.

, Bras are available at nearly any department store or big box store that sells clothing. If you are uncomfortable buying a bra in person, consider ordering online or ask a female friend to purchase one for you.

, Once wearing your bra, decide whether you want to stuff it for a fuller, more natural look. This can be done with tissues, socks or even silicone inserts.

, Ideally, the bra will not be visible, helping to achieve a natural look.

If you find that loose skin (not the same as breast tissue) now pokes over the top of the bra, you can tuck it in and smooth it down for a smoother silhouette.",How to Put on a Bra," The majority of women are wearing the wrong sized bra—believe it or not. If your bra isn't the right size, then you will have trouble putting it on because it won't fit your dimensions correctly. Here are some easy signs that say that you're wearing the wrong bra:If your breasts spill out of the top of the bra
If the straps of the bra cut into you
If the band of the bra cuts into you
If the bra feels incredibly tight, like you can't breathe in it
If the bra is so loose that the straps fall down no matter how much you adjust them
If you can comfortably fit two fingers between your side and the band of the bra;
, Independent boutiques are generally the best places to get fitted, though they can be wrong. Department stores are the worst places to get fitted, as the employees often aren't trained well and use outdated measuring techniques.









To get an idea of your bra size, measure your underbust in inches, making sure the tape is snug, but not tight. If it is below 30"", round up to the nearest even number. If it is above 36"", round down. Above 40"", bands get very stretchy so you may need to go down another band size after rounding. This is your band size.
To work out the cup size, lean forwards at 90 degrees and measure your bust loosely. Take the difference between the bust and underbust measurements, and convert into cup letters - A=1"" difference, B=2"" difference etc. Be warned that this method can overestimate cup size for people with under busts over 36"" or so (if this applies to you, take a bust measurement while lying on your back and average the two bust measurements, then calculate the cup size).
If you do go to a professional fitter, and you find their results are very different to the results you get from this (eg 2+ band sizes larger, 2+ cup sizes smaller), they are probably using an outdated fitting method, and you should ignore them.

, You may think that the band size you've been told to use is too tight, but the bra should fit a bit snugly. Know that a cup which is too small can make the band feel too tight; try on a bra backward to assess band tightness. Also, know that cups do not hold equal volumes on different band sizes - a 32C is a cup size smaller than a 34C. To change band sizes but keep the same cup volume, go up a cup size for every band size down, and go down a cup size for every band size up.








, You may have thought that you were a 36C all of your life, only to be told that you're really a 34D. Don't think, ""This can't be right""—instead, try wearing a bra in the correct size and see how much better you feel. If you really aren't sure about the results of the fitting, try on as many bras as you can, or, if you're very stuck, get a second opinion from another professional (though take this advice with a grain of salt—your comfort is the top priority, and if they disagree with that, they aren't doing their jobs properly). But you must come to terms with your correct bra size, even if it means you haven't been wearing the right bra all of your life.

, You should get measured at least once a year to make sure that you're wearing the right bra size. There are a variety of reasons the size of your breasts can change, whether it's because your body is still growing, because you've experienced significant weight loss or gain, or if you're pregnant. Measuring regularly is a good habit to keep up if you want to wear the right bra and be able to put it on correctly.

, To put on a traditional bra, the first thing you should do is to place your arms through the armholes. A traditional bra will have two straps that attach the bra cups to the back of the bra and run up and over your shoulder to the back.

, Most bras have clasps in the back that connect the right side of the bra to the left. These clasps will typically have either two or three hooks on one side that will connect with two or three loops on the other side. Your goal is to get all of the hooks into the loops. Many bras have two or three settings of tightness, so you can adjust the bra a bit to make it tighter or looser around your body.









If your bra is new, it should fit closely on the loosest hook. This will allow you to tighten the bra over time as the elastic wears and stretches. If a newer bra can be fastened on the middle or tightest hooks, you may need a smaller back size.
To make it tighter, hook the bra on the eyes which are further in. If you can comfortably wear a new bra on the tightest hooks, consider going down a band size. You should wear new bras on the loosest hooks except when pregnant.
Some bras have a clasp around the front or side instead of the back. The clasp in the front typically just has one setting, so it's easy to clasp it. The clasp on the side can also have multiple settings which you can adjust just as you would adjust the clasps on the back.
Some women have trouble hooking the bra in the back and like to clasp it before they put on the straps. To do this, place the bra backward over your breasts, clasp it, move it around to its proper position in the back, and then place your arms through the arm holes. Be gentle if you use this method, as the movement of the bra could damage the elastic and misshape the wires in the cup.

, Once you've put your hands through the loops of the bra and clasped it, you'll need to adjust the straps so they fit perfectly over your shoulders instead of being too loose or too tight. If they're too loose, they can fall down off your shoulders, all the way to your elbows, and if they're too tight, then you'll feel uncomfortable and the bra cups will be pulled up too high. Here's how to adjust the straps on your bra.








Figure out if the straps are too loose or too tight. If they're too tight, then you'll feel constricted near the straps, and may even feel them digging into the skin of your shoulders. If they're too loose, then they won't stay comfortably on your shoulders and will be hanging off them a bit.
Find the clasps. The clasps are the plastic things on the back of the bra—each strap will have one.
If the bra is too loose, simply pull down on the clasp so it moves closer to the back of the bra and then pull up the extra strap that will hang loose to straighten out the straps. Pull down both clasps to an equal length.
If the bra is too loose, then pull up the clasp from the bottom, moving it up, toward the front of your bra. You'll need to pull down on the straps while moving up the clasps.
If you see that you need to adjust the clasps significantly, it may be easier to unclasp and take off the bra to do this, so you can see what you're doing more easily.

, Once you've put on the bra and adjusted the straps, you should just gently pull at the straps and the sides and back of the bra to make sure that it fits reasonably well. After this, you can begin to make sure that your breasts fill the cups, which is the trickiest part of putting on a bra. Check the straps and band of the bra to make sure that nothing is twisted.

, If you're not already standing, stand up and bend down so that you lower your back about two feet, towards the floor. This will help you move your breasts in the right direction.








, First, feel the sides of your breasts for any additional tissue that is hanging off the sides of each breast, below your armpit. If you're in front of a mirror, you may be able to see this extra tissue. Feel for this tissue with the opposite hand from each breast and then move it in, so that it fills the side of the cup. Then, use the same hand to lift up the breast, so that you've moved the sides of the breast in, and then up.








Repeat the same process with your other hand and other breast. The sides of your breasts should have been gently eased into the sides of each cup and then lifted outwards.
When you've adjusted your breasts, you can stand straight up again.
Ideally, the underwire of your bra should be positioned right along the bottom of your breasts, without leaving any extra space for them to hang down. Your breasts should be perky and moving upwards, not hanging down below the underwire.

, If there is breast tissue coming over the top of the cup, then the bra does not fit, buy a larger cup size or find a bra with more space at the top.

Cut a piece of thick canvas or fabric.,
Cut out a piece of fabric adhesive.,
Back the fabric strip.,
Push the wire back in the bra.,
Put the fabric strip on.",How to Repair an Underwire Bra2," You'll use this piece of fabric to patch the hole, so it needs to be large enough to cover it. You may want to bend it over the edge of the bra for extra security, so make sure it is big enough to do so.You may also want to choose a piece of fabric that's similar in color to your bra. That way, that patch will blend in better.

, The adhesive strip should be about the same size as the fabric strip. You can hold the fabric strip up to the canvas to measure it. As you hold it, cut around the strip.At the fabric store, you can find packages of two-sided fabric adhesive sheets. Some of these are iron-on, but for this project, using one that doesn't require ironing is better, as it's not a good idea to iron some bras.

, Peel off one side of the paper backing on the adhesive strip. That will reveal a sticky strip of adhesive. Carefully adhere the strip to the fabric, trying to get it smooth. The other side of the strip should still be backed with paper.Once you've got it backed, trim up the edges. Also, round off the corners so that they don't poke you later.

, Hold up your bra where the wire is sticking out. Push the wire all the way back in so that all you see is a hole. Try to cover the end of the wire up with a bit of fabric from the bra by moving it around until it's in a good place., Remove the paper backing from the other side of the adhesive. Place the strip sticky-side down over the hole. You can bend the strip over the edge of the bra for more security. Smooth it down, making sure it is stuck well, and you're done."

Thread a needle.,
Push the wire back in.,
Sew the edges together.,
Reinforce the stitching.",How to Repair an Underwire Bra3," Start out by threading a needle. You'll want a fairly sturdy needle, but you don't want one so thick that you'll have a hard time pulling it through. Use a thick thread or double thread it for extra strength. Knot the end of the thread so it won't pull through the fabric.To double thread a needle, smooth two pieces of thread together. Cut the end so the pieces are even. Push both pieces of thread through the eye of the needle at the same time. Leave at least 4 or 5 inches of tail so that the needle doesn't come unthreaded.
An easy way to knot the thread is to find the end of the thread. Hold it up against the needle so that the needle is facing towards the length of the thread, not the end. While holding the end of the thread against the needle near the eye, wrap the thread around the sharp end of the needle three times. Put your fingers over where you wrapped the thread, and pull the needle through. Still holding the loops with your fingers, let the length of the thread go through the loops until it knots at the end. Cut off any extra thread.

, Find the place the wire is sticking out. Push it all the way back in. Gather the the two edges of the fabric that surround the hole by pulling up a bit on each edge and holding them together so that the edges meet, sticking up towards you., With the edges together, start sewing on one end of the hole. Pull the needle through both edges. Loop the thread over the edges, and start on the same side again. Push the needle through again. Keep making this stitch (a whip stitch) until you reach the other edge of the hole. Knot the thread off.Make sure to make your stitches close together to keep the wire from escaping. Also, it's probably a good idea to sew a little bit farther than you think you should on each side to help reinforce it., Use a bit of nail polish or fabric glue to reinforce what you've done. Simply paint or spread a bit of the substance over the stitching. Make sure to work it into the stitches if you can. Let the substance dry, and you're done.You can also use superglue for this step."

Wear a non-padded bra.,
Find your band size.,
Write down your measurement.,
Wrap a measuring tape around the fullest portion of your breasts.,
Record your measurement in inches.,
Calculate your bra cup size.,
Measure your breasts every two to three weeks during pregnancy.,
Purchase three bras.,
Avoid underwire bras.,
Make sure the bra fits comfortably.,
Take proper care of the bra.",How to Measure Bra Size During Pregnancy," Your non-padded bra should fit comfortably and correctly. Wearing a padded bra while taking the measurement can prevent an accurate measurement. If you don’t have a non-padded bra, you can purchase a cheap one at stores like Walmart and Target., Take the inch side of a measuring tape and place it firmly around your body just underneath your breasts and below your armpits. Keep your arms as close as possible to your body to get an accurate measurement of your band size. If this becomes too difficult for you to do yourself, ask a friend to help. Look in the mirror to make sure that the tape is parallel to the floor along your back and breasts.You shouldn’t have any fingers underneath the measuring tape.

, To get the most accurate band size, round the number up to the closest whole number and then add five to allow room for the increase in bust size as your pregnancy progresses. For instance, if the measurement you obtain is 39.5 inches (100.3 cm), rounding up to the nearest whole number is 40. Adding 5 inches (12.7 cm) would mean that your band size is 45 inches (114.3 cm)., Take the measuring tape and wrap it firmly around your body at the biggest portion of your breasts, which is usually around the nipple area. Hold both ends of the measuring tape at the side of your breasts with one hand. Use your other hand to push the measuring tape in between your breasts for a more accurate measurement. Keep your arms as close as possible to your body while taking the measurement., To get the correct cup size, you will need to round the measurement up to the next whole number. For example, if the number you record is 27.5 inches (69.5 cm), your cup size is going to be 28 inches (71 cm). If you can’t see the measurement, have someone check it for you so that you don’t have to move., Take the measurement you recorded for the band size and subtract it from the measurement you have for the cup size. Record the result. The result is your bra cup size. There is a 1 inch (2.5 cm) difference between all cup sizes with the exception of the A cup and AA cup, where there is a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) difference.Bra Sizes: 0 to 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) difference is an AA cup; 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) is an A cup; 2 inches (5.1 cm) is a B cup; 3 inches (7.6 cm) is a C cup; 4 inches (10.2 cm) is a D cup; 5 inches (12.7 cm) is a DD or E cup; 6 inches (15.2 cm) is a DDD or F cup; 7 inches (17.8 cm) is a G cup; 8 inches (20.3 cm) is an H cup; 9 inches (22.9 cm) is an I cup; 10 inches (25.4 cm) is a J cup.

, Do this to ensure you are wearing the proper size bra. During pregnancy your breasts grow quite rapidly and you may need to change your bra size multiple times., If you’re wondering how many bras to purchase, three is ideal. This will allow you to have one bra to wear, one to have, and one to wash. This number, however, may be too many if you expect to purchase multiple bras in different sizes throughout your pregnancy.It is also good to choose bras in multiple colors to wear with different outfits.

, Underwire bras are mostly safe, but they can be a problem during pregnancy. If you’re planning on breast feeding, underwire bras can push into the breast tissue, which clogs the milk ducts. This can inhibit nursing and cause breast infections. Instead, look for look for bras that have contoured cups that conform to your breasts.An example of a contour bra would be Warner’s Women’s Cloud 9 Wire-Free Contour Bra.

, There are several things you need to check when trying bras on. First, the straps should fit comfortably on the shoulders. They should not dig in or be too loose. Your breasts shouldn’t have too little or too much room in the cups. The band should sit straight around your ribs. The center front of the bra should sit flat on the chest.If your straps don’t feel comfortable at first, you can probably adjust them until you find the right fit.

, Caring for your bra properly extends the life and elasticity of the bra. The best way to wash your bra is in the sink with cold water and a mild detergent. If you use the washer, use cold water on a gentle setting. Hang to dry. Do not use a dryer.Some women clean their bra while wearing it in the shower.

Check your bra size.,
Look for a padded bra.,
Consider different types of padding.,
Go for specific bra types.",How to Increase Breast Size With a Bra1," Wearing a bra that is too big will not make your breasts look larger. That is why it is important to wear the right size bra for you. You can visit a lingerie shop and have them measure you to help you fit a bra to your size, or measure yourself before you shop for a new bra to ensure that you get a good fit.Use a flexible tape measure, like one found in a sewing kit. Wrap the measuring tape around the top of your rib cage just below your breasts. Check the measurement and then round this measurement to the nearest even number to determine your bust size.
Measure around your body and across the nipples to find your cup size. The difference in inches between your bust measurement and this measurement is what determines the cup size. If you have less than an inch of difference, then you are an AA cup, a difference of one inch is an A cup, a difference of two inches is a B cup, a difference of three inches is a C cup, etc.
Your breast size will change as you grow and gain or lose weight. Re-measure yourself periodically when you feel you may have had a change in your breast size and need a new bra.;
, One way to increase your breast size with your bra is to look for a bra that is padded. Some bras even promise that they will make your breasts look like they are a full cup size larger. Look for a padded bra that provides the level of padding that you are looking for.


Try on a few different padded bras to find the padding level that works for you.

, Padding comes in a variety of materials, so you can also look for a bra with a specific type of padding.Foam or silicone rubber padding is common, effective and comfortable.
Gel and liquid padding was created to give a more natural breast-like feel to the touch.
Some padded bras have a pocket which allows you to remove the padded inserts if you choose.

, Some bras are more effective than others at increasing your breast size. Try to choose a bra that will give your breasts the lift and support they need to look larger. Some popular choices include:


Demi cup bras. Demi cup bras are cut lower and closer to the nipple to allow more of your breast to spill over the top. The extra exposed skin will provide more cleavage.Push-up bra. The wires in an underwire push-up bra run along the bottom of the breasts in the front of the bra. Some people find underwire push-up bras uncomfortable, but they lift and support your breasts, which can make your breasts look larger."
"
Pick bras that match your tops.,
Pack enough.",How to Pack Bras1," Before you can choose which bras to pack, you need to figure out which tops and dresses you'll be wearing. Make sure that the bras you pick are versatile enough to use with the clothes you plan to bring.For most purposes, a standard smooth bra in a nude/skin tone will be your best option.
When packing light colored t-shirts, opt for a smooth nude/skin tone bra. A white bra can work, as well, but will be slightly more visible than a skin tone choice.
For black tops and other dark shades, consider packing a black bra. Dark colors can bleed onto light colored bras.
If you're packing a halter, racer-back, or strapless top, you will need a strapless bra in a neutral color. Convertible bras are another option, but you need to make sure that you pack the straps if you want to take full advantage of the convertible bra's versatility.
Deep v-neck tops should be paired with a plunging bra so that the bra will not show when the top is worn. Similarly, high neck tops should be paired with a full coverage bra so that the chest area will remain as smooth as possible while the top is on.

, Figure out how many days you'll be gone and determine how many days you can wear each bra you choose to pack. Make sure that you have enough to rotate through during your trip.


As a general rule, you should plan on wearing one bra for every two to three days of your trip. Delicate bras should only be worn once every one or two days.
If you plan to do laundry while you're away, make sure that you have enough bras to last you through your intended laundry day, plus one extra in case your laundry day is delayed.
Always pack more than one bra, even if you're only going to stay somewhere for a couple of days. You need to have multiple bras in case an unforeseen mishap occurs, like the snapping of a strap or the destruction of your bra's underwire.
Plan on rotating through your bras during your stay. If you wear one too often, you can actually wear it out.

Now, it's time to go shopping.,

Check the cup size.,
Start to get critical about the particular preferences.,
At this point, if you need to, go back into the store are and choose new bras based on your observations of the last ones.,
Be sure that every 9-10 months or so, you recheck the fitting of your bra(s).",How to Measure Your Bra Size and Find a Great Bra," Sizing is not always consistent with different brands, but if you try to measure yourself, you can get a general idea of what size you should wear. First, use a measuring tape and measure snugly (but not super tightly) just below your bust. Make sure that the measure doesn't droop or get higher on your back. This is your band size. If this comes out to an odd number, then add one more. Now, use the tape measure to measure around the fullest part of your bust. Subtract your measurement below your bust from the number. (For example, 31- 28). If this number is 1- 1.9, your cup is an A. If it's 2-2.9, you're a B. 3-3.9, et cetera.;
, Choose the right store. You don't have to go to Victoria's Secret (although they do have a wide selection), but choose a store with a good choice of good quality bras. Try Macy's, Kohl's, Gap Body, or a similar store. Victoria's Secret Pink is a great substitute for Victoria's Secret (you might spend $20 rather than $50 on a similar bra) Try to avoid Walmart or Target. While their items are inexpensive, they are often made of poor quality, uncomfortable materials. While you might not want to spend a lot, keep in mind that a bra is an essential and should not be skimped upon. Use your size that you measured and pick out a bunch of bras in lots of styles to try on. Also grab a few in a size bigger or smaller than yours to try as well (you never know, you might like these better). Choose at least 15, maybe more.

,, Now it's time to really test them out. Do whatever you can.First though, adjust the straps. The straps should be snug to your skin, but not cutting into you. They should prevent the bra from slipping down, but not pull it so that it rides up in the back.

, The correct band size is the smallest you can comfortably wear.It needs to be tight enough that the bra is still fairly supportive without weighing down heavily on the shoulder straps. You should be able to run your fingers around the inside of the band, but not much more. A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to fit no more than a fist under the back of the bra.It should fit on the biggest or middle adjustment, but will probably be too tight if you try to fasten it on the smallest size. Bras are designed to fit like this so that you can tighten the band as the elastic starts to wear out. If the band is roomy enough for you to be able to comfortably fasten it on the tightest adjustment, try a smaller band. (For example, go from a 34 to a 32. keep in mind this MAY alter the cup size. So you likely need a cup size that is one letter bigger. If you can only just fasten the bra and the band is painfully tight, even on the biggest adjustment, then go up a band size, for example if a 32D is too tight, try a 34. (This will probably change your letter cup size to a C).

, The correct cup size is the biggest you can completely fill out with no wrinkling of the fabric or space in the cups. You should fill out the cups, but not bulge out anywhere, even in low cut or pushup bras. Check around the cups for any bulging, not only along the top edges but also at the sides under your arms. Make sure the underwire encloses your whole breast and lies flat against your rib cage. Also, make sure that the center piece is flat against your chest. If it's not, you need a bigger cup size. If the cups are too big (i.e. the cups gape open a little), go down a cup size. If they are too small, (i.e. they pinch, or your bust bulges out )try on a bigger cup size. It's a lot easier to tell if they are too big than too small.

, Do the underwires or the edges of the cups dig in to your breasts? If your breasts are bulging out of the sides or over the top of the cups, then you need a bigger cup size. Does the middle of the bra sit flat against your chest? The center of the bra, between the cups, should be against your body. If it is being pushed away from you, then you need a bigger cup size. Bend over. If your breasts are falling out, then the bra doesn't fit. Either the cups are too small, or the band is too big, or both. Put your arms above your head. The bra should neither ride up nor pinch at this point. If the band slips, try a smaller size. If it cuts in, it's too tight. Twist left to right at the waist. Your bra should stay firmly in place and not slip as you move. Try the bra on under your shirt. Does it show?

, You might NOT have to do this though. If you've found ones that fit, get them.

, Is the elastic worn out? Are the cups not shaped anymore? Is the bra sagging or are the straps stretched out? If so, it's time to get a new one. Be sure to measure yourself again, even if you think you know your size (you might have changed).

Twist your bra at the center.,
Tighten the straps.,
Wear two bras.,
Stuff your bra.",How to Increase Breast Size With a Bra2," A simple trick to bring your breasts closer together and create more cleavage is to give your bra a twist. This will pull the cups a little closer together and add a little more cleavage.


Before you put the bra on, turn one cup all the way around from top to bottom to create a twist in the front of the bra between the cups.Then, just put on the bra as you normally would without undoing the twist.

, When you tighten your bra straps, you press your breasts closer to your body, which gives them a lift. This is an especially helpful technique when you are trying to even out the size of your breasts. If one breast is larger than the other, fit your bra to the larger breast and tighten the strap of the smaller breast to even out your chest.Experiment with different levels of tightness to see what works for you. Just keep in mind that making your straps too tight can be uncomfortable.

, Wearing two bras will make your breasts look as much as three times their normal size. Just put on one bra and then put on another bra over the first one.Keep in mind that wearing two bras can be a bit uncomfortable, so you might want to save this technique for a special event.
Do not do this with two sports bras. Wearing two sports bras will flatten your chest even more. To get the best results, wear two padded bras.

, Stuffing your bra is a classic way to create the appearance of larger breasts. However, it is important to stuff your bra with the right materials, or the result can be sloppy.Use socks. Socks are a great option because they are soft and you probably already have lots of them. Just fold a sock in half and place it near the bottom of your bra cup.
Buy gel inserts. You can also purchase silicone gel inserts to pad your bra. You can slip these inserts into the bottom of your bra to make your breasts look a full cup size bigger.
Avoid tissues and cotton balls. Tissues and cotton balls may slip out more easily than other materials. They can also fall apart and create a lumpy appearance.

"
"
Choose tops that make your bust look bigger.,
Work on your posture.,
Wear accessories that hang right on your breasts.,
Use makeup to create the appearance of cleavage.",How to Increase Breast Size With a Bra3," Some of your tops might be more flattering to your chest than others. To ensure that you are making your breasts look as big as possible, choose tops that have the desired effect. Some good options include tops that have:Ruffles around or near the chest.
Lighter colors on top and darker colors on bottom.
Horizontal stripes around the chest area.
Gathered material or pleating around the neckline.

, Sitting or standing up tall can also make your breasts look larger and fuller.Try to remember to stand up and sit straight to ensure that your breasts will look as big as possible.


Try setting a reminder on your phone to “stand up straight.” Every time the reminder goes off, pull yourself up to your full height and push out your chest.

, Some carefully chosen accessories may also help to enhance your breasts. For example, you can choose items that draw the eye towards your chest, rather than away from it. Skip the dangly earrings and go for necklaces and brooches instead.


Try wearing necklaces that hang down to the area between your breasts or just above your cleavage. Or, try wearing a brooch right on the edge of a scoop neck or v-neck sweater.

, You can also use makeup to contour the areas just above your breasts, which can make it look like you have cleavage or enhance your existing cleavage.


To create the appearance of cleavage with makeup, use a light brown eyeliner to draw two arcs just above your breasts.
Then, use a fluffy brush to blend the lines with some matte bronzer.Use a bronzer that is a couple shades darker than what you would normally wear. Be sure to blend until the arcs are barely visible; they should provide just a shadow that resembles cleavage but not be too obvious.

Save the bras for last.,
Stack the bras on top of each other.,
Stuff the cups.,
Protect the bras from damaging items.,
Remove them as soon as possible.",How to Pack Bras2," Your bras should be one of the last things you pack. Clear a space for them within the top layer of clothes in your suitcase.


Measure out the total depth of your bras when stacked together. The space you clear out should be at least that deep. If you try to cram the bras into a space that is too small, you may distort the cups.;
, Place your bras together so that the cups of each one rest on top of the cups of the bra beneath it. All of the bras should lie flat, not folded.









Do not fold one cup into another when you are packing molded bras. By inverting one cup, you distort the shape of that cup. This can lead to dents, bumps, and an overall improper fit.

, Roll up your socks, tank tops, or underwear and stuff the material into the cups of your bottom bra.








Fill the cups of the bra with enough material to keep them as full as possible. Doing so will prevent the cups from caving inward even when accidental pressure is applied. As a result, you can better preserve the shape and longevity of all the bra cups in your stack.

, Keep the bras away from items in your suitcase that can snag the material or crush the cups.


Consider placing the stacked bras in a large plastic bag or covering them with a sheet of plastic or wax paper. This one extra precaution can prevent Velcro or zippers from snagging the material.
Do not place any thing heavy on top of the bras.
It is also a good idea to tuck in the straps to prevent the hooks from getting snagged on other bras or clothing. Stuff the straps beneath the cup of the bra they belong to and above the cup of the bra beneath. For the bottom bra, stuff the strap in between the cups of the bra and the stuffing material you filled them with.

, Ideally, you should unpack your bras as soon as you reach your destination. Do not leave them in your suitcase during the duration of your stay.









Keeping the bras in a stuffed suitcase for a prolonged period of time can cause the cups to become distorted even if you took plenty of precautions while packing them.
Hang your unpacked bras on a doorknob, hook, or hanger. Make sure that you do not hang them beneath bulky items like bags or coats, though, since doing so can crush the cups.

"
"
Tuck one cup into the other.,
Fasten the hooks.,
Stack the bras.,
Keep the bras in a protected space.,
Unpack them as soon as possible.",How to Pack Bras3," Fold each bra in half, inverting one cup so that it collapses into the other.








The cups of non-molded bras are not as easily distorted, so you should be able to invert them without causing any damage to the integrity of the cup shape or the overall bra.

, Fasten the hooks of the back strap together. Tuck the straps into the cup of the bra once clasped together.


Doing this can prevent the hooks from snagging any other bras or clothes.

, Fold each bra separately, then stack them together. Stack one on top of another so that the cups of one bra rest over the cups of the one beneath it.


Since the cups are not as sensitive as they would be with a molded bra, you do not need to stuff them with any excess material to prevent them from collapsing when you pack them.

, If possible, place the bras in a separate zipper compartment of your suitcase instead of keeping them in the main space with the rest of your clothes.


Another option would be to slide the stacked bras into a large plastic bag. Choose a durable bag, like a “freezer safe” resealable bag or the type you would get from a department store. You can then place this bag into the main compartment of your suitcase and the bras should stay protected from zippers, clasps, Velcro, and similar threats.

, When you reach your destination, remove the bras from your suitcase and keep them out for the remainder of your stay.









While it is not as crucial to unpack non-molded bras as it is to unpack molded bras, it is still advisable. Leaving any bra in a stuffed suitcase for a prolonged period can cause damage to the underwire and the overall integrity of the bra.
You can hang your unpacked bras on a hook, hanger, or doorknob. Try to avoid hanging them beneath heavy items, though. Even though the cups of a non-molded bra cannot be easily distorted, you can still damage the integrity of the bra if you crush it carelessly.

Choose a case.,
Stack the bras inside the case.,
Place the case inside of your empty bag.",How to Pack Bras4," You can choose an ordinary box or a specialized bra traveling case, but either way, the container you use should be hard.









There are several cases available on the market that are specially designed to hold bras, but the best are bra-shaped, hardcover, and designed so that the bras will lie flat instead of folded.If you don't want to buy an actual bra travel case, consider using a sturdy plastic container or cardboard box. The container should span the length of your bra cups when they lie flat, and the width of the container should roughly match the height of the cups.

, Lay the bras out flat and stack them on top of one another. The cups of one bra should fit over the cups of the one beneath it.









When packing bras with molded cups, you should never fold one cup into another. Doing so will cause dents, bumps, and other distortions in the cup you invert, and as a result, the bra will no longer fit as well as it should.
Consider tucking the straps in to prevent the hooks from snagging the other bras. The straps of each bra should be wedged in between the cups of the bra they belong to and the cups of the bra beneath it.
Most bra traveling cases can fit one to six bras, depending on the case itself and the size of your bras. If you have a small cup size, you can usually fit up to six; for larger cup sizes, you may only be able to fit one or two.
If you opt to use a plastic container or cardboard box, pack as many bras into the container as possible without crushing them. Do not stuff the bras into the box since doing so will distort the shape of the cups.
Since there is no risk of accidental crushing when you pack the bras in a separate case, you do not need to stuff the cups with any excess material.

, Sit the packed case inside of the main body of your empty suitcase, then pack the rest of your clothes around the case.









Fill in as much space around the sides of the case as possible. Doing so can prevent the bras from getting tossed around and tangled during transport.
Note that you can unpack your bras when you reach your destination, but if you pack them in a separate container and leave plenty of excess space, there is very little risk of causing them to become distorted. That being the case, you should be able to keep them in the case for the duration of the stay without much of any risk.

,, If washing silk or silk-like material, use gentle lingerie wash (like Woolite or the washes that GapBody and sometimes Victoria's Secret sell) or shampoo to avoid damaging the material. If your bra is made of cotton,your regular detergent should be fine.

, If you use bleach, wear rubber gloves while washing to avoid harming your skin.

, Let the bra soak for 10-15 minutes in the wash water, occasionally agitating the water and scrubbing with your fingers the areas that have the most wear (the underarms, back clasp, the straps.)

Put on a comfortable, well-fitting, non-padded bra.,
Find your band size.,
Find your bust size.,
Subtract your band size from your bust size.,
Combine the cup size with your band measurement, and you have your final bra size.,
Remember that the cup size is not the same for each band size.,
Get help from a professional if you need it.,
Hook the bra so it is hanging around your waist.,
Lean forward and pull the bra up from the front only, sliding your arms through the straps.,
Lean forward and, using the opposite hand, reach into the bra and pull the soft flesh near your armpits into the cup.,
Check the fit and tighten the straps.,
Remember your bra size is not permanent and will change along with your body.,
Get to know your breasts.,
Consider the function of the bra you are buying.,
Buy a sports bra for exercising.,
Check that the cups are smooth and the edges lie flat against your chest.,
Make sure the bra band is snug and low in the back.,
Make sure the straps stay in place but don't dig into your shoulders.,
Check that the underwire doesn't dig into your chest or pinch your skin.,
Make sure the band isn't too tight.",How to Choose the Right Bra," Choose the bra you feel most comfortable in--it should be snug but not dig into your sides.Your nipples should be about halfway between your elbow and shoulder. If they are lower, tighten the straps to lift.You can also measure without a bra, but it may be slightly more challenging when things can move around.;
, Standing in front of a mirror, use a soft tape measurer to measure around your ribs right under your breasts. This is also where the band of your bra wraps around your torso. Pull the tape tight. Write down this measurement.Use the mirror to make sure the tape is exactly parallel to the floor. If the measuring tape is not in a straight line around your body and at an angle, you will not get an accurate measurement.Don't pull the tape so tight it's like you are wearing a corset. Just make sure it is squeezing your body snugly.If your measurement is a fraction (like 33 1/2 inches), round up to the nearest whole number (34 inches).Band sizes are measured in even numbers, so if your measurement was odd, you may want to try one size up and one size down (if you measure 35 inches, try both the 34 and the 36 size bra), but round up for now., Wrap the measuring tape around your back and measure your breasts at their fullest point, usually at the nipple.Write down this measurement.


Because your cup size can fluctuate based on hormones and bloating, try to measure on a day when your breasts feel relatively normal.If you are concerned about your posture (maybe you slouch), try bending forward at the hips to a 90 degree angle, or until your body forms an L shape. Then measure your bust from that position.Don't pull the tape tight like you did with your band measurement.
As with the band measurement, round up to the nearest whole number if your measurement is a fraction.Again, be certain the tape is straight across your back. The measuring tape should not angle up from your back toward your nipples.
All women have one breast that is larger than the other, so be sure you are measuring to the fuller breast., The difference between these two numbers is your key to finding your cup size. A 1 inch difference = A cup. 2 inch = B cup. 3 inch = C cup. 4 inch = D cup. 5 inch = DD cup.Once you go above 5 inches (12.7 cm), cup sizes will differ with each company. There should be a sizing chart on the company's website and you can use your band and bust measurement to find which cup you want., So, a 34C means you have a 34 inch band and a C cup.

, A 34B cup will be smaller than a 36B cup. When trying on bras, if you change band sizes you, will also have to change cup sizes.


If you need a larger band size, go down a cup size. So instead of 34B, you'll want 36A.
If you need a smaller band size, go up a cup size. Instead of 34B, go for 32C.
It is more important to have an accurate band measurement than cup measurement. Going up or down a band size is a more significant change than going up or down a cup size. Get a comfortable band first and then fine tune with the cup size., If you aren't sure you're doing it right, want a second opinion, or just don't feel like measuring yourself, stop into any bra or lingerie store or department and ask a sales associate for help. Helping customers find the best bra is part of their job, and they will know exactly what to do.

, Make sure the straps are loose--you can tighten them later if you need to.If you have trouble hooking a bra behind your back, you can hook the bra at the front and then twist it around your waist so the hooks are at your spine.

, The cups may feel empty or a little too big at this point, but that's ok. The band should be snug and low on your back., Pull all the soft flesh forward and up. Then hold the bra in the center between the two cups and jiggle it., Straps shouldn't be so tight they dig into your shoulders, but there should be no slack.Does the bra pinch your breasts or make it look like you have four boobs? Then it's the wrong size.Your nipples should be about halfway between your shoulder and elbow.If your breasts are spilling out of the sides of your bra, you need a different size., Just because you are a 34C now doesn't mean you will always have those same measurements. If you've gone through a major body change or your bra doesn't feel right, take your measurements again.


Get refitted if your weight has fluctuated more than 10 pounds, you've had a baby, started exercising regularly, or have completed hormone therapy., The size and shape of your breasts may impact your bra size and influence which style is most flattering to your body. Breasts and bodies come in every shape and size. Instead of worrying that your breasts don't look like a Victoria Secret Model's, concentrate on dressing for your body and finding what looks best on you.


Examine detailed fitting guides that recommend bras for many different shapes and types of breasts. They make suggestions for women with prominent breast bones, large areolas, distended stomachs, and more.

, Is this an everyday bra to wear under a t-shirt? Do you wear a lot of low-cut shirts or are you planning to wear a backless dress? Maybe you can only afford one bra and need something with versatility? There are tons of possibilities for different styles, cuts, and fits.


Check out a guide to the pros and cons of different bra styles, and on which bodies and breast shapes they work best.
A seamless bra can be a great everyday bra to wear under T-shirt or with other form-fitting clothes, as it will be almost invisible underneath., If your breasts bounce or move too much during activity, the supportive ligaments begin to break down.Bouncing can also become very painful, and the discomfort may eventually prevent you from participating in activities.


Check the impact or intensity level when shopping for a sports bra. A low-impact bra works great for yoga or hiking. A high-impact bra is necessary for activities like running.Smaller-breasted women are usually comfortable in compression bras (that give the appearance of a ""unibreast"") and look like a cropped tank top.
For larger-breasted women, an bra that cups and encapsulates each breast may be more comfortable and inhibit bouncing. These bras have wide straps and clasps.You may also find a bra that combines compression and encapsulation, which will give you the best support overall., If the cups are wrinkled or look pointy, you may not be filling out the cup and need a smaller size. If you are spilling out of the cups or feel pinched, try a larger cup size., The band can be parallel to the floor but should angle no higher. If the band is too high, the bra cannot provide proper support.Try a smaller band size or tightening the straps.

, Your straps should not provide the majority of the support. If you're relying on the shoulder straps to keep your breasts lifted, you may actually need a smaller band size.


If your shoulders are sloping or narrow, try a bra with a leotard back, a racerback bra, or buy a special clip that will keep your straps from slipping off your shoulders., The wires should not bend outward in the center. Try a larger size or consider a bra without an underwire.Many women choose to wear a bra with an underwire, but a soft-fit bra that is properly fitted can provide equal support. Go with whatever feels most comfortable to you., Run a finger under the front of your band. If you can't slide your finger under the band, your bra may be hooked too tight or you need a larger band size.If your bra becomes uncomfortable when you sit, try a larger band or a bra with and arched center panel. Your ribs expand when you are in a seated position. You want your bra to be comfortable whether you're on your feet or in a chair."

Don’t pull the measuring tape too tight.
If you do not measure exactly to the inch, round up.
For every inch difference, go up a cup size. 1” would be an A cup, 2” a B, and so on.
If your cup size is greater than a D, different manufacturers will classify your cup size differently, so you may have to try different cup sizes when you fit bras. , It's important to realize that the size of the cup will increase along with the band size, and vice versa. For example, the cup of a size 36C bra will be bigger than the cup of a size 34C bra. So:


If you want to try a smaller band size, you’ll need to compensate by choosing a larger cup size. For example, if you find the band on a 36B bra is too loose, go for a 34C instead.
And if you want to try a larger band size, you’d need a smaller cup. For example, if a 34B is too tight around the band, try a 36A.

, Lift the front up as high as it will go, without sliding over the front of your breasts.


This will make sure the back stays low, for proper support.
This will make sure you get lift in front, where you want it.

When buying a bra, hook into the loops at the very end of the band. This gives you a way to tighten the bra as it stretches out over time.

, Your breast size will change along with other changes in your body.


Get fitted every time you lose or gain more than ten pounds, or have hormonal changes such as with pregnancy or hormone therapy. Many lingerie stores and departments offer free professional fitting.
Don’t be embarrassed! These women are usually very kind and professional, and have seen it all before.Try to get fitted at a store with a wide range of brands and sizes, otherwise the information you get might be limited to what the store actually sells.

, While bras are widely available, most stores cater to “average” sizes. Find a store or a brand that is particularly suited to your body type.


If you have a hard time shopping in department stores, consider going to specialty lingerie stores or ordering online.
Don’t feel pressured to buy in any store, or from a particular salesperson. There are many options to choose from!

, Bras can be expensive, but it’s important not to sacrifice good fit for the sake of paying less.


An ill-fitting bra is not worth buying. It will eventually make you uncomfortable, both physically and psychologically.
Plan to have less bras in your wardrobe, if necessary. Buy bras that are versatile, such as “convertible” styles, or ones with removable straps. Thinks about the color of the clothes in your wardrobe and aim to buy bras to match.

, Your size is just a starting point, as sizing can vary and every bra will fit a little bit differently. Take the time to try it on in the store and make sure it’s right.


When shopping for bras, plan to spend a fair amount of time in the store choosing and fitting bras. Don’t be frustrated if you don’t find the right fit right away.
If you order online, make sure the site you buy from has a good return policy.

, The shape of your breasts and torso are unique. Depending on your particular proportions, certain styles will look better on you than others.


Your bra will look better if it flatters the overall proportion of your torso. Ideally, your shoulders should look about the same width as your hips.

If your shoulders are broad, try to find bras with narrower set straps, and a shape that plunges more in the middle.

If your shoulders are narrow, consider bras that create a more distinct horizontal line across your torso.

If your torso is short, a bra that plunges more in the middle can elongate your torso.
Consider the shape of your breasts. There is a wide variety of breast shapes and sizes. To understand how to classify your breasts, look at this guide.

, Put your arms above your head and twist left and right at the waist.


The bra should neither ride up nor pinch at this point. If the band slips, try a smaller size. If it cuts in, it's too tight.
If you're trying on a sports bra, jog in place or jump up and down as well to test if it can control 'bounce' comfortably.
Bend over. If your breasts are falling out, then the bra doesn't fit.

, There are plenty of add-ons that can make your bras more comfortable.


Everyone has one breast larger than the other. Adjust each strap to the correct length, and consider padding one side.
If your bra band is too tight, consider purchasing a band extender.
If your straps hurt because they're cutting into your shoulders, you may benefit from strap padding.
If the straps keep falling off your shoulders, consider a clip to hold them together in the back.

, If you’re unhappy with your body, bra shopping can be a truly unpleasant experience. However, it's important to remember that every woman's body is unique, but bras are mass produced. No bra can ever be made to look good on everyone.


Remember that even with a perfect body (if such a thing exists) an ill-fitting, unflattering bra can do a woman a great disservice.
If something doesn't suit you, remember that you can always wear something else. Refrain from passing judgement on yourself.
If you’re having a hard time finding a bra, this doesn't mean you are ugly or strangely shaped. It just means you’re different.

,


The cup: The part where your breasts fit into. It’s usually made of stretchy fabric, and can have up to three tailored seams.
The band: This is the elastic part that goes all the way around your chest.
The wings:These are the portion of the band that extend from the end of the cups to the center of the back.
The strap:These go over the shoulders and are often adjustable, and sometimes padded.
The closure: This is usually a hook and eye set at the center back. However it can also be in front, or absent.
The center gore: This is the part between the cups in the front.

, If you appear to have four, you have what is called the “quad boob effect.”


This indicates that the cups are too small, and there's not enough room inside.
This is especially apparent if you try your shirt on over your bra.

, If it does, this means that the band is too loose.


Try raising your arms and bending backward a bit to check if this happens.
Remember, when you go up a band size, go down a cup size.

, If it won’t, then the bra doesn't fit.


This could be because the underwire is the wrong shape for your breasts.
It could also indicate that the cup size is either too large or too small.

, You should be able to run your fingers around under the edge of the fabric.


If you can pull it away from your back by more than a couple of inches, it's too loose.
If the band digs into your sides, to the extent that it causes pain after wearing it, the band is too small.
If the band rides up, try loosening the straps. If this doesn’t work, the band is too big.

, This does not necessarily mean the band is too tight.


Instead, look for bras that have a wider band or a “leotard band” to create a smoother silhouette.
Unless the band is causing you pain, don’t go up a band size, otherwise you will not have enough support.
This could also indicate that the cup size is too small.Another solution is to wear a body shaping undergarment.

, This could mean that the cup size is too big, the style is wrong, or that you have not put the bra on properly.


Try adjusting your breasts to make sure they are centered in the cup.
This could also mean that the bra is not right for your breast shape.
If your breasts are fuller at the bottom than at the top, you may need a differently shaped bra, such as a “demi cup” or “balcony” style bra.

, This can cause pain, and other problems.


Straps that dig into your shoulders can cause long term problems, such as headaches, back pain, permanent indentations, and even nerve damage.
Try looking for bras with wide, padded straps, especially if you have larger breasts.
Shoulder pain could also indicate that the band is too big, and not providing enough support. The support should come from the band, not the straps.

, If you’ve adjusted the straps and they still keep falling, try a different bra.


Petite women and women with sloping shoulders often have this problem.
Make sure the straps are set close enough together and are fully adjustable.

, Underwires that are fitted properly should not cause any pain or discomfort.


If the cup is too small, the underwire may not fit comfortably under your breasts.
Also, your individual breasts may not necessarily be the same shape as the manufacturer’s underwires.
You may have trouble wearing underwires if you have a higher rib cage.
Underwires are not recommended for pregnant women or women undergoing surgery.
Some medical conditions may also make it inadvisable to wear underwires.
Bras without underwire can be just as supportive, even if you have larger breasts, as long as the fit is correct.

, This is the first number in a bra size and indicates the band width. Add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to this measurement for the correct bandwidth for you. If the number is odd, choose the next highest even number.

, Keep the tape in the back even with the tape in the front to get an accurate measurement.


The bra sizes are as followed: Cup A = 0 to 1.5-inch difference, B (1.5 to 2.5), C (2.5 to 3.5), D (3.5 to 4.5), E or DD (5 to 6), F or DDD (6 to 7), G (7 to 8), H (8 to 9), I (10), and J (10 to 11).

If you're buying nursing bras online, carefully follow the directions for measuring bra size from each manufacturer as it may differ from other stores. You want to obtain the best fit possible.

, The wide straps help to distribute the weight of your breasts and provide more comfort.

, Non-breathable materials will trap moisture next to the breast and encourage bacterial growth and soreness.

,


Avoid bras that expose the breast entirely when opened, especially if you will need to feed the baby in public occasionally. These types of bras make it difficult to be discreet, although they may be used in private without much difficulty.

Stick with a standard bra for casual crew neck t-shirts.,
Opt for a seamless bra for shirts made of clingy fabric.,
Look for a plunging bra for deep v-neck tops.,
Try on a halter bra for a halter top.,
Use a strapless bra beneath a strapless or spaghetti string top.,

Many women find a standard, no-fuss bra the most comfortable but you can opt for whatever style you like best.

, Seamless bras prevent lines from showing through your top, making them an excellent choice for tight t-shirts and fitted blouses. Stick with a full-coverage bra to create the smoothest fit, since demi-cup bras hit the middle of your breast and may create a dividing line that can show through your top.

, Plunging bras have a very deep center bridge, well below your breasts. If you wear a standard bra with a deep neckline, the cups or bridge may be exposed.

, The straps on a halter bra come in closer around your neck, rather than sitting further out along your shoulder. As a result, the straps remain hidden beneath the fabric of your top.


Wear racerback bras for racerback tops. Like the halter bra, the racerback bra has straps that mimic the shape of the top that shares its name.

, Strapless bras smooth out your form and provide basic support. They might run a little tighter than a standard bra, however, since the band must provide full support in the absence of straps.

, A bra with super thin straps may coordinate well enough with a spaghetti strap top. The straps may not disappear completely beneath your top but as long as your bra straps do not exceed the thickness of your top's straps, you may be able to get away with showing your bra straps in casual settings.


Choose a color that matches your top or stick with a neutral color.

, Convertible bras have adjustable straps, allowing you to change the way the straps fit based on the cut of your shirt. Basic convertible bras can usually be changed into halter bras and strapless bras; more extravagant convertibles have even more options.

, Silicone adhesive bras have no back and no straps. They stick onto your skin and smooth out your silhouette. These bras offer minimal support, however, so you should only use them as a last resort.

, There are no rules about matching the bra to your underwear––nobody sees the ""match"" and it's totally up to you whether this matters or not. If it does matter, aim to buy the bra and underwear at the same time to ensure a good match.

Stick with thicker straps if you are well-endowed.,
Give yourself added lift with a push-up bra.,
Wear padding sparingly.",How to Wear the Right Bra for Your Outfit4," Thicker shoulder straps provide better support, which is essential for women with especially large busts. If you have a smaller bust size, however, thinner straps may provide enough support.

, The right push-up bra can work beneath a wide variety of tops, ranging from ordinary t-shirts to fancier blouses. Look for one that creates a smooth, natural silhouette, though, or else you may end up looking disproportionate or obviously fake.

, A bra with light padding can look natural and give your bust a few added inches. Too much padding can look obvious, however and will not flatter your figure well.

Use a soft cloth tape measure to measure the length around your torso, just beneath your breasts.,
Add five inches (12.5cm) to this measurement, rounding up to the nearest even whole number.,
Use your tape measure to measure around the widest part of your chest.,
Take the difference between your band size and your bust size to find your cup size.,
When trying on a bra, place your hands through the straps and bend over at the waist, so that your breasts fall into the cups.,
Adjust both the hooks and strap size of the bra to achieve a comfortable fit when trying on a bra.,
Check the bridge of the bra.",How to Wear the Right Bra for Your Outfit5," The measuring tape should rest where your bra band rests. Keep the tape smooth and parallel to the floor.

, This number is your band size.

, Usually, the tape measure should cross over your nipples. Keep the tape measure parallel to the floor. Do not allow it to become slack but do not keep it too tight, either. This number is your bust size.

, Add a cup size for every inch (2.5cm). For example, a difference of one inch (2.5cm) puts you in an A cup, a difference of two inches (5cm) puts you in a B cup, a difference of three inches (7.5cm) puts you in a C cup, a difference of four inches (10cm) puts you in a D cup, and a difference of five inches (12.5cm) puts you in a DD or E cup. If the difference is less than one inch (2.5cm), you should wear an AA cup.

, The cups should contain your breasts and the center of your nipple should fall in the fullest part of the cup.


If your breasts brim over the cup in the middle or at the sides, the bra is too small.
If the bra fabric is pinched together in places and not filled in by flesh, the bra is too large.

, Neither the band nor the straps should dig into your skin but both should fit snugly and lie flat.

, This center piece of fabric should lay flat against the breastbone.

If you have ill-fitting lingerie, it may be poking or pinching you, or it might be causing unsightly lumps and wrinkles. If you've been wearing the wrong size bra (like lots of women do), you'll be amazed what a difference properly fitting lingerie will make., To find out what band size you should be wearing, wrap a soft tape measure around your body, placing the measure directly beneath your breasts. Round up to the nearest whole number.If you get an even number, add four to your measurement to find your band size. For example, if you measured 32 inches (81.3 cm) across, you have a band size of 36.
If you get an odd number, add five to your measurement to find your band size. For example, if you measured 31 inches (78.7 cm) across, you have a band size of 36.

, Wrap the flexible tape measure around the fullest part of your bust, being careful not to tighten it too much so that you compress your bust. Round up to the nearest whole number.

, Once you have both of your measurements, use some simple math to calculate your cup size. Simply subtract your band size from the measurement around the fullest part of your breasts. For example, if your band size is 36 and your breasts measured 38 inches (96.5 cm) around, your number would be 2.A difference of 0 is an AA cup.
A difference of 1 is an A cup.
A difference of 2 is a B cup.
A difference of 3 is a C cup.
A difference of 4 is a D cup.

, When shopping for bras and camis, choose pieces with necklines that will show off some skin and flatter your smaller bust, like scoop necks and v-necks.If you really want a really sexy look, opt for a super deep v-neck.A low-cut cami looks great if you want to emphasize your chest while covering up your stomach., Strapless lingerie like bandeau tops look great on women with smaller busts. Not everyone can wear these styles, so take advantage of it!, If you want to enhance the size of your bust a bit, choose a push-up bra or a cami with a built-in push-up. Try it on and look at yourself in the mirror to make sure that it gives you the look you want. Some women feel that push-up bra lingerie makes them appear too unnatural, while others love it.You can buy bras with padding to give yourself a little a extra volume, but only if you want! Make sure to keep it natural by not going overboard with padding., As a woman with a smaller bust, you don't need a ton of support from your bra, so you have a lot of different style options available to you. This means if you dislike underwires, you don't have to wear them! If you want to add a little roundness to your breasts, you can opt for a style with an underwire., The more of your chest and neck you show, the bigger your bust will look. Avoid full-coverage bra cups and choose styles that show a little more skin.Select bras with flattering cup shapes, like the triangle cup, or any shape that minimizes the amount of fabric between the cups.

, Use lingerie as a way to highlight the parts of your body your love the most. If you have long, slender legs, for instance, look for lingerie that shows them off and do not worry as much about emphasizing your bust.

, If you want to make your top half look bigger, try choosing a bra with a wider band.You can wear low-cut panties to balance the look if you have wider hips.

, Lace, bows, and other embellishments will help draw attention to your upper half and make your bust appear larger., Bold patterns like horizontal stripes will add visual weight to your bust.Look for pieces that have horizontal stripes on the top and a solid color on the bottom for best results.

, Black slims down everything, including your bust. Choose bras in pastels or other light colors to create a fuller appearance.You can wear black panties to give the illusion of less weight on the bottom half of your body.

, If you're comfortable showing a little extra skin, go for some lacy or sheer material on top. It will add more visual interest and you will look amazing.A sheer chemise will give you some added tummy coverage while still allowing you to show plenty of skin.

Know that cup size is not absolute.,
Understand how a correctly fitted bra should look and feel.,
Be aware of different breast shapes.,
Know about sister sizes.,
Navigate different fitting styles.,
Be wary of professional fittings.",How to Measure Your Bra Size1," This is the biggest myth about bra sizes: that a D cup looks the same on every band size, or that having small breasts automatically means you're an A cup. Actually, cup size is proportional to band size — meaning it's dependent on your band measurement. For instance, a 32 D will fill out less volume than a 36 D, but they're both D cups.






;
, There are a few tell-tale signs that indicate whether or not a bra fits you. Here's what to keep an eye out for as you're measuring yourself and trying on different sizes:









A snug band: The band is what should do the majority of the work supporting your breasts, not the straps. You should be able to put one or two fingers under the band, but no more.
Sufficient side coverage: You shouldn't have any tissue coming out from the sides of the cups, beneath your armpits. On an underwire bra, you can assess side coverage with the underwire: if the end of it is pointing toward the middle of your armpit, you're good to go.
A flat gore: The gore (the part of the bra band that's between the cups) should sit flat against your chest, without digging into your skin uncomfortably. If it doesn't, you're wearing the wrong bra.
A smooth curve: Avoid the dreaded ""quad-boob"" that results from the top of a too-small cup cutting into breast tissue above the bra. Instead, look for a fit that results in a clean silhouette with no stray tissue.

, So what happens if you find a bra in your size, but it still fits wrong? You're probably not picking the right bra cut for your breast shape. Try these solutions to common shape issues:









Shallow breasts: If your breast tissue is evenly spread over a wider area, with less projection, you probably have a shallow shape. (Another tell-tale sign: having breast tissue near your collarbones despite being relatively small-busted.) Shallow breasts fit best in balconette or demi-cup bras, with a cup that's open on top and cut horizontally. Avoid plunge styles.
Pendulous or tuberous breasts: If the base of your breast is relatively narrow, but the actual tissue hangs down quite a bit, don't despair! Instead, look for bras that have underwires, well-separated cups and fuller breast coverage. Avoid demi cups and plunge bras.

, If you find a bra that's close to a perfect fit but not quite there, try a sister size. It might provide just enough variation to correct the slight differences between manufacturers.









Go down a sister size: Reduce your band size by two, but take your cup size up one interval. For instance, you might go from a 36 C to a 34 D.
Go up a sister size: Increase your band size by two, but go down one cup size. For instance, you might go from a 36 C to a 38 B.

, Currently, there are two different bra fitting styles (outlined below). The modern measurement is being adopted by more manufacturers, though some still use the traditional style. Unfortunately, it's difficult to know which system individual designers and labels use. Here's how to hedge your bets:









If you're trying on bras in a store, it's a good idea to know what your size is for both styles.
If you're ordering online, try to find a site that has a flexible return policy.

, Asking for a seasoned professional to measure you is a great idea if you're starting from square one — she'll probably be able to suggest cuts and styles that could work for you. However, being fitted comes with a few caveats:









Avoid stores that carry a limited range. A fitter at one of these shops might try to incorrectly sell you a size that they have on-hand, instead of your true size. Before you commit to a fitting, make sure the store carries smaller band sizes (such as 28 and 30) and larger cups (DDD and up). Good choices in the US include department stores like Nordstrom and Dillard's.
Ask to be fitted with both measurement systems. That way, you have an idea of what size to try if one style produces a completely wrong fit.
Don't leave your current bra on. If your fitter tries to measure you with your bra still on, it's probably not going to be the correct measurement. If you're concerned about modesty, wear a thin but close-fitting tank top to your fitting, and simply remove the bra underneath.

Respect your daughter’s privacy.",How to Buy Your Daughter's First Bra," Observe your daughter’s chest area beginning around the age of 9 or 10. This is usually the time that girls start larche, or the process of developing breasts. Ask your daughter if she’s felt nickel-sized lumps under each breast called “breast buds” or noticed any pain or tenderness in her chest. discuss them with her.Be aware that each breast bud can develop at different rates, which is completely normal.;
, Girls usually start puberty between ages 8 and 13. This includes developing breast, but there are other physical and emotional signs. Recognizing these can indicate that your daughter is going through puberty and may be ready to buy her first bra.Watch for the following signs your daughter is going through puberty:Change in body shape
Development of body hair
Changing behaviors and emotions

, If you don’t notice any signs of breast development or your daughter is shy with you, schedule an appointment with her doctor. Let the doctor know in advance why you’re visiting. Allow your doctor to see the doctor by herself and have the doctor discuss her development with you either by phone or in a separate meeting. This can inform you if your daughter needs a bra or other support while giving her some independence with her body., Approach your daughter gently at a time when just the two of you are together. Broach the subject of getting a bra with your daughter by asking questions not directed at her. This can let you know whether or not your daughter is comfortable with the idea of getting her first bra.For example, “Emmeline, I noticed that Liv was wearing a sports bra at practice the other day. Is that something you’re interested in?” Your daughter’s answer can clue you in to if she’s ready for a bra.

, Let your daughter know you are always around if she has questions about her changing body. Be honest about issues of breast health and whether it’s necessary to wear a bra. Being open to discussion about breast development with your daughter can make it easier to buy her first bra., Notice if your daughter’s friends are wearing bras. Peer pressure can cause many girls may wear bras, which can range from sports bras to padded confections, before they develop.

It can be pretty traumatizing for a young girl to not wear a bra when others do.Keep in mind that your daughter may be changing for gym class or going to sleepovers and may not want to be different than her friends.

, After you’ve discussed the pros and cons of getting a bra, let you daughter know it’s her choice of whether to get a bra or not. Tell her you’ll support her in any decision she makes and even help her find a suitable bra she likes. Giving your daughter the decision can give her a measure of control over her ever changing body.For example, “Hey Josephine, the decision is up to you. We can make a fun day of it and get you your first bra. But if you want to wait, that’s totally ok, too. Just let me know whenever you’re ready.”

, Avoid telling your entire family that you’re going to shop for a bra with your daughter. Although this may be a happy time for her, she may feel embarrassed if other people know she’s developing. It also demonstrates that she can trust you if she has questions about her body.

The flexibility of the measuring tape will allow you to measure the circumference of your bust. You can go to your local pharmacy, like Walgreens or CVS, or a fabric store to find a measuring tape. You can also try visiting a Target or a Walmart; both stores have sewing sections.;
, Measure across the bottom of your band, directly under the bust and across your ribcage, by bringing the measuring tape around your back to the front. Make sure the measuring tape is level and close to your body. Round to the nearest whole number. If your measurement is an even number, add four inches. If it is odd, then add five inches. The band size is the sum of this calculation. For example, if you measured 32 inches (81.3 cm), then your band size is 36. If you measured 29 inches (73.7 cm), then your band size is 34., Wrap the measuring tape loosely around the fullest part of your chest, i.e., nipple level. Round to the nearest whole number. , Subtract your band size (the first measurement) from your cup size (the second measurement). The difference determines your bra size, where each inch represents a cup size. For example, if your band measurement is 34 and your cup measurement is 36, the difference is 2. Therefore your cup size is a B cup. As a whole, your bra size would be 34B, where 34 refers to the size of your band. , If you do not want to or do not have the time to calculate your own bra size, most lingerie stores can calculate it for you.


Visit a lingerie store, like Victoria’s Secret, at your nearest mall, outlet, or shopping center. They can professionally measure your bra size for you.

, Aim for quality when selecting your bra. You want a bra that will support your bust and make you feel comfortable. Features that provide support and stability are:


Silicone lining: look for silicone beading that follows the contour of the cups. Silicone lining is “self-adhesive” and will help the bra stick to your body. Elastic bands: in non-corset style bras, the wide band of elastic that runs under the bust is the main source of support. If you have a big bust, get a bra with a wider band for more support. Underwire: underwire provides shape and support. A bra whose underwire pokes into the breast is too small, while a bra whose underwire pokes into the armpit is too big. Boning: boning provides a lot of support and is a great choice for full-figured women. A high quality bustier or corset will have steel-wire boning as opposed to plastic or PVC. , If you are an A cup size, or an A cup pushing a B cup size, try this version of strapless bras. It is the only strapless bra without cups., If you would like to accentuate the fullness of your breasts with strapless tops or dresses, look into this type of bra. If your top or dress has a low neckline, try getting the strapless plunge bra. It is similar to the push-up bra except that it is especially designed for tops and dresses with a low neckline. , If your top or dress has a low back, consider getting a backless, strapless bra. These bras are similar to corsets in that the strap that goes around the back is more at your waistline. , If you are a full-figured woman with a size C, D, or DD cup, look into getting this type of strapless bra. The corset feature of the bustier provides shape and support from the bust to the waist. By conforming to the shape of the body, the bustier prevents the bra from slipping down the waist.The larger your chest is, the wider you want your band to be for additional support. If the wider band still isn’t enough, try a longline style. This style will give you reinforcement from below your chest. If your cup size is larger than a DD, try checking out specialty lingerie stores—they have so many options to chose from.

, While choosing your strapless bras, choose at least one bra that is one band size smaller than your original measurement. Because a strapless bra does not have straps, you need to compensate for the lost support. You can compensate for this by having a tighter fitting bra, but it should not be so tight that it is uncomfortable. , Assess if your bra fits correctly by examining the placement of the bra on your body's frame in the mirror. Your bra should center and lift your bust where it is midway between your shoulders and elbows. There should also be one inch of definition between your breasts. Move around the fitting room and see if the bra stays in place. You don't want to buy a bra that you will be having to constantly readjust.

, You can ensure that the bra you choose fits the top or dress that you will be wearing with it by making a pattern or bringing a similar top with you.


You can make a pattern by drawing the outline of the top or dress that you will be wearing with a pencil on a tank top you have at home. When you are in the fitting room, try on the bra over the tank top with the pencil marks. If the bra goes over the boundaries made by the marks, then that bra will not work. You can also bring a top or dress that is similar to the one that you will be wearing. Try it on with the bras that you have picked out to ensure that everything is covered.

Measure your band size.,
Determine your cup size.",How to Measure Your Bra Size2," This is the easiest part of the process — your band size should be fairly stable and straightforward.









Run a tape measure all the way around your body just underneath your breasts and take a measurement in inches. Make sure the tape measure is horizontal and fairly snug. Your arms should be down. Write down this number.
If this measurement is an odd number, then you should try out bras in both the size below your measurement and the size above. For example, if you measured 31 inches (78.7cm), your band size could be 30 or 32.
If your measurement is already an even number, this is almost always your band size, but you may need a smaller or larger size depending on your body type.

, Remember, your cup size isn't an absolute measure — it's in proportion to your band size.









Bend over so that your chest is parallel to the ground. This is so that you'll be measuring all of your breast tissue — not just what protrudes outward when you're standing up.
Measure around your torso, so that the tape is over the fullest part of your breasts. Don't pull the tape too tightly — it should be tight enough that it doesn't evenly move, but not so tight that's pressing into your breast tissue. Write down the number.
Make sure your tape measure is level to the ground. It shouldn't be a few inches down your back, or you'll end up with an uneven measurement. To combat this, try to measure yourself in front of a mirror, or ask your partner or close friend to help you.
Calculate your cup size. To do this, you'll subtract your band measurement from the cup measurement you just took. The difference between the two numbers determines your cup size:

Less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) = AA
1 inch (2.5 cm) = A
2 inches (5 cm) = B
3 inches (7.5 cm) = C
4 inches (10 cm) = D
5 inches (12.5 cm) = DD
6 inches (15 cm) = DDD (E in UK sizing)
7 inches (18 cm) = DDDD/F (F in UK sizing)
8 inches (20.5 cm) = G/H (FF in UK sizing)
9 inches (23 cm) = I/J (G in UK sizing)
10 inches (25.5 cm) = J (GG in UK sizing)
The majority of leading brands use UK cup sizing: AA, A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, FF, G, GG, H, HH, J, JJ, K, KK, L, LL. If you're shopping in the US you might see cup sizes such as DDD or DDDD. These are equivalent to E and F. If you're in any doubt, particularly with larger cup sizes, you can refer to an international bra sizing chart."

Try on a bra with the band and cup size you've arrived at in these steps.,
Put on the bra on correctly.,
Check the band size.,
Check the cup size.,
See how it looks with your top on.",How to Measure Your Bra Size3," You should not regard this as your definitive size until you have tried on a few bras, and even then you will often find you need a different size in different brands or styles of bra.








, Known as the ""scoop and swoop,"" this is a more correct way to make sure all of your breast tissue is in the bra:









After taking the bra off its hanger the shoulder straps will need to be lengthened. Put your arms through them and lean forward slightly so that your bust falls into the cups.
Fasten the bra on the largest set of hooks and eyes. Don't worry if it's tricky to fasten, if you're trying a smaller back size you will notice that you need to stretch it around you to make the hooks and eyes meet.
Still leaning forward, take hold of the underwires and give them a wiggle from side to side to make sure you're settled comfortably into the cups.
For each side in turn, slip your hand into the side of the cup and lift each breast towards the centre.
You will probably have to adjust the length of the shoulder straps. Slip them off your shoulders and adjust the sliders so that the straps are short enough to stay in place but don't cut in.

, The correct band size is the smallest you can comfortably wear. (This might be smaller than your underbust measurement-bra bands are quite stretchy, especially at 42+.)It needs to be firm enough that the bra is still fairly supportive without weighing down heavily on the shoulder straps.









You should be able to run your fingers around the inside of the band, but not much more. A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to fit no more than a fist under the back of the bra where your spine is at.
It should fit on the biggest adjustment, but will probably be too tight if you try to fasten it on the smallest size. Bras are designed to fit like this so that you can tighten the band as the elastic starts to wear out.
If the band is roomy enough for you to be able to comfortably fasten it on the tightest adjustment, try a smaller band, for example if a 32D is too loose, try a 30DD. Remember that the cup size has to be changed when you move to a different band size - for every band you go down, you must go up by one cup size in order for the cups to remain the same capacity and vice versa.
If you find the band painfully tight you should try going up a cup size because too small of cups can make a band which is too big or the right size seem ill fitting. If going up a size, maybe even several does not work, then try going a band up and a cup down, e.g. 28G to 30FF. However, try the first method before the latter.

, The correct cup size should be completely filled out with no wrinkling of the fabric or space in the cups, but any spillage or ""double boob"" means the cup size is too small, even in low cut or pushup bras.









Check around the cups for any bulging, not only at the front but also at the sides under your arms.
Make sure the underwire encloses your whole breast and lies flat against your rib cage.
Check at the sides under your arms to make sure the underwires are sitting on your ribs, not on soft breast tissue. If they're cutting into the sides of your breasts then you need a larger cup size. Also be aware that if you have been wearing a bra with a too big band and too small cups, you may have ended up with migrated tissue, which will seem to be armpit rolls, or back rolls. This can be fixed after getting a well fitting bra.
If the underwires are pressing painfully against your breastbone at the centre front you may need a smaller cup size or you could try a plunge style with a lower centre front (this is more likely to be an issue with the cups than the band.) Or you might just be human, and it's the shaping of your ribcage. In that case, wait for the bra to be ""broken in"" and see how it fits then, or go with the lower centre front.
If you think the cups might be too small but you're not sure, try on a bigger cup size as well to double check. It will usually be obvious if the smaller size fits better.

, You've found a new bra that fits well, maybe in a different size or style to the ones you're used to. Now it's time to see what it does for your figure! If you're trying a t-shirt bra it's also important to make sure it gives you a smooth line under fitted clothes.









If you look side on to the mirror, you should be able to see that your bust is approximately halfway between your elbow and your shoulder.
In a well fitting bra, your bustline will be supported at the right level. A lot of people find that their clothes fit a lot better, and they discover a waist that could never be seen before! If your bustline had previously been quite low because of a poorly supporting bra, you may even find that you need to wear a smaller dress size.
A fitted t-shirt will show up any bulges from cups which are too small, and likewise a moulded bra that is not filled out will show lines at the bust where the edge of the cups are visible. It's also useful to make sure that the colour of your bra is not showing through a thin or light coloured top - if you need to make your bra invisible, go for seamless cups which match your own skin colour rather than the colour of your top.
It is a common concern that wearing a smaller band size will make a big bulge around your back. However, these bulges are actually caused by the back of the bra riding up when it is too large. You should find that when the band sits lower at the back, it fits firmly and remains horizontal, rather than pushing upwards creating a bulge.

Measure your band size.,
Measure your cup size.",How to Measure Your Bra Size4," Wrap a tape measure around your ribcage, just beneath where your breast tissue ends. Then:









If the measurement is even: Add 4 inches (10 centimeters).
If the measurement is odd: Add 5 inches (12.5 centimeters).
Be aware that most brands no longer use this band measurement system. The ""add four"" method was popularized by Warners in the 1930s when bra design was in its infancy and it simply doesn't work with modern bras.Still, it's good to be aware that it's out there.

, Stay standing up, and wrap the tape measure around the fullest part of your breasts. (Keep the tape as horizontal as possible — make sure that it's not sagging around your back.) Subtract your band size from this new number to calculate your cup size:









Less than 1 inch = AA
1 inch (2.5 cm) = A
2 inches (5 cm) = B
3 inches (7.5 cm) = C
4 inches (10 cm) = D
5 inches (12.5 cm) = DD
6 inches (15 cm) = DDD (E in UK sizing)
7 inches (18 cm) = DDDD/F (F in UK sizing)
8 inches (20.5) = G/H (FF in UK sizing)
9 inches (23 cm) = I/J (G in UK sizing)
10 inches (25.5 cm) = J (GG in UK sizing)

Some slide adjusters can run the full length of the strap, while others can only run about halfway.On a new bra, you will probably find the strap adjustor all the way at the back of the bra strap, near the bra band (the part that hooks across your back).
Some bras, like most sports bras, are made from a single piece of fabric, and therefore do not have adjustable straps. If your straps are too loose or too tight on a bra like this, then there is an issue with the overall fit and you need a new bra.
It is usually easier to adjust the strap if you are not wearing the bra. The adjustor will normally lie against your back, which makes it hard to reach unless you remove your bra.;
, As the strap slides through the adjuster, the adjuster will move closer to the bra band. The closer the adjuster is to the band, the shorter and tighter the strap becomes.If you are trying on a new bra and you have to adjust the straps to the tightest position, it's not the bra for you. Your straps will stretch over time, so you need to have some room to tighten them later.Try a bra with a smaller band size.

, The slide adjuster should move closer to the bra cup. The closer the adjuster is to the cup, the shorter and tighter the bra strap will become., This is completely normal and nothing to be self-conscious about.

, If your straps are fitted properly, they will lie flat and smooth against your chestand they will hold the cups against your breasts.Always re-adjust your bra after you wash it, as the process may cause the slide adjusters to move.If the straps are as tight or as loose as they can be and you are still having issues (the strap is falling off your shoulder, the straps are cutting into your skin), read the following sections to learn possible causes and how you can solve them.

, Some women are born with narrow or sloping shoulders and some develop them later in life. This can make it difficult to keep your bra strap from falling off your shoulder, even if your bra is the correct size. If this is the case, you may need to try a different style bra.Look for bras with straps that are closer to the middle of the back, such a leotard backs, racerback, or straps that criss-cross over your back.Avoid bras with ""camisole backs,"" which come straight down and attach to the bra band at a right angle.Try a halter bra, which loops around your neck and attaches just at the front of your bra.Make sure the front of your bra straps attach to the cup right above the apex of your breast, or your nipple.A bra with convertible straps will allow you to try different styles (racerback, criss-cross, halter) so you can adjust for a comfortable fit or for different outfits.You can buy a clip that attaches to the straps of your bra, pulling them together into a racerback style and keeps them in place on your shoulders., Over time, your bra straps will lose elasticity and become looser and looser, causing you to tighten them. If they lose too much of their elasticity, you may not be able to make them tight enough to stay on your shoulders.Slide your finger under your strap and pull up. If it easily stretches to your ear, it's too loose and needs to be replaced.If you take good care of your bra (don't wear the same one every single day, hand wash and air-dry them, and put them on properly), they should last about 6-9 months, if not longer., The band should be snug against your back and parallel to the ground. Your breasts should fill the cups without pinching (giving you the appearance of having four boobs), and the cups should lay flat against your breasts.If your bra doesn't fit the above criteria, try a smaller band or cup size. You can measure yourself at home or be professionally fitted for a bra that fits properly., Petite women may find their straps are always too long, no matter how much they tighten them. A tailor or lingerie shop may do this for you, or you can do it at home by removing an inch or two from the strap and re-sewing it., Your bra straps should be doing minimal work to hold up your breasts--a properly fit bra band should provide almost total support. If the band is too loose, you may be tightening your straps to pick up the slack, causing them to gouge into your shoulders.Your bra band should be snug, but no so tight that you can't slide a finger between the fabric and your skin at the front of your bra.The band should be parallel to the floor and sit no higher than the bottom of your shoulder blades.If you measure your bust and find your bra band is the right size but still too loose, then it's simply too old and needs to be replaced., If your cup size is too large, you may be tightening your straps too much to keep the cups from looking pointy or to pull the them flat against your chest.If your cup size is too small, the straps may not be long enough to accommodate your breasts and be pulled tight, gouging your shoulders.
A bra in the correct size will have cups that lie smooth and flat against your chest, without pinching or causing your breasts to overflow from the sides or top.If the center panel of the bra (the part between the cups) doesn't lie flat against your breastbone, your cups may be too small, forcing you to tighten your straps to a painful degree., Many full-support bras come with wider straps, which distribute weight better than thin straps and provide more comfort.Even with a properly fitted bra, thin straps can sometimes still be painful for women with larger breasts. Try to avoid them when possible., If your bra fits properly but the straps are still causing you discomfort, invest in cushioning designed specifically for bra straps.They fit under or around your straps and should mold against your skin so they are not obvious under your clothes.


Some bra straps, especially wider straps, come with build-in cushioning for added comfort."

Fill a sink with warm water and add some mild detergent.,
Mix the detergent into the water.,
Add the bras in.,
Let the bras sit in the soapy water for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Swish and squish the bras.,
Drain the dirty water and rinse the bras with clean water.,
Repeat the soapy water bath and rinsing for very dirty bras.,
Press the bras between two towels to remove any moisture.,
Reshape the cups and let the bra air dry.",How to Wash a Bra1," Unless you are washing a great number of hand-wash items, you will only need between 1 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon of detergent.If you do not have a sink, you can use a bucket instead. Be sure that you are using an alcohol-free detergent intended for hand washing garments.If you do not have any mild detergents at home, you can easily make one of your own:Combine 1 cup (240 milliliters) of hot water, 1 teaspoon of baby shampoo, and 1 to 2 drops essential oil (such as lavender or chamomile). Fill a sink or bucket with lukewarm water, then add your homemade detergent.
Dilute some liquid castile soap with water, and add it to a sink or bucket filled with warm water.;
, Do this by swishing your hand around in the water. Keep doing this until you get some bubbles and foam. Do not get concerned if there is not a lot of foam; too many suds will not only not clean better, but wastes detergent, and makes rinsing a longer process.

, Try to wash similar colors together, especially cotton bras, as dark colors can discolor light colors. Bras made of synthetic materials can typically be washed together without fear of ""bleeding"".








, This allows the detergent to dissolve any oils or dirt. For particularly dirty bras, leave them in the water for one hour.

, This helps loosen and dirt and oils. The water will be pretty murky by now.







, Do this until the water runs clear. Consider rinsing them in the bathtub, which will give you more space.








, If your bras have not been washed in a while, you may need to give them another soak in fresh, soapy water; do not use the old, dirty water again. Be sure to rinse the bras well, until there is no soap left.







, Lay the bra down on a towel, and cover it with another towel. Press down on the bra and towel. Do not squeeze or wring the bra.







, You can either hang the bra up or you can lay it down on a clean, dry towel. If you choose to hang the bra to dry, do not hang it by the straps, as this will cause them to stretch. Instead, drape the bra by the middle over a clothesline or a drying rack. You can also clip the band of the bra to a hanger.

Close the claps and hooks.,
Put the bra in a mesh lingerie bag.,
Put the bra into the washing machine with similar colors.If you are washing your bra at the same time as the rest of the laundry, make sure that you are not mixing colors.,
Consider putting the bra in with fabrics with other lightweight items.,
Wash the bra using a mild detergent and a gentle cycle.Be sure to use cold water, as hot water can weaken the fibers and cause the straps to become less stretchy.,
Reshape the bra cups once the cycle is done, if needed.Take the bra out of the mesh bag, and press on the inside of the cup until it pops back out to its original shape.,
Air dry the bra.",How to Wash a Bra2," If you do not close your bra, the hooks will often catch on other items in the wash and may rip them, or the hooks may deform. Straps can sometimes tangle on other laundry items, which may put stress on them. If your bra does not have any closures (such as a sports bra), then do not worry about this.







, This will prevent the bra from getting tangled in other items. It will also protect it from rougher items, such as jeans. It can also be handy for sorting later. 







, Wash white bras with other white clothes. Be sure to wash light-colored bras (such as beige and pastels) with other light-colored clothes, and to wash dark-colored bras (such as navy and black) with other dark-colored clothes. Mixing colors can cause dyes to bleed, which results in faded and murky colors.








, Try to wash your bras with lighter-weight items, such as t-shirts, underwear, socks, and pajamas. Jeans and towels are much heavier than bras and could damage them.








, Do not use any strong detergents; strong detergents can eat away at the fibers and make the fabric weaker over time and can deteriorate the fabric.







, This is typically more needed for padded or shaping bras.


If the bra is soaking and dripping wet, do not wring or twist them; instead, put the bra between two towels, and press down on the towels to remove any excess moisture

, Avoid using a dryer, as the heat will cause the bra straps to stretch and lose their elasticity.You can air dry the bra by draping it across a drying rack or clothesline. You can also clip the band of the bra to a hanger, and hang it up to dry. Do not hang the bra by the straps; this will cause the bra straps to stretch too much. If you do not have any spare hangers, clotheslines, or drying racks, you can lay the bra out flat on a clean, dry towel.If you must use a dryer, ideally use the ""no heat"" setting. Be sure to keep the bra in its mesh bag to prevent any tangling.Putting a bra in a hot or warm dryer will not likely do immediate harm. If this does happen, there is usually no reason to panic. This is not ideal treatment, but rarely causes a bra to become unusable.

Buy a comfortable but not too expensive bra.,
Buy the supplies.,
Find a large and flat workspace to lay out your materials.,
Decorate the bra.,
Allow to dry.,
Try on your new disco ball bra.",How to Make a Disco Ball Bra," It doesn't really matter what color the bra is, but common colors such as white and black work best. When this is complete you won't see the cups, so don't worry too much about how fancy the bra looks.


Make sure the bra has full coverage and is firm. Padded bras are a good choice.
You may be wearing this bra uncovered, so make sure the bra fits well and does not ride up or slip off the shoulders.;
, You can purchase either silver sequins, mosaic mirror chips or silver glitter (a messier but still effective option). You will also need fabric glue. The sequins or glitter can be found in sewing, craft or even art stores along with the mosaic mirror chips. You can also purchase a shiny metallic fabric, but this is optional.


Sequins attached to a long thread are better than individual sequins - they're faster to attach.
If using glitter, the glitter should be in as large pieces as possible.

, Avoid using any place that will become too cluttered, as you need lots of room to move. You may want to lay out newspaper or a drop cloth under the bra to contain the mess.

, Spread the fabric glue right across the cups of the bra. Depending on what you're using, here is what to do next:


If you bought sequins, then glue them on in even rows; don't leave gaps but keep the sequins tightly packed together. Alternatively, sew each sequin onto the bra evenly by hand. If using strips of sequins, cut to size to fit each bra cup and hand sew or machine stitch in place.
If you bought the mosaic mirror chips, then just arrange them carefully on the bra and glue into place. Again, keep them closely together, without gaps.
If you bought glitter, place fabric glue over the bra, then just sprinkle it over the bra and set it out in a good place to dry.

This step is optional but effective if you're using glitter. If you bought metallic fabric as well as glitter, cut the fabric out to fit the shape of each bra cup (do a few basic measurements to make sure what you're cutting is accurate). Shape the fabric over the bra, glue in place (or stitch around if you're really patient) and wait for it to dry. Then, put fabric glue on top of the metallic fabric and sprinkle the glitter on this glue. The metallic fabric will help to bring out the sparkles of the glitter, making it appear shinier.



, Before the disco ball bra dries, hold the bra out and check its shape. If any adjustments are needed, it's much easier to do before the glue dries, so fix any gaps or mistakes now.


Check that the bra cups are fully covered with the sequins, mirror chips or glitter.

, Check it out in the mirror, then make any adjustments needed to ensure that it fits you comfortably. Once it fits well, it's time to wear it out to the next dance.

Place your sticky stabilizing paper in the hoop.,
Start embroidering.",How to Monogram Shoes1," Embroidering with a sewing machine is a great way to get the look of a professional embroidery job. To use an embroidery sewing machine to monogram your shoes, you will need:A sewing machine with a computerized embroidery setting.
A pair of shoes with a long tongue. Canvas material works best, such as a pair of Converse.
Thread. Choose a strong, smooth thread, such as cotton.You can use any color you want.
A pair of scissors.
A seam ripper.
An embroidery hoop.
Sticky stabilizing backing paper.;
, Sewing machines with computerized embroidery features usually include several different designs to choose from. Look through the designs to choose the type of monogram initials you want to embroider on your shoes. After you have selected a design, follow your machine’s instructions to select your desired initials and set your machine to the recommended tension, stitch type, etc.If your machine does not have an automatic embroidery setting, then you can also try to do freehand monogram initials. However, keep in mind that this will be much more challenging and may not look as neat as the monogram that a computerized embroidery machine will produce. Try asking around to friends and family to see if anyone you know has an embroidery machine that you could borrow for your project.

, The only part of a shoe that you can easily embroider with a sewing machine is the tongue. This is the fabric under the laces on the top center of a pair of sneakers. To monogram the tongue of your shoes, remove the laces and pull the tongue out and away from the shoe.If there is a tag on the backside of the tongue, then you will need to remove it. Use a seam ripper to cut off the tag. You can do this but ripping the seams on the edges of the tongue and then removing the entire back side of the tongue.

, Next, place a piece of sticky stabilizing backing paper into your hoop. Make sure that you place the paper so that the sticky side is up. Then, press the tongue of your shoe onto the center of the sticky stabilizing paper so that it will stay put.If you do not have sticky stabilizing paper, then you can also use regular backing paper and use the hoop to secure the tongue of the shoe as well.However, this may be difficult if the tongue is not very long, so using the sticky paper is ideal.

, When the tongue of your shoe is secured on the sticky paper, you can begin embroidering. Make sure that you follow your machine’s instructions for embroidering and monitor the sewing machine as it completes the monogram design.After the first shoe is finished, raise the needle and pull the tongue away from the paper. Trim any loose threads that you see.
Monogram your other shoe and then replace the laces in both shoes to complete the project.

Choose enough ribbon to wrap around the straps; err on more rather than less.

, Wrap the length around the straps to check that you have enough. Then unwrap in preparation for adding it permanently.

, Carefully and evenly, start to wrap the ribbon around the flip flop, dabbing a little glue behind every second or third wrap to ensure that the ribbon stays in place neatly. You have two choices––either wrap the entire way around as one length, or stop at the toe post and wrap each strap separately. Do whatever is easiest or looks best with the ribbon you're using.

, This step is optional but can complete the look. Use a large ribbon bow glued or tied in place. Use the same ribbon that you wrapped the straps with for consistency, and be sure to tie it on tightly.


Alternatively, use a costume gem, fabric flower or other embellishment in place of the bow and glue in place.
Some small shoe bows might make a handy alternative to making a ribbon bow; just make sure that it complements the ribbon used along the flip flop straps.

Collect your materials and tools.,
Decide where your monogram will be.,
Create a stencil.,
Prepare the shoe fabric that you want to embroider.,
Attach the stencil.,
Stencil your shoe.,
Heat-set your shoe.",How to Monogram Shoes2," Stenciling is a fun way to monogram shoes, but it requires several materials and a few special tools as well. Before you begin, you will need:

Computer or device with word program.
Printer.
Pen.
Regular printer paper.
Cardstock.
Exacto knife.
Scissors (optional).
Strong tape.
Fabric paint.
Spouncer (a sponge-like brush for stenciling).
Iron.
Ironing board (optional).

, Determine where you will place it on your shoe. Favor flat areas where the surface isn’t interrupted by any seams or stitched-on items like logos or stripes. Measure the dimensions of this area so you know how large or small your monogram should be.

Tongues are perhaps the most ideal to work with because they can be stretched flat over a work surface.

, First, design your monogram on your computer or device with Microsoft Word or a similar program, or sketch it by hand on cardstock. If your printer is able to print cardstock, use that for your print-out. If not, print it on regular paper and trace the design onto cardstock. Then use an exacto knife to cut the design out so the cardstock becomes a stencil.

Cardstock is thick enough to keep fabric paint from bleeding through. However, because it’s stiffer than standard paper, it doesn’t bend as well, which is why you should pick the flattest parts of your shoe to work on, ideally the tongue.

, Remove any laces so they won’t get in the away. If you’re placing your monogram on the tongue, use scissors to trim off any labels that may be on the back side, since these may prevent you from stretching it totally flat.If you’re placing it elsewhere, stuff the shoe full of paper, socks, or anything else that will firm it up.Decorative attachments, like bows, can also be removed to make more room.

, If you’re placing your monogram anywhere other than your shoe’s tongue, crop your cardstock around the stencil until it is small enough for you to tape the edges to the shoe. However, be sure there is still enough cardstock around the stencil to block your spouncer from touching the rest of the shoe. Secure your stencil to your shoe with tape around all sides. If you are stenciling the tongue instead:Trim off the top and bottom of your cardstock to shape your stencil into a wide rectangle.
Pull the tongue of your shoe free and stretch it flat over the edge of your worktable, with the rest of the shoe dangling off the side.
Center the stencil over the tongue using the monogram’s middle initial, if you included one.
Secure the stencil to the worktable with strong tape, which should pin the tongue down in place. If not, tape the tongue to the table, then the stencil over it.

, First, pour a small amount of fabric paint onto a paper plate. Dip a spouncer into the paint. Remove excess paint by dabbing the spouncer a few times on another paper plate until it’s relatively clear. Then monogram your shoe by pressing the spouncer over your stencil lightly and quickly.

It’s better to use too little paint at first and then add more. Keep your first application light and repeat a second time.
Allow the paint to dry for a couple of hours or overnight.

, After the paint has dried, remove the tape to free your shoe from the stencil. Place a thin piece of fabric over the painted area. Because it’s touching paint, use scrap material, not anything nice. Set your iron on high and then press the fabric over the paint, without using steam, for about ten seconds to heat-set the paint."

Get the necessary materials and tools.,
Situate your first patch.,
Iron the edges or center briefly.,
Attach your other patches.,
Press the patch.",How to Monogram Shoes3," Ironing on patches is one of the easiest ways to monogram, but you will still need a few special materials and tools to complete your project. You will need:

Shoes to monogram. Check the materials listed on the tags of your shoes to ensure that a patch will stick. Polyester and/or cotton work best for iron-on patches. Materials to avoid usually include rayon, nylon, tri-cetate, and waterproof materials.Iron-on patches that will fit on the part of your shoe that you want to monogram, preferably with adhesive backing. You can find patches at a local arts-and-crafts or fabric store or online. Look for iron-on patches for each initial in your name and be sure to buy two patches for each initial: one for each shoe.Iron.
Ironing board (optional).
Tape (optional).
Paper, socks, or other filler (optional).

, Start with your middle initial if you have one, which will make centering your monogram easier. Peel off the backing to the patch’s adhesive side. Center your middle initial in the middle of the target area on your shoe and stick it in place.If you don’t have a middle initial, line up the rightmost edge of your first initial with the middle of your target area, or the leftmost edge of your last initial.
When you stick the patch on, insert one or more fingers into the shoe behind the patch so it has a strong backing when you press it on. This helps ensure that the adhesive is firmly attached.

, To ensure that your patch doesn’t move out of place (especially if it only has a cloth backing), give it a quick heat-seal treatment with your iron. Set the iron to high heat. Then use the iron’s tip to press either the patch’s edges or center for a second or two, without using steam. Only use the iron’s tip so you have room to hold the patch in place with your fingertip as you press.Since your iron will be directly touching your patch and shoe, keep the contact brief so you don’t scorch either one.
If you’re monogramming the tongue, remove the shoe’s laces and free the tongue from the shoe. Then stretch the tongue flat over an ironing board and tape the edges down to keep it in place.
If you’re monogramming anywhere else, stuff the shoe with paper, socks, or whatever else to keep it firm as you apply light pressure.

, Repeat the process with each remaining initial for your monogram. Situate each one where it should go. Then secure it to the shoe with a quick press from your iron before moving on to the next.You can then either do the same for your other shoe or finish ironing your first one before moving on to the second.

, Place a sheet of fabric (or a handy piece of cloth like a towel or pillowcase) over your patches to protect them and your shoe from prolonged contact. Finish heat-sealing the patch to the shoe by pressing it through the fabric without using steam. Refer to the patch’s instructions for exactly how long you should press since times may vary, but expect it be around 30 to 45 seconds.If you’re monogramming the tongue, flip it over when you’re done and do the same to the back side.
Pressing both sides helps create a stronger seal. Unfortunately, the design of your shoe probably won’t allow you to do this anywhere else.
Pressing (pushing straight down) works better than swiping the iron back and forth.

Decide on the color and position.,
Make a single stitch.,
Fill in your stitch with a back stitch.,
Make another stitch.,
Continue the pattern until you spell your name.",How to Personalize Slippers1," If you want to add your name to a slipper, this can be a nice personalized touch. However, before adding your name, stop and consider where you want to add your name and the color thread you will use.


Choose a color that you like and goes well with the current color of your slippers. If you have yellow slippers, for example, they may look great with blue lettering.
Decide where you want to stitch your name. The main body of the slipper is probably the best place to start, as this is where you will have the most space.
You can try lighting writing your name with a fabric pen or pencil first so you have a line to follow when you sew.;
, A simple back stitch can be used to add your name to a pair of slippers.To make a back stitch, start by making one simple stitch.Insert your needle through the underside of your slipper and then pull it upward.
Move the needle forward slightly and then pass it back down through the slipper. A small space away from the first stitch, poke the needle back to the top of the slipper.
This should leave you with a single stitch. You will make a series of stitches to write out your name on your slipper.

, From here, you want to back stitch to form a solid line. To do this, poke your needle back through the top of the slipper. Insert the needle where the first stitch ends and then push it through to the back side of the slipper. This should create one long line., Place the needle a small space away from the line you formed. Pull the needle back up to the top of the slipper. Then, stitch back again by feeding the needle through the top of the slipper where your line ends.When you're done, an even longer line should be formed with your thread.

, Continue this pattern of backstitching, moving your thread until it forms your name. When you're done, tie a tight knot with the thread to prevent it from coming undone. Cut away excess thread with a pair of scissors.If you don't have the space to write your entire name in thread, you can just write you initials.

Glue on felt decorations.,
Sew on buttons.,
Add designs with fabric paint.,
Try miscellaneous decorations.",How to Personalize Slippers2," A simple way to add your own unique decorations to slippers is with felt. Buy some felt and fabric glue from a local craft store. Choose colors or patterns of thread you like and that reflect your personality.Cut your thread into whatever shapes you want. You can use flowers, hearts, zig-zags, or anything else that's personally meaningful to you.
When you're done, use the fabric glue to glue your designs on your slippers.

, Buttons can be a cute addition to slippers and can give them a personal touch. If you want to add a splash of decoration, choose a variety of cute buttons to sew on your slippers.Look for cute buttons at craft stores, flea markets, and thrift stores. You can also remove buttons you like from old clothing you no longer wear.
It's simple to sew buttons on to fabric. You can use a needle and thread to sew a loop of thread around the center of a button. Loop the thread around the slots near the center of the button a few times to secure it in place before tying your thread tightly and cutting off the needle.

, You can purchase fabric paint at a local craft store. This is a great way to spruce up plain slippers with a dull design or color. You can use a paintbrush or sponge brush to dab colors onto an otherwise dull pair of slippers.You can paint your slippers however you like. You can add designs, shapes, colors, or symbols that are personally meaningful to you.
If you're not into sewing, you can write your name on your slippers using paint instead of sewing it on.

, If you're stumped on what to do, stop by a local craft store and see what inspires you. With a little fabric glue or sewing supplies, you can attack a variety of items to slippers to make them more personal. Some ideas include:


Pom-poms
Pipe cleaner
Ribbons
Jewels
Beads
Rhinestones

Choose a material that works for you.,
Think about how you'll clean slippers before decorating them.,
Consider how and when you will wear your slippers.",How to Personalize Slippers3," When selecting a slipper, select the right material. If you intend to personalize your slippers, you want a material that will hold up over time. You do not want to personalize slippers only to have them wear down fast.If you don't have your heart set on fuzzy slippers, rubber slippers are resistant to damage and hold up over time.
Softer materials that tend to hold up include wool, cotton, animal skins, and polyester.

, If you intend to decorate the slippers, think about cleaning them. Will your designs hold up in the wash? Cotton slippers can usually be washed in the washing machine, for example, but if you've added embellishments like buttons or paints, these can be harmed during the washing process.If you intend to personalize slippers, opt for a kind you can easily, safely hand wash or spot clean. You should also check the materials you're using to design your slippers to see if they hold up after being exposed to detergent or water.
Rubber slippers, while not soft, may be a good option for personalized slippers as you can wipe them clean when they get dirty or damaged.

, If you just intend to wear your slippers around the house, you can get by with most softer fabrics. Things like wool and cotton are fine for indoor use. However, if you need slippers for outdoor use, consider water resistant materials like rubber.Some cotton or wool slippers have rubber undersides. These may work if you want to occasionally step outside wearing your slippers.

Before you draw on your shoes, practice on a piece of paper. That way, you'll be ready for the final design.
Vary your lines. Create squiggles, dotted lines, or swirls. The bolder your lines, the better.;
, Decide whether you want thick or thin ones and how big you want them to be. Patterns look best if each dot or line is the same size. Practice drawing dots on your paper. When you're ready, start drawing dots or lines on your shoe.

, For your first project, start simple, then try more intricate designs once you've got the hang of painting. Nature themes look beautiful on fabric shoes. Draw trees, flowers, and your favorite animals. Or, if you're a fan of a certain book, movie, or tv series, try drawing the characters on your shoes. Cartoon characters work best because of their flat and simple design.



Splatter paint can give your shoes a wild design.

, If you can draw something on a flat design, you can draw it on a shoe.Use paper as your practice board and draw your design several different ways. Continue experimenting until you are completely satisfied with your drawing.


Do not draw on your shoes until you have finished your design. Practicing your sketches can feel boring, but you will avoid more long-term mistakes if you plan beforehand.

, Color in your design sketches and experiment with what colors look good together. Avoid creating color patterns that clash or do not look aesthetically pleasing together.


When you've chosen your colors, create a final sketch design and color it in. Your last sketch will be your blueprint as you paint your shoes.
To make colors pop, place complementary colors next to each other. This will make both colors seem brighter in comparison., First, sketch your design in pencil so you can erase if needed. Then, trace over your design using a fine-tipped fabric pen or marker. You will appreciate a bold, clear outline when painting to avoid any mistakes.If you are not confident in your artistic abilities, use a stencil. Stencils are often available at craft stores. You can also create your own stencil, if desired., If any of your design areas are white, trace them on the painter's tape, cut out the design, and place the tape on the shoe.

, You'll want an open space to paint in to avoid inhaling fumes. If you can find a flat surface outside, paint your shoes there. If not, find a room with open windows.


Because most acrylics are water-based, their fumes are usually non-toxic.If you start to feel overwhelmed by the smell, take a break.

, Cover an area wide enough for you to move around and paint without feeling cramped. Tape the papers down with masking or painter's tape.


If you are especially concerned about stains, apply two layers of the paper.
Avoid painting in a carpeted room, as you will be unable to tape down the paper lining.

, If your shoe has laces, remove them temporarily until you have finished decorating them. Laces do not respond well to color, and any paint you apply will flake off.If your shoes are made of soft fabric, stuff them with paper so they keep their shape while you are painting. You risk messing up on your design if your shoes' shape changes easily.

, Stained soles can flake and become uncomfortable to wear. You can also use masking tape as an alternative.

, If you need to mix colors, mix a small amount on paper to test the color ratios. When you've created the right color, mix larger amounts in your palette.Prepare all your colors first so you can work quickly.


Alternatively, use fabric paint pens, which are less messy and often easier to use.

, Without acrylic primer, your design will will begin flaking.Primer takes anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour to dry, so plan accordingly.


You will want a thin coat that doesn't cover the shoe's texture. One coating is more than sufficient.

, While you may be tempted to rush, a slow and steady hand will give you cleaner results. If you forget what color you wanted a certain area, consult your final design paper.


Use a variety of paintbrushes in different sizes. If you're adding delicate lines, use a slimmer paintbrush. Use a thicker paintbrush or a sponge for painting broad areas.For polka dots, dip the end of a cotton bud directly into the paint and press in place on the shoe.

, Allow each shoe to dry thoroughly before finishing. If you want to finish your project sooner, place your shoes in a sunny area and leave them until completely dry.The drying time for acrylics varies depending on brand.Consult the label for exact times.
Avoid touching your shoes until dry. Touching them too early can create finger smudges and mess up your design.

, If you bought glitter, beads, or ribbons, glue them on. Try not to add too many decorations. Too much may distract from your shoes' new design.

, To ensure that the design stays intact and is durable, apply a fabric sealant. Mod Podge Outdoorand Scotchgard work well for fabric shoes, but other brands are available.


Sealant is technically optional but highly recommended. The paint will wear off quickly if it is not protected from the elements and begin to crack.

, If you want a funky or creative look, use a colorful ribbon or a patterned cord instead. Tie them as you would regular laces. Just be sure to choose a ribbon that is durable and will not break over time.


For a cute flair, thread beads onto your shoelaces or ribbons. Avoid adding too many and weighing down your shoes: three or four beads per lace is enough.

Make a second loop with the free lace and feed it through the ""hole."",
Wrap the new loop around the lace and back through the hole.,
Pull the loops to tighten.,
Undo the knot by pulling on the lace ends.",How to Tie Your Shoe Laces Differently1," If you've noticed that your shoelaces seem to come untied frequently, try this knot, which is based off of the super-secure knot that doctors use to tie sutures after surgery (the knot is also popular with fishermen.)To start, make the same sort of basic ""right over left"" knot that you'd begin with when tying your shoes normally.To do this, simply take your right lace and cross it over the left lace. Wrap it around the left lace once and pull tight. You're done!;
, After this, make a small ""looped"" section by doubling one of the laces back on itself. You're not doing any tying or wrapping here — just re-positioning one string so that it makes a U shape.

, Next, take the lace that you didn't make a loop with and pull it so it crosses behind the loop. Then, pull it back around in front of the loop. This should make a small ""hole"" between the two laces and the initial ""right over left"" knot at the bottom.

, Take the slack end of the free lace in your hand and make a second loop by doubling it up on itself in a U shape (just like you did with the other lace.) Push this second loop through the ""hole"" that was formed in the previous step.


Resist the urge to pull the knot tight at this point — if you do, you'll just be left with an ordinary shoelace knot.

, Now, take the second loop that you just pushed through the hole and wrap it all the way around the first loop. Push it back through the hole one again. ""Double-wrapping"" the loop this way is what makes the surgeon's knot so secure — the friction that's generated when the tightly-wrapped laces rub against each makes it very hard for this knot to come undone.

, Now, you can simply pull the loops in opposite directions to tighten the knot. The results will look a little like a standard shoelace knot, but should be much more secure.


If you really don't want your laces to come undone, try soaking the knot in water before pulling it tight. As the water evaporates, the fabric of the laces will constrict, making the knot even tighter., Though this knot shouldn't come undone accidentally, it's not hard to undo when you want to take off your shoes. Simply pull on the loose ends of the laces like you would with an ordinary shoe knot and the surgeon's knot should come apart easily.

Select a boot lace.,
Start lacing the boot.,
Cross one end of the lace diagonally over the tongue.,
Continue lacing.,
Lace all the way up to the top.",How to Lace Boots1," Most likely you have a pair of boots that go at least as high as your ankles. Make sure that you get boot laces that are long enough for your pair of boots.


Ask a sales clerk for advice or read the packaging to determine the right boot lace length.
If you are getting new laces, measure the laces that came with your boots.
You can determine the length you will need by the amount of hole pairs in your boots. 5 or 6 holes requires 36 inches; 6 or 7 holes requires 40-45 inches; 8 holes requires 54 inches; 9 holes requires 63 inches; 10 or 11 holes requires 72 inches.;
, The standard way for lacing your boots is to lace up your boot in a criss-cross fashion. Starting at the bottom, string the laces through each of the bottom eyelets. Pull the laces up vertically as far as possible and ensure both tips are even.Your laces should now be on the outside of your eyelets.
For a standard criss-cross lacing method, string your laces through the eyelets, not over the top.

, Insert the lace into the second eyelet from the bottom. feed the lace through the eyelet and over.


Once you have strung one lace through the next eyelet, repeat with the other.
Your laces should now be on the outside of your boot.

, Make sure to always insert one side before the other to keep the pattern uniform until the top of the boot is reached.


If you crossed from left to right for the first eyelet, keep this pattern consistent.
If you want your boots to have a symmetrical look, do the opposite for the other boot. If you starting by crossing left over right on one boot, go right over left on the other.
Staying consistent not only gives your boots a nice, clean look, but it makes tightening the laces easier.

, If you want a bit more room and extra length in the laces, you can leave the last pair of eyelets empty. At the top, either tie the laces in a bow, or tie off the ends and tuck in.


Depending on how much extra lace you have, you can also wrap your laces around your boots before tying your knot.

Make a basic ""right over left"" starting knot.,
Make a loop with one lace.,
Coil the free lace around the loop.,
Feed the lace through the gap at the bottom.,
Undo the knot by pulling on the loop.",How to Tie Your Shoe Laces Differently2," This odd shoelace knot looks a little like a tiny noose, making it great for adding some creepy flavor to your outfit for Halloween and other spooky occasions. To start, all you need to do is make a very basic starting knot (the same kind you'd start with when tying your shoes normally.)As a reminder, to make this basic knot, take your right lace and cross it over the left lace. Wrap it under the left lace once and pull tight. Note that this part is exactly the same step as in the section above.

, Next, take the right lace and double about an inch or two of the lace back on itself to make a ""loop"" or U-shaped section. Just like in a real noose, this loop will eventually become the ""neck hole.""


Once you make the loop, take the loop and the other lace in your hand and hold both so that they are pointing upward. This isn't essential, but it ensures that all of your laces are positioned correctly for the next step and keeps things a little tidier as you start to make the noose.

, Starting at about the middle point of the loop, start wrapping the free section of lace around both parts of the loop and the other lace. In other words, you should be wrapping the lace around a ""bundle"" of three laces : both sides of the loop and the free lace. Work your way down towards the bottom of the loop, coiling tightly as you go.


There's no exact number of coils you need to make this way — longer laces will be able to make more coils than shorter ones, but as long as you are able to make about four or five, your knot should hold.

, When you've coiled the free lace all the way to the bottom of the loop, take whatever slack is left and pass it through the small hole between the initial ""right over left"" knot and the lace that you've been using to coil. This hole should be near the bottom of the coil you just made, but slightly off to the side. When you've done this, pull the lace gently to tighten.


If your lace isn't long enough to reach the bottom of the loop, try starting over and making the initial loop smaller.

, When you're ready to untie this mini noose knot, slip your finger into the loop and pull up. The ""loose"" side of the noose should pull through the coil easily and the entire knot should fall apart.


On the other hand, pulling the ""tight"" side of the noose should cause the coil to tighten. You may want to give this side a tug after you put on your shoes to keep your knot tight during your daily activity.

",How to Tie Your Shoe Laces Differently3," This unconventional knot can be done entirely with one hand, making it a great choice for when you need to tie your shoes while doing something else.However, this knot requires you to lace your shoes in a special way. This initial lacing is tricky, but not impossible with one hand. Start by tying the lace to one of the top eyelets — the little holes on either side of the tongue that the laces go through.

, If your shoe isn't already unlaced, pull the lace out until it's completely free (except for the eyelet it's tied to.) Next, re-lace the shoe in a zig-zagging pattern as follows:


Thread the lace through the eyelet at the top that's directly across from it. in other words, if you started at the top left eyelet, thread the lace into the top right one.
Pull the lace under and through the eyelet directly beneath the previous one. It should go under the material between the two eyelets, not over it.
Thread the lace through the eyelet directly across from it again.
Continue this ""down, across, down, across"" pattern until you reach the last eyelet at the bottom. If there are an even number of eyelets (which there usually are), the lace should end at the side opposite the starting point. If there are an odd number, it will end at the same side.

, Take the loose end of the lace and bring it back across the tongue of the shoe. Thread it through this eyelet — this may be tricky if you have thick laces, but it should be possible.

, Use the thumb and index finger of your shoe-tying hand to make a loop that's an inch or so long with the loose end of the lace. If you're using one hand, you can do this by holding the loose part in your palm, then slipping your thumb under it and pushing out.


When you have a loop, hold it so that it lays across the lowest straight section of lace at its middle point. The loop should be pointing across the tongue of the shoe.

, This is the only tricky part of the whole knot. Take one side of the loop that's laying across the lowest straight lace section and pull it under the straight lace and over the other side of the loop. This essentially creates a second loop that should be pointing up or down the tongue of the shoe.


If you're working with one hand, the easiest way to do this is to grab the initial loop between your thumb and index finger, then use your index finger to push one side of the loop as you guide it under the straight lace and over the other side of the loop.

, At this point, you can tighten the knot by pulling on the second loop that you've just created. As you do so, be careful not to pull the loose end of the lace all the way through the knot you've just created or it will come apart.


Continue pulling the loop down and across to slide it back towards the eyelet — when the knot is tight, it should be touching (or else lie very close to) the eyelet.

, This one-handed knot is surprisingly tight and should stay fastened through daily activity. When you're ready to take your shoe off, simply pull the free end of the lace and the knot should come apart with ease.


A word of warning: as you loosen the laces before you take your shoe off, try not to let the loose end of the lace get pulled back through the eyelet. It can be tricky and time-consuming to work the lace back through the eyelet when you re-tie your shoes, especially if you're using one hand.

If you have an even number of eyelet pairs, you will start by threading the lace through the bottom eyelets from the inside and pulling the laces out.
If you have an odd number of eyelet pairs, you will begin by threading the lace straight across the bottom eyelets from the outside in.

, Start with one end of your laces and run it diagonally through the inside of the next eyelet. For the second pair of eyelets closest to the bottom, you will lace the same way you did for the criss-cross lacing. Repeat with the other end of your laces.


Be sure that your diagonal lace runs under your horizontal lace at the bottom, not on top of it.
your laces should now have one criss-cross and be on the outside of your boot.

, On each side of your boot, you will now take the lace and run it directly through the eyelet directly above. Do this for both laces.


Run your laces through the next eyelet by going outside in.
You will now have one horizontal portion of your laces at the bottom eyelet, one criss-cross above it, and two eyelets with your laces running vertically through both.
Your laces should be on the inside of your boot now.

, Alternate threading your laces diagonally and the over the top vertically.


Keep the order in which you thread your laces consistent. If you always go right over left, do that for every diagonal lace, and vice-versa if you start left over right.

, You will end up with your laces on the inside of your boot. Here you can tie a bow like normal, or tuck the laces inside your boots if you want a cleaner look.


If you have enough length, you can also wrap your laces around your boot and tie a knot in the front, tucking it behind the tongue.

The Ladder method is also sometimes known as straight across lacing, and is popular among US paratroopers for the security of firm lacing.This method works best on higher boots with a lot of eyelets.

, Start the laces the same way as for diagonal laces, running the laces underneath the bottom eyelet.


Your laces should now be on the outside of your boots.

, Now, instead of running your laces diagonally, run each end vertically through the next eyelet up. This time going from outside to in.


Your laces should now be on the inside of your boots.

, Run your lace under the section of lace that is connecting two eyelets vertically.You’re not threading your lace through an eyelet for this step as you are running the lace horizontally, not diagonally.
Instead of threading your lace through an eyelet, thread it through the section of vertical lace on the outside of your boot.
Do this for both ends of your laces. You should now have your laces on the outside of your boot.

, bring it up from underneath to the eyelet directly above the one below. Insert the lace from the outside in. Do this on both sides of you boot before bring running the lace horizontally across and under again.


Always follow the same order you started with. If you laced right over left first, continue in that order.

, Repeat this process until you have reached the top.


For this method, the only time your laces go through an eyelet is when you are moving to the eyelet vertically and from the outside in.
Once you are the top, your laces should be facing in, on the inside of your boots.

, Once you’ve laced all the way up, tie your boots in a bow, or a not and stuff the laces behind the tongue.

Remember that the color on the dye packaging may not be exactly the same color that ends up on your shoes. With home dying you need to be prepared for a little variation and fun surprises when it comes to coloring.;
, Many craft stores and online sellers have dyes for fabrics, so look around. Read the packaging on dyes you are considering buying in order to judge whether you want to put in the work to use them. Some dyes are more complicated to apply than other ones.


You will also need other supplies. These can include: plastic sheeting (to protect surfaces), latex gloves (to protect your hands), and rubber cement (or another product to protect the soles of your shoes from the dye). In addition, you may want to use a paint brush to paint on detailed designs and you will probably want to have paper towels on hand to clean up any little spills.
Rubber cement can usually be found at any supermarket or office supply store.

, If you already have some shoes that you want to dye that is just great. However, if you need to buy some, pick out white canvas shoes. It doesn't matter whether they are laces-ups or slip-ons, whichever you like. The most important part is that they are white, so that they can be dyed easily.


Cotton canvas in particular is a great fabric to dye because it will absorb and hold dye really well. That is because, in general, natural fibers are easier to dye than synthetic fibers.If you have never dyed anything before, and you don't want to spend a lot of money on this project, consider getting the cheapest sneakers or slip-ons you can find. They may not be as comfortable to wear as more expensive shoes but their inexpensiveness will keep you from getting really upset if you mess up the dying process.

, Make sure your shoes are clean because dirt, grime, and stains can interfere with how the dye will look on the canvas. Use warm water and soap to clean. Hand washing canvas shoes may easier than tossing them in the washing machine if you just need to do a spot cleaning.


You do not need to dry the shoes after cleaning. To dye your shoes you will get them wet ahead of time, so drying them is unnecessary.

, You should place your dying basin on a hard secure surface that won't move around a lot. This is to prevent the basin full of dye moving around so much that the dye spills over the edges. Additionally, you may want to put down plastic either on the surface you are working on or on the floor beneath your work area. This will protect the area in case of spills.


Set out all of your supplies so you don't have to search for them while you are in the middle of dying. It can be pretty annoying if you are searching for something you need while your gloved hands are covered in dye.
There are some dyes that need to be used while being heated on a burner.If you are using one of these dyes, and you don't have a portable burner, prepare an area in your kitchen that will be the dying area. Remove all extraneous items that could get dye on them by accident and cover sensitive surfaces with plastic.
Consider doing your dying outside if you can. Even dyes that need to be simmered can be used outside if you have a portable electric burner and access to electricity outside. If you can't do your dying outside, you should find an area in your house that won't be ruined if a little dye spills. This could be an unfinished basement or a utility room of some sort.

, Most fabric dyes need to be mixed with water in order to use them. Some dyes also require other additions, such as salt.Follow the directions on the dye package, as the ratio of dye to water varies by brand.


Be sure that you are mixing your dye and water in a container that is big enough that you will also be able to add your shoes to it without spilling over. It's best to have a lot of leeway in this area, as you don't want to have to deal with the mess of spilled dye.
You may need to mix your dye on the stove, if it requires heating to high temperatures. Once again, follow the manufacturers directions when using commercial dyes.

, Whether you need to protect the soles of your shoes depends greatly on the type of dye you are using. There are some dyes that will not penetrate a rubber or synthetic sole, meaning that you can simply wipe any dye off that gets on the sole. Other dyes, however, will permanently dye the sole.


To figure out if the dye you have will dye the soles of your shoes, place a little bit of the prepared dye on the bottom of the sole of one of your shoes. Once it is dry try to remove the dye with a little soap and water.
If you can easily get it off, great! You don't have to protect the soles from your dye. If not, you should keep all dye off the soles completely.

, Slick the rubber cement all around the areas on the shoe where you don't want the dye. That goes for the canvas too, so you can etch little designs if you're handy with rubber cement. If you mess up with the rubber cement, don't panic, because as soon as it dries, you can peel it off with your (gloved) hands.


Alternatively, you can cover the soles in either high-stick painters tape or a thick layer of vaseline.This technique for protecting the soles of your shoes is best if you don't plan of dipping the shoes completely in the dye, but rather you plan of painting the dye on with a brush.

, Some dyes require that the shoes are wet before they enter the dye.This is because the dye will move across the surface better if it doesn't have to do the additional work of moistening the canvas in the first place.


Use warm water, as this helps most dyes thoroughly penetrate the canvas.

, If you want the shoes to be all one color, simply place the tops of the shoes completely in the dye. If you want several colors, place one section of the shoe into the dye, while keeping another part of the shoe out of the dye.


Keep the shoes in the dye for as long as the directions tell you to. This varies greatly depending on the dye you use, but might be anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes.You will probably want to wear gloves while you are doing this. This will allow you to get your fingers into the dye while holding the shoes without getting dye all over them. While most dyes that are sold for home use won't be particularly dangerous to get on your skin, they will dye your skin and take a long time to wear off. In addition, getting dye on your fingers means that you risk making a mess if you touch surfaces or areas of your shoes that you don't want dyed.

, Why not add a few colors to your shoe? Using a second color (or more) won't be a lot more work but it will add a lot more fun to your shoe design!


Be strategic if you want to dye your shoe multiple colors. For example, if one color you are using is very light and the other is dark, consider applying the light color first. That way, you can dye the whole shoe the light color (which is easier that dying a specific section) and then cover up a section of that lighter dye with a darker color afterwords.
Try dyeing your laces as well! You can dye them the same color as your shoes or pick a different color to add another pop of color to your kicks., Don't limit yourself to just solid colors. Use a paint brush to paint a creative design onto your shoes with additional colors. Perhaps you could cover them in polka dots? Or maybe you could draw your favorite animal onto the tops of your shoes? Draw whatever inspires and excites you!


Mixing colors of dyes on your shoes can make totally new colors. Think of the dye as watercolor paints which you can use to make a beautiful array of blended colors.

, Most dyes need be rinsed out after use. This removes any extra dye from the shoe so it doesn't get all over your socks. Follow the directions on the package of the dye you used, but most dyes should be rinsed with cold water until the water runs clear., If you used rubber cement, or painter's tape, it should peel right off. Vaseline will need to be cleaned off with a little soap and water once the shoe dye is dry.


Don't do this immediately after you dye your shoes, as the dye could drip a bit on to the soles. Instead, wait a few minutes until you are sure there will be no more drips. You could even use a paper towel to soak up any areas of excessive dye that might eventually drip on to the soles.

, You can either allow the shoes to dry naturally or you can put them in your dryer.Just be warned that a bit of dye may rub off in the interior of your dryer, so you may want to wipe it out thoroughly after your shoes are dried and before you put clean laundry in it.

, Some dyes actually do need to go into the dryer because the dye needs to be set. Setting a dye means making sure it won't come out. In the case of many home dyes, this is done by applying high heat to the canvas. Check your dye package to find out if you have this kind of dye.


Sometimes you can also use a hairdryer to set a dye. Check your dye packaging to see if this is an option for you.

Paint the shoes.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Decorate Shoes1," To decorate shoes with paint you'll need to use canvas tennis shoes. You can buy canvas shoes in white, black, and many other colors at department or drug stores. Get a few pairs to try out different designs, or just stick with one pair for your masterpiece.


You can choose canvas shoes with or without laces - both will work just fine.
Paint an old pair of canvas tennis shoes if you don't want to buy a brand new pair. Painting shoes is a great way to bring new life to shoes you've already worn.;
, Fabric paint is designed to adhere to the type of fabric that is used to make canvas shoes, and in many cases it is even waterproof. Using fabric paint will help your designs last through a lot of wear. Go to an art supply store and choose paint in as many colors as you want.

, Draw draw your design on a piece of paper before you get started. Plan what to paint on the tops of the shoes, the heels, and the sides. Decide whether to make both shoes the same or do something different with each one.Here are a few ideas:


Choose a pattern and a background color. For example, you could paint the shoes with a star pattern against a purple background.
Do two-tone shoes. Make the toes and heels one color and the middle of the shoes a contrasting color.
Make one interesting shape. Paint a pair of lips or a watermelon slice on the front of the shoes.
Make a silly design. Paint a banana on one shoe and a monkey face on the other, or paint one shoe to look like an alligator foot and the other too look like a bear paw.

, Outline your design first, so that it will be easier to paint it neatly. If your drawing doesn't look right, you can just erase it and try again.

, Pour the different colors of paint into separate containers. Use a small paintbrush to apply the first color. Rinse the brush and apply the second color. Repeat until you've completely finished filling in the design you drew.

, Wait several hours for the paint to dry before you wear your newly-decorated shoes.

Pick out shoes to decorate.,
Buy glue and supplies.,
Decide on a design.,
Apply the adhesive.,
Apply the glitter and rhinestones.,
Repeat with the other shoe.,
Let the shoes dry.",How to Decorate Shoes2," Glitter and rhinestones can be used to decorate all sorts of shoes - not just canvas. Use glitter or rhinestones to jazz up flip flops, dress shoes, tennis shoes, or any other type of shoes.

, The only materials you need to decorate with glitter and rhinestones are glue and the glitter and rhinestones of your choice. Go to a craft store and pick up the following items:


Spray-on adhesive. This makes it easy to apply the glue - all you have to do is spray it on, rather than painting it on with a brush. You can certainly use the painting method if you don't want to buy spray-on glue.
Solid or multi-colored glitter. Buy a large bag or can of glitter to make sure that your shoes get entirely covered (if that's the look you're going for).
Rhinestones, buttons or other baubles. Craft stores carry all kinds of rhinestones and other small items with one flat side that makes it easy to glue to another surface. Pick out the colors and shapes you love.

, Covering the shoes entirely with glitter has a striking effect, and it's also a style trend that has been popping up in stores. You can go all the way or make a subtler pattern to decorate your shoes.


Make a glitter border. Plan to paint a line of glitter just above the soles of the shoes if you want just a hint of glitter.
Do a glitter base dotted with rhinestones.
Make alternating glitter and rhinestone stripes.
Make a rhinestone heart or star with glitter bursts along the edges.

, Spray or paint the first shoe with adhesive according to the design you created. If you're glittering the whole shoe, go ahead and spray the whole thing. If you're making a pattern, spray only in the places where the pattern will be.


If you need to block of areas that shouldn't get sprayed with adhesive, you can keep them dry with masking tape.
For more complicated designs, it's best to use a paintbrush to apply a little glue at a time.

, Sprinkle the glitter over the areas where you planned to use glitter. To apply the rhinestones, simply press them onto the surface of the shoe. For extra security, you can apply a little glue to the bottom of the rhinestone before pressing it on the shoe.

, When you're finished working with the first shoe, move on to the second.

, Wait several hours before wearing the shoes. Glitter and rhinestones aren't machine-washable or waterproof, so be careful where you wear them.

Use sharpies to decorate your shoes.,
Get unique laces.,
Use super glue to apply larger decorations.",How to Decorate Shoes3," Go with classic black or pick up a package of colorful sharpies to create a design. You can use them to write words, like a quote, or to create a sketch.


Consider writing a poem or your favorite song lyric.
Draw a cartoon of your favorite animal or celebrity.
Ask your friends to sign your shoes and make a doodle.

, Laces come in all kinds of patterns and colors. Look for animal patterns, polka dots, tie-dye designs, small printed characters, and all sorts of other unique prints.


Instead of buying laces, why not make your own? Use ribbon, baker's twine, or hemmed pieces of fabric to make decorative laces.
If your shoes have plain white laces, you can decorate those as well. Add small rhinestones or glitter, or use paint to make a pattern.

, Glue ribbons, buttons, and other small decorations to your shoes with superglue.

,
Paint shoes with red paint.,
Try for two even coats.,
Leave shoes to dry in well-ventilated area for 1-2 days, to make sure that when gluing on sequins the paint will not come off (the purpose of this is so the natural color of the shoe will not come through the gaps between the sequins).

",How to Make Dorothy's Ruby Red Slippers," Avoid using new shoes.;
,, If using spray paint, follow directions on label and read the warnings, if using acrylics, make sure you have sufficient experience to guarantee evenness, if you don't, use spray paint.

, Try to buy red shoes straight up; this will avoid the 'home-made/cheap' look, and cut down the time and effort required.,, Glue guns work in a similar fashion to an electric stovetop, so it may take awhile (1-2 min) for the wires in the glue gun to heat up enough to melt the glue.

,, Place them as close together as possible, but don't shove them together (this step will take a long time, so play some music or put on a movie, but not a very interesting one, otherwise you will get nothing done). You can also use spray glue in a can similar to hairspray, found in your local craft store, and any type of glitter. This method is a lot faster. Just spray and sprinkle glitter on shoes. Use newspaper so you can reuse excess glitter.

,, If they are, replace them, only this time, use a little more glue.

Some good sources can include wrapping paper, old magazines, old books, comics, and crossword puzzles. If you are unable to find anything you like in print, you can also find images you like online and print them onto standard printer paper.
When selecting images and patterns, pay close attention to the size of the print. You'll need to make sure that the pattern is small enough to fit over the surface of your shoe.
Take color into consideration, too. Arrange your images in a pile and make sure that the colors work well together.;
, The easiest size to work with will be postage-sized squares—approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) around all sides.


You can also cut the paper into small strips or cut out individual shapes from the pattern.
Small pieces work best since they will crease less when you apply the paper around the curves of the shoe.
Cutting the paper with scissors will create smooth, straight edges. Another option would be to simply tear the paper into small pieces. Doing so will create ragged edges and give the finished shoes a different sort of look.

, While not strictly essential, it's usually a good idea to spread out your cut pieces and plan a layout or overall design for your shoes.


You may need to make alterations to the layout as you actually apply the pieces, but giving yourself a rough estimate of how the design should look can make the application part of the process seem less intimidating.

, Find a good pair of leather or faux leather shoes. Solid color shoes with a smooth surface and minimal detail will work best.


This project is a great way to add new life to an old pair of shoes, but if you don't have a pair lying around, you can probably find some at a thrift store.
By choosing a solid color shoe, you'll guarantee that the decorative paper will be the focal point instead of the pattern beneath.
Shoes with grommets, laces, straps, and other details can be a bad choice since you'll need to decoupage around these elements. Doing so isn't impossible, but it will make the project more complex.

, Wipe the shoes down with a damp rag or baby wipe to clean away any surface dirt and debris.


The shoes do not need to thoroughly cleaned, but you shouldn't see any large clumps of dirt or grime. Stains and deeply imbedded dirt can be left alone, though.

, If you choose patent leather shoes, it's a good idea to lightly buff and scuff the surface with a patch of sandpaper before continuing further.


A nail file can also be used to scuff the shoes.
Scuffing shiny, smooth surfaces can give the paste something to sink into when you apply it, creating a more secure bond in the process.
Note that this scuffing process is not necessary if the shoes already have a matte or rough surface.

, In a glass or plastic bowl, combine equal parts PVA glue and water. Stir them together with a popsicle stick or disposable wooden chopstick until thoroughly combined.


Note that PVA glue is merely standard white glue.
Another option would be to purchase Mod Podge or a similar commercial decoupage glue. Make sure that whatever you choose will create a permanent bond and a clear, smooth finish.

, Apply your prepared paste to a small section at the back of the shoe using a sponge brush or other small paintbrush.Only apply enough paste to cover enough shoe for one or two small patches of paper. The paste needs to be fresh and very wet when you adhere the paper, and if you apply too much at once, it may start drying out before you can work with it.
You can technically start working anywhere on the shoe, but typically, it is easiest if you start toward the back (heel) of the shoe along the inside edge.

, Place one patch of your desired paper over the paste on the shoe.Use your fingers to apply gentle pressure to the paper so that it adheres securely.
If the paper does not adhere well, you may need to coat the back of the patch with additional paste before trying again.

, While the paste is still wet, use your fingers to smooth away any wrinkles or creases you see in the applied patch.


If the paste has already begun drying or if you are otherwise unable to smooth away the wrinkles with your fingers, brush over the patch with a damp sponge to help smooth it out more thoroughly., Before proceeding, with the next patch of paper, apply another smooth coat of past over the patch you just put on.


Don't be afraid of applying too much. The paper should be thoroughly soaked with paste if you really want it to remain in place.
This coat of paste can also extend over onto the next section of shoe you plan cover.

, Work your way around the rest of the shoe in the same manner, applying the paper one patch at a time until the entire surface is covered.


Each patch of paper should slightly overlap the one before it. Overlapping the patches reduces the amount of blank space and gives the final piece more strength.If you make a mistake, you'll only have a few seconds to remove the patch before the paste starts setting. After this period of time passes, it is better to cover the patch with a new one instead of trying to rip it off.
You can decoupage the heel of your shoe, if desired, but do not bother covering the sole or the inside. These spots will wear down too quickly to make the effort worthwhile.
When you finish decorating one shoe, complete the second shoe in the same manner.

, Set the shoes aside for a couple of hours until the surface is mostly dry.


The surface can still feel sticky, but it should be dry enough to prevent the patches of paper from sliding around.

, Use a foam paintbrush to apply one final coat of paste around the entire covered surface of both shoes.


This final coat of paste can help keep all of the paper patches down while also adding a mildly protective coating.
Set the shoes aside when done and let them dry or a full 24 hours before handling them further. The shoes must be completely dry before you do anything else with them at this point.

, Once the shoes have dried, you should apply some form of waterproof sealer so that they can be worn in any kind of weather without a problem.


Mod Podge and several other pastes can actually create a waterproof seal, so you can use several coats of this if desired.
Clear varnish and sealing lacquer are other options worth considering.
Regardless of the option you choose, let the sealer dry for a few hours in between each separate coat and wait for the final coat to dry completely before proceeding.

, While not strictly essential, you may wish to mask the messy, uneven inside edge. You won't be able to see this inner edge while the shoes are on your feet but you will see it when the shoes are off.Begin by trimming away any paper that is not stuck in place.
The simplest option is to paint over the messy patchwork edge with a paint color that matches the inner lining of the shoe.
Another option would be to glue a ribbon around the entire inner edge of the shoe. Doing this would hide the messy inner edge while creating an aesthetically interesting accent.

, You can keep the shoes as they are at this point, but you could also add other embellishments to the surface to create a slightly different look.


Some possible options include sequins, glitter, buttons, and bows.

, Make sure that any glue, sealer, and paint has dried before you handle or wear the shoes.


As a general rule, it is best to wait 12 to 24 hours after completing the shoes before actually wearing them.

, Your newly decoupaged shoes should now be complete and ready to show off.

",How to Decorate Canvas Shoes With Markers," Converse and flats are very popular, so they are a good choice. Remove the laces.;
, Thin ones are very good for small details, blending colors, and drawing outlines, while thick ones are good for blurry images and backgrounds.

, Try thinking of objects that resemble one another, are easy to draw in a variety of different colors, and are unique and pleasing to the eye. For example, flowers, hot air balloons, and even jellyfish are great examples. Refrain from large landscapes with dull colors, or images that are too dark. They will look bad when drawn on.

, It is best to keep it small--1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) at its widest point. Draw more, keeping them about a half inch apart.

, Using the same color, outline the pictures you just drew. Make sure this color is contrasting. Be careful! It may bleed. If you do not want the risk, outline it in thinner marker.

, If you used a dark blue, move onto lighter and lighter blues, then greens, then yellows. Yellows are very dynamic looking when they sit top-tier over darker colors. Keep in mind that Sharpies go over previous colors. On cloth, if you make a blue mark and go over it with yellow, it will turn green. With this in mind, overshoot your colors a little.

, Repeat on all other sides, and maybe even the tongue.

",How to Color Your Converse1," The best Converse to work on are brand new. If you can't get new ones, you will need to clean the ones you already own. This will help the ink stick and show up better. Wipe down the rubber parts with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol. Wipe down the fabric parts with a damp towel. Let the shoe dry before moving on.


Most markers are translucent, and will show up best against a white shoe. If you are going to buy a new pair of Converse, try to get white ones.
If you are going to color the entire shoe, remove the shoe laces. You can even color those ones as well.;
, Permanent markers will work on all parts of the shoe. Because they are translucent, they will show up best against white Converse. Fabric markers will only work on the fabric part of the shoe. They may smear if you use them on the rubber part.


Make sure you get the right type of fabric marker. If your shoe is colored, get a fabric marker intended for dark or colored fabric. If your shoe is white, you can use any type of fabric marker.

, Once you start coloring your shoe, it will be difficult to erase any mistakes. Sketch out your design on a sheet of paper or scrap of fabric, then color it in using the markers. Try simple designs, such as lightning bolts, hearts, and stars. You can also try geometric designs as well.


If you are going to color the rubber parts, practice on a sheet of paper.
If you are going to color the fabric parts, try to practice on a scrap of canvas, linen, or cotton fabric. The texture will give you a feel for what it is like to color on Converse.

, If your shoes are white, try to sketch lightly so that the pencil doesn't show through. If your shoes are dark, use a white colored pencil instead., Depending on the type of marker you are using, you may need to wait for the ink to dry before moving onto the next color. Don't start with the darker colors. If you do, the ink will smudge and bleed into the lighter colors and make them muddy.


If you are using fabric markers meant for colored fabrics, shake it first, then tap the tip on a flat surface. This will help get the ink into the felt tip. The ink will gush out, so don't do the tapping part on your Converse.

, The outlines are not necessary, but they can help make your work stand out some more. Try to use thicker lines on the main/larger shapes, and thinner lines on the smaller shapes and details.

, Whatever you choose to use, make sure that it is matte, or your shoes will end up shiny. This will help protect your work and make it last longer.


You do not need to spray the rubber parts, if you colored them. Keep in mind that the designs will wear off of the rubber parts on their own the more you wear your shoes.

, Keep in mind that even with the sealer, your work will still be delicate. Wear your shoes with care and try to avoid getting them wet or muddy.

Plan your design carefully.,
Trace your design with pencil.,
Use a thin-tip permanent marker.,
Let the shoes cure for a day.,
Set your design with waterproof acrylic spray.",How to Decorate Converse Shoes1," Because you are planning on permanently altering your shoes, ensure that your design is one you’ll want to wear for some time. Also consider all the different places you wear your shoes. You may want curse words on your Converses at a music show, but not when you meet your new girlfriend’s parents.


If you’re feeling stuck for ideas, take a look at your room. What kinds of colors and patterns do you like? Is there a favorite band or collectible you love? Drawing inspiration from your own life will ensure your Converses reflect you.
You can never go wrong with classic patterns like stripes, polka dots or chevrons.;
, Once you’ve settled on a design you like, take a pencil and outline your illustration on the canvas top and/or rubber toe of the Converses. Designs on the rubber of the toe can stand up a bit better over time than the canvas, but it’s up to you.By tracing with pencil first, you can edit your design as you see fit. If you decide you don’t like your idea and want to start over, you can even wash your Converses on low in your washing machine to wash the pencil out.

, When you’re happy with your pencil outline and want to move forward, be sure to draw with a permanent marker so your design will last. Thin-tip permanent markers will provide a little more control and bleed less if you are drawing on canvas.


Keep in mind that all colors will fade a bit over time. If you prefer a vibrant look, be sure to use very bright colors from the start. They may become more muted.
It can be helpful to color with lighter markers first. If you make a mistake, you can always fix it by coloring over with a darker marker.

, When you are finished, let the Converses cure for at least 24 hours so the ink can fully sink into the material and set. During this period of time, it makes sense to place your shoes in a clean, dry place where you won’t accidentally get water on them., It is critical to set your new design with waterproof acrylic spray such as 3M Scotchgard Fabric Protector or Nikwax Fabric Waterproofing Spray. These will weatherproof your illustration.


If you don’t have access to these sprays, you can rub the canvas of your Converses with beeswax. Then set the wax by blowing it with a warm hairdryer to seal your design.

If you'd like to color the rubber parts, you will need to use permanent markers.If you are only painting the sides of the shoe, you do not need to remove the shoe laces.

, Once you start painting your shoe, it will be difficult to erase any mistakes. Sketch out your design on a sheet of paper or scrap of fabric, then color it in using acrylic or fabric paint and some thin paintbrushes.


Cotton, linen, or canvas fabric will give you the best feel for what it is like to work on Converse. Paper will do in a pinch, however.
If your paint is too thick, thin it out with some water.

, Press lightly, so that the pencil doesn't show through once the paint dries.If your shoe is a very dark color, use a white color pencil instead.


Simpler designs, such as stripes, stars, and hearts will look the best.
If you like cartoons or comics, consider painting your favorite character.

, This will help your colors show up better and make them last longer. Let the paint primer dry before you move on to the next step.If you are using fabric paint, you don't need to use paint primer.

, Paint the edges first, then fill the shape in. If you want to add any details, wait until the paint dries. For example, if you want to paint a ladybug, paint the entire bug red first. Add the spots after the red paint dries. Keep in mind that some colors, such as yellow, will need several coats before they show up well.


If you want the outline to be another color (like black) wait until the very end.If you make a mistake, wait for the paint to dry, then paint over it., You can do the outlines using a thin, pointed paintbrush or a black permanent marker.

, You can also use an acrylic spray sealer. Whatever you decide to use, make sure that it is matte, or your shoes will be shiny.

Remove the tape or petroleum jelly.,
Toss the shoes into the dryer for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Put the shoe laces back in.",How to Color Your Converse3," Dye is translucent. It adds color to whatever color is already there. For example, if you tried to dye a pair of blue shoes red or pink, you'll end up with purple. You also cannot dye shoes a lighter color.You can, however, dye any color of shoe black.

, This will protect the rubber from picking up the dye.If you want to dye the laces as well, you will still want to take them out; you will dip them into the dye bath along with the shoes. This will help them dye more evenly.

, Make sure that the bucket is deep enough to fit your shoe.


The salt and laundry detergent will help make the dye brighter., Each company may be a little different, so follow the directions on your bottle or packet. In general, liquid dyes do not need any preparation. If you are using powdered dye, you will need to dissolve it in 2 cups (475 milliliters) of hot water first., If your shoes float to the top, you will need to weigh them down with something heavy. You can use glass jars or bottles, or even sticks. If you don't do this, they will float to the top and your dye job will be uneven.


Some people find that soaking the shoes in warm water first helps the dye soak in better and more evenly.Dye can get messy. Consider wearing some plastic gloves to protect your hands from getting stained., This will give the dye enough time to soak into the fabric.

, Use warm water first to set the dye, and then cold water to get rid of the excess dye.Be sure to get the inside of the shoes as well.

, This is to get rid of any last traces of dye. Remember to rinse the inside of the shoes as well.

, If you can, set them out in a sunny spot. This will help them dry faster. If you don't have any newspaper, you can use an old towel or even a paper bag instead.

, If any dye leaked onto the shoes, you can remove it using rubbing alcohol or a bleach pen.You can also try a magic eraser or a paste made from equal parts of baking soda, water, and vinegar.If you are using a bleach pen, leave the bleach on the rubber parts for 10 minutes, then wipe it off with a damp cloth. Be careful not to get any bleach on the fabric part., The heat will help set the dye further.It will also help the shoes finish drying, if they are still a little damp.

, Your shoes are now ready to wear.

Plan to decorate the rubber toes of the Converses.,
Rough up the toe with fine sandpaper or a nail file.,
Use flat-back metal studs or crystals.,
Adhere your embellishments with E6000 glue.,
Let the glue set fully.,
Don’t forget glitter.",How to Decorate Converse Shoes2," The canvas tops of Converses are less ideal than the toes if you’re looking to adhere embellishments such as crystals or metal studs. The material is simply too porous. To get the most longevity of out your design, plan on bedazzling the toes.

Need some ideas? Draw inspiration from color families. Try warm colors, cool colors, jewel tones or classic black and white.
Animal prints make a big statement. You could bedazzle a leopard print or zebra stripe for a wild look.

, Creating micro-abrasions on the toes of the shoes will allow embellishments to adhere more fully. This will keep your design intact longer.Get a fine-grained piece of sandpaper from the hardware store or use the rougher side of a nail file to scratch the toes. Work in smooth circular motions, covering the toe area completely.

, Crystals or studs that have metal teeth can damage your shoes and compromise the water-resistance of the rubber toe. Opt for flat-back embellishments to keep your Converses (and your special design) lasting their longest., This extremely strong specialty glue will keep the embellishments on your shoes for the long haul. Do not touch this glue with your bare fingers, as it cures very quickly. When you are ready to work, use an old pair of tweezers to dip the gems’ flat backs gently into the glue and place them where you want on the toes.Industrial glues such as E6000 tend to have strong fumes. Be sure to perform your decorating in a well-ventilated area. Outside is ideal.

, Once you have completed your design, let your glue set for 48-72 hours to keep the embellishments from coming off. The longer the glue is able to sit undisturbed, the more fully it will harden., If you want to decorate with glitter rather than gems or studs, use the same E6000 glue. Since you can’t apply glitter with tweezers, use a popsicle stick to the spread a small amount of glue over the toe of the shoe. Then use a cup to sprinkle your glitter over the desired area. Let cure for the same 48-72 hours.Glitter is more prone to “shedding” so keep this in mind as you consider how you want to decorate your Converses.

"
"
Remove the shoelaces of the Converses completely.,
Sketch a design on the canvas with a pencil.,
Pick a durable thread.,
Use a chenille needle.,
Use a thimble and needle nose pliers to protect your fingertips.",How to Decorate Converse Shoes3," This will open the shoes up more and give the tongue more flexibility. It will allow you more space to maneuver inside the shoes as you stitch your designs., The rubber toe of your Converses is not suitable for embroidery, but the canvas is ideal. When you have a design in mind, use a pencil to sketch an outline onto the canvas.

If you decide you don’t like your idea and want to start over, you can even wash your Converses on low in your washing machine to wash the pencil out.
Embroidering lends itself to lettering. If you’re stuck for ideas, you could embroider your birthday or initials.

, A strong, vibrant thread, such as DMC’s Pearl Cotton, will make your design stand out and last for a long time. When selecting thread, consider that thicker gauge thread will be more difficult to push through the canvas than a thinner thread., Chenille needles have very sharp tips and a larger eye. The sharp tip will be better able to penetrate the stiff canvas of your Converses more easily, and the larger eye will make threading thicker thread easier.The needles of most home sewing machines will be too fine to successfully sew through the side of your Converses. To keep from wrecking your sewing machine, embroider an item like this by hand.

, It’s wise to use a thimble to protect the sensitive pads of your fingers whenever you are sewing. Needle nose pliers will help you pull the chenille needle through the stiff canvas of your shoes more easily, too.

Take your time while stitching. It is easy to injure yourself when sewing thick or difficult materials.
When you’re ready to wrap up your stitching, perform an anchor stitch—a stitch that runs parallel to the stitching surface back through the last several stitches—to secure your work."

Doodle on canvas shoes with permanent markers or fabric markers.Make sure that the shoes are clean first, then start doodling.,
Add some embellishments to the front toe area.,
Change out plain shoe laces for a shiny ribbon.,
Glue rhinestones along sandal or flip flop straps.,
Wrap ribbon around the straps of a pair of flip flops to make them look more dressier.",How to Customize Your Shoes1," If you are worried about making mistakes, you can sketch your design out lightly in pencil first. You can use all one color, such as black, or many colors. If you are using multiple colors, put the lighter colors down first, then the darker ones, and finally your outlines. Here are some ideas on what you can doodle:


Write your name, nickname, or initials
Swirls, spirals, squiggles, and zigzags
Lightning bolts, hearts, or stars
Fake studs or gemstones
Smiley faces or skulls
Flowers, birds, or butterflies
Polka dots, checkered, chevron, etc;
, Use super glue or an industrial-strength glue (such as E6000) to attach a pendant or brooch to the front part of a fancy dress shoe. If you want a non-permanent option, use some large, fancy clip-on earrings or shoe clips. Simply slip them over the front of the shoe so that the design rests right over the toe area. Whatever you choose to use, just make sure that they match.

You can also make your own shoe clips by purchasing some blank clip-on earrings, and then hot gluing some fancy brooches or pendants to them.

, Take out the old laces and use them to measure out some ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeter) wide satin ribbon. Cut both ends of the ribbon at an angle. Seal the edges with fabric glue or super glue so that they do not fray. Use the ribbon to lace up your shoes instead of regular shoe laces. You can use any color of ribbon you want, but a matching color or a contrasting color might look the best. For example:

If your shoes are white, consider getting a teal or black ribbon.
If your shoes are light blue, they might look good with a light blue, dark blue, or white ribbon.

, Use super glue or E6000 to attach the rhinestones. The stones should not be wider than the strap. You can use varying sizes, shapes, and colors, but try to arrange them in a pattern instead of randomly. This will make them look more professional.

You can also glue rhinestones to other areas of the shoe as well. If this is a pair of fancy dress shoes or wedding shoes, consider using Swarovski crystals. They will make your shoes look fancier and more expensive.

, Super glue the end of a long piece of ribbon to the base of a flip flop strap. Wrap ribbon around the strap, like a candy cane. Try to overlap the ribbon a little bit as you wind it around the strap. When you get to the other end of the flip flop, cut off any excess ribbon and glue the end down to the base of the strap.

You can also use thin strips of fabric.
Consider starting with two pieces of ribbon. Glue the end of each ribbon to the base of each strap, and wrap them towards each other. Tie them together into a pretty bow when they meet in the middle, right above the toe thong.

Work in a well-ventilated area.,
Protect your work surface.,
Try to work on clean shoes.",How to Bleach Colored Canvas Shoes1," The best place to work is outside. If you can't work outside, open up a window or turn on a fan. Bleach can get stinky and cause headaches if you don't have enough fresh air.;
, Spread some newspapers, a plastic tablecloth, or some old towels over your work surface. This will help protect it from getting stained.

, If your shoes are dirty, you may not see the effects of the bleach as well. If necessary, wash your shoes in a bucket of soap and water, and let them dry.

Fill your pencil work in with acrylic paint.,
Allow the paint to dry.,
Consider outlining your work with permanent markers.,
Spray your shoes with a clear, acrylic sealer.,
Peel off the painter's tape.,
Allow the shoes to dry completely before you wear them.",How to Customize Your Shoes2," Painting your shoes is a great way to show off your individuality. This method will work great on canvas and fabric shoes, but it may also work on leather and other materials. Keep in mind, however, that paint sticks best to fabric as opposed to plastic, leather, and so forth. Here's a list of what you will need:Canvas or fabric shoes
Acrylic paint primer
Acrylic paint
Acrylic sealer
Paint brushes
Paint palette
Thin permanent marker
Painter's tape

, This will give you nice, crisp lines and make your work look neater., This will give you a blank canvas to work on. The primer will also help the paint stick to the fabric better. Do not apply the primer too thickly, however; you still want to feel the texture of the fabric.

If you are painting a delicate design with lots of open space, such as lace, scrolls, or vines, then skip the primer. Keep in mind, however, that you may need a few coats of paint if your shoes are a dark color to begin with.
You can buy paint primer in the painting section of an arts and crafts store.

, This will help you figure out where to paint, and prevent any mistakes. Try to sketch lightly so that the pencil marks don't show once you are done painting.

Try to keep your designs simple if this is your first time painting shoes.

, If you make a mistake, wait for the paint to dry first. Depending on how bad the mistake is, you can just paint over it, or you can fix it with paint primer. Allow the paint primer to dry before you paint over it.

If you want to add shading to your design, consider laying down the base color first, waiting for it to dry, then painting on the shadows/highlights.

, Most acrylic paints will dry in 20 minutes. Some may need up to two hours to dry., This help your work stand out even more. Try to use a super-fine tip so that your work will be neater and more professional-looking.

, This will help protect your work from getting smudged. It will also make it easier to clean., Do this while the acrylic sealer is still wet, so that you don't accidentally chip it off., Even though you sprayed with a sealer, it would be best to avoid getting them wet.

Keep applying more coats of glitter glue until your shoes are as glittery as you want them to be.,
Apply a coat of plain, glossy Mod Podge once the last coat of glitter has dried.,
Remove any painter's tape and newspaper, and allow the shoes to dry fully.,
Apply some clear, acrylic sealer to your shoes.,
Allow the sealer to dry and cure before you wear your shoes.",How to Customize Your Shoes3," Adding glitter is a great way to dress up any pair of shoes. You can cover your entire shoe with glitter, or just a small portion (such as a heart or star shape). If you are glittering a pair of high heels, you can glitter just the sole part, and leave the rest of the shoe plain. Here's a list of what you will need:Shoes
Mod Podge, Gloss Finish
Fine glitter
Painter’s tape and newspaper
Foam brushes or paintbrushes
Plastic wrap
Plastic bowl
Spoon or stirring stick
Acrylic sealer

, These will only get in the way of glittering your shoes. Taking them off will make your work easier, cleaner, and neater. You can always re-lace your shoes, or glue embellishments back on, later once the shoes dry., Soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and wipe down the area you will be glittering with it. Throw away the cotton ball when it becomes dirty and use a new one. Any surface dirt and oils may prevent the Mod Podge and glitter from sticking.

Even if your shoes look clean, it might still be a good idea to wipe them down with rubbing alcohol.

, This will make your work neater and crisper. You may also want to stuff the inside of your shoes with newspaper at this time; this will prevent any glitter from getting inside your shoes., You can use a spoon or even a popsicle stick to stir it. The more glitter you use, the fewer coats you will have to brush on. You want the consistency to be smooth. If you use too much glitter, it will be chunky and difficult to spread., Your first coat will appear thin and not very sparkly. Don't worry, it will become more sparkly as you continue to add more coats. Brush the glitter glue onto the other shoe., You may also want to rinse off your brushes or store them in a plastic sandwich bag so that the glue does not dry out on the bristles.

You are covering your bowl so that the glitter glue does not dry out.
Once the glue on the shoes turns clear, it is dry.

, Be sure to let each coat dry before you apply a new one. For a fully-glittered pair, you will need about four coats. This, of course, will depend on how much glitter you used in your original mixture., This Mod Podge should not have any glitter in it. You are merely sealing the glitter in so that it does not shed everywhere., This can take a few hours, depending on how dry or humid it is., You can also use a shoe sealer or a waterproofing spray—just make sure that it has a clear, glossy finish. If you spray your shoes with anything that dries matte, your shoes will lose their sparkle., Just because something feels dry does not necessarily mean that it is fully cured and useable. Some sealers will be cured in as little as 20 minutes to two hours. Some may requite up to six or more hours.

If you took off any laces or embellishments, now is the time to put them back on.

Gather your supplies.,
Cut a piece of fabric large enough to drape over the shoe.,
Cut a slit in the fabric so that you can see the shoe opening.,
Apply a thick coat of Mod Podge to the toe part of the shoe and smooth the fabric down.,
Brush more Mod Podge down the sides of the shoe and press the fabric down.,
Stop when you are 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) away from the heel seam.,
Trim both sides of the fabric so that they extend past the back seam by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).,
Glue down one of the sides over the back seam with Mod Podge.,
Hem the other side of the fabric and Mod Podge it down.,
Trim the excess fabric around the opening of the shoe so that you have a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) hem.,
Cut slits into the top hem so that the fabric will curve better when you fold it into the shoe.,
Mod Podge the hem to the inside of your shoe.,
Trim the excess fabric along the sole of the shoe.,
Apply Mod Podge to the underside of the fabric, and press it down onto the shoe.,
Gently run your craft knife along the seam of the shoe, where the sole joins the body of the shoe.,
Cover the shoe with another layer of Mod Podge and let it dry before sealing it with a clear, acrylic sealer.,
Allow your shoes to dry completely before you wear them.",How to Customize Your Shoes4," This method will allow you to change the color and pattern of your shoes. It will work best on a simple pair of shoes with as few seams as possible, such as ballet flats. It is not recommended for sneakers. Here's a list of what you'll need:Ballet flats (or similar)
Foam brush
Mod Podge
Craft knife
Scissors
Fabric
Acrylic sealer

, Place the shoe down on your table and drape the fabric over it. Cut around the fabric where it meets the table. You will end up with something that looks like a rectangle or an oval., Start at the heel and cut down the middle until you are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the toe part. Do not cut past the shoe opening. If you can see the top of the toe area, you have cut too far., Lift the fabric up so that you can see the toe. Brush on a thick coat onto the toe, then press the fabric down onto the Mod Podge. Smooth out any wrinkles with your fingers. The fabric needs to lay as flat and smooth as possible. Don't worry if the glue soaks up through the fabric; it will dry clear., Work in small, 1 inch to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08) wide segments. Again, try to keep the fabric as smooth as possible., You will need this space and extra fabric so that you can ""hem"" your fabric and create a new ""seam."", They will be overlapping each other, but you will fix that in a moment., It will be extending past the seam by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Don't worry, you will be covering it up with the other side., Cover the underside with Mod Podge first. Then, fold the edge in by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Glue it down onto the back of the shoe with more Mod Podge. The raw edges should now be completely hidden by fabric., You want to be able to tuck this into your shoe. You should end up with something that looks like a long oval., You will need the most slits along the curve that is facing the toe of your shoe, and hardly any slits along the side. You may need a few slits on the side just above the heel. Each slit should go from the raw edge down to wear the fabric meets the shoe., Use your foam brush to apply some Mod Podge to the underside of the top hem. Fold the top hem over the top of the shoe opening. Press the fabric firmly against the inside of the shoe.

If the fabric won't stay put, secure it with some sewing pins or metal clips.

, Try to cut as close as possible to the seam between the sole and the body of the shoe., If you see any bunching or wrinkling, use your fingers to smooth the fabric down. If necessary, cut in a few slits or notches., Be careful to cut just the fabric, and not the shoe. Continue smoothing the fabric down with your fingers. The cut edge of the fabric should now by flush with the top of the sole.

If you can, try to tuck the fabric into the crease. Use the top/dull side of the craft knife to do this.

, It will take about 12 hours for the Mod Podge to completely dry and cure, and two to six hours for the acrylic sealer to dry and cure.

Unless you want shiny shoes, be sure to get a matte finish for both your Mod Podge and acrylic sealer.

, Just because something feels dry does not necessarily mean it is fully cured and ready to wear. Also, the acrylic sealer will protect your shoes from getting damaged, but you might want to avoid getting them wet. Moisture may cause the Mod Podge underneath to dissolve, bubble, and warp."

Lace up your Converse when you are done.

",How to Bleach Colored Canvas Shoes2," This method will work best on shoes that lace up or have a rubber toe cap, such as Converse, but it can work on all-fabric canvas sneakers as well, such as Toms and Vans. Here's a list of what you will need:


Canvas
Bleach
Water (optional)
Bowl
Old rag
Rubber gloves

, If you don't take them off, then the spaces under the laces will still be the original color. You might also end up bleaching the laces.

, This will protect your hands from the bleach if your rag gets soaked through.

, You can use the bleach full-strength or you can dilute it with water. Pure bleach will give you faster results, but it may also eat away at the fabric. Using diluted bleach will take more time, but it will be less harsh on your fabric.


If you are diluting bleach, use one part bleach to one part water.

, You might also want to bring out some Q-tips or an old toothbrush to reach small areas.

, If you rub the bleach into the shoe it will lighten the cloth more. Don't be worried if the canvas turns weird colors — for example, navy may turn brown. This will go away.


Keep in mind, however, that some shoes will never turn fully white. For example, most shades of black tend to turn brown or orange.

, If it's a dark color, you may have to use a lot of bleach and go through this step several times. They will get lighter and lighter as you go. It may take some time and patience.


Use a Q-tip to get into small areas, such as corners and between grommets.

, This will stop the bleach from acting and prevent it from eating away at the fabric.

, After that you may want to wash them so they stop smelling like bleach.

If you have a pair of shoes that lace up or have a rubber toe cap, try this method instead. Here's a list of what you'll need:


Canvas sneakers
Bleach
Water
Plastic tub
Rubber gloves

, If your sneakers have inserts inside, you can pull those out and set them aside. This way, they will be their original color when you put them back in. This can create a nice contrast.

, You want to protect your hands from the bleach solution.

, For a stronger solution, use one part bleach and one part water. For a weaker solution, use one part bleach and two parts water.


The water-bleach solution needs to be deep enough so that you can submerge the shoes completely.
The plastic tub needs to be long enough so that you can sit your shoes inside.

, Try to set them upside down in the tub. This way, more of the fabric gets covered with bleach.

, This will take one to five hours, depending on how dark the shoes are to begin with, and how light you want them to become. Keep in mind that some of the darker colors will never fully turn white. Some colors, such as black, will turn orange or brown.


Be sure to check back on the shoes every 10 to 60 minutes.

, This will stop the bleach from acting. It will also get rid of the smell.

, It will take about three hours for them to fully dry.

, Even though you are working with a spray bottle, there is a good chance that some bleach may drip onto your skin. The gloves will keep your skin safe.

, For a stronger solution, use one part bleach and one part water. For a weaker solution, use one part bleach and two parts water. The bottle should have a nozzle with two to three settings: spray, mist, and off.

, This will mix up the bleach and water inside.

, Use the ""spray"" setting to squirt a few splatters onto your sneakers. This will give you a sort of galaxy effect. Use the ""mist"" setting and spray your shoes all over to completely bleach them., This may take around 20 minutes to several hours. The longer you leave them out, the lighter they will become.

Treat the shoes with care.",How to Bedazzle Shoes," You can bedazzle just about any type of shoe, from wedges to heels, canvas sneakers to flip flops. Plain shoes without a lot of embellishments (at least on the area you want to bedazzle) will work the best. News shoes will work the best, but you can use older ones as long as they are clean and in good condition.

Because of how quickly they show wear and tear, flip flops and canvas sneakers should be new.;
, If the shoes are especially dirty, use rubbing alcohol instead. Be careful if the shoes are made out of leather, however; rubbing alcohol can discolor leather shoes.You don't have to wipe down the entire show, but you need to wipe down the area you will be bedazzling., You will be working with strong adhesives, so it will be difficult to fix mistakes. Take a look at your shoes and now and decide where you want the rhinestones to go. Because of how heavy the rhinestones can make the shoes, it's not recommended that you cover the entire shoe. Here are some ideas to get you started:

Cover the entire heel portion on a pair of high heels or wedges.
Cover just the fabric part on a pair of canvas sneakers.
Consider covering just the rubber toe cap on canvas sneakers. Keep in mind that the rhinestones may fall off.
Cover the straps on a pair of flip flops. Depending on the material, be aware that the rhinestones may fall off.

, Silver or clear rhinestones will work with just about any shoe. You can also use colored rhinestones, but make sure that they look good on your shoe. You can use rhinestones that are all the same shape and size, or play around with different shapes and/or sizes. If you are using rhinestones that are all the same size, it would still be a good idea to get a few odd sizes in order to fill in any gaps caused by curves.For a pair of high heels, wedges, or very expensive shoes, use tiny, high-quality rhinestones. Sizes between 5ss and 16ss will work especially well.Large, plastic rhinestones will look tacky.
If you are covering a pair of casual or inexpensive shoes, such as canvas sneakers or flip flops, you can use larger and less expensive rhinestones., A jewel setter is a small, plastic stick with a ball of wax attached at the tip. If you can't find one, roll a small piece of wax into a ball, and stick it onto a toothpick. The ball should be about the size of a pinhead.This is only necessary for tiny rhinestones. If you can easily pick the rhinestone up with your finger, you don't need a jewel setter.
You can also use a pair of jewelry tweezers. They look similar to cosmetic tweezers, except that the tip is longer and thinner. You can find them in the beading section of an arts and crafts store.

, If you can't find a tray, a clean, plastic lid would also work. Make sure that the flat, back side of each rhinestone is facing down, and the faceted side is facing up. This will make the rhinestones easier to pick up.If you are working with a lot of rhinestones, pour out only a small amount first.
If you are working with different shapes and/or sizes, it would be a good idea to sort them out first. Use different trays/lids if necessary.

, Use a toothpick, skewer, or popsicle stick to apply the adhesive to a 1 by 2-centimeter patch on the shoe. If you are bedazzling a heel on a high heel or wedge, start on the edge or back of the heel; don't start in the middle or top.

It is easier to work in small patches. It also prevents the glue from drying out too fast.
Use a strong adhesive, such as E6000 or GemTac. Regular white school glue or tacky glue won't be strong enough for this.
If the heel is covered in fabric, or if you are covering a canvas sneaker, you may be able to use a good-quality fabric glue instead.

, Lightly tap the wax tip against the top of the rhinestone. The rhinestone should stick to the wax. Don't press too hard against the rhinestone, however, or it will get stuck to the wax and not adhere properly to the glue.Don't panic if you get some wax residue on the crystal. You will take care of that later.
If you are working with large, chunky rhinestones, you can pick it up with your fingers instead.
You can also pick up the rhinestone with a pair of jewelry tweezers. Grip it by the sides.

, Once the rhinestone sticks, carefully lift the jewel setter away. Use an orange stick or a toothpick to push the rhinestone into place, if needed.An orange stick is the same tool that manicurists use to push back cuticles. You can find it in the nail care section of more grocery stores and super markets.
If you are using jewelry tweezers, be careful not to get any glue on them. If you did, wipe the glue off immediately.

, Always work in small, 1 to 2-centimeter patches. You can place them right next to each other for the ultimate sparkly look, for further apart for something more subtle. If your rhinestones are all the same size, you may need to use an odd-sized one to fill in any gaps.If you are using a variety of sizes in a random pattern, start with the largest ones first, then fill the gaps in with smaller ones.

Apply round rhinestones in off-set lines, like bricks on a wall, to get the most coverage.Applying square rhinestones in straight lines for a neat, geometric look.
You don't have to cover the entire area with rhinestones. Use tiny rhinestones to make patterns, such as simply daisies., How long this takes depends on what type of glue you are using, so read the instructions on the package carefully. For example, E6000 will take 24 to 72 hours to set.Drying times are not the same as curing times. If your glue has a curing time, then you must wait that long before wearing the shoes.

, You can do this with a q-tip or a brush. If you are using a brush, make sure it's one that you don't care about, because it will ruin the fibers. Avoid soaking the area, however, or the acetone will dissolve the glue and cause the rhinestones to fall off.Always test the acetone on a spare rhinestone, especially if it is made out of plastic. It can fog or dissolve certain types of plastic.
If the rhinestone is made out of plastic, try scratching the adhesive off first. If it won't come off, try rubbing alcohol next; it is gentler than acetone.
The adhesive will dry clear. If it is not very noticeable, it may sometimes be better to just leave it as it is.

, This is only necessary if you got any wax or fingerprints on the rhinestones. Gently wipe them down with a soft cotton or microfiber cloth until the residue is gone., Some of the rhinestones may eventually fall off, especially if they are in an area that bends a lot (such as rubber toe caps on canvas sneakers or straps on a pair of flip flops). Even through the adhesive you used is very strong, avoid getting the shoes wet. This will help them last even longer."

If you want a pair with polka dots, then look for some polka dot ballet flats. Before you get started, you will need:a pair of ballet flats in the style and color of your choice
leather or faux leather fabric (in a color that matches the ballet flats)
scissors
ruler
fabric glue
10 binder clips
leather cord (in a color that matches the ballet flats);
, Use your ruler to measure out 10 strips of your leather or faux leather measuring 1 centimeter (0.39 in) by 3cm each. You can use a marker or pen to mark on the back side of the material. Then, cut out the strips.








Keep in mind that leather will not fray, so you do not need to worry about the raw edges.If you are using leather, then make sure that the leather you use is thin enough to bend into loops. Also keep in mind that leather thickness is measured in ounces. For best results, choose a piece of leather that is no more than 3oz. thick., Next, fold over one of the strips so that the two short ends are lined up and the leather forms a loop. Apply some fabric glue between the two ends, but make sure to leave enough space for the cord or ribbon to pass through. Then, clamp a binder clip over the ends of the leather to help the ends bond tightly.








Follow the same process for the rest of your leather strips. When you are done, you should have 10 loops.
Let the glue dry completely. Since you do not need a lot of glue to secure each of the loops, they should be dry in about an hour. However, you may want to leave the loops for a few hours to ensure that they are totally dry.
If you want, you could even make loops out of a special ribbon or out of some colorful shoelaces. Some people have even skipped the loop step altogether and used a leather hole punch to punch holes in the ballet flats., After the loops have dried, you will need to glue them onto the inside of your ballet flats. Apply a generous dab of fabric glue to the inside of the shoe and clamp each of the loops onto the shoe with a binder clip.








Start by gluing one loop to the inside of one of the ballet flats. Position the loop so that it is centered near the toes.
Attach your next two loops slightly higher up on the inside of the shoe so that they are opposite each other, but still somewhat near to the toes.
Then, attach your final two loops for the first shoe. These loops should be positioned so that they will be just in front of the ankle, similar to how laces are placed on sneakers.
Attach the loops in the same places for your other shoe. Use the position of your loops on the first shoe as a guide to help you position the loops on the second shoe.
Allow the glue to dry completely on both shoes. Leave them to dry overnight if possible.

, Take your leather cord or ribbon and cut it in half so that you have two pieces of the same length. After the glue has dried, start threading your leather cord or ribbon through the loops.








Begin with the loop near the toes and make sure that there is an equal amount of cord or ribbon on both sides.
Then, thread the cord or ribbon through the next two loops.
Criss-cross the cord or ribbon and then thread the cord or ribbon through the final two loops.
Repeat the same threading process with the other pair.
You will have enough excess cord or ribbon to wrap the pieces around your ankles a couple of times. Then, tie the cord or ribbon in a bow to secure them.

, Adding a back flap is optional, but the result is a slightly more dramatic, intricate shoe. If you want to amp up the drama of your ballet flats, then you will need a few extra items. You will need:template for the back flapanother piece of leather or faux leather
a permanent marker in the same color as your leather.

, Cut out the paper template and then use it to trace the shape onto your leather or faux leather. You will need to have two of these flaps, so trace the design twice. Then, cut out the shapes.








The cut edges of leather will not fray, so you do not need to hem the sides.If you are using a non-leather material, then you may want to check to see if the edges fray when you cut them. If they do fray, then you will also need to fold over the sides and glue them. If the edges fray, then fold over the sides and glue them before you create the loop in the top if the flap.

, The top part of the flap is a little wider than the bottom part. You will need to create a loop at the top of the flap so that you can thread your leather cord or ribbon through this space.








Fold the top part of one of the leather flaps and apply a generous amount of fabric glue to the flap. Make sure that you are leaving a wide enough space for the cord or ribbon to pass through.
Secure each of the flap sides with a binder clip. Do not use pins to hold the leather in place. Pins will leave permanent holes in your leather.Let the glue dry completely. It might take a few hours for your glue to dry, depending on how much glue you apply. You can let it dry overnight if you want to be totally sure that it is dry.
Repeat the same process for the other flap.

, The sides of the leather piece will likely be much lighter than the front side of the leather. To blend the colors, you can color in the sides of the leather with a matching permanent marker.








For example, if the leather you are using is dyed black, then the side edges may look tan. You can use a black permanent marker to color over the tan edges.

, Next, you will need to secure the flaps to the heels of your shoes. Apply fabric glue to the lower part of the flaps and press the flaps onto the heels of your shoes.








Allow the glue to dry completely before you do anything else. Since this part cannot be clamped down and you are gluing over a larger area, you may want to let the glue dry overnight or even for 24 hours.

, After the flaps have dried, take the end of one piece of cord or ribbon and start to thread it through one side of the flap until it comes out on the other side. Then pull the rest of the cord or ribbon through.








Thread the other piece of cord or ribbon through the opposite end of the flap loop.
After you have pulled the cord or ribbon through both sides, you should still be able to wrap the cord or ribbon around your ankles a few times. The cord or ribbon will just be higher up than it would be without the flaps. Tie the ends in a bow to secure them.

",How to Make Glitter Shoes," The first step of this project is to find the perfect pair of shoes. Since this is a craft project, you probably don't want to spend big bucks on a brand new pair that you'll be covering in glitter anyway.


The best shoes for this project are an old, comfy pair. If you don't have anything suitable, look in Goodwill or other second hand stores for shoes in your size.
The color doesn't matter in the slightest -- once the shoes are covered in glitter you won't be able to see the original color.
Plain high-heeled pumps or ballet flats are the best style of shoe for this project, as they are easy to cover in glitter. Anything with laces or straps will involve more work, and the glitter will wear away much faster.;
, The type of glitter you choose will define your finished product. It is important that you choose a super fine glitter, rather than a chunky glitter. Many people recommend the Martha Stewart brand of glitter, but any super fine glitter will do.Super fine glitter will produce a much smoother, more even finish, whereas chunky glitter will result in a goopy, uneven mess.
Any color glitter will work -- you can either do your shoes in one solid color, tape off patches of the shoes and use different colors on different parts, or mix different glitters together to produce a rainbow effect -- it's up to you!
If you are making the glitter shoes to match a particular outfit, make sure to bring the outfit with you while craft shopping to get an exact color match.

, Even more so than the shoes and the glitter, the type of glue you use will be the most important aspect of making successful glitter shoes. A good glue will dry smooth and even and keep the glitter firmly attached to your shoes.


Mod Podge is the best glue for the job, as it is a glue, sealer and finish all in one! Choose either the matte or gloss finish, either will work just fine.If you can't get your hands on Mod Podge, all-purpose Elmer's Glue is a good alternative, in addition to Martha Stewart's glitter glue. If all else fails, a good fabric glue will do the trick.

, Along with the above-mentioned essentials, you will need a number of additional tools in order to make your glitter shoes.


Take an old newspaper that you can lay on your work space. This is absolutely necessary, unless you're okay with getting glitter everywhere.
Grab a plastic cup or bowl for the glitter and glue, plus a plastic spoon or wooden stick to mix the two.
Get a couple of fine-bristled paint-brushes -- one for applying the glitter-glue and one for applying the final top coat of glue.
Find some masking tape or painter's tape which you can use to protect the soles of your shoes from becoming covered in glitter.

, Before you begin, it's a good idea to make sure that the shoes are completely clean, as you don't want any dirt to get trapped beneath the glitter. This is especially important if you are using an old or second-hand pair of shoes. Clean thoroughly with a shoe brush or some paper towel and water, and allow to dry thoroughly before proceeding.








, Though it may be tempting to skip this step in order to save time, it is highly recommended that you cover the soles of your shoes in masking tape.









No matter how careful you are, glittery glue will find its way onto the soles and once you start wearing the shoes you'll leave a trail of glitter wherever your go.
Cover the soles of your shoes in strips of masking or painter's tape, trimming off the excess around the edges. If you're using high heels, remember to tape off the small section at the bottom of the heel!
You may also want to stuff the insides of your shoes with newspaper or plastic bags to prevent the glitter glue from finding its way in there too.

, Now the fun begins! Pour the Mod Podge (or whatever glue you're using) into a plastic bowl or cup, then add the glitter and mix well. The mixture should be about two parts glue to one part glitter. The consistency should be pretty thick and paste-like.









It's important to get the consistency right -- if the there's too much glue, you'll need to use a ton of layers to cover the shoes in glitter, if there's too much glitter, you'll get a clumpy finish.

, Dip one of the fine-bristled paintbrushes in the glittery glue and start applying the first layer to your shoes. Try not to make it too thick -- it's much better to do multiple light layers than a single thick layer.









Don't panic if the glue looks white as you paint it on, it will turn clear as it dries.Once you have covered both shoes in an even layer of glitter glue, set them aside to dry, somewhere where they won't be disturbed by curious pets or children!
You should also cover the glue and glitter mixture with some plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.

, Once the first coat of glitter is dry, you can apply a second, and then a third layer of glitter (waiting for the shoes to dry between coats).









If you like, you can sprinkle a little additional loose glitter over the shoes while the glue is still wet. This will give the shoes some extra sparkle and a slight 3D effect!
After the third layer of glitter glue the shoes should be covered evenly in glitter, with none of the original color peeking through.
However, if there are any patches, you can do as many additional layers as needed to cover them up.

, Once the last layer has dried, you will need to apply a final coat of plain glue to seal in the glitter and prevent it from shedding.









Pour some fresh Mod Podge into a clean plastic bowl or cup and use the second paintbrush to apply a light, even layer to the surface of the shoes.
Alternatively, you can spritz the shoes with an acrylic or polyurethane spray. This will also effectively seal in the glitter.

, After the final coating of glue or spray, place the shoes in a well-ventilated space to dry out completely. Leaving them overnight should do the trick. Make sure that they will remain undisturbed, away from little hands or paws.

, If you like, you can add some additional details to the shoes, such as sequins or bows or heart-shaped shoe clips, using hot glue. Just keep in mind that these shoes are pretty glam-tastic already, so you don't want to go overboard!








, Now that your glitter shoes are complete, all that's left to do is remove the masking tape from the soles and give those babies a spin on the dance floor. Don't forget to click your heels!

Gather your supplies.,
Choose your chiffon or fabric flowers.,
Cut the flowers out of the fabric netting.,
Arrange the flowers how you like on the table first.,
Cut circles out of felt that are a little bit smaller than the flowers and set them aside.,
Start gluing the flowers down onto the straps.,
Take a felt circle and draw a spiral of fabric glue onto the back.,
Place the felt circle against the back of the flower.,
Glue the rest of the felt circles against the backs of the flowers.,
Allow the glue to dry and cure completely before you were the shoes.",How to Customize Your Shoes5," This method is a simple way to dress up a plain pair of flip flops or dress sandals. Here's a list of what you will need:Flip flops or sandals
1 – 1 ½ inch (2.54 – 3.81 centimeter) wide chiffon/fabric flowers
Felt (matching flower color)
Scissors
Fabric glue

, You can find them in fabric stores, usually in the ribbons and trims section, or on bolts of fabric in the special occasion fabrics section. They will usually come on some fabric netting. You want them to be between 1 – 1 ½ inch (2.54 – 3.81 centimeter) wide. If you have very small shoes or feet, you might want to go for something even smaller. You can also include one or two larger flowers to use as a focal point.

The more delicate your flowers look, the better.
If you aren't certain what color to choose, get a color that already matches your flip flops or sandals. You can also go with a contrasting color.
Do not use fake flowers that come on a stem for this project. Not only will the stem poke you in the foot, but the flowers will look cheap and unprofessional.

, You may notice that the flowers have been stitched onto the netting. You will need to cut them out. This way, you can rearrange them as you like. Try to cut the flowers as close to the base as possible so that, when you look down at the flowers, you do not see any of the netting. Be careful not to cut this thread, or the flowers may fall apart.

If you accidentally snip a thread, then glue it to the back of the flower with a small drop of glue.

, This will allow you to experiment with different designs before you glue them down onto the straps. Once you glue the flowers down, you don't be able to take them off without ruining them (and possibly your shoes too). Whatever design you choose, make sure that it will fit on the straps. Here are some design ideas:

Place the larger flowers towards the center, and the smaller towards the ends.
If you are decorating a flip flop, consider placing the larger flowers on the outside strap and the smaller flowers on the inside strap.
Alternate the flower colors or shades. For example, you can alternate between white and teal. You can also alternate between light pink and dark pink.
If you are decorating a pair of sandals, you may have two straps: an ankle strap and a wide strap that goes across your toes. Consider placing the flowers on the toe strap and leaving the ankle strap untouched.
If you are decorating a sandal that has a T strap, then put the flowers only on the vertical strap; leave the ankle straps untouched.

, You will be using the felt circles later. Try to choose a color that closely matches the color of the flowers. If you are having troubles getting the shape or size right, trace the flowers onto the felt using a pen first, then cut a little bit inside the lines.

If you are gluing flowers to a T strap, consider cutting out a felt rectangle that is just a little bit wider than the vertical strap.

, Put the fabric glue onto the straps first. The flowers are likely going to be a little bit wider than the straps. If you put the glue onto the flowers first, you might end up putting on too much glue., You will be working with one felt circle at a time so that the glue does not dry out., You will be sandwiching the strap between the flower and the felt circle. Use your fingers to press the sides of the circle to the sides of the flower., The felt circles will help hold the flowers to the strap. They will also hide the glue and make the back of the flowers less scratchy., Just because the glue feels dry does not necessarily mean that it is fully cured. If you wear the shoes too soon, they glue may not hold, and the flowers may fall off. Refer to the label on your glue bottle for precise drying and curing times. Every brand of glue is different. Your shoes may be ready to wear in as little as two hours. They may also require a full day to dry."

Count the number of eyelet pairs on your shoe.,
Insert each end of the shoelace downward through one of the bottom two eyelets.,
Feed the right lace underneath the shoe so that it pops out of the second eyelet on the right side.,
Feed the left lace underneath the shoe.,
Cross the right lace over to the left side and insert it downward through the second eyelet.,
Cross the lace emerging from the third eyelet to the right side.,
Continue repeating this pattern.",How to Lace Vans Shoes1," Vans with an even number of eyelets can be cross-laced. if your shoes have an odd number, the basic principle will still apply but you will have to adjust your technique somewhat.






;
, The shoelace should now form a bar across the bottom with the laces going inwards. Keep the left lace on the left side and the right lace on the right side.








, Hiding the inner lacing is what gives this technique its unique look.









Whether you go by your right or the shoe’s right doesn’t matter. Make sure you stay consistent and the end result will be the same.

, It should pop up out of the third eyelet on the left side. You should now have an empty eyelet on the left side between the original bar and the emerging lace.








, You should now have two bars in your lacing and both laces should be on the left side.








, Insert it downwards through the third eyelet. You should now have three bars in your lacing and each lace should be on a different side of the shoe.








, Feed the left lace underneath the shoe so that it pops up out of the fifth eyelet on the left side. Then, feed the right lace underneath the shoe so that it pops up out of the sixth eyelet on the right side. Cross each lace over to the corresponding eyelet on the other side to form new bars.









If your shoes have more than six eyelet pairs, repeat as necessary, continuing to reverse sides after every two bars are completed.

Gather your supplies.,
Plan out your design.,
Consider copying your design onto your sneakers using a pencil.,
Pour some bleach into a bowl and get out a cheap, thin paint brush.,
Start drawing your design onto your shoes.,
Consider rinsing the shoes once you are happy with the lightness.",How to Bleach Colored Canvas Shoes5," You don't have to bleach your shoes all the way; you can paint or draw designs onto them as well. Here's a list of what you will need:Canvas sneakers
Bowl
Bleach
Small, cheap, stiff-bristled paintbrush
Bleach pen (optional)

, Once you start drawing on your shoes, it will be impossible to erase the bleach. Get out a piece of paper and a pen or pencil, and sketch out your design.

, This will allow you to see where you are drawing and keep you from making mistakes.

, Make sure that the bristles are stiff and made of plastic. If the bristles are too soft, they won't hold the bleach. If they are made of natural fibers, such as boar bristle, sable, or camel hair, the bleach will eat through them.You can also use a bleach pen, although some people find those difficult to control. Consider testing the bleach pen out on some scrap fabric first.

, The bleach won't work at first, but after a while, you should see the colors start to fade. It will take about an hour or so.


Keep in mind that some designs won't fade completely to white. If you want really white designs, you may want to try drawing them with a white, opaque fabric pen instead.

, This will stop the bleach from acting, and prevent it from deteriorating the fabric.

Insert each end of the shoelace downward through the bottom eyelets.,
Cross the right lace over to the left side.,
Cross the left lace over to the right side.,
Continue lacing in this pattern.",How to Lace Vans Shoes2," Push both ends of the shoelaces through the eyelets closest to the toe of the sneaker. The shoelace should now form a bar across the bottom with the laces going inwards. Pull the ends of the laces up over the bar and then downward toward the toe.








, Insert it down through the second eyelet going up the shoe. The right lace should now be crossing the tongue of the shoe with left lace emerging from between the bar and the cross-lace. Pull the crossed lace to the left (away from the shoe) to get it out of the way.









It's usually easiest to do this with the shoes off and the sneaker facing you. Whether you go by your right or the shoe’s right doesn’t matter. Just stay consistent and the end result will be the same.

, Insert it downward through the second eyelet up on that side, just as you did on the other side. You should now have a bar and two cross-laces in your lacing. Pull the newly-crossed lace to the right (away from the shoe) to get it out of the way.








, Start by crossing the lace on the right-hand side over to the left side and downward through the eyelet, making sure that the other lace now emerges from between two crossings. Pull the newly-crossed lace to the left to get it out of the way, then cross the left lace over to the right side. Repeat until the shoe is completely laced.









Lacing the shoes this way ensures that cross-laces going in one direction always dominate the cross-laces going in the other. When the time comes to lace your other shoe, be sure to reverse the process so that your laces mirror each other.

Keep your shoelaces from twisting.,
Take your shoes off and turn them to face you.,
Use thick white laces.,
Change your laces regularly.,
Change up the way you lace your shoes.",How to Lace Vans Shoes3," The straight, flat-laced look is classic Vans, so don’t let your laces get sloppy or it won't look right. If you want your vans to look crisp and new, keep the laces as straight as possible.









Every time you pull your laces through the eyelets, make sure to flatten them out and keep them from twisting up. Go slowly.
Don't over-tighten the laces, which can cause them to bunch up and look uneven, if they're actually pretty straight.

, It's a lot easier to lace up your sneakers when they're on the ground, with the toe facing you, instead of the other way around. If you want them to look right, take them off and turn them around.








, Vans white laces are usually the best laces for Vans, but any variety of white sneaker lace would be fine. In general, skate laces are pretty puffy and white, whereas some basketball laces can be really thin and cylindrical, or other sneaker laces can be kind of lighter.









You can use any color, of course, but new white laces are the most commonly associated with Vans.

, Having a fresh set of laces always looks cool. It's a good idea to change your laces every couple of weeks, especially if you're skating regularly and breaking laces, or scuffing them up.








, To get the most life out of your shoes, it's a good idea to alternate between the styles you use when you lace your shoes, so that they won't wear from repeated lacings.









If you bar-lace your shoes, cross-lace them every now and then to keep them looking new
If you cross-laces your Vans, change the direction of the crosses, so that the right side isn't always over the left, or vice versa. This will help to keep the shoes from wearing unevenly.

Start with clean sneakers.,
Cover work area with the drop cloth or newspaper.,
Prepare fabric dye as directed by the manufacturer.,
Smear petroleum jelly all over the rubber soles of the shoes.,
Dip shoes into dye.,
Rub dyed shoes with the cloth, dragging the dye backwards, towards the heel.,
Allow shoes to completely dry before re-lacing the sneakers and wearing.

",How to Create Faded Dyed Sneakers," The best way to achieve the faded dye look is to ensure your shoes are completely clean and are completely made of fabric. If you have faux (or real) leather running across any part of the shoe the project won’t work very well.


Remove the laces from the shoes and put aside (unless you plan to dye the laces the same color as the sneakers).





;
, Make sure the entire work area is protected because if the dye splashes or gets on the floor or countertop it will most likely stain.


Consider wearing old clothing or a smock/apron to avoid ruining your clothing.

, You can mix the dye either in an empty bucket or the sink (however the dye may stain the sink so using a bucket is recommended).

, Add jelly to the sides too if they are rubber to avoid having the dye leak onto that area.

, Hold one shoe in each hand and make sure shoes are lined up completely (so the toes and heels are lined up together).


Dip shoes up to where the lace holes begin (so just the top portion of the shoes) and remove from the dye.






Hold shoes in the dye for a few seconds and check to determine if you’ve achieved the color you desire.







, Begin at the top of the shoe and drag the cloth backward, pressing down into the shoe. You should see the dye follow in long streaks, beginning with a more vibrant color and then fading as you draw toward the back of the shoe.


Work quickly before the dye dries.
Consider asking a friend to help and you can each work on one shoe.

Cut off two small pieces of tape.,
Place the tape on the corners of your eyes.,
Draw your eyeliner wings.,
Remove the tape gently.",How to Make Eyeliner Wings Even1," You can use household Scotch tape, or you can use surgical tape if your skin is a bit more sensitive. You will need one small piece for each eye. Fold one corner of the tape down, so that it creates a little flap that will make it easier to peel the tape off of your skin., The tape will go at an angle on each side of the eye, diagonal from the cheek to the temple. The tape should be placed where you want your eyeliner wings to go. To determine where that should be, imagine two lines extending from the corners of your nose up to the corners of your eyes. The tape should follow that trajectory.








If you are unsure where the tape needs to go, grab an eyeliner pencil or a long straight edge and hold it from the side of your nostril to the corner of your eye. That is the line that the tape should line up with.
Press the tape onto your skin firmly enough that no makeup product can get underneath it.

, Once you are happy with the tape placement, grab your liquid or gel eyeliner. Using a tiny eyeliner brush, paint the product along the edge of the tape. The tape will ensure that the line of the wing is perfectly straight, and also guarantee that your wings are even on both sides.







, Once you’ve created your wings, gently peel away the tape. You should be left with two even eyeliner wings with crisp, straight edges where the tape was. If necessary, you can use your small eyeliner brush to add product anywhere necessary.

Buy some activated charcoal.,
Break a few capsules into a small container.,
Dip your eyeliner brush into the charcoal.,
Experiment with different textures.",How to Make Eyeliner1," Activated charcoal is available at drug stores and natural health stores. It's commonly used as a remedy for indigestion, so it usually comes in the form of capsules. This pure black, all-natural substance is perfect for creating homemade eyeliner.This is not the same as the type of charcoal you burn to cook food on the grill. Look for a jar of capsules labeled ""activated charcoal"" in the vitamin section of the store.
If you can't find activated charcoal locally, it's available for purchase online. One bottle provides enough charcoal to make many year's worth of eyeliner.;
, You can use an old eye shadow or lip balm pot, a tiny tin, or any other container you have on hand. Break the activated charcoal capsules into the container.

, You can use plain activated charcoal as eyeliner without mixing it with anything else. The charcoal will naturally mix with the oil on your skin to stay in place once you apply it. Dip your eyeliner brush into the container and apply eyeliner in your favorite style.

, If you like your eyeliner to have more of a paste or gel consistency, you can mix the activated charcoal with water or oil to make it a little damp. Start with just one or two drops, and keep mixing more in until your eyeliner reaches the consistency you want. Try mixing in one of the following ingredients:


Water
Jojoba oil
Almond oil
Coconut oil
Aloe vera gel

Ask a friend what she thinks!",How to Find Eyeliner That Suits You," Before you start looking for the best brands, you should take a moment to figure out what kind of look you're trying to go for. Are you aiming for something casual and innocuous, or a bold visual statement? You should keep your intent at the front of your mind when you are choosing your eyeliner. Don't just think about how it looks, but also what that particular shade or technique is meant to convey. Having a strong idea what you want to do will take guesswork out of the equation further down the road.;
, Taking a look at your place and giving it an objective analysis can be incredibly helpful when it comes to choosing cosmetics, as it lends a more specific insight into what traits should be emphasized or evened out. There are several dimensions that factor into the right type and style. The most important of these factors are the shape and size of your eyes. Some traits relate to the type of eyeliner, while others will have an effect on the way you put it on.


To get a grasp of your eyes' relative size, judge them in rough proportion to your other facial features, such as the nose or forehead.
If you have smaller eyes, you'll want to aim to brighten your eyes with light shades and only use dark liner on the outer corners of your eyes. If you have big eyes, you'll want to emphasize that fact by hugging the upper contour of your eye with a dark liner.

, If you're trying to figure out whether you have round, or thinner almond eyes, check to see if you can see visible whites above or below your iris whilst assuming a normal facial expression. If you can, you have relatively round eyes. If you don't, they're considered almond eyes. Simple enough? While neither type is necessarily better than the other, they do favour different cosmetic approaches.


Almond eyes favour strongly favour makeup that highlights their distinctive shape, so lining the top and bottom contours of your eyes is recommended if your eyes fit that bill. If your eyes are rounder, you should try adding length by adding liner wings or 'cat's eye' makeup.

, While there is no single set answer for each shade of eye, you should keep in mind the likely effect eye colour/liner combinations will have on your appearance. Choosing an eyeliner that contrasts your natural eye colour, for example, serves to emphasize that colour. Keep that in mind when you're looking for a certain shade of eyeliner; having a rudimentary knowledge of the way colours intermingle will help you figure out what liner will look best on you. If you have brown eyes, choosing a lighter shade of brown eyeliner will help to emphasize the lighter shades in your eyes.

Blue eyes combine well with gold and rusty-coloured eyeliners.

Green eyes, on the other hand, work well great with reddish tones. If you're feeling creative, you might want to throw another dimension into this by experimenting with different-coloured contact lenses!

, While the colour of eyeliner should hinge on the colour of one's eyes, a lot of the eye size and shape-specific effects you're looking to get from eyeliner are based in the product's application, less so the product itself. However, you'll want to purchase a brand that is reputable, and preferably cruelty-free. This means steering clear of dollar store cosmetics, and going to a department store, specialty boutique, or shopping online instead.


While this might cost you something more, the difference between quality and 'budget' eyeliners are night and day, and you shouldn't think of buying a low-grade product that will have such frequent contact with your skin anyway.
If you've got an adventurous personality, don't be afraid to pick up some liners in bold and surprising colours! While the standard black and brown liners should absolutely be a part of your makeup arsenal, you can make a memorable statement by highlighting your eye with a colour people aren't expecting.

, Most department store beauty sections will have employees who are specialized in the choosing and application of cosmetic products. If you're still having any difficulty in deciding what might work for you, it is recommended you seek one of them out and ask for help in choosing the right eyeliner.


Make sure to let the specialist know what general style you're going after; that way, she'll be able to give you more accurate suggestions.

, Once you have a decent set of makeup and eyeliner, stand in front of the bathroom mirror and decide how you'd like to use it to accentuate your eyes. This is different from your initial brainstorming, as you'll be thinking of practical ways you can put your new tools to the best effect. As a general rule, you want to balance out your features as much as possible, and exercise moderation in highlighting features that are already prominent.


Whether you have large or small eyes, wide or almond-shaped, there will be particular techniques that favour your shape, and others which probably won't yield as desirable a result.
While some techniques are safer bets than others, part of the fun of makeup is trying new things, so if you think of something that goes against popular recommendation, feel free to try it out. If it doesn't turn out the way you imagined it, you can always wash it off!

, One crucial part of mastering makeup is knowing which looks work for certain situations. You wouldn't want to dress for the red carpet going to the mall or the grocery store, and the same works vice versa. Generally speaking, for more glamorous or exciting situations, you should draw on your liner thicker. Likewise, you should keep it subtle for stay-in occasions.


If you're having any trouble deciding how much is enough for certain situations, keep your eye out for others' makeup at certain events; what is the common extent at a night club? How about a library? It's recommended to fall back on popular trends if you have any doubt. From there, you can eventually springboard into your own style.

, Winged liner is a very popular technique, as it adds length and distinction to the contour of your eyes. Most important, possibly, is the fact that the winged technique may apply to an extensive variety of eye shapes and sizes. While adding a subtle accent to the outer ends of your eyes is appropriate to virtually every kid of eye, how far you go with it depends on the shape and placement of the eyes.


Although it's known for its versatility, winged liner is most recommended for round eyes, as it will add length to their appearance. Narrower eyes may still benefit from wings, so long as they're left very subtle.

, If you're looking for your eyes to 'pop out', drawing a thin line along the bottom of your eye to complement the top will emphasize your eyes' natural shape. This is particularly recommended if you have almond eyes. However, you might want to avoid this technique if your eyes are on the small side; because a double line will make them smaller than they really are. , White eyeliners are interesting because they make your eyes look more awake. Although they don't make them look wider per se, smaller eyes benefit from the rejuvenating effect this technique will have on your look. Either try drawing a thin line along the top of your eye, or smudge it behind a black one. Either way, regardless of your eye shape, this is a great trick if you're going for a livelier look. , Once you have perfected your masterpiece, the last thing you want is to have it smudge or mess later on. The best way to avoid this is to dab over your liner with an eyeshadow that matches your skin tone. Doing this simple step will save you a lot of trouble further down the road, so even if the extra step means more work, it's well worth your time. , What do you think of the effect the eyeliner brings out in your face? Does it suit the situation you were planning for? More importantly, does it emphasize the right characteristics in your eyes? If the result isn't up to your standard, you can always rub it off and try again. Even if you are okay with it, you can always pick out way you might improve for next time!

, Don't feel self-conscious about asking a friend what they think of your eyeliner; many of your friends have probably faced similar issues, and some may have even invented methods of their own they'll be all too happy to share with you. Friends are a notably underrated source of insight when it comes to makeup, so make the most of their knowledge.


If you can think of a friend with a similar shape and colour to their eyes, they might be best to ask for advice. Bonus points if you think they have a good fashion sense!

Find an eyeshadow in a neutral color.,
Create an outline of your wing with your shadow.,
Trace your shadow with eyeliner.",How to Make Eyeliner Wings Even2," This technique works best if you choose an eyeshadow in the same color as the eyeliner you plan to use for the wings. Otherwise, any neutral color like gray, black, or brown will work for this. Ditch your regular eyeshadow brush, and grab an eyeliner brush., Using the eyeliner brush, flick the powder from the outer corner of your eye upwards. To make sure that both wings extend along the same angle, follow the angle of your bottom lash line. In other words, imagine your lash line continued outside the outer corner of your eye. Draw your shadow along that imaginary line, and ensure that they look even.This is a perfect trick for beginners, because eyeshadow is easier to remove from skin than liquid or gel eyeliner. You can easily erase your eyeshadow wing if you’re unhappy with it, and simply start over.

, Once you're satisfied with your eyeliner wing, trace over it with your liquid or gel eyeliner of choice. This step is much less scary if you have a pre-approved shadow outline to trace. Fill in the wing with your eyeliner, and make sure once again that everything looks even.The shadow will also act as a primer of sorts, giving your eyeliner something to adhere to and ensuring it stays in place all day.

Place dots where your eyeliner wing should end.,
Ensure your dots are even.,
Apply your eyeliner from the points inward.",How to Make Eyeliner Wings Even3," Most people have an idea about where exactly the wings should extend to on either side, but then they get the eyeliner brush in their hands and that plan goes out the window. Instead, work backwards and place the point of the eyeliner first, before attempting to draw any sort of line., Once you’ve placed dots on either side of your eyes where you want the wings to extend to, look straight ahead in the mirror. Double-check that the dots are symmetrical and at the same distance from the outer corners of the eyes. If the points are symmetrical, the wings will be even., Once you’ve ensured that the dots are evenly placed, you can use your liquid or gel eyeliner to create the wing. Start at the points and move inwards to the outer corners of your eyes. With a defined point already created, the guesswork has been taken care of. Connecting those dots to the corners of your eyes is the easy part!"

Use concealer to even out eyeliner wings.,
Perfect your wings with makeup remover.,
Smudge your liner.",How to Make Eyeliner Wings Even4," It’s a major bummer when you use one of these techniques to create beautiful winged eyeliner, only to examine them in the mirror and notice a small flaw. If you don’t want to remove your eyeliner and start over, you can use foundation instead. Using a clean eyeliner brush, crisp up the borders of your winged liner. With this technique, you can conceal any jagged edges or overly thick lines., This step can be tricky for beginners, but done correctly and it can improve your winged eyeliner game immensely. Imagine that you’ve created wings on both sides of your eyes only to discover that one line is a bit thicker than the other, or extends a bit too far out from the eye. Dip a small Q-tip into makeup remover, and carefully erase any extra eyeliner. Once you’ve removed a bit of liner, check again to see if your wings are even.








You can do a quick stroke along the side of your wing to thin out the line, or you can carefully shorten your wing as well.
Once you’ve removed the “wonky” parts of the wing, you may need to grab your eyeliner and perfect it a bit more.

, This is a perfect tip for anyone in a hurry, with no time to sit in front of the mirror drawing and redrawing their winged eyeliner. If you’ve drawn your wings and they’re a bit uneven or shaky, grab an eyeliner brush and smudge them out a bit. Instead of adding more product, you can drag the product you’ve already placed, adjusting the sides to make them even or smoothing jagged skinny lines into thicker wings. You may not get the super skinny wings you were originally going for, but at least they’ll be even!Ariana Grande rocks the thick eyeliner wings, so you can always say that’s what you were going for as well.

Put on some eyeshadow, starting at the lash line and going all the way up to the crease.,
Find the right angle for your wing.,
Make a dot to indicate the tip of your wing on each eye.,
Draw a line connecting the dot to the outer corner of your eye.,
Draw another line connecting the dot to the middle of your upper lash line.,
Fill in the outline you have made, if necessary.,
Clean up any mistakes with a pointed Q-tip.,
Draw a thin line along your upper lash line, beginning at the inside corner of your eye, near your tear duct.Try your best to do this in a single, fluid motion, otherwise the line may look jerky and uneven.Again, avoid pulling on your eyelid.,
Thicken the line as it gets closer toward the outer corner of your eye.,
Finish with mascara.",How to Make Cat Eyes With Eyeliner1," The eyeshadow will prime your lid and allow for a smoother application of eyeliner. It will also give the eyeliner something to cling to, so it will stay put and won't smudge or rub off.








Because cat eyes are so dramatic, darker eyeshadow colors can look overdone. Instead, consider using a color that matches your skin tone—or is slightly lighter.
Don't use a cream eyeshadow—the eyeliner won't stick and could easily wipe off.;
, Hold a brush against the side of your nose and angle it until it points to the end of your eyebrow—this is the line you want your wing to follow.You want your wings to be as identical as possible—different lengths, widths, and angles will look off.Another way to look at it is that the wing is an extension of your lower lash line. Let the flick follow the angle of that line and your wings should be symmetrical.If your eyelids are hooded, make the angle less upward and more straight. This will extend your lash line and open up your eyes., The higher you make your dot, the thicker and more dramatic your cat eye will be. Make sure the dots are at the same angle and height on both eyes before moving on.It's much easier to erase a dot and move it than an erasing entire wing.








, Don't pull on your skin while drawing the wing. Though it might make it easier to draw on your skin, when you release the skin and it goes back to normal, the wing will look completely different and probably pretty sloppy. Instead, tilt your head back slightly and lower your gaze so that you can see your lash line. This way you can see exactly what you are doing and how your wing will look when you are finished.







, If you have a round eye, try a thicker wing and line.If you want to extend your lash line and make your eyes look bigger, draw a curved line instead of a straight one. Make sure that the line is curving downwards.







, Depending on how you angled your initial lines, and how thick you drew them, you may or may not need to fill the outline in.








, The pointed tip will allow you to get into corners and clean along lines without accidentally smudging the eyeliner.You can also dip the Q-tip in primer or eye cream and use that to gently remove any excess eyeliner.









Avoid using makeup remover. It might do the job too well and remove any eyeshadow that you put on earlier., Instead, tilt your head back slightly and lower your gaze so that you can see your lash line.









You can try tightlining your eyelid, which means you get the liner between your lashes and up against your waterline, but this can be difficult to do and may irritate your eye.

, Try resting your pinkie on your cheekbone while you do this. It will stabilize your hand and make it easier to get a smooth, straight line instead of a shaky one.








If you are using a felt-tip liner, hold it closer to the middle of the tube so you have more control., You want a few layers on the top lashes and a single layer on your bottom lashes. For a glamorous, evening look, consider curling your lashes or popping on a pair of false lashes.

Gather supplies.,
Hold the almond in the tweezers and burn it.,
Scrape the soot into the dish.,
Dip your eyeliner brush into the almond soot.,
Experiment with different textures.",How to Make Eyeliner2," This method is a great alternative if you don't have activated charcoal on hand. The soot from a burned almond creates a rich, black liner that looks just as good as store-bought liner. All you need are a few household supplies:


A raw almond that has not been roasted or salted
A pair of tweezers
A lighter
A small container or dish
Butter knife

, Use the tweezers to hold the almond steady (and protect your fingers from getting burned) and hold the lighter up to the almond. The almond will slowly burn and smoke. Keep going until about half of the almond has turned to soot. It should be black and smoky.If the tweezers you're using are all-metal, they may heat up and burn you if you use the lighter for too much time. Put on a glove to protect your hand.
Try rotating the almond in a circle so it burns evenly on all sides.

, All that nice black soot is what you need to create eyeliner. Use a butter knife to scrape it off the almond and into the dish. If you need more soot, keep burning the almond or start on another so you collect a good heap of it in the dish.


As you scrape, make sure not to scrape off chunks of unburned almond. You want the soot to have a fine, dusty texture, with no big pieces.
Examine the soot afterward and pick out any larger chunks.

, You can use plain soot as eyeliner without mixing it with anything else. It will naturally mix with the oil on your skin to stay in place once you apply it. Dip your eyeliner brush into the container and apply eyeliner in your favorite style.

, If you like your eyeliner to have more of a paste or gel consistency, you can mix the soot with water or oil to make it a little damp. Start with just one or two drops, and keep mixing more in until your eyeliner reaches the consistency you want. Try mixing in one of the following ingredients:


Water
Jojoba oil
Almond oil
Coconut oil

Use cocoa to make brown eyeliner.,
Try spirulina powder to make green eyeliner.,
Use beetroot powder for reddish hues.,
Buy mica powder to make colorful eyeliner.,
Convert old eye shadows into any color liner.",How to Make Eyeliner3," Unsweetened cocoa powder makes a beautifully rich, dark brown eyeliner. Spoon a little into a small container. Mix the cocoa with a few drops of water, jojoba oil or almond oil until it has a gel-like consistency, then apply it with your eyeliner brush.

, Spirulina powder is made from dried and ground algae, so it has a beautiful dark green hue. Pour some spirulina powder into a dish, then apply plain or mix it with water or oil to create a gel effect., While you might not want to wear bright red eyeliner, adding beetroot powder to activated charcoal or cocoa will create a pretty reddish hue that looks great with warmer skin tones. Beetroot powder is available at most health food stores.

, Mica powder comes in every color of the rainbow. It's a product used in all types of makeup, from eye shadow to lipstick. Do an online search for mica powder to find the color you like best. Use the powder the same way you'd use activated charcoal: mix it with water, aloe, or oil to create a gel you can instantly apply.

, Any eyeshadow can be converted into eyeliner. Take one of your old, cracked eyeshadows and dump it into a small container. Use a knife to break it up until it turns into a fine powder. Mix in a little water, aloe, or oil to create a gel, then apply the product with an eyeliner brush.

Put on some eyeshadow.,
Take a short piece of clear tape, and tap it onto your hand.,
Position the tape along the outer corner of your eye.,
Apply your eyeliner, but make the line thicken as it goes towards the outer corner of your eye.,
Extend the line past the corner of your eye, using the tape as a guideline.,
Carefully peel the tape off and make any touchups, if necessary.,
Finish off with mascara or false lashes.",How to Make Cat Eyes With Eyeliner2," Start at your lash line and go all the way up to the crease. The powder will smooth out your lid and help the eyeliner go on smoother. Because cat eyes are so dramatic, consider using a color that matches your skin tone instead of a darker color, which can look overdone.









Avoid using a cream-based eyeshadow. The eyeliner won't stick to that very well, and could slide right off.
Avoid putting on under-eye concealer just yet. The tape will take it off. Also, the tape may remove any eyeshadow in that area., This will make the tape less tacky and gentler on the delicate skin around your eye.







, Place the tape just beneath your lower lashes, and angle the top towards your temple. For a more dramatic look, angle the tape towards the end of your eyebrow instead. This will result in a thicker line.Be sure to press the tape against your skin. This will ensure that the eyeliner (especially liquid) will not bleed through.If your eyelids are hooded, position the tape at less of an upward angle and closer to a straight line., Don't draw past the corner or onto the tape just yet.If you are having troubles applying the eyeliner smoothly, don't tug on the outer corner of your eye. Instead, try one of the following:









Brace your pinkie finger against your cheekbone and hold the eyeliner by the middle.
Tilt your head back lightly and lower your gaze. This will allow you to see your lash line.

, Don't worry if you get some eyeliner onto the tape. Just make sure that the line gets thinner towards the end.You can make the ""flick"" as long or as short as you want. The longer it is, the more dramatic your cat eye will be.








, When you pull the tape off, you will see a nice, crisp line.If the tape removed any eyeshadow, carefully patch it up with more eyeshadow. If you usually apply any under eye concealer, you can do so now.








, Apply a few coats on your upper lashes and a single coat on your bottom lashes. For a more glamorous, evening look, curl your lashes or pop on a pair of false lashes.

Add your first flower near the center of your lash line.,
Add your second flower.,
Continue across your lash line, alternating between colors.,
Create the buds.",How to Do Floral Eyeliner1," Start at the center of your lash line. Using your first color, draw an X-shape at the center of your lash line by drawing on two lines. The ends of each line should touch your lash line. Then, add a line going straight down through the X. From there, add additional lines shooting from the center of your X until you have a flower that is as bushy and full as you want.Do not worry if this does not look flower-like yet. The flower shape will become clearer when you add the buds.
The color you choose is up to you, but go for something bright and floral like a vibrant pink or yellow.;
, Right next to your first flower, add another flower. Use the exact same process. Draw an X, then draw a horizontal line through it, and fill out the flower from there., Fill out either side of your lash line with flowers. Alternate between colors. Continue to create flowers by starting with an X and filling out the colors from there. Keep going until your entire upper lash line is covered in flowers., Take a yellow eyeliner. Place a dot in the center of each flower. This will make it clear the shapes are flowers as they will have a defined bud.It can help to use glitter yellow eyeliner. This will pop quite a bit, catching people's attention.

Place a small amount of loose eyeshadow in a container.,
Add a small dab of petroleum jelly.,
Apply the liner with a brush.",How to Make Gel Eyeliner1," To mix up your own gel liner in a hurry, find a loose eyeshadow pigment in the shade that you want to line your eyes with. Sprinkle a small amount into the lid of its container or on another flat surface that you can mix on.It’s best not to use eyeshadow pigment with glitter. The particles may fall in your eyes if you make a liner with the glitter.
If you don’t have a loose shadow pigment, you can scrape a pressed shadow with a nail file or butter knife to get some pigment to work with.;
, When you’ve got the eyeshadow pigment in ready, use a toothpick to place a small amount of petroleum jelly in the container with it. Stir the shadow and petroleum jelly together to form a colored gel.Start with an extremely small amount of petroleum jelly, and only add more if necessary. There should be more pigment than jelly.
Swipe a small bit of the gel liner onto your hand with the toothpick to test the color. If it’s not as dark or pigmented as you’d like, mix in more of the eyeshadow.

, Once you’re satisfied with the color of your gel liner, use an eyeliner brush to trace it along your lashline. Because the petroleum jelly is extremely emollient, it’s a good idea to set the gel liner with the powder eyeshadow in the same color.This gel liner isn’t particularly long-wearing and can smudge easily. It’s best used if you’re doing a grunge makeup look or a smoky eye where you won’t mind some smudging.

Opt for colorful liners.,
Add a white flower to your outer corner.,
Add two flowers branching outward.,
Work your way back in with smaller flowers.,
Add flowers all along your lash line.,
Use a brighter color to draw on colorful flowers.,
Mix your white eyeliner with your colorful eyeliner.,
Add lighter colored flowers.,
Finish up with buds.",How to Do Floral Eyeliner2," Floral eyeliner is usually made with colorful liners. Go for things like pinks, purples, greens, reds, and yellows. This will help give your dots a flowery feel.Make sure you have at least one green or yellow eyeliner. You will need these to create buds for your flowers.

, To start, you'll be creating a backdrop of white flowers. Start with a single white flower on the outer corner of your eye. To create a flower, use the tip of your eyeliner brush to draw five small dots in a circle. Leave a small hole in the center of the circle. You will fill this in later to create the bud of your flower.Do your best, but keep in mind not all your circles will be completely uniform. Just as flowers have petals of different sizes and shapes, it's okay if your circles are a little mismatched.

, Right next to your first flower, add another flower stemming away from your eye. Make this one slightly smaller by using smaller dots. Moving outward and upward slightly, make another flower with even smaller dots connected to the second one.The line the flowers follow should be similar to a cat eye you would make with a regular eyeliner look. It should be a small wing of flowers moving outward and upward slightly in a diagonal line.

, On top of your first line of flowers, draw another line of flowers. These ones should be all be slightly smaller than the first three flowers you drew. The line of flowers should lead back to your eye. It should end on the top of your lash line just near the corner of your eye.Again, your flowers may not be perfectly uniform. It can be particularly difficult to draw totally uniform flowers when you're making tiny dots, but mismatched flowers can make for a more realistic floral look.

, Draw a line of white flowers across your lash line. Draw the flowers in clusters of two, so you have two rows of white flowers running along your lash line as you go. Vary the size and shapes of the flowers to add some spontaneity to the look.Remember, you make flowers by drawing five dots in a circle.

, Take a brighter color, such as a purple or pink. Starting on the line stemming outward, draw a few flowers here and there over the white flowers. Again, make flowers by drawing circles of five dots. Have the colored flowers overlap the white flowers slightly. Continue adding colored flowers about halfway down your lash line.The number of colored flowers you want is up to you. Some people prefer only a splash of colored flowers while others like 50/50 ratio of colorful and white flowers.

, On a paper plate or similar surface, add a dab of your white eyeliner. Then, add a dab of your colorful eyeliner. Using a clean eyeliner brush, mix the colors together slightly., Using the new color you created, add flowers along the remainder of your lash line. Again, have them overlap slightly with the white flowers and add as many light colored flowers as you prefer., Take a yellow eyeliner. Using an eyeliner brush, dab the center of each flower with a dot of yellow. This should make it clear the cluster of dots are flowers, as they now all have buds.Keep in mind, not every flower will get a bud. Some flowers overlap, covering the hole in the center of the dots.

Use light foundation.,
Apply one coat of mascara.,
Fill in your waterline with colored liner.",How to Do Floral Eyeliner3," Flower eyeliner is very attention grabbing. You should keep other makeup minimal when wearing it. Add only a light layer of foundation after applying floral eyeliner., A single coat of mascara is all that is necessary for liquid eyeliner. Too much mascara, or something like false eyelashes, can take attention away from your floral liner.Go slower than you usually would when applying your mascara. This can help prevent you from smearing your flower shapes.

, Filling in your waterline will help your eyes pop and make them look bigger and more defined. Choose a colored eyeliner if you used floral eyeliner. This will give your eyes a floral, spring look. Opt for a color that's the same or similar to the one of the colors you used for your flowers."

Add the charcoal to a dish.,
Mix in the coconut oil.,
Transfer the liner to a container and use a brush to apply it.",How to Make Gel Eyeliner2," An all-natural black gel eyeliner gets its color from activated charcoal, which is usually used to treat stomach issues and for other medicinal purposes. Open 1 to 2 activated charcoal capsules and dump the powder into a small bowl.You can usually find activated charcoal capsules at the drugstore. They’re also available at a variety of online stores.

, With the charcoal powder in the bowl, add ½ teaspoon (2.25 g) of coconut oil. Stir the two together with a toothpick or even an eyeliner brush until you have a smooth paste.You can substitute grapeseed or sweet almond oil for the coconut oil. Just add ¼ (1 ml) teaspoon instead.
You can also mix distilled water with the charcoal instead of the coconut oil. However, a water-based liner won’t last as long on the eyes.

, Once you’ve created the gel liner, use a spoon or small spatula to place it in a small pot or other container with a lid. When you’re ready to line your eyes, use your usual eyeliner brush and carefully drag the liner across your lash line.The gel liner will stain clothing and other fabrics, so be careful when you’re putting it in a storage container and applying it.
Refrigerating the gel liner will help it last longer. Even if you store it in the fridge, you should throw it away after a month.
