Add ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of grated beeswax and ½ teaspoon (2.25 g) of coconut oil to the glass bowl. Bring the water in the pan to a gentle boil over medium heat until the wax and oil melt, which should take 10 to 15 minutes.You can substitute grapeseed or sweet almond oil for the coconut oil if you prefer.
You can usually purchase beeswax at your local farmers' market, health food store, or organic grocery store.

, When the wax and oil are melted, remove the glass bowl from the double boiler. Add ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of activated charcoal powder to the bowl. Stir with a spoon until the charcoal is completely blended into the wax and oil., Once the charcoal is fully combined with the wax mixture, mix in ¼ teaspoon (1.25 ml) of distilled water. Whisk the mixture until the water is fully incorporated and a smooth gel forms.If you find that the ingredients are separating, mix in a capsule full of lecithin to help bind the eyeliner. You can find lecithin capsules with other supplements at the drugstore.

, When the gel liner is completely mixed, use a spoon to place it in a small container with a lid. Keep the liner in the refrigerator to help keep it fresh.Because there are no preservatives in the eye liner, you should throw it out after 3 to 4 weeks.

, For the best application, dip a small, narrow eyeliner brush into the liner. Apply the liner in as thin or thick a line as you’d like at your lash line.To remove the liner, apply some coconut oil to your eyes with a cotton ball. Wipe your eyes gently until all of the liner is removed.

",How to Apply Liquid Eyeliner," So you’ve made the decision to use liquid eyeliner, but now you need to choose the best application style for you. Liquid eyeliner comes in two main types: felt tip and a dip-brush.


Felt tip liquid eyeliner is very similar to a marker, and has the eyeliner fed through it like a pen.
A dip-brush liquid eyeliner is similar to nail polish in that it comes with a small bottle of the eyeliner with a brush that must be dipped in in between each application.

, Applying eyeliner is a middle step to be done after you put on your eyeshadow but before you put on your mascara. Put on an eyelid primer to help your eyeshadow and/or eyeliner stick to your lid for the whole day. If you plan on wearing eye shadow, apply it now and your eyeliner will go over the top.








, The biggest problem with applying liquid eyeliner is lacking a steady hand, causing a wavy line and uneven application. To rectify this problem, rest your elbow on a table and your hand on your cheek as you apply.


If you are able, hold a small hand-held mirror in your opposite hand instead of using a large mirror so that you can get a good view of your eyelid and liner application.

, When applying liquid eyeliner, avoid putting it on in a single line; doing so will increase your chances of a wavy line and uneven tail end. Instead, start by drawing small dots or dashes directly along your upper lash line, evenly spacing them apart.








, Use small, short, slow strokes to connect the dots or dashes you created along your line. You will be able to create an even line on both eyes that lacks any bumps or waves by following this method. Avoid connecting all the dots in a single stroke, but use several small strokes between each mark.








, If you find that the top of your line shows the breaks between the dashes, steady your hand and draw a thin line along the edge to smooth it out. Do so on the bottom edge of the liner as well to fill in any space between your eyeliner and your lash line.








, Regardless of the type of eyeliner that you use, a small tail should be created at the outer edge of your eyelid to give the illusion of a continuation of your lash line. Use your eyeliner to draw a small line extending upwards on your upper lash line, but drawn at the same angle as the upwards curve in your lower lash line. Draw a small triangle from the end of the line with the upper lash line and fill in the space.









You can stop it early for a natural look, or sweep it far up your lid for a classic cat eye.

, With the completion of your eyeliner, apply your mascara and any other finishing touches to your makeup. Use a large, full-bristled brush to wipe off any shadow or eyeliner that might have fallen underneath your eyes. Use a q-tip dipped in makeup remover to remove any mistakes you made in your eyeliner or mascara application.







, Not quite the same as a liquid liner, cream based eyeliners are applied with a thin brush and a thick liner paste. Cream eyeliners give smoother lines than a pencil and are very similar in appearance and application as a liquid liner.;
, Believe it or not, you an can actually make your very own liquid eyeliner using a mixture of loose powder eyeshadow and water. Mix the two together to form a thin paste, and use a clean eyeliner brush to draw it on.








, When things are heated, they typically melt down into a liquid; the same process applies for pencil eyeliners. Use a lighter to heat up the end of an eyeliner pencil until it becomes very soft. Wait 10-15 seconds, and then draw on the creamy pencil over your lash line. Make sure it is not hot.

Use a primer.,

Finish your eyeliner with a point.,
Add some volume to your eyelashes.,

Finish your look by adding some lip gloss.",How to Do Unicorn Eyeliner," Before you apply makeup, whether it’s a little or a lot, you should first apply primer. Primer creates a smooth, even base for your makeup. It helps your makeup adhere, thus keeping it from smudging or “melting” later on. Put a bit on your fingertip, and then blend it across your eyelid and around the rest of your eye. This will ensure your unicorn eyeliner stays in place!








If you are applying makeup to the rest of your face, apply primer to the rest of your face as well.;
, If you choose to wear foundation and concealer, apply it before starting on your eyes. Face makeup is often done after the eye makeup is applied, but you risk messing up the intricate unicorn horn if you do it afterwards. Apply your face products however you like, and make sure to set any liquid products with a powder.








, You don’t need to wear eye shadow with your unicorn eyeliner, but you certainly can. If you plan on wearing it, you need to apply it before doing your eyeliner. Because your eyeliner is white, a dark color eye shadow is your best choice. Glittery and shimmery eye shadows certainly add to the imaginative look you are going for!







, For this look, you will need to use white liquid eyeliner. By using liquid eyeliner, you’ll be able to create the very precise, pigmented line that you want. Carefully apply your liquid eyeliner on your top lash line, from the inner corner of your eye to the outer corner. The line should gradually thicken as it moves outwards.








, Starting at the outer corner of your eye, begin extending the same white liner, as if you were doing winged eyeliner. However instead of creating a stick straight line, softly curve the line a few times. Then, lighten up pressure on the liquid eyeliner and finish the “horn” with a sharp point.








You can also create the horn backwards, starting by creating a point. With this method, you can ensure that your horn is the exact length you want, by putting its ending point down first. Then, add the curvy line to connect the point and the outer corner of your eye.
This look might take some practice! If you aren’t experienced with liquid liner, you may need to practice a few times. Soon, you will be applying liquid liner like a pro.

, This is the detail that will turn your curvy eyeliner into a unicorn horn. You will be using your pastel liquid eyeliner to help create the coiled look of a unicorn horn. Begin slightly above the white eyeliner at the corner of your eye. If your white eyeliner begins with a curve going upwards, you will begin your colored eyeliner with a curve going downwards. Continue curving the colored line in the opposite direction as the white. When you are finished, the white line and the colored line should appear intertwined.








The trick to applying the second color eyeliner is to make sure you don’t create a curvy line layering directly on top of the white curvy line. Instead, you want to create this line so that it alternates going on top of the white line and then “behind” the white line.
To make your colored eyeliner appear on top of the white, apply the liner on top of the white. To make it look like it’s going behind it, pick it up as you go over the white liner, so that the line looks like it’s hidden behind the white line. The colored eyeliner should alternate every time it crosses paths with the white eyeliner.

, After you’ve created the second, intertwined curvy line in your colored eyeliner, it needs to meet in a point with the white. Don’t worry if the colored eyeliner is above or below the white. Just make sure they come together to create a crisp, sharp point. After all, you’ve probably never seen a unicorn with a dull horn!







, Once your eyeliner is perfected (and totally dry!), it’s time to add a bit of drama to your lashes. First, curl your lashes with an eyelash curler. Bring it to the base of your lashes and clamp down, holding it for about five seconds. Release, and then do the same thing in the center of your lashes and the tip of your lashes.









Apply your mascara. After your lashes are curled, apply your favorite mascara. Start at the base of your lashes, gently wiggling the wand as you brush product on your lashes to the tip. For extra volume, you can apply a second or even third coat.
If you want more length and volume than you can get with an eyelash curler and mascara, apply some false eyelashes.

, To finish your dreamy look, you want to add a bit of a glow to the rest of your face. Dust a bit of highlighter along the highest point of your cheekbones. Then add a bit on your cupid’s bow, or the center of your upper lip. Add highlighter down the bridge of your nose, and underneath your brows. Finally, dot a bit in the inner corner of your eyes. This will make your eyes look bright and sparkly, which will call attention to your fun unicorn eyeliner.







, To complete your whimsical, unicorn look, add a bit of sparkle to your lips. Grab your favorite shimmery lip gloss and sweep it on your pout. If you have a matte lip color you love, apply it with a bit of clear lip gloss over it. Nothing complements your unicorn eyeliner like sparkly, shimmery lips!

Curl your lashes.",How to Apply Eyeliner to the Waterline," Take a little of the concealer you normally use for your skin tone and dab a little just below your eye line using your fingertips. Applying concealer can help the eyeliner stay in place longer.Always wash your face before applying makeup and be sure to wash makeup off of your face at the end of the day. This will help keep your skin clear and healthy.;
, Gently pull down the skin of your lower eyelid. Take your cotton swab and swipe along the waterline so that you remove any moisture. This will help the eyeliner stick to your waterline.








Take care when using the cotton swab on your eye. Stand in front of a mirror with good lighting so you can easily see what you're doing.

, To make application easier, look directly at the mirror and tilt your head down. Don't adjust your gaze while you do this. Use your fingertips and gently pull down on the eyelid.Some people find that squinting can make it easier to apply eyeliner to the waterline.

, Use a sharp eyeliner pencil and rub the pencil along your waterline using sweeping motions. You should still be pulling the lid down so that the pencil doesn't directly rub against your eye.








While it might seem easier to use liquid eyeliner, you should avoid applying it to the waterline.

, Dip a cotton swab in some makeup remover or petroleum jelly. Carefully run it along the lashes below the waterline. This can clean up smudges or thin out a heavy line of eyeliner.








If you'd like to create a smoky look, gently smudge the eyeliner along your lashes. You can use clean fingertips or a smudging tool.

, Set your eyeliner by applying a little eye powder to keep the eyeliner in place. Dip an eyeliner brush in eyeshadow that's the same shade as your eyeliner. Brush the eyeshadow over the eyeliner.








If you'd like a bold look, you can repeat this process and apply eyeliner to the upper waterline (known as tightlining).

, If you like how your eyes look when you use eyeliner on the waterline, then you should continue doing it. But, if you're worried it doesn't work with your eyes, there are simple things you can try. For:








Wide-set eyes: make sure the eyeliner goes all the way to the inner corner near your nose.
Close-set eyes: avoid applying eyeliner in the inner corner and instead apply it mainly along the middle and outer corner of your eyes.
Small eyes: use a softer color like brown or khaki instead of black which may define your eyes too much.

, You'll probably want to use a sharp eyeliner pencil since you can control the eyeliner easier. You can also use a gel eyeliner and a brush if you feel comfortable applying the liner with a brush. If you choose a pencil, choose one that's designed for applying along the waterline. Kohl pencils are good choices for this.Since the eyeliner is directly against your eye, choose a waterproof eyeliner to make it last longer. Just avoid using liquid eyeliner since it's too slippery to accurately apply.You can use any color of eyeliner. Black eyeliner is a good choice for bold, evening looks. White or tan eyeliners can open up the eyes, making them appear brighter.

, You can rub the eyeliner over the waterline several times when you're initially putting it on. But, you should avoid touching up the waterline later. Doing so can increase your risk of infection by up to 30%.








Once your waterline is lined with eyeliner, it will be hard to contain or control. You may need to carry cotton swabs to clean up any smudging or mess after wearing it for a few hours., If you're using a pencil instead of gel, always sharpen the pencil before each use. This ensures that the pencil tip is fresh and won't introduce bacteria into your eye, which could lead to infection. Keep anything that touches your eye completely clean. For example, if you're using a cotton swab, make sure you use a new swab right out of the package.To further reduce your risk for eye infection, never share eyeliner or eye makeup with others. You should also replace your pencil eyeliners every two years., Your eyeliner will stay in place longer if you take the time to curl your lashes before applying the eyeliner. This way, eyelashes don't poke down into the makeup.








This can be especially helpful if your eyelashes naturally point straight downward.

Reapply the color as necessary.",How to Do Winged Eyeliner with Pencil1," Before you begin the process of applying eyeliner, dab some primer onto your eyelids. Use your fingers to gently rub in the primer. This will make your eyeliner and any eyeshadow you use stand out more.









Make sure to wash your hands before you apply your eyeliner.;
, When selecting an eyeliner pencil, go for a creamier brand of eyeliner. In general, creamier and thicker eyeliners will more easily spread on your lash line.Opt for pencils that can be sharpened.
Bigger pencils will create bigger wings, while smaller pencils will create smaller, finer lines.

, Start applying eyeliner at the inner corner of your upper lash line. You do not want any visible space between the eyeliner and the lash line, so draw your eyeliner as close to the lash line as possible.








Close your eye and pull the lid so it's straight. This will give you better control.Start by making one small line, wiggling it between each eyelash. Then, add a second line thickening the first.

, You want your line to stretch all the way across your lash line. Use sideways, swiping motions to continue drawing your line along your lash line. As you're going to morph your line into wings, thicken the line as you go. It should get thicker as you move towards the outer corners of your eyes.







, The line should move up and outward as it approaches the end of your eyelid. The wing will point towards the tip of your eyebrow. Use this as guidance as you draw your line.








Again, start with a wiggling line and then reapply the eyeliner to thicken the line.

, Even after applying eyeliner carefully, you may have some gaps in color or spots where the line is uneven. You may have to draw over the line a few times. This is to fill in any gaps and get the line to your desired thickness. After drawing the first line or eyeliner along your lash line, fill it in as necessary.








How thick you want the line is up to you. When reapplying the eyeliner, add eyeliner until it's at your desired thickness.

",How to Apply Pencil Eyeliner," There are many different types of eyeliner that come in a pencil form, each of which has a different consistency and texture, application, and effect.


Powder-based pencils, sometimes called kohl, offer less intense color.They’re also a good option if you want to smudge the eyeliner for a “smoky eye” effect.
Gel- or cream-based pencils offer simple and excellent application. These pencils apply a rich and intense color. They're a good choice if you want to apply a winged, or cat eye, look.You can also purchase gel or cream eyeliners that come in a pot and can be applied with a tapered brush applicator.
Liquid eyeliner pencils offer the most dramatic and intense application. Many liquid liners come in pen form (though it more closely resembles a felt marker), making application fairly simple. Tips range from very thin to thick depending on how intense you want the look or if you want to apply a cat-eye or winged look.;
, Most companies offer different eyeliner formulas for different needs including sensitive eyes and organic, animal-friendly products. Some even offer formulas that include serums to elongate your lashes.


If your eyes are sensitive because you wear contact lenses, or if you suffer from allergic reactions to certain formulas, certain companies (like Almay) make non-allergenic (also called hypoallergenic) makeup, including eyeliner.
If you prefer an eyeliner that is ethically produced, made of organic materials, and is not tested on animals, for example, companies including, Aveda, NARS, Arbonne, The Body Shop, and Josie Maran Cosmetics offer these products., Pencil eyeliners come in a broad range of colors from electric blue and emerald green to traditional colors like black and brown.


A good rule of thumb is to apply shades such as black, dark brown, deep plum, or grey if you want a more natural look.You can intensify or soften these colors as you like to achieve your desired look.
Unusual colors such as electric blue, orange, or emerald green will really stand out against your eyes and eyelids, so it’s a good idea to use them for special, non-professional occasions.
Different eyeliner colors highlight each eye color differently. For example, plum eyeliner makes green eyes “pop,” while grey eyeliner looks great on blue eyes. Purple-toned liners can enhance brown eyes, and black is a good choice for any eye color.

, Once you’ve decided on the color, format, and formula, you are ready to purchase the pencil or pencils either at a store or online.


Eyeliners vary greatly in price. They can cost as little as 99 cents and as much as 50 dollars or more.
You can buy eyeliners at retailers including drugstores such as CVS, stores like Target or Walmart, or department stores such as Macy’s or Saks Fifth Avenue. Sephora, a large French makeup retailer with stores across the world, is another excellent place to purchase eyeliner.
Most vendors, including CVS, Target, Macy's, and Sephora, also have websites where you can purchase your eyeliner.

, Eyelids are the greasiest part of your face. If your skin and eyelids are clean, your eyeliner and any other eye makeup you apply will last longer.A clean face also helps reduce the chances that you will accidentally get bacteria in your eye, which can cause infection.

, Pick a room with lots of bright, direct light either from the sun or a lamp.


Having a light that shines evenly across your face allows you to evenly apply the eyeliner on both eyes.

, There are a few products to have handy that will soften your look or fix mistakes.


Brushes. A small-tipped brush in natural or synthetic fibers is the best way to soften your eyeliner line. They are also an easy way to apply gel or liquid liner.
Q-tips or cotton swabs. These are another great way to soften the look of eyeliner. Cotton swabs also effectively fix mistakes when paired with eye makeup remover.
Eye makeup remover. Many companies, including Neutrogena and Clarins, offer eye makeup remover that effectively and gently removes eye makeup and fixes mistakes in your application.
Pencil sharpener. You need to sharpen powder/kohl shadows for best application. This is also a way to clean your pencil, as you're shaving off the surfaces that may have been exposed to bacteria.

, Rest your elbow on a flat surface to steady your hand to ensure even application., This creates a great canvas for your eyeliner by removing any discolorations and evening out your skin tone.








It's a good idea to use a matte, skin-toned cream eyeshadow as your base. This will allow for more even application of your eyeliner.
However, cream eyeshadows can also lead to smudging or creases throughout the day. It is important to set any cream-based eyeshadows with a powder-based shadow or translucent powder before you apply eyeliner.

, This will also help you apply eyeliner evenly.


Make sure not to tug the lash line as this can make the line appear smeared. It is also bad for the delicate skin around your eyes., Place the pencil as close to your lash line as possible and slowly draw a thin line from the outer corner to the inner corner.








Keep the line thin to start. A thinner line will create a more natural look.Start at the outside corner of your eye. You want to deposit the least amount of pigment on the inner corners of your eye.You can thicken this pencil line as you like, for instance, if you want to apply your eyeliner in the cat eye or winged style.If you're interested in doing winged or cat eye style liner, you'll also want to thicken the eyeliner line. Then, draw a line at a 45 degree angle from the corner of your eye. Start from the bottom of the outer edge of your eye and extend upward. You can make this line as long or as short as you wish.Some makeup artists suggest making dots along your lash line and then connecting them if you aren’t steady with drawing a continuous line., Place the pencil as close to your lash line as possible while avoiding the rims of your eyes. Slowly and gently draw a thin line from the outer corner to the inner corner.








The eyeliner on your lower lid should be much softer than on your upper lid or else you can look harsh. A good rule of thumb is that it should be one third the size of the line on your upper lid.,









Avoid a complete circle of eyeliner around your eyes, which looks harsh and smears easily from your tears., This will make the look softer and give the liner a “lived in” look.








Use a brush, Q-tip, or even your finger to soften the line.
Another option for a softer look is to apply brown eyeshadow over the liner on your lower lid using a small, tapered brush. This works particularly well to soften black liner.

, If you want to make your eyes “pop” more, applying a little white eyeliner or shadow at the corners of your lids is an excellent trick.








This trick will also help you look more awake.

,, If you made any mistakes in your application, go back and correct them with a little eye makeup remover and a cotton swab.


A brush can also help blend out mistakes, depending on how serious they are.
You can also use a little foundation on a Q-tip to correct mistakes. This decreases your risk of removing too much of your work., Properly sealing your eyeliner will ensure that it lasts for a long time and doesn’t run.








Use a thin coat of powder eye shadow in a similar color to your eyeliner to seal your eyeliner look. This will also give your eyes a little more of “pop” effect., Applying a coat of mascara to your eyes will highlight your eyeliner and enhance your eyes even further.









Make sure to apply mascara only after you’ve applied eyeliner.,"

Draw three dots extending upward.,
Draw a line through the dots.,
Reconnect your line with your eyeliner.,
Fill in the triangle.",How to Do Winged Eyeliner with Pencil2," Drawing dots along the corners of your eyes can help guide you as you make your wings. Draw three dots that extent upward. Remember, your wing should stretch out no farther than the tip of your eyebrow.








Draw one dot right next to the outer corner of your eye.
Move your pencil upward and draw a third dot rest in the crease created by your eyelid.
Draw a third dot that's parallel to the end of your eyebrow. It should be near your brow bone.

, Take your brush and draw a line stretching through the dots. The line should start at the end of the eyeliner you applied to your lash line and end at the third dot. Go slowly to avoid smudging your eyeliner. When you're done, you should have a small line stretching out of the corners of your eyes.







, Draw another line from the third dot to around the middle part of your lash line. The line should slant into your lash-line, creating a triangle shape.







, Take your pencil and color in the triangle you created. When you're done, you should have a wing extending from the corner of your eye. Repeat with the other eye to complete your look.

"
Smooth out your line with a clean brush.,
Use q-tips to clean unwanted or smeared makeup.,
Try a makeup removing pen.",How to Do Winged Eyeliner with Pencil3," Use a brush meant for lip liner, as this can also work to define eyeliner. Use a clean brush to shape your eyeliner, blotting out any uneven edges and pushing the line upward more. Use the brush tip to draw over the top of the line running along your lash line. Then, use the brush to outline your wings to smooth out any uneven edges.







, If you smeared your makeup at all during the process of applying eyeliner, grab a q-tip. Dip the q-tip in a small amount of makeup remover. Gently dab out the smeared portions with the tip of the q-tip.








If your wings are asymmetrical, you can also use the q-tip to push them into more similar shapes.

, If you frequently apply eyeliner, try using a makeup removing pen. You can buy these at a local supermarket, drug store, or beauty store. These can easily be used to trace over unwanted smudges or uneven portions of your eyeliner. They can be particularly helpful if you're just starting to apply eyeliner, as you'll be prone to making mistakes.

To achieve these crisp, perfect lines, liquid or gel eyeliners work perfectly. While pencil eyeliners are great for everyday lining, it is more difficult to achieve that precise line you want. You can find liquid and gel eyeliners at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store.

If you have pencil eyeliner you want to use for this look, use it for the bottom line, closest to the lash line. Then, use a liquid liner for the top line.
If you are using a gel liner, make sure to pick up a tiny eyeliner brush as well. The bent liner brushes work extremely well for this technique.;
, This technique works best with a light and a dark color, so that you can see the two separate lines distinctly. Unless you're going for a very funky look, think one neutral, and one more ""flashy"" color. Consider color combinations that look great together, like black and gold, navy and gold, black and red, and so on. You can certainly be creative!, Makeup primer is an important first step for any makeup look. Primer creates a smooth, even base for your makeup, helping it adhere to your skin and stay in place all day. Think of your primer as makeup insurance. It helps your makeup go on perfectly, and keeps it looking flawless all day.You can buy primer specifically for your eyelids at the pharmacy or beauty supply store.

, You really want your stacked eyeliner to steal the show. To make sure it does, minimize any discoloration of your eyelids with a bit of concealer. Dot it across your lid with your fingertip, and then gently rub it in thoroughly.

If your eyelids have no visible discoloration, you can skip this step.

, It’s easiest to use the darker color eyeliner out of the pair you’ve chosen. Black, navy, and dark brown work beautifully for this step. You can create the line as thick or thin as you desire, just remember that you’ll be creating another line on top of it.Begin applying your eyeliner in the center of your lash line. Bring it out towards the outer corner of your lid. Let the line become thicker as you move it outwards.
Then go the opposite way, bringing your liner into your inner corner. As you get closer to the corner, thin out your line.
Create an eyeliner wing or cat eyes from the outer corner. This is optional, but creates a really cool effect when done with stacked eyeliner.

, For this step, you should absolutely use liquid or gel eyeliner. You want this line to be very crisp and precise, and these products will help you achieve that. Carefully, create a line above the first line you just created.The most important aspect of your stacked liner is getting the two lines perfectly layered. Make sure you don’t leave any space between your two eyeliners, and try not to overlap your first liner with your second.
Don’t forget to line the top of your winged liner or cat eyes as well. Only apply your eyeliner to the top of the extension, rather than the entire perimeter.

, It can be hard to apply your eyeliner perfectly, especially the first couple of times you experiment with stacked eyeliner. Luckily, you can clean up any errors after you’ve applied both colors. Dip a small, angled eyeliner brush into makeup remover to even out the top border.Do the same thing on your wings, making sure that they come to a sharp point.

",How to Apply Gel Eyeliner," While it’s not necessary to buy the most expensive cosmetics, read reviews about the product you’re considering buying to find out whether it’s worth it.


Select a gel eyeliner that comes with the brush needed to create the look you want. A thick brush will create thick, dark lines. A thin, angled brush will give you more control and allow you to make finer lines.Look for a brush that has a bit of stiffness to it.;
, Use a gentle cleanser and your favorite moisturizer. You want to ensure your skin is free of dirt and oil so that you have a fresh canvas to work with.Don’t use an overly oily moisturizer, or the eyeliner will have trouble adhering to your skin.

, This is an optional step, but the base layer will give the gel eyeliner something more to stick to, will help it last longer, and will make it more apparent.








Dab either concealer or translucent powder on your upper lids and around your eyes. Blend it in with a sponge or your fingertips.

, Only dip the brush bristles in, and wipe them on the sides to remove excess eyeliner. Start with less rather than more, as you can always add more eyeliner if necessary, but taking it away will be much more difficult.









Using too much eyeliner at once can lead to globs and smearing.

, Tilt your head to point your chin up and out, so that you can see your entire eyelid more easily.








, Don’t point the brush perpendicular to your eye so you can’t see what you’re doing. Instead, hold the brush at an angle so you can see the tip touching your eye and can follow as you work.

, Using your other hand, place a finger on your face between your temple and the eye you’re going to apply eyeliner to. Very gently pull the skin taut toward your temple. This will help you apply the eyeliner in a straight line.







, Close the eye you are going to apply eyeliner to, but not so tightly that you’re squinting. On your top lid, start at the inside near your tear duct. Use the tip of the brush to gently and smoothly follow the lash line and trace the natural curve of your eye with the eyeliner.Try to do this in one stroke, keeping the eyeliner as close to the lash line as possible.









If you find it difficult to trace the lash line smoothly, mark points along the way first with the eyeliner, and then connect the dots with a single stroke of the brush., For a more dramatic effect, thicken the line by retracing the original line with a thicker one. Make sure the line is thinner at the beginning and end of the eyelid, and slightly and gradually thicker toward the corner.







, Extend the basic line beyond the corner of your eye slightly, angling it gently upward with the natural curve of your eye.








, Apply eyeliner only to the corner of your eyes. Start in the middle of your eyelid and draw a line toward the outer corner. Make the line thicker as you approach the corner. Do the same on the bottom lid, and connect the eyeliner lines in the corner of your eye.







, The wing, or cat eye look, will extend your eye and create a more dramatic effect.Create the wing by using the brush tip to draw a triangle that naturally extends the corner of your eye. The triangle should taper and come to a point that points toward the tip of your eyebrow, and should get thicker as it approaches your eye.









Angle the triangle slightly upward toward your temple. The wing should follow the line that connects the bottom of your brow with your nose.Make the triangle no longer than the halfway point between the corner of your eye and your eyebrow.
Fill in the triangle shape with eyeliner, and smoothly connect the triangle with the original line you drew to trace your lash line.

, Use either a cotton swab or makeup sponge wipe up any mistakes right away, before the eyeliner dries. If necessary, dip the cotton swab in baby oil or makeup remover first.








, An unsteady hand can make for a rough or uneven eyeliner line, which will make your makeup job look sloppy. If necessary, rest your elbows on a counter or table as you apply the eyeliner.








, Wash it with soap and warm water and let it air dry before your next use. This will prevent bacteria from growing, and it will keep the brush clean, which will make your makeup easier to apply.








, This is especially true for things like lipstick and eyeliner that can transfer bacteria into your body through your mouth or eyes., Applying makeup with the same brush over and over again can cause bacteria to grow, which can lead to infections. Cosmetics can also degrade and go bad over time, especially once they’re open. Depending on your eyeliner, you should probably use it within three to six months.,"

Pick your eyeliner product.,
Pair the proper product and brush.,
Make sure your brushes are clean.,
Dip your brush into the product.,
Begin at your top inner corner.,
Line your bottom lash line.",How to Apply Eyeliner with a Brush," You can find an assortment of different brushes at beauty supply stores or your local drugstore. Different types of eyeliner brushes are useful for different purposes. They can also be great for different types of products, like gels, creams, powders, and liquids. A variety of eyeliner brushes is a worthwhile investment to your beauty arsenal.Flat, angled eyeliner brushes have stiff bristles that are longer at one side. These brushes are pretty multipurpose, and can achieve tight lines along the lash line.
Your basic eyeliner brush is a straight brush with a small, sparse tip. It’s perfect for thin lines, thanks to its thin tip.
A flat tip brush is similar to the angled eyeliner brush, but without the angle! This one is good for simple, straight lines.
The angled bent eyeliner brush is a funny looking brush that almost looks like it’s been broken. It has a smaller tip, and is used to draw super thin lines. It’s particularly good for curved wings.
The dome shaped semi flat brush has a bigger tip than the others, so it’s great for applying thicker lines.;
, Again, the beauty of applying eyeliner with a brush is that virtually any makeup product can become eyeliner. If you love a certain eyeshadow or powder, you can use it to line your eyes with a softer, smudged line. Gels and creams are smooth and pigmented, and typically last for a long time. Liquid eyeliner is dramatic and precise, but it can be difficult to apply. This one might take a bit of practice!, With an array of brushes and a variety of products, your eyeliner potential is seemingly endless. To choose the appropriate product and brush, it’s important to consider the final look you want to achieve. Selecting your supplies is half the battle.

Liquid eyeliners are great for super defined, sharp lines. To apply these, select a brush with a very fine tip, like the classic eyeliner brush or the angled bent eyeliner brush.
Gel and cream eyeliners are rich and smooth, with a great staying power. The dome shaped semi flat brush is recommended for applying these.
Powders are better for a soft look, and using a flat angled eyeliner brush or a flat straight eyeliner brush both work well for this.

, If they’re straight out of the package, you don’t need to worry about this. Otherwise, you should clean your eyeliner brushes between applications. While this is important for all makeup brushes, it’s particularly important for the brushes you’re using near your delicate eyes. You want to limit the amount of bacteria you’re spreading near your eyes – plus, the application is typically smoothest when the brush is clean before dipping it into product.

Learn about different ways to clean your brushes here.

, Here’s a helpful tip: you can always add more eyeliner, but it’s trickier to remove it. In other words, start with less product and build up, rather than vice versa. Make sure the tip of your brush is coated in a layer of product, but don’t pack it on. If you need to add more product, you easily can., Line your brush up to the inner corner of your top lash line, or as far inwards as you want your liner to extend. Then, drag or brush the product outwards to your outer corner.You can stop your liner at the outer corner, or extend it to a cat eye or a wing.

If you are nervous to draw a line in one fell swoop, you can first add dots along your top lash line. Then, simply connect the dots!

, Bottom eyeliner can be a bit trickier, because it can make your eyes look very severe and dark if done incorrectly. Again, start inwards and move outwards. However, unlike the top eyeliner, you should start about 2/3 into the eye, omitting product from your inner corner. Lining the outsides of your bottom eye make your eyes look bigger and open, while lining the entire thing can make your eyes look very dark and stern.

Make sure to connect your eyeliner to the outer corner of your eye, thus also connecting with the top eyeliner. This will make your eye look unified and natural.
Typically, you’ll want to create a softer, lighter line on your bottom lash line.

Use a light hand.,
Avoid your waterline.",How to Apply Eyeliner That Stays All Day2," If you are using a pencil liner, consider putting your eyeliner in the fridge for 10 or so minutes if you notice it is soft.

Your eye area is very delicate and being rough on it will cause your eyes to water. Watering eyes causes makeup to shift, so be gentle when applying your liner.

, If you want to do everything you can to avoid smudging, avoid putting eyeliner on your waterline. Your waterline is the rim of your eyelid that is against the eye, between the base of your lashes and your eyeball. Your waterline is very sensitive, and applying eyeliner there can cause your eyes to water. Watering eyes and tearing causes your eyeliner to shift downward, giving you the smudged, raccoon look. Some prefer the look of liner on their waterline rather than on their lash line. If you are not willing to give up putting eyeliner on your waterline, make sure that you are using a liner that is not irritating to your eyes. This may mean investing in a more expensive product than most drugstore eyeliners.

Apply eyeshadow over your eyeliner.,
Use a makeup sealer.,
Use Vaseline as a makeup sealer.,
Apply waterproof mascara.,
Use a setting spray.",How to Apply Eyeliner That Stays All Day3," After you apply your eyeliner, take a similarly-colored eyeshadow and use a thin brush to sweep a layer of eyeshadow over your eyeliner. For instance, if you used black eyeliner, use a matte black eyeshadow .This seals your liner and prevents it from running or smudging.

Glitter can seriously irritate your eyes and is best for lids, not the area around your eyes. , Makeup sealers work by drying over your eyeliner so that it stays set. They are usually clear so that the sealer does not interfere with the color of your liner. You can find makeup sealer at stores like Sephora, Ulta or Target. , If you do not have a makeup sealer and would rather not purchase one, just use Vaseline to seal your eyeliner.

Waterproof mascara can help your eyeliner from shifting around and smudging. , Setting sprays use a mist formula to set your makeup. Once you have applied your liner and the rest of your eye makeup, close your eyes. Take the setting spray, hold it about a foot away from your eyes, and give your eyes one spray.

You may be doing it unconsciously, but if you make a point of trying to remember then it should become second nature to you to avoid touching your eye area.

, Hot and sticky weather can melt your makeup and make it run. If you can avoid it, try not to spend excessive time in the heat. If you are spending time outside on a sunny day, wear sunglasses. This can shield your eye area from the sun and also prevents your eyes from watering as you squint. , Many eyeliners are not waterproof. A rainstorm, a swim session or a shower can all cause your makeup to run. Do your best to avoid getting your face wet after you put your makeup on.

Buy a high-quality eyeliner.,
Buy waterproof eyeliner.,
Buy liquid eyeliner.,
Buy gel liner.",How to Apply Eyeliner That Stays All Day5," You may find that the problem with your eyeliner is not how you apply it, but that you are using a low-quality eyeliner. Some eyeliners are better than others. Poor-quality eyeliners do not have very long staying power and are more prone to smudging. They also may irritate your eyes, which causes watering and makes your eyeliner shift. Buy eyeliner from a makeup store like Sephora or Ulta. Their products are more expensive for a reason: it's because they are very high quality. There are good quality eyeliners at the drugstore, but you may want to do a little online research and read about others' experiences with the product.

, Waterproof liner is much more resistant than non-waterproof liner. It lasts activities like swimming and showering, but it also resists tearing or watering of the eyes. If you are using eyeliner on your waterline, make it's waterproof. , Liquid eyeliner is incredibly effective in not smudging. It goes on wet and after it dries it's extremely resistant to moving. Liquid liner gives a very crisp and uniform line, and is great for dramatic eye looks like cat eyes. It is best used on your upper last line. Liquid liners are not made to be used on your water line. Use a pencil liner instead.
Make sure to give your liquid liner time to dry. Do not put on any other eye makeup before it's dry, or you could smudge the liner.

, A gel liner has a consistency that is in between a pencil and a liquid eyeliner. Like a liquid liner, it has great staying power after it's dry and is therefore much less prone to smudging. It also can be used on the waterline, so if you are looking for an optimal liner for your waterline, consider a gel liner. "

Experiment and discover which styles of high waisted skirts look best on you.There are pencil skirts, A-line skirts, pleated skirts, maxi skirts, and many more. High waisted skirts can be found in a variety of stores depending on your price range.Pencil skirts are known for their slimming features and are typically worn for more formal occasions.A-line skirts are appropriate for more modest circumstances, like interviews or work place attire.Pleated skirts help to create a less formal, playful, feminine look.;
, Because there is such a variety in high waisted skirts styles, some varieties are more appropriate for certain situations than others. For example, besides the design style of the skirt, the length and print of the skirt can determine which settings and situations it would be best to wear that style.Generally speaking, the shorter the skirt, the more appropriate it is for a relaxed setting.


For most business settings, a dark colored, knee length or calf length skirt is considered appropriate attire.Floor length maxi skirts are normally considered casual wear. Because maxi skirts are more casual, there is more freedom in the print style.High waisted mini skirts are considered appropriate for extremely casual settings, party, and club wear.Shorter skirts can usually be bolder in color and paired with fun accessories., A high waisted skirt is supposed to emphasize your hip to waist ratio, so wearing the correct size skirt is very important.If the skirt is too small, it will pull across your body and create folds and lumps in unflattering areas. If the skirt is too big, it could diminish the sleek, waist defining effect intended by the skirt.Since these styles of skirts sit high on your waist, it can shrink the appearance of your torso. If you already have a shorter distance between your belly button and your breast line, this skirt style will proportionally make your torso looks especially short., Over the last few years, high waisted styles have become a very popular trend, from high waisted pants, to shorts, to skirts. Because of this hot trend, celebrities and models can be seen sporting high waists in all variations. Look at the outfits and styles of popular icons and try to recreate some of your favorite looks.For example, celebrities like Taylor Swift, Alessandra Ambrosio, Amal Clooney, and Xenia are all notorious for rocking different styles of high waisted skirts and bottoms., Since the high waisted style first became popular in the 40s and 50s, high waisted bottoms have had numerous cycles throughout fashion history. Vintage fashion icons like Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot, and Mary Tyler Moore paved the way for early high waisted styles.


Since it's initial popularity, most decades since have seen their own variation on the high waisted style (bell bottoms in the 70s, high waisted jeans in the 80s and 90s)., High waisted skirts look best with tops that are tucked in. That’s because the high waist combined with a tucked in top, creates a clear appearance of cinched waistline.Your tucked top should be fitted, like a soft blouse, a dress shirt, or even a tank top.


Thinner fabrics tend to fold and bunch up less when tucked into skirts, so keep that in mind when choosing a top.If you have a full chest, consider wearing a looser, flowing top, but still keep it tucked in. There are some shirts that may look better with your body proportions when they are not tucked in, but you will have to experiment and see how the combination looks on you., Wearing a crop top with a high waisted skirt can transform your outfit into a summery, casual look, or keep it classy when paired with a longer, more modest skirt.Additionally, wearing a crop top with a high waisted skirt can boost your confidence in bearing your midriff.


Crop tops are extremely versatile, and can work with longer high waisted skirts, shorter, more playful high waisted skirts, and nearly everything in between.
Crop tops might not be the best option for those who have fuller figures, but again, experiment and find what works best for you.

, Tops that have higher necklines lend a more elegant feel to any outfit, and can help redesign your outfit for more formal events.High necklines along with collared shirts add an air of sophistication and class to any high waisted piece.

, The elongating effect of the high waisted skirt looks best, and is only further accentuated, when worn with a pair of heels.Dainty and strappy heels look very nice with high waisted skirts, but wedges and close-toed heels can also work for summery, or more professional styles. Try nude colored heels to elongate your legs even more.High waisted skirts don’t usually go well with flip-flops, flats or boots. Flip-flops and flats can look too casual and boots can look too clunky for the lean, elegant line of the skirt.
However, delicate ankle boots might be appropriate, if you have long legs. Flat shoes might also work with a fluffier, more casual high waisted skirt.

, Adding a belt to your high waisted skirt can help cinch your waist (or appear to cinch your waist) even more. A belt also lends a unique look to your style, and allows you to customize and distinguish your outfit to truly make it your own.If you add a belt that is the same color as your skirt, you can create a seamless hourglass silhouette.


If you use a colored belt darker than your skirt, it will help create a more prominent cinch.If you already have a tiny waist, wear a brighter belt to help draw attention to your flattering waist area., Consider wearing a jacket, blazer, or cardigan with your high waisted skirt. An additional top layer can completely change the vibe of your outfit.A leather jacket can lend an edgier, cool look to a skirt. A blazer can help an outfit maintain a professional look, while still being relaxed.A fitted cardigan can tame down your outfit, and if it falls just above your waistline, it can discretely highlight your natural curves., For the fall and winter months, high waisted skirts can be combined with tights.Consider pairing your skirt and tights with ankle booties.


If you are going to a work party and feel that your skirt is too short or glitzy, consider wearing dark, opaque tights to balance out your outfit and make it a bit more modest and appropriate for the occasion."

, There are many types and colors of eye pencils available. You will want to choose one based on the kind of look you are going for.


Jumbo eye pencils are much larger in diameter than standard eye pencils. These can be used to apply a thick layer of eyeliner to the eyelid or even as an eyeshadow.Standard eye pencils are about the same diameter as a regular pencil used for writing. Sometimes the diameter is even smaller than that. Smaller eye pencils can be used to create a thin, defined line on the client’s eyelid.
Eye pencils come in virtually every color and they can also come in shimmery and metallic colors. Browse the selection in stores near you or online to see what is available. In most cases, your imagination is the limit!, Depending on the look that you would like to create, you will want to sharpen the eye pencil. This can be done with a regular pencil sharpener or with one specifically marketed for makeup. You will need to find a sharpener that is a suitable size for the eye pencil you would like to use.


A sharper pencil will create a thinner, more precise look.
A dull pencil will create a thicker, less precise look. If this is what you desire, you may decide not to sharpen the pencil.
You can use a small eye brush or Q-tip to smudge the eyeliner if you would like to create a look that is not very defined.

, You can do this by spraying an alcohol spray onto the tip of the pencil. An alcohol spray will dry quickly, allowing you to use it within a few minutes or less.


Always use isopropyl alcohol to sanitize your makeup (not ethyl alcohol).Isopropyl alcohol can be obtained from your local drugstore, beauty supply store, or from Amazon.com.

, Ask the client to close their eyes. Place your thumb on the client’s cheekbone and your pointer finger above the eyebrow. Gently stretch the skin so that it is not wrinkled or creased on the eyelid. Apply the pencil in short, light strokes, moving from the inner corner of the eye to the outer corner.

, If you would like, repeat the application of the eyeliner until you achieve the desired look.


For a thicker, more dramatic look, repeat the application of the eye pencil until you are satisfied with the results.
For a lighter, more natural look, stick with a light application and do not add many more layers.

An example of pressed powder is virtually any eyeshadow on the market; they are generally sold as pressed powders to prevent mess and spills.
Most of the time, if you want to use pressed powder to apply as eyeliner, you will be using an eyeshadow.
Using pressed powder as eyeliner is generally the easiest method because it requires the least amount of precision and has a smudged, not-too-defined effect.

A small brush with tight bristles will create a very defined, precise effect. The smaller and tighter the brush and bristles, the more defined the look.
A larger brush with loose bristles will create a loose, smudged effect that is not very precise.

, You will want to make sure that your brush is clean and doesn’t have remnants of old makeup on it. Spray isopropyl alcohol on the brush. It should dry in a few minutes or less.


You can clean your brushes by using a makeup cleaning spray from Sephora, which dries relatively quickly, depending on the size of the brush. Smaller brushes will dry faster than large brushes.Isopropyl alcohol spray is available at drug stores, beauty supply stores, and can be ordered off websites such as Amazon.com.

, You can disinfect your powder by scraping off the top layer of powder with a dry tissue or by spraying isopropyl alcohol onto it.


You may have to wait fifteen minutes or so for the powder to dry if you use alcohol spray on it, so do this only if you have enough time.

, Ask the client to close their eyes. Place your thumb on the client’s cheekbone and your pointer finger above the eyebrow. Gently stretch the skin so that it is not wrinkled or creased on the eyelid. Gently tap the powder onto the desired area of the eye.


Powder does not last for very long on the brush, so you will have to re-dip your brush into the powder several times to get an even application.
Dampening the brush with water will yield a more precise application.
Repeat the application of the powder onto the eyelid until you achieve the desired result. A heavier application will result in a darker, more dramatic look.

Decide on a liquid liner.,
Disinfect the liquid liner.,
Apply the liquid liner.,
Use concealer to erase mistakes.",How to Apply Eyeliner to Another Person3," You will need to decide if you would like to use a felt tip pen, a sponge tip, or a long brush.


The felt tip pen is easiest to use for beginners, due to the lack of mess and the familiar format of using a pen.The sponge tip is great for intermediate users, due to the sturdiness of tip, yet similarity to the pen.
The long brush is best for those who are more advanced at applying makeup. It can be difficult to control the bristles but this is the best way to achieve fine lines., This can be done by spraying isopropyl alcohol onto the tip of the liquid eyeliner. Wait fifteen seconds or so for the alcohol to evaporate before applying to the client.

, Ask the client to close their eyes. Place your thumb on the client’s cheekbone and your pointer finger above the eyebrow. Gently stretch the skin so that it is not wrinkled or creased on the eyelid. Carefully draw a line, moving from the inner corner of the eye outward. This can be done in a single motion. You can also choose to stop and restart from where you left off, as long as you end up with an even, continuous line.


If done correctly, you should not need to re-apply liquid liner. It is not necessary to layer liquid liner to achieve a darker shade.
You may need to go back and fix mistakes where the line does not look even. You can compensate by filling in the line to make the eyeliner even, with no jagged parts.

, Concealer and a concealer brush will allow you to fix mistakes you may have made while drawing the line. Use the concealer to cover the parts that you would like to erase. This may require you to use a few layers of concealer to completely conceal the eyeliner, depending on how dark the color of the eyeliner is.


Be sure to blend the concealer into the rest of the makeup to prevent it from looking sloppy and the concealer from looking apparent to others.

Prime your eyelids.,
Use a liquid or gel eyeliner.,
Apply your eyeliner.,
Create the wing.",How to Apply Eyeliner for Dramatic Makeup1," You can find eyelid primers at a beauty supply store or your local pharmacy. You can either pick a primer that matches your skin tone or one that matches the eye shadow you’ll be using. A little goes a long way when it comes to priming! This is an extremely important step, because primers help your eyeliner go on smoothly and give it the staying power to last all day or night.Nothing ruins an impeccable makeup look quite like smearing.









Squeeze a tiny amount of primer onto the back of your hand.
Dip your finger into the product and then dab it onto your eyelid.
Blend it in completely, focusing particularly on the creases.;
, Both types of eyeliner allow you to create thin, precise lines, which is necessary for the winged effect.It is much harder to create precise lines with an eyeliner pencil. If you are using a gel, use a thin pointed or angled eyeliner brush to apply. Get a feel for your chosen product before you begin lining your eye, as both liquid and gel eyeliners can be slightly more difficult to apply than pencil. Create a couple lines on the back of your hand so that you can see how the product goes on.








, You should apply it in short strokes, right across your lash line. Begin in the middle of your eye, slowly extending the line to the inner and outer corners. Once you’ve applied the product across your entire lash line, examine your lid in a mirror to determine if it's even. Apply more eyeliner, thickening out the line, as necessary.








A general rule of thumb is to make the line thinner as you get toward the inner corner of your eye, and thicker as you move outwards.

, You can do this by following the curve of your bottom waterline. In other words, imagine a line running underneath your eye to the outer corner, and then continuing out past your eye. That imaginary line extending past your outer corner is where you should apply your eyeliner. Very carefully use your brush to draw a thin line following the angle of the bottom waterline. Extend your top eyeliner to meet the line, joining them together in a sharp point.









As you draw the line out away from your eye, slowly decrease pressure so that the end of the wing is narrow and sharp. It should be almost a flicking motion. If you use steady pressure to draw this line, you'll create a thick line with a blunt end. The sharp, precise point is the thing that makes this winged look so iconic.

, Since tightlining requires applying eyeliner closer to your eyeball, make sure that your chosen eyeliner is waterproof. Tightlining is easiest with a pencil eyeliner, but you can use a cream or gel eyeliner.The eyeliner can be any color, but for a “natural” look, try to use an eyeliner that matches your eyelash color (brown, light brown, or black).


Avoid using liquid liner for tightlining. The liquid liner will not dry quickly and can leak onto your actual eyeball, causing pain and irritation.
If you choose to use a pencil liner, consider using a plastic twist up liner rather than a wooden pencil liner.The wooden edges of the liner can irritate your eyes.
If you choose to use a gel or cream liner that doesn’t come in a pencil style, apply with an angled or flat edged brush.This will help you apply the liner accurately.

, Your waterline is more vulnerable to infection than the rest of your eyelid. To remove bacteria that can collect on makeup implements, sharpen your eyeliner pencil each time before tightlining.A sharp pencil is also easier to use for this precise task.

Do not borrow someone else's eyeliner.

, Raise your chin to tilt your head back a little bit and look up.While your eyelashes are grazing your brow bone, use a cue tip or the end of a dry makeup brush to press your lashes upward and hold them in place on your brow bone. Now you can look down while keeping your upper waterline exposed.


If you're having trouble exposing your waterline, gently increase the upward pull on your lashes until your eyelid is stretched taut.
You may use your finger instead, but the heavier pressure may cause creases and make even application more difficult.

, Start by placing your eyeliner vertically on the outer corner of your waterline. Your waterlines are the moist rims near the base of your eyelashes, which come in contact with each other when you blink.Trace your upper waterline back and forth with your eyeliner.Do this two or three times, depending on how deep you want the color to be. Repeat on your other eye.


Don’t trace your eyeliner all the way into the inner corner of your eye. This will make your tightlining look unnatural. Stop when your get to the area where your tear duct starts, or where your lashes start to thin out.If you plan to only tightline your upper lid (which makes your eyes look bigger), take care not to blink while applying. If you blink before the eyeliner dries, you'll transfer a little eyeliner to the lower lid and lose the effect. Using eye drops before you begin may help.

, You may use the same eyeliner for this, or an eye shadow of a similar color. If using eyeliner, gently stipple and dot the spaces between your lashes. If using eye shadow, push it up into the base of your lashes.If you use eye shadow to fill in the spaces between your lashes, make sure to use an angled edged brush. This will help add pigment with precision.

, If you would like a little more pop to your look, gently run your eyeliner near the base of your lower eyelashes.Most people apply this just below the lower waterline, not directly on it. Be aware that dark eyeliner on your lower lids can make your eyes look smaller.


Try not to make this lining too thick or too dark, because it will detract from your natural makeup look. Do this on both of your eyes.

, If you like, use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes. Open up the curler, fit your lashes in the curler’s open space, and gently close the curler shut. Make sure the rubber strip of the curler is right at the base of your eyelashes. Softly squeeze the curler with a pulsating rhythm.Curl both of your eyelashes in this way.


For added curl, after squeezing the curler vertically, turn the curler horizontally (following the curve of your eyeball) and squeeze a couple more times.Always curl your eyelashes using light pressure. If you feel pain or discomfort, adjust the curler and try again.

Apply primer to your eyelids.,
Put a piece of Scotch tape underneath your eye.,
Apply black eye shadow.,
Buff the eyeliner out with a clean blending brush.",How to Apply Eyeliner for Dramatic Makeup2," Although this look is a smudged, smoky look, you still don’t want it smearing all over your eyelid. A primer will prevent the eyeliner from smudging or creasing, and it will create a smooth base for the eyeliner. Squeeze a tiny amount of primer onto the back of your hand. Dip your finger into the product, dab it onto your eyelid, and blend it in completely.







, This should hit at the outer corner of your eye, extending from underneath your eye out at the angle of your bottom waterline. This might sound (and look!) a bit crazy, but it will allow you to create a sultry, smudged line on the top of your eyelid with a clean, crisp bottom border. Apply the tape to both eyes, making sure that they’re symmetrical.








Because you’re using sticky tape on your face, it’s best to do this look before you apply your foundation.

, You should apply this directly to your top lash line with a small eyeliner brush. Because this look requires blending, powder is the best option. Begin applying the product in small strokes, slowly working your way from the middle of the lid to the inner and outer corners. The line should be thin at the inner corner of the eye, and thicker as it moves outward. Continue to extend the line outward at the outer corner of the eye, following the line of the tape.







, This is how you create the beautiful smoky effect. Blend it out until you are satisfied with how it looks. The tape makes this step virtually fool-proof, because the product will only go onto the top lid. Once you gently remove the tape, you have a beautiful, crisp line.

Apply eyeliner to your bottom lash line.,
Use white eyeliner.,
Play around with shapes and thickness.",How to Apply Eyeliner for Dramatic Makeup3," This will create an intense, darker look. Bottom eyeliner can smudge, giving the appearance of dark circles, so it should be applied very carefully. Apply it from the outer corner inwards, stopping three-fourths of the way in. Blend it out gently, so that the line doesn’t appear harsh. You want your eyes to look beautiful and dramatic, not exhausted!








After you’ve finished applying your bottom eyeliner, dip a cotton swab in makeup remover and clean up the skin underneath.

, White eyeliner is great for making your eyes appear bigger and brighter. There are several different ways you can apply it. Applying it to the bottom waterline will make your eyes appear bigger, and you can still use a regular eyeliner underneath. Dot a bit of white eyeliner into the inner corners of your eyes and blend it out gently with your finger tips to add some brightness and glimmer to your look.








If you’re feeling really brave, completely line your eyes in white eyeliner solo. It’s certainly not an everyday look, so it’s perfect if you want the drama!
Don’t feel obligated to stick with white. Try out pastel, bright, and even metallic colors for ultra-dramatic looks.

, The possibilities are truly endless. You can do an upside down cat eye, where you fully line the bottom lash line, rather than the top, and extend it upwards. You can double wing your eyes, adding an additional, smaller wing below the traditional wing. You can try applying your eyeliner extremely thick, in a bold stripe across your lash line. For a super intense look, try tracing your eyeliner along your crease line as well as your lash line!Truly, there are no rules when it comes to applying eyeliner. If you want a bold, dramatic look, don’t be afraid to get creative and take some beauty risks.

Make a Grecian cross along the back.",How to Wear a Two‐in‐One Dress1," A two-in-one dress usually has two long straps that can be tied in different ways depending on the cut you want. For a basic cross front halter, simply take the two straps dangling from just below your chest on the dress. Cross them over one another, making them intersect just below your neck. Then, tie the two straps around the back of your neck so the crossed lines lay flat on your chest. This creates an easy cross front halter that can work for many occasions., For some occasions, you may your front covered completely by the straps, creating the illusion of small sleeves. To achieve this, drape both straps over your shoulders. Letting the straps hang somewhat loosely, resembling short sleeves, loop both straps around your front. Then, loop the front around your back to secure your look in place. Tie the straps tightly at your back, but leave enough slack that the straps create a sleeve-like effect.When you're done, it should look like you're wearing a v-cut dress with short sleeves.
This may be hard to do alone. Ask a friend for help.

, A conventional halter top will look much fancier with the addition of a bow. Pull both straps around the back of your neck and tie them together. Two straps at the front of the dress should cover your breasts.

Leave enough of the straps untwisted to cover your breasts. Tie the straps together behind your neck. In front, two straps should cover your breasts. In back, twist the two twisted straps together with one another. Follow the twist down the center of your back. Then, untwist the remaining slack. Move the untwisted portion of your straps around your front, then again around your back. Tie the straps together to secure.When you're done, you should have two straps covering your breast in front. In the back, you should have one braided twist stretching across your back.

, Primer is the base for the rest of your makeup. It helps the eyeshadow and liner to adhere to the eyelid without smudging or fading away. It will make your eye makeup last much longer than if you were not to use primer.Makeup primer can be purchased at drug stores and beauty stores. Primer can range in price but you can find quality products at an affordable price, such as Nyx Cosmetics.Primer can be applied with the fingers and a little goes a long way. Squirt a pea-sized amount onto the tip of your finger, rub together with your other finger, and apply to both eyelids.

, Concealer will hide any veins, discolorations, or uneven coloring of the eyelid and will provide a nice, neutral base to work with. Dab a pea-sized amount onto the tip of your finger and apply to the lid. Repeat on the other side. Make sure to blend it until it is absorbed into the eyelid.

, The best type of eyeliner to use to create a graphic eye look is liquid liner. You can also use an angled eyeliner brush and some dark powder to trace where you want your eyeliner to go, but ultimately, you will be using liquid liner to create the look. The best type of liquid liner to use is a brush or a fine-tipped felt pen. These will give you the most precise application.Kat Von D’s Tattoo Liner in Trooper is a popular eyeliner to use that is extremely precise, yet easy to use., Starting at the outer corner of the eye, slowly and carefully draw a line where the eyeliner wing should be. Generally speaking, you will want the wing to extend in the same direction as your lower eyelid. In other words, create a flick that looks as if it is extending straight out from the outer corner of your eye, rather than one that flicks upward or downward too much.


You can use a piece of clear tape to use as a guide and to ensure that the line is straight. This will help you to achieve a more precise line.
Use a concealer brush to fix mistakes. Dab your brush into your concealer and use it to gently cover up any mistakes. If you accidentally drew the line a bit crooked, the concealer will help you disguise the error.

, Now that you have your line, connect it to the top line of your eyelid, along the lash line, creating a cat-eye style eyeliner look. Carefully and slowly finish lining your upper eyelid, taking care not to blink and smudge your liner. It can be helpful to be looking down into a lighted makeup mirror, which can be purchased at grocery or beauty stores, for this part.

, In the same manner as you did the top lid, draw a line on the lower lid that is parallel to, but not touching, the wing on the upper lid. The flick will be going outward from the outer corner of the eye. This will guide you on where the eyeliner should go and what angle it should flick out at.

, The line along the bottom eyelid should gently follow the curve of the lower lash line. It should not be applied to the waterline; rather, it should be applied just below the bottom lashes. Carefully line the bottom lid, making sure the liner is less thick than on the upper lid. Connect to the flick that you drew, creating a smooth, uninterrupted line from one corner of the eye to the other. Repeat on the other side., Use eyeliner to line the top of your upper lash line. The liner will need to be thick enough for you to erase a small section of eyeliner and use the empty space to create a triangle. Creating an eyeliner wing is optional; however, it will add drama to the look.


If you would like to create a wing, draw a straight line starting from the outer corner of your eye to guide where you will want your eyeliner to wing out. Connect the line back to the upper lash line. Finish lining the rest of your upper lash line. When you are finished, you will have a line from one corner of your eye to the other corner, with a wing at the end.

, Hold up a Q-Tip and drape a makeup removing wipe around the tip. The purpose of this is to precisely remove a small section of eyeliner. The Q-Tip will allow you to be more precise than if you just used the tip of your finger with the wipe. Holding the makeup removing wipe on top of the Q-Tip, begin rubbing away a small section of the liner, no wider than the eraser of a pencil, in the middle of the lid.

, After erasing a section of the eyeliner, you will have two sides: a left side and a right side. Starting at the top of line on each side, draw a line at a 45 degree angle going down toward the lash line, meeting in the center of the empty space. This should create a triangle shape. Since this method uses negative space (i.e. your eyelid) to create the triangle, you do not need to fill it in. , Using small and precise motions, line the upper lash line with black eyeliner. Draw the line from one corner of the eye to the other. You can choose to add a wing or not, depending on what you prefer and enjoy doing.

, To add a bit of drama and art to your eyeliner, add a second line, which will be drawn on above the black eyeliner. This will give your eyes a pop of color and will add some flair to your overall look. A thinner eyeliner applicator or brush will help with preciseness.

, Starting from the inner corner of the eye, draw the colored line right above the black line. Using small flicks, draw the line until you have reached the end of the first line. Drawing this line can require a lot of precision, so as not to draw an uneven line that will cover up the black line. It can also be a bit easier because you will be using the first line as a guide.

, When you are finished with your graphic eyeliner look, apply a layer or two of mascara to your eyelashes. Hold the wand at the base of the lashes and gently wiggle it. Then draw the wand upward and outward along the lashes. For a second layer, start at the base of the lashes and move the wand up and outward again.

Start from the inner corner of your eye and work toward the outer corner.
The line does not need to be especially neat at this point, even though it should be thin. You will end up going over the line again, so a little roughness will not make much difference at this point.
Keep your eyelid as flat as possible while doing this. If necessary, tilt your head back and just barely keep your eye cracked open as you apply the liner.;
, Hold your eyeliner pencil at the end point of your bottom lash line. Point it upward diagonally so that it looks like a continuation of your lower lash line.

The line will extend diagonally up and out.
If you have a hooded eyelid, you may need to angle the wing more outward than upward to avoid the hooded part of your lid.

, This line should roughly match the guideline you visualized when holding the liner pencil against your eyelid. In other words, it should almost look like an extension of your lower lash line.

Before you start, make sure you have a mirror around, also make sure your elbow or arm is on a stable surface. This allows for more control over creating your wing!
Begin at the very tip of the eyeliner line drawn above your upper lash line.
Draw a diagonal line roughly 45 degrees out and up. The line should be heading in the general direction of the end of your eyebrow.
The length of the wing is up to you. A more subtle winged eyeliner look should have a short line at this point, but a more dramatic one can extend up to just below your brow bone. Never extend it all the way up to the eyebrow itself.

, With your eyelid as flat and taut as possible, draw a straight diagonal line from the very tip of the wing down to the middle of your upper lash line.

This does not have to be especially thorough if you plan on tracing over the pencil eyeliner with liquid liner later on.
Fill in the eyeliner as close to the eyelashes as possible to avoid gaps of skin peeking through. The idea is to blend your eyelashes into the eyeliner.

, To make it appear as though the wing is getting thinner naturally as it goes into the eye, you should use short strokes of your eyeliner pencil to smooth out the corner between the end of your wing and the liner on the upper lash line.

The eyeliner should be its thinnest at the innermost corner, but it should appear as though it is gradually getting thinner in this direction.

, The piece of tape should extend from the corner of your eye toward the end of your eyebrow./images/thumb/e/ef/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-7-Version-5.jpg

For further guidance, the tape should line up from the nose to the outside corner of your eye, finally ending toward the tip of your brow. You should only have the tape extend from the corner of your eye to the brow, though, if possible.
If you want a more subtle, less angled wing, apply the tape at a slightly more outward angle instead a more upward angle.
Make sure that the tape is pressed against your skin well so that no liner bleeds through as you apply it.
If your skin is too sensitive to use tape on, hold a credit card or other small, straight edged object against your skin at the same angle.

, Using a light eyeliner pencil, draw a thin line above your upper lash line. This line should be as thin as possible and as close to your upper lash line as possible. Extend the line all the way to the edge of the tape.

Start from the inner corner of your eye and work toward the outer corner.
The line does not need to be especially neat at this point since you will go over the line again. While a little roughness will not make much difference at this point, though, you should avoid making the line too thick since doing so will only make the end result look chunkier and unpleasantly thick.
Keep your eyelid as flat as possible while doing this. If you have trouble doing this with your face forward, tilt your head back and just barely keep your eye cracked open as you apply the liner.

Do not be afraid to get a little eyeliner on the tape. If you stuck it on securely enough, the liner should not bleed through. This is especially true if you are using a light pencil liner.
Carefully remove the tape when done.

, Go back over the line of the wing and upper lash line with your eyeliner pencil. The outer edge should look thicker than the inner corner.

Do not start at the top tip of the wing. For aesthetic purposes, this part should be left as a fine point.
The outer part of the wing should come in at a curve. Most of the eyeliner should follow the natural shape of your eye, but the liner should be a little thicker toward the outer corner of the upper lash line and as thin as possible toward the inner corner.

, Take a step back. Blink, walk around for a couple of minutes, and chase the look of your face from the freshest place in your mind before examining how your eyeliner looks again. Sometimes, staring at something for too long can distort our image of it. Make a judgment on your success or failure only after stepping away to give yourself a fresh perspective.

As you examine the way your eyes look, you should also compare the way that both eyes look in relation to one another. The wings should be fairly even.

, Fill in the entire outline with this liquid liner.

By double-layering the eyeliner like this, you allow yourself more control over the shape. This creates a darker, more convincing wing shape.
Rest the elbow of your working hand on the table or counter. Doing this will help steady your hands as you apply the liner.
Make sure that you press the eyeliner wand or pen as close to the lash line as absolutely possible to prevent gaps between the eyelashes and eyeliner.

, If the pencil liner appears jagged or uneven at certain places, you can carefully clean it up by dipping an angled eyeliner or eye shadow brush into a bit of makeup remover and tracing over those edges./images/thumb/3/37/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-13-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-13-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/3/37/Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-13-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Winged-Eyeliner-Step-13-Version-5.jpg









In a pinch, you could also use a cotton swab to erase mistakes. A pointed cotton swab can be more effective in cleaning up mistakes than a round swab.
You can also use concealer to mask over any mistakes. Use your fingers, a brush, or a cotton swab and gently apply the concealer over any mistakes or unclean edges.

, After applying the liquid liner, let it dry briefly before you blink. If you blink immediately after applying it, the eyeliner could smear.

Use an eyeliner pencil.,
Try liquid eyeliner.,
Buy a cosmetic brush or some cotton swabs.,
Pull your lower lid taut.,
Run the eyeliner pencil along the edge of the lower lid.,
Do the same for the upper lid.,
Touch up the outer corner of the eye.,
Smooth the lines.,
Smudge the eyeliner.,
Draw on a ""winged"" edge.,
Line just one lid.,
Go with a different shade.",How to Apply Eyeliner (Men)," The most common method for applying guyliner is by using an eyeliner pencil. These pencils have soft, malleable points that draw on smoothly and have a rich, dark, creamy color. Eyeliner pencils are easy to come by and can be purchased in most drug stores or supermarkets in the personal hygiene section. They come in multiple colors and shades, but black is standard and is the most masculine.Using a pencil will allow you to draw on more precise lines and contours, but because of their sharp tips and closeness to the eye they require a bit more practice.
Run the tip of a new eyeliner pencil over the soft part of your palm a few times before you begin applying it to your eyelid. This will blunt the tip somewhat so that it doesn’t poke or scratch.;
, If it’s your first time putting on guyliner and you’re uncomfortable with having a pointy pencil tip near your eye, you might try a liquid eyeliner applicator. Rather than a soft pencil-lead type point, liquid eyeliners go on wet using a thin brush tip that lets you trace precise lines, then dries around the eye. A liquid eyeliner can make a good alternative for the inexperienced user, or for those looking to draw on darker, thicker lines.It can be tough to draw on thin, straight lines using a liquid eyeliner, but one advantage of a liquid and brush combination is that it lends itself to creating a much more fluid coat around the eye.

, A chisel brush or any similar thin, soft cosmetic brush can be used to soften the edges of the eyeliner after it’s been applied. A simple cotton swab will also do, although the fluffy texture of the cotton might smear the eyeliner too much and make a mess. While not a necessity, a makeup brush or cotton swab can soften lines for a more natural contour around the eye for those who don’t want that hard-edged look.Small sweeps of a makeup brush will blend the hard edges of the eyeliner.
Dampen the cotton swab before you use it to blend.

, You’ll be lining the upper and lower lids separately. It’s usually easier to begin with the lower lid because your vision won’t be obstructed by your drawing hand. Use a finger at the outer edge of the eyelid to pull the lid taut; this will allow you to draw straighter lines without accidentally moving the eyelid. Pull the lid slightly downward so that you can start the line close to the inner eyelid to avoid creating gaps., Carefully place the point of the eyeliner pencil or brush just above the lower eyelash line and make short, linear strokes from the inner edge of the eye outward. Keep the lines as close to the inner eyelid as you can and try not to overlap. Go over the lines a few times from one side of the lid to the other until you achieve the desired style and thickness.Go slowly, even if you’re used to putting on guyliner. You’re working very close to the surface of the eye, so you don’t want to make a mistake.
Eyeliner can be applied either inside or outside the lash line depending on the look you're trying to achieve. Lining inside the lash line is more subtle and less distracting, while lining outside the lash line creates the appearance of thickness and is helpful in restructuring eye shape.

, Place a finger just below your eyebrow and pull the upper eyelid up and across. Once again, line the lid from the inner edge out, staying along the area just above the eyelashes. Go slowly and make sure you’ve got a good view of the eyelid and pencil in the mirror. Since the upper eyelid is thinner than the lower one, it’s easier to slip., Now that you’ve lined the upper and lower eyelids, use a few small strokes to fill in the space in the outer corner of the eye and connect the lines. This will give the eye a one-piece ringed look. Don’t fill in the inner corner of the eye—this is where the tear ducts are, and eyeliner that gets into these crevices can run and sting, causing a buildup of sticky black eye boogers and possibly even leading to infection.


Try not to “color in” the outer corner of the eye. This can end up looking more like a black eye than an expressive accent. Instead, line the upper and lower lids and go around the outer corner lightly, just enough to keep the lines from looking disjointed.

, Using the chisel brush or a damp cotton swab, go over the eyeliner with a sweeping motion to blend and soften the edges. You can also leave eyeliner as-is once you’ve drawn it on, but it will have a sharper, more jagged look, and any small mistakes you’ve made in the lines will be more noticeable. If you’ve drawn the eyeliner on thicker than you’d like or smeared it while smoothing, use a wet paper towel to wipe the area., Some proponents of guyliner, like Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance, prefer a deliberately smudged, messy look to their eyeliner. To accomplish this, apply the eyeliner thickly and then use a brush, cotton swab or the point of your finger to smudge it around and outward from your eye. Add more eyeliner as needed until you’re able to create the effect you’re after., Rather than simply penciling around the lash line, a winged liner can be used to add new dimensions to the shape of the eye. This technique will be useful in crafting a more theatrical look for themed dress, costume or the stage. Fold one corner of a small strip of tape over on itself and stick the tape on just under the lower eyelid. Then, line the eye as your normally would, but finish by drawing a short line from the outer edge of the eye to the tape and filling in the angular space it creates. You'll be left with an exotic flourish that provides an interesting alternative to regular contoured lining.Any type of tape will be sufficient for stenciling around the underside of the eye, but a softer tape with a weaker adhesive, such as masking or surgical tape, will probably work best as it won't cause irritation or discomfort once it's peeled off.
Be careful not to make the ""wing"" too large, or it may end up looking cartoonish.

, This is a less common approach, but one sometimes taken by Johnny Depp, Russell Brand and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. Lightly line only the upper or lower eyelid, or apply it partially to just the outer edge of the eye. Partial lining can bring out your eyes and lend a dark, mysterious aesthetic without requiring you to encircle the whole eye.Because you’re going for a sleek, minimal eye effect, it will probably be easier to partially line using a pencil.

, While black is the popular choice for guyliner enthusiasts, it’s not your only option. Stick with a masculine color palette, but take a look at different gradients of black and more natural flesh tones. A charcoal eyeliner or one a few shades deeper than your own skin tone can highlight your eyes as well as a black one and not be quite as starkly obvious. Weigh your options and decide on a product that you like and that complements the look you’re trying to create.Try out a few different brands and styles of eyeliner until you find the right consistency and shade.

Make the dress one shoulder.,
Add a bow to the single shoulder look.,
Go strapless.,
Go for a dress with straps.,
Make short sleeves.",How to Wear a Two‐in‐One Dress2," Start with both straps gently draped over your shoulders. Move one strap to the right, overlapping the other strap. This should create what looks like a longer strap over your right shoulder. Then, weave the straps behind your back together moving down until you're halfway down your back. At this point, move the straps over to the front of your body and then loop them around to the back of your body. Tie the straps together tightly in the back. When you're done, you should have a one shoulder dress., If you want to add some flare to the one shoulder look, repeat the same process above. However, stop when the first two straps are at your front. Instead of looping them around the back to tie, tie them together in the front. This will create a lovely bow for your dress., Start with the straps draped across each shoulder. Hold the straps together just above your breasts with one hand. With the other hand, move the straps off your shoulders. Move the straps behind your back. Then, loop them around to the front and pull them around to your back once more. Pull the straps together tightly at your back and tie them. You should be left with a mermaid-like sleeveless dress., Leave your strapless dress secured, but take the slack from the straps tied around your back. Pull them over your to your front and then toss them over your shoulders. Tie them together at the back of your neck. This will create two small straps for your dress., To create sleeves, leave your strapped dress in place. Unfold both straps slightly, and pull any balled up fabric downward covering your shoulders. This creates two short sleeves for your strapped dress."

Use a woven dressy belt for a night out.,
Wear flats during the day and heels for the night.,
Add fun jewelry for a night out.,
Use a belt to flatter your figure.",How to Wear a Two‐in‐One Dress3," If you want to make a basic dress more formal, layer a little. Cardigans and blazers can give a dress a professional feel, especially a sleeveless dress that may look out of place at work otherwise.For example, say you have a basic black sleeveless dress. To add formality, wear it with a form-fitted black blazer to match.
A short-sleeved t-shirt dress can be made more formal with a conservative cardigan.

, If you want to wear a dress out, but have a plainer two in one dress, there are many ways to tweak it for the occasion. A plain loose-fitting dress can be altered with a woven belt. A local clothing shop or thrift store should sell decorative, woven belts. You can wear these around your waist or just above your hips.Pick a belt that will look fun and carefree. For example, try a colorful woven belt with beads.
In addition to adding a little extra to the dress, a looser dress will flatter your figure more when worn with a belt.

, You can switch up your shoes and wear the dress at work and then to happy hour afterwords. Wear formal flats or dress shoes for your workday. Keep a pair of heels in your purse or bag to wear at night.In addition to changing up your shoe type, do other things to switch your outfit to something more casual at the end of the day. For example, you can let your hair down if you wore it up, remove layers like cardigans, and add some extra makeup.

, If you're going out in an otherwise plain dress, add some jewelry. Add flare to a plainer two in one dress with a clunky, flashy necklace and long, dangly earrings. You can also add bracelets, rings, and hair clips.Go for jewelry that is attention catching. Anything with sparkles or sequins works.

, To change a loose-fitting dress to a new look, use a belt. Pick up a belt that cinches at the waist at a local clothing store. Wear the belt over your middle to give yourself a more flattering figure. This can make a looser two-in-one dress more stylish and flattering.Remember the occasion. Choose a more formal belt, like a plain black belt, for work. Go for something fun and colorful for a night out.

Wear something under the dress.,
Alternate between boots and lighter shoes.,
Use tights based on season.",How to Wear a Two‐in‐One Dress4," A sleeveless dress can be worn in the winter with one quick alteration. During the colder months, find a sheer or see through sleeved dress. You can wear this over your sheer dress, providing you warmth as well as a new outfit.For added warmth and style, accessorize with scarves and hats.

, A long, loose dress can be worn under another outfit. Consider slipping on a thin t-shirt or even another very thin dress first. Then, pull your dress over the outfit. This adds dimension and warmth to your outfit., Some dresses are relatively warm and can be worn year round. To switch up your outfit, use your footwear. Wear different shoes based on season to make a dress work for multiple times of the year.For example, for winter you can wear warmer flats, boots, and work shoes with your dress.
During the warmer months, opt for things like sandals, light flats, and flip-flops.

, Many two in one dresses can be worn with and without tights. To switch up your look by season, wear a dress with tights during the winter.

Use a waterproof black or brown eyeliner.,
Apply concealer first.,
Draw one dot beneath each eye at the center of your lash line.,
Get a throwback Twiggy look with exaggerated top lashes.,
Keep the rest of your makeup minimal.",How to Do Dot Eyeliner1," The most basic, and also most natural looking, dot eyeliner look is created with either brown or black eyeliner. Black is generally preferred if you want to create a doll-like appearance, which is often the aim of this trend.To make sure your look stays put, use a waterproof eyeliner.Start with brown eyeliner if black feels too dramatic for you.
Liquid and pencil formulas both work great, although a liquid liner will provide the most control and precision.;
, Along with using waterproof formulas, prepping your eye area with concealer first will help keep your look long lasting and smudge proof. Apply a creamy concealer directly beneath both eyes, taking care to work it all the way up to your lash line. Blend it in so that it looks natural, then dust the area with translucent powder to set the concealer.







, For the most natural look, create the two dots close to the bottom lash lines. If you want a little more impact, draw the dots a few millimeters away from the lash line. The further you stray from the lash line, the more dramatic and noticeable the results are. The size of the dot is up to you. Draw pinpoints for a bohemian flair; go bigger to create more drama.








Make sure you line up the dots with your pupils so that everything appears symmetrical.Don’t go any larger than the width of a pencil eraser. Anything larger will have a clown-like effect.

, Dot eyeliner enjoyed immense popularity in the 60s because of the model Twiggy, who used the makeup trick to emphasize her lashes and create a wide-eyed, demure look. Apply the dots, then brush several coats of mascara onto your top lashes.









Normally you’d want to avoid clumps of lashes getting stuck together, but this look is emphasized even more by dramatic “clumps” of top lashes.

, To avoid looking theatrical (unless that’s what you’re going for!), keep the rest of your makeup simple and fresh-looking. Use foundation or BB cream to even out your skin tone and put on a small amount of blush to give your cheeks a healthy glow. Apply cream eyeshadow in a neutral shade, then shape your eyebrows so that they frame your face in a natural-looking way.








A bright lip is sometimes worn with this look, or you can go for a nude lip so that all of the emphasis is on your eyes.

Follow lower lash line for a winged look.",How to Apply Eyeliner1," To ensure that the liquid liner is well-mixed, you will need to shake the bottle. Make sure that the lid is secured first and then shake the liquid liner for a few seconds. When you are ready, unscrew the cap and pull the brush out of the bottle.If the brush seems to have too much liner on it, then swipe it across the edge of the liner bottle.;
, Place the brush against your upper lash line so that it is as close as possible to your eye lashes. Then, begin applying eyeliner to your upper lash line.

Try creating just a small wing if you do not want to look too dramatic, or go for a longer wing for a high drama look.
You can use the edge of a business card to help you create a straight line for the wing. Just place the business card against the outer edge of your eyelid at an angle and trace along the edge with the liquid liner.You can also use tape to create wings. Place some tape on your lower lash line so that it is at an angle. The tape should be right up against the outer edge of your lower lash line and extending up towards your eyebrow. You can tilt the tape as much or as little as you want, but keep in mind that more tilt will look more dramatic. If you want a less dramatic look, reduce the amount of tilt in your tape."

Pick a flared or a-line skirt for comfort.,
Choose a skirt that sits at the natural waist.,
Try a high-low skirt.,
Go for a little extra length in a fitted skirt.,
Consider a skort.,
Wear loose shirts or sweaters.,
Layer over the skirt.,
Wear tights or leggings underneath.,
Hide spandex underneath.,
Wear flat, comfortable shoes.,
Walk on even surfaces.,
Bend at the knees when bending over.,
Keep your knees together while sitting.",How to Wear a Short Skirt Without Looking Overexposed," Try a short skirt that isn’t fitted and flares out from your body. This will prevent the discomfort and exposure of a tight skirt that tends to ride up the legs.


While standing, most short skirts tend to have a hemline a few centimeters above the mid thigh level.
Try a skater style skirt, a pleated skirt, or a button-down skirt in denim, velvet, or corduroy for some on-trend fashions that aren’t so tight and uncomfortable.
Note that flowy, loose short skirts can easily blow up when a breeze comes through! You might favor a thicker denim, wool, or corduroy material for a windy day outside.;
, Get a skirt with a waistband that’s meant to sit at your natural waist, which is the narrowest part of your torso. While it still falls at a normal length for a short skirt, you can feel a little more covered and secure with fabric covering your midsection.


Look for an elastic waistband for extra comfort, good fit, and better ability to move around.
Flared styles that rest at the natural waist can help elongate the body and accentuate the waist on short or curvy bodies., Consider the high-low skirt as a good hybrid of a short skirt and a skirt with more coverage. Find one of these skirts, which can be quite short in the front but longer in the back, to avoid exposure when you bend over or move around.


Pair this style easily with dressy or casual tops and shoes, and use it as an easy transition from cooler to warmer weather.You can also try a skirt that is asymmetrical from side to side, so one leg is exposed more than the other., If you choose a fitted body con skirt in a stretchy material, look for one that is slightly longer in length. Because it hugs your body, it will still feel short, but a little extra length accommodates for any riding up the material will do.


Also look for fitted skirts that just skim the outline of your legs rather than hugging them tightly, as this will prevent it from riding up and give you a break from pulling it down all the time.
Try a denim skirt for a fabric that won’t ride up, but note that it likely won’t be as stretchy and comfortable as a fitted knit skirt.

, Try a skirt with built-in shorts underneath for a comfortable style with no fear of exposing yourself when you move around or the wind comes up.


Note that “skort” is the name that was originally used for a garment that had a skirt flap in the front but with shorts showing in the back, while a “scooter” had skirt panels covering shorts entirely. In modern fashion, the latter style is favored but the names are used interchangeably.Look out for a style that has skirt panels that fall lower than the hidden shorts so they don’t peek out accidentally.

, Pair a short skirt with tops that cover more skin in loose, comfortable fabric. You can pull on some comfy sweaters for fall and winter, or keep the material light and thin for warmer weather while still feeling a little more covered up.


If you feel a little uncomfortable with how much skin you’re showing with a short skirt, look for tops with higher necklines and sleeves to cover up more skin on top.
Pick longer, drapey styles in a top to provide contrast from a structured or fitted skirt. Wear more structured tops that fall right at the waistline to contrast a looser a-line or flowing skirt.
Try wearing a short skirt with a fitted tank and then donning a long, sheer top that covers the tank and skirt completely for a fun and unique look that is totally covered up while still showing off the skirt underneath., Add sweaters, cardigans, jackets, and wraps to your outfit so that they can fall over your skirt. This will help break up the short line of the skirt and allow you to feel more covered and secure.


Try wearing a long coat or cardigan over a short skirt. Keep it unfastened in the front so you can still show off your skirt and bare legs while being covered in the back., Pull on a pair of tights underneath a short skirt to cover up your legs a little more for warmth or modesty. Wear a thicker legging for more coverage or for a colder climate.


Try a neutral color like black, white, or a shade that matches your skin tone for tights that go well with any outfit. Or, bring a pop of color to a more muted outfit with bright colored or patterned tights.You can experiment with the opacity of tights, too. If you’d still like to show some skin, opt for a sheer variety. If you’d like to cover up more, go for opaque ones.
Textured tights, like fishnet, lace, or ribbed can help keep a form-fitting skirt from riding up.

, Consider wearing small spandex shorts meant for sports or biking underneath any short skirt you wear. They’ll make you feel a little more secure and prepared for a surprise breeze or other revealing accident.


Make sure spandex shorts are short enough that they won’t show underneath your skirt intentionally.
Get spandex shorts in a neutral color like black, or even match them to the color of your skirt if possible.

, Wear a short skirt with flats, sneakers, booties, or tall boots rather than high heels. Heels accentuate the length of the leg, which can make you feel like you’re showing even more skin than you are, not to mention that they can be uncomfortable and add to a feeling of vulnerability and exposure.


Casual sneakers and flats help downplay the short length of a skirt. Add other casual pieces of clothing to your skirt outfit to achieve a similar effect.Try a taller leather riding boot, cowboy boot, or even a thigh-high boot to cover up more skin while still showing off your short skirt.

, Try to walk carefully and on even surfaces when wearing a short skirt. Avoid the skirt riding up or moving around too much by taking smaller steps.


Avoid wearing high heels, as these will only make it harder to walk when you have to manage both a short skirt and the risk of tripping or falling on uneven surfaces.
Remember the weather and check for a windy day before you don a flowing skirt to walk around outside in. For a day you know you’ll spend walking outdoors, you might want to wear a more structured skirt that skims the body with a heavy material that will stay put.
Try not to keep tugging at your skirt, even if it may feel too short. It will only draw unnecessary attention. Try to hold yourself confidently while wearing them.
If you are a school student, try to avoid all physical activities such as running or jumping.

, If you have to bend down or move to sit down, make sure to bend from your knees, keeping the hemline of your skirt level rather than making the back come up with your forward movement.


Also try holding the back of your skirt close to your body before you bend over. This is especially useful before sitting down, as it keeps the skirt down and flat rather than hiked up or rumpled underneath you.

, Press your legs and especially your knees together whenever you’re sitting in a skirt to avoid exposing yourself.


Try crossing your legs or tucking one ankle behind the other to help keep legs closed comfortably when sitting in a chair.
If you have to sit on the floor, sit on your shins with your legs folded straight under you.
While sitting in a short skirt, almost the entirety of your thighs will be exposed and this will be even more obvious when you're wearing a tight miniskirt. As a countermeasure, you can place a purse, jacket, or other clothing item or accessory over your lap when sitting to help avoid the risk of others seeing up your skirt."

, This will dull down your look, and won't bring attention to either your sarong or outfit. If you must wear solid colored sarongs and clothes together, consider wearing an interesting belt, necklace, or accessory.

, In contrast to wearing only solids, wearing only patterns will make your outfit look too busy. The patterns may also clash, and neither your sarong or outfit will stand out.

, They are perfect for keeping you covered during the short trip between your car or hotel room and the pool or beach. Keep in mind that some sarongs are transparent. If you are self-conscious about this, place your hand behind the sarong before you buy it. If you can see your hand, people will be able to see your swimsuit.


Avoid wearing white sarongs with dark-colored swimsuits—unless this is the look you are going for. White sarongs will be transparent.
Patterned sarongs can make great, long dresses.

, Sometimes, your stay at the beach or pool may extend into the evening. It might be too cool to just wear your swimsuit, but too warm to put on a sweater. A sarong will cover you just enough to keep you warm.

, If you are nervous about your sarong slipping off, you can pair it with a belt. If you are using the sarong as a skirt, wear the belt as your hips. If you are using the sarong as a dress, place the belt as your waist, or the narrowest part of your torso. This will help cinch the excess fabric in.

, It is a piece of plastic, metal or wood that has two holes in it. Pull the corners of your sarong through each hole until it is tight and secure. Your sarong will remain secure without the need for bulky knots., Leather sandals and belts, woven hats, and seashell necklaces work great with sarongs.

When you’re doing a statement look like this, it’s important to keep the rest of your makeup minimal. Pulling off multiple dramatic makeups looks simultaneously doesn’t typically work well (unless you’re in costume).

, Experiment with a central shade that you use to pull all of your makeup together, like red. For instance, you could use a cherry red liquid lipstick on your lips and use that same color on your cheeks as a subtle blush, similar to the way you’d use a cream blush on your cheeks. Find a matching cherry red eyeliner to create your dots. It may sound a little over the top, but others have pulled it off – you can, too!







, Liquid eyeliners in metallic shades like gold, silver and bronze have become popular in recent years, so they’re not hard to find at drugstores and beauty supply shops. Create a unique look by using them for dot eyeliner. Try creating barely perceptible pinpoints with metallic shades for a unique sparkle."

Put dots in places other than under your eyes.,
Vary the color and placement of your dots.",How to Do Dot Eyeliner3," Dot eyeliner has become so popular that almost everything has been road tested already, including using more than two dots.

This can create even more emphasis on your eyes and yield very interesting results. Try using a metallic shade at the inner and outer corners., There are no rules when it comes to makeup, especially when you’re experimenting and having fun.

Keep your palette neutral.,

Bronze your face.",How to Wear a Sequined Dress," Sequins make a big statement. When you are wearing a sequined dress, you are going to be turning heads. You don’t need a daring neckline or a dramatic silhouette on top of the sequins. Instead, look for a dress that has a pretty ordinary (and higher) neckline, hem, and so on. Let the sequins do the talking, not a plunging V-neck or an asymmetrical hem.There are plenty of styles with a ""simple"" design, so explore! You may opt for a strapless dress, a basic shift dress, a dress with a simple racer back, a t-shirt dress, a dress with spaghetti straps, and so on! When it comes to the cut, just remember that less really is more. Keep it basic!;
, “Long enough” probably means something different to everyone, but just make sure this isn’t the shortest dress you own. The downside of sequins is that they can look showy if not worn properly. It's okay to wear a mini dress, but try for one that you can sit in comfortably without worrying., You might be able to get away with a little black dress that bunches up a bit in the front or hangs a little off of your backside, but a sequined dress should fit like it was made for you. Because all eyes are going to be on you, you want to make sure your dress is doing you favors! Find a dress that hits you in all the right places and hangs just right.If this is a dress with sleeves, make sure the shoulders fit.
It may take a while to find the perfect dress, but it’ll be worth it.

, If you want a dress that is covered entirely in sequins, stick to one color and one color only. A sequin dress will make you stand out, but a patterned or multi-color sequin dress just becomes an eyesore. Whether your dress is black, silver, gold, red, or pink... choose one and stick to it!

, A sequined dress doesn't necessarily mean it's covered in sparkle. Dresses with sequin accents are trendy and often more versatile and ""wearable"" than a full-sequined number. For example, look for dresses with a sequin pocket, sequin elbow patches, sequin trim, and so on. A pop of sequins can go a long way!


Dresses that incorporate sequins through a pattern are also an excellent option. For example, a black dress with gold flowers made from sequins is fun without being over-the-top.

, If it’s a chillier day and you need to wear a jacket or tights with your dress, stick with black. Don’t get sparkle-crazy and throw a bedazzled jacket or shimmery tights on with your sequined dress. A sequined dress does all the talking, and the rest of your outfit should complement it. In other words, don’t match sparkle with sparkle!, A pair of simple, solid-colored heels or flats work perfectly. When in doubt, throw on a simple black pair. Avoid a metallic pair that will be shine overload. Ditch the shoes with an intricate design, because they’ll contrast with your sequined dress. There is a time and place for eye-catching footwear, but it’s not when you’re already rocking a flashy sequined dress., When you’re draped in sequins, you’ve got enough bling. Skip the earrings, necklaces, bracelets, or any other sort of jewelry. Any additional sparkle will be overpowering and make your outfit look busy. The great thing about wearing a great sequined dress is that you don’t need to spend any extra time picking out your jewelry!

, If it's a bit colder outside or you simply want to add another layer to your outfit, don't hesitate to throw something on top of your sequin dress – just make sure it's the right thing! Opt for a more structured material, rather than a knitted material that will snag on your sequins. For example, a silk blazer or a trendy leather jacket pair perfectly with a sequined frock.


Keep your outerwear simple in terms of color or detailing so that it remains secondary to the sequined dress.

, With your bold sequined dress, you don’t want to use any bright or daring colors on your face. Instead, use a neutral palette to enhance your features without looking like a Vegas showgirl. For eyeshadow, stick to colors like tan, brown, gray, or black. For your lips, stick to a nude or soft pink., Add color to your pout with a neutral lipstick, but don’t stop there. Add a layer of gloss over your lipstick to get a little bit of shine that will complement your sequined dress beautifully. The shimmer from your lips will brighten up your entire face and add a bit of festivity to your otherwise neutral makeup look., Nothing pairs better with a sparkling dress than healthy, glowing skin. Add a bit of blush to the apples of your cheeks. Then, dust your favorite bronzer on your cheekbones and along the top of your forehead. This will give your complexion a sun-kissed glow, which will work well with your vibrant ensemble.Don’t forget to brush bronzer onto your neck and chest so that all of your exposed skin matches!

While most clothing manufacturers size skirts according to the same basic measurements, you still try the skirt on before you buy it.


If a pencil skirt is too large, it may add too much extra volume to your midsection. As a result, your waist will look wider and your figure may take on a boxy appearance.
On the other hand, if a pencil skirt is too small, it may create bulges along your thighs, stomach, and rear. Super tight pencil skirts are also difficult to walk in.
If you aren't sure where to start, try to find a pencil skirt with a waistband that sits roughly 2 inches (5 cm) above your navel. The material should fit around the widest part of your hips without looking stretched, and it should taper off and end somewhere beneath that point instead of ending directly on it.;
, The length of the lower hemline and the height of the waistband will have slightly different effects on your overall appearance. While there are some general guidelines to consider, the best way to determine the right length and height for your figure will be to try on a variety of styles and gauge which one you prefer while standing in front of the mirror.


If you want to make yourself look taller or leaner, consider choosing a high-waisted style with a shorter hemline. By shifting the skirt further up along your body, you create the illusion of longer legs and a narrower waist.
On the other hand, taller women may wish to consider pencil skirts that drop down to the knee or just beneath it. You can still show off your naturally long legs with a short skirt, but the added length can have a sophisticated effect when you're tall enough to pull it off.

, Nowadays, pencil skirts are made from a wide range of fabrics and prints. You can stick with classic choices if you want a relatively versatile skirt, but if you're feeling bold, picking something more unique can be a great way to add more pizazz to your outfit.


It's hard to go wrong with a black pencil skirt, so if you want only one easy-to-style piece in your wardrobe, stick with black. Vibrant colors and prints can be somewhat difficult to dress up, but in comparison, a black pencil skirt can make the switch from professional to casual to seductive much more readily.
Also note the way that color, pattern, and texture affect your overall appearance. The more you stray from the standard black skirt, the more attention you'll draw to your lower half.

, The pencil skirt works well for most body types, but if you're notably curvy on the bottom, you might want to be a little more careful about the way you wear it. Since pencil skirts hug your thighs, they tends to accentuate your lower curves, and the resulting oomph in sex appeal may not be appropriate for all occasions.


To draw attention away from your lower half, stick with pencil skirts in dark, solid colors and pair them with patterned or textured tops. The visually stimulating top should draw the eye upward, drawing it away from your bottom half in the process.
Pay attention to the hemline, as well. Make sure that the hemline does not land at the widest part of your thighs; if it does land there, you'll only make the added volume look even more significant than usual. Skirts that hit just above or directly below the knees are usually a better choice since these are the narrowest points of your leg.

, If you've tried on a standard pencil skirt and don't like the way it fits your curves, don't give up. Try on another pencil skirt with a slit removed or darts sewn into it. Either option will change the shape of the skirt in a subtle way, and it may become more appealing to you.


To make your hips and legs look leaner, consider wearing a pencil skirt with two vertical darts sewn into the front. The darts draw in your waist and encourage the eye to look up-and-down, rather than side-to-side.
To accommodate a narrow waist and wider thighs, you might consider a pencil skirt with a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 8 cm) slit in the hemline of the middle backside. The slit gives your legs more room to move around while keeping the waistband cinched in where it needs to be in order to maintain a proper fit. Slits can also give the skirt a sultrier, more flirtatious ambiance.

, Since pencil skirts are generally somewhat snug and form-fitting, the wrong underwear can easily create unwanted lines, creases, and folds. For that reason, building the best possible outfit starts with choosing the right undergarments.


In most cases, any panty style should work as long as the skirt itself fits your body properly. For particularly snug pencil skirts, however, you could consider wearing seamless undergarments or thongs to completely erase unwanted lines.
To mask unwanted folds, consider wearing some type of shapewear. Girdles and ""tummy tuckers"" should be able to provide structure to your lower abdomen and upper thigh, which should make the area seem much sleeker and trimmer.

, Since pencil skirts hug the curves of your lower body, add volume to your top if you wish to keep your overall shape looking balanced.


Looser tops should accomplish this task well enough. The key is to look for tops that are meant to drape loosely, rather than opting for tops that are merely oversized, baggy, or boxy.
Neckline is another factor worth considering. Choosing a top with ruffle or a deep v-neck will make the top half of your body look curvier and more voluminous.
You can also accomplish this with color. Putting a light or bright color on top will create the appearance of greater volume there, even if the top itself is form-fitting.

, Your pencil skirt can be the focal point of your entire outfit, or you could opt to make another piece the center of attention. It's generally best to stick with only one focal point to avoid making your overall ensemble too busy, though.


Keep this in mind when picking out colors and patterns. If your skirt has a bold pattern, gravitate toward simpler tops. Conversely, if your skirt is on the mild side, you could spice up your outfit with more vibrant colors, textures, and patterns on top.
Note that the focal point of your body will be the portion that becomes accentuated. If you want to draw attention to your lower curves or make your legs appear curvier than usual, opt for a patterned skirt. If you want to draw attention away from your lower half, choose a patterned blouse.

, No matter what type of top you wear, you can choose to tuck it into your pencil skirt or let it hang out. Both options have different effects, so you should make your choice based on the overall look you want to create.Tucking your shirt in tends to be preferred. It gives your look a neater, more sophisticated edge. By drawing attention to your waist, this option also makes your legs look longer and your waist look narrower. It also shortens your torso, though, which might be undesirable if you have a petite figure or short waist.
On the other hand, letting your shirt hang loose will create a more relaxed, easy-going appearance and will also elongate the torso. Using this option with a longer shirt may make your legs seem unnaturally short, though, and loose shirts may make your waist look wider than normal.

, If you decide to tuck your shirt into your skirt, consider accentuating the top of your skirt with a belt. As a general rule, choose a belt that's darker than your top and your skirt to make your waist look even narrower.


You can still wear a belt even if you don't tuck in your blouse, though. Gravitate toward skinnier belts in this instance, and wear the belt directly over your top at the narrowest part of your waist. This can be an especially good fashion choice if you're wearing a loose top since the belt will help you maintain a curvier figure.

, While pencil skirts can look great anywhere, they arguably shine their brightest when worn in a professional setting, like an office or business meeting. Pair a toned-down pencil skirt with other timeless pieces to create a classy, sophisticated ensemble.


Choose a solid, neutral color for your pencil skirt. Black is an easy choice, but navy blue, brown, tan, gray, or cream could also work. If you really want a patterned skirt, try a fairly muted pattern like pinstripes or houndstooth.
Pair the skirt with a plain button-down shirt or nice blouse. Consider wearing a ruffled blouse for something feminine yet mature, or something with an interesting print if you want to add a small dose of excitement to your outfit. Tuck the top into your skirt for a well-trimmed appearance.
Keep your shoes and accessories fairly simple. Closed-toe heels are a classic choice, but the right pair of ballet flats could also work. If you wear any jewelry, stick to simple pieces without much sparkle.

, Thanks to the hip-hugging nature of the pencil skirt, this piece is also sensual enough to wear during a date or a fun night out with friends. Glam it up with other fun, feminine pieces to make the most of this look.


Nearly any skirt color or pattern can work well as long as you pair it with the right pieces. To boost your sex appeal, though, consider wearing a high-waisted pencil skirt that narrows the waist or a pencil skirt with a tiny slit up the back or the side.
Your blouse can be anything from simple to shimmery. Try to have fun with it. Nighttime is a good opportunity to play with bold prints, vibrant colors, cropped hemlines, and other edgy trends.
Pumps and strappy heels are usually the footwear of choice for an evening look, but if your feet can't stand heels, you could swap them out for a fun pair of flats.
Evening looks are also the best time to play with sparkling jewelry. If sparkles aren't your thing, consider wearing one bold statement piece with an interesting design or bright opaque stone.

, The right pencil skirt can also be toned down for a relaxed yet trendy daytime weekend look. Match the skirt with other casual clothes to balance the overall tone of the outfit.


You can make a black pencil skirt casual, but daytime outfits are a good time to switch out your dark skirts for something in a light or bright shade. Patterns can also work well, but stay away from sparkly, shimmery materials.
For your top, stick with something fitted yet comfortable. Slouchy sweaters, t-shirts, denim shirts, and similar pieces are all good options
Your shoes and accessories should be fairly simple. Flats and flat sandals are some of the best choices, and if the rest of your outfit lacks pattern, you can spice things up with more decorative footwear. Simple, non-sparkly jewelry and fabric accessories—hats, scarves, belts—can help you maintain the right tone.

, There's no need to put your pencil skirt away when cold weather sets in. By keeping your legs and arms covered, you can continue to rock nearly any look—professional, evening, or casual.


Cover your legs with the right nylons. For professional looks, standard sheer nylon tights are often best. Sheer nylons can work for a nighttime look, too, but you can also mix things up by wearing black tights or tights with a slight shimmer woven through them. Casual looks generally do best with colored or patterned tights.
For your arms, you can either choose the long-sleeve version of whichever top you'd usually go for, or stick with your short-sleeve tops and throw some type of jacket over them. Consider a cardigan or matching blazer for your office apparel. Prepare for a night on the town with a leather jacket, fun blazer, or sparkly shrug. Warm up your casual daytime look with a sweater or denim jacket.
Remember to wear the right footwear for the season, as well. Cold weather is boot weather. Heeled boots are often good choices for the office or the evening, but flat boots might be a better option when you want something more relaxed.

A v-neck is generally flattering for most body types, so go for a v-neck when possible., If you're looking for a red dress to wear to any occasion, pick a more versatile style. Something that's not overly formal or casual can allow you to wear your red dress on any day of the week.Go for something very basic. A knee-length dress with three quarter sleeves and a v-neck works for most occasions.
Avoid anything too tight or short if you want a dress for any occasion. Look for looser, longer red dresses when selecting a versatile style.A simple dress also allows you to add many different accessories, allowing you to mix and match depending on the occasion.

, In general, the cut that works best is the one you enjoy most. Your body type and skin tone cannot 100% predict what type of dress will look great on you. Try a variety of dresses on when selecting a red dress to wear. Ignore conventions about things like body type and experiment with an array of styles.Pick a dress that makes you feel confident. If you exude confidence when wearing a dress, you're more likely to look good in red.

, A red dress is often thought of as a sexy dress. Many people prefer a tight or low cut variety of the red dress. If this is your preference, a more revealing red dress can look great. However, if you dislike wearing outfits that are too revealing, do not assume a red dress must be overtly sexy. Red is a bold color on its own. Even a modest red dress can have a sexy appeal due to the color itself."

Opt for gold, black, and silver.,
Pick a lipstick to match.,
Keep your makeup simple.,
Minimize accessories at formal events.",How to Wear a Red Dress3," Red dresses are a fairly versatile outfit, so a variety of shoes can match with them. Make sure to pick shoes in a matching similar shade of red, or in a neutral color like black or white.If you want high heels, you can wear kicks, wedges, or stilettos with a red dress. This can work well for more formal occasions. These may work well for a more formal occasion, like a cocktail party, or for a fun night out.
If you want something more casual, flats, sandals, or even flip-flops can pair with a red dress. These would work for a more casual social event or for every day wear around your office.

, Red and white can be a stunning and somewhat preppy color combination. When choosing accessories, consider the red/white pairing, especially for warmer months where lighter colors are in style.You can wear something like a white blazer or cardigan over your red dress.
Try white jewelry. A v-neck red dress may look great with a string of white pearls.
Try a white scarf or hat with a red dress if going for an outdoor event.

, Black, gold, and silver are shades traditionally paired with red. This can be stunning for a more formal occasion. It can also work great if lighter colors, like white, are not in style for the season.Solid metal jewelry can go great with a red dress.

You can incorporate black tights with a red dress, or something like a black blazer or cardigan.
Some dresses work well with a belt around the middle. Try wearing a gold, silver, or black belt with your red dress.

, As a general rule, your lipstick should match your dress when you're dressed in red. Try to find a lipstick that is more or less the same color as your red dress. An exact match may not be possible but try to find a close approximation of your dress's shade.However, if you're doing bold makeup elsewhere, such as your eyes, a neutral lipstick is preferred. A bold colored dress and bold makeup elsewhere may be overpowering when paired with bright red lipstick.

, Remember, red is a bold color. If you're wearing a red dress, you want to tone down your makeup. Go for natural shades of eye shadow and minimize use of mascara and eyeliner. You should also only add a light layer of things like foundation, concealer, and bronzer., Red dresses can be great at formal parties. At these events, however, do not over accessorize as this can look tacky or gaudy. Stick to one or two classy accessories and let the dress be the main draw of your outfit.For example, wear an elegant red evening gown with a gold chain necklace and gold stud earrings.
You can also try something like a nice watch or bracelet.
Try a belt or scarf as an accessory if you're not into jewelry.

If you want to draw attention to your curves, wear a high-waisted pencil skirt.;
, The banana figure is used to describe women with few curves—there is little distinction between the size of their shoulders and the width of their hips.

Wear thicker socks (or multiple pairs).,
Stuff the toes of your shoes.,
Use an insole.,
Use ball-of-foot pads.,
Use a set of heel strips.",How to Wear Shoes That Are Too Big1," Perhaps the easiest thing you can do to make a loose pair of shoes fit better is to ""bulk up"" your feet with thicker layers of socks. For example, you might try exchanging a skin-tight pair of dress socks or tights for a padded set of crew socks. You can even wear two or three pairs of socks on top of each other — the thicker the padding, the more tightly your foot will sit in the shoe.



Best for: Athletic shoes, boots.

Notes: This can be an uncomfortable choice in hot weather, especially if you tend to get sweaty feet.;
, In a pinch, you can use cheap, wadded-up material (like tissue paper, toilet paper, or even thin rags) to fill in the space at the the tips of your shoes. This is a great choice if you feel your feet sliding from the fronts of your shoes to the back as you walk — plus, it's something you can do almost anywhere.



Best for: Flats, boots, close-toed heels.

Notes: Not a particularly good choice for athletic situations or long walks — the ""filler"" material can get gross and uncomfortable with heavy use.

, An insole is a soft pad (usually made of foam or gel material) that sits under your foot in the shoe to provide cushioning and support. Insoles are often intended to help with posture problems and discomfort, but they're also handy for taking up extra space in shoes that are too loose. Insoles can be purchased for reasonably cheap at most places where shoes are also sold.



Best for: Most shoes (including heels and open-toed shoes).

Notes: If you can, try on any insoles before buying to make sure they are comfortable to wear. Well-known brands like Dr. Scholl and Foot Petals offer comfortable, long-lasting insoles, but any quality insole brand should work. Higher-end insoles can run $50 or more but provide top-of-the-line comfort and support.

, Sometimes, adding ""full"" insoles to a set of shoes makes them uncomfortable or awkward to wear. Luckily, other, smaller cushioning devices are usually sold alongside insoles. One such device that's useful for too-big shoes are partial pads that sit directly under the balls of your feet (the part just before your toes begin). These discrete, hard-to-see pads provide friction and a thin layer of support, making them perfect for heels that are just a little too big but that become uncomfortable when wearing a full insole.Best for: Heels, flats

Notes: These often come in many colors, so you can try to pick a pad that's in a color that compliments your shoes if you wish.

, Another ""partial"" padding option along the lines of insoles and ball-of-foot pads are thin strips of padding sometimes called ""heel strips"" or ""heel grips."" As their name suggests, these adhesive pads are often used to pad shoes with uncomfortable, pinching heels, but their strip-like design means you can put them virtually anywhere in the shoe to take up extra space — perfect for that odd pair of shoes that nothing else will work for.



Best for: Most shoes, especially tight pairs of heels.

Notes: Try these on before wearing and be aware that some users report blisters after use."

Try shrinking the shoes with water.,
Use an elastic band to constrict the shoe.,
See a cobbler or shoe repair professional.",How to Wear Shoes That Are Too Big2," For some shoes, you may want to consider actually making the shoes smaller by wetting them and then allowing them to air-dry. This can get great results if done right, but it's important to note that it carries a small risk of damage to your shoes, so always check the care label inside the shoe before beginning. See below for directions.First, get your shoes wet. For leather or suede shoes, use a spray bottle. For casual/athletic shoes, soak the shoes in water.
Let the shoes dry in the sun. If it's not sunny, use a hairdryer on the ""low"" setting. Be careful not to hold the hairdryer too close to the shoe — some fabrics, like polyester, are vulnerable to burning and/or melting.
When your shoes are dry, try them on. You may need to repeat this process several times if they're still too big. If you're worried about your shoes shrinking too small, let them dry on your feet so that they will form around them as they constrict.
Condition fine suede or leather shoes after they dry. Conditioning kits are usually sold at shoe stores and sometimes drug stores.

, This trick is handy if you have some experience with sewing. Stitching elastic bands into the inside of your shoes pulls the material together, giving a tighter fit. All you need for this is a short elastic band for each shoe, a needle, and thread. Use a fairly strong set of bands if possible.Stretch the elastic band along the inside of the back of the shoe. A good spot for this is the inside of the heel, but any loose area will work.
Sew the band in place, keeping the elastic tight as you go. Safety pins can help here.
Release the band. When you let go, the elastic band will draw in the material of the shoe. This should give it a ""smaller"" fit.
You can use method this with the water shrinking method or one of the tricks above if needed.

, When all else fails, you can always see a professional. Cobblers (people who specialize in working with shoes) were once common, but they are somewhat rare today. However, the internet can make them a little easier to find. For instance, a search on Google Maps or Yelp should give at least a few results in any major city.



Best for: High-quality, expensive shoes; treasured heirlooms.

Notes: The services of a cobbler are often expensive, so try to reserve them for shoes that are really worth it. The nicest pair of dress shoes you own are a good choice to bring to a cobbler. Your daily tennis shoes are not.

Try to maintain your posture when wearing big shoes.,
Be careful of tripping over your toes.,
Don't wear shoes that fit poorly for prolonged walking.,
Replace shoes that are significantly bigger than what you're used to.",How to Wear Shoes That Are Too Big3," Keep in mind that, no matter what you do to the inside of your shoes, they'll still be about the same size on the outside. This can unfortunately sometimes lead to posture and gait problems. When you're wearing an oversized pair of shoes, it's important to maintain good posture to compensate for your ""bigger"" feet. See our posture article for a good selection of tips and pointers. A few general points include:Stand up straight. Keep your head and chest up and pointed forward. Pull your shoulders back slightly to align your arms.
Use a heel-to-toe walking motion. Start each step by putting your heel down in front of you, then rolling through your arch, balls, and toes. Finally, push off!
Try to squeeze your abs and glutes slightly as you walk. These supporting muscles help keep your spine straight and well-supported.

, Oversized shoes are usually slightly longer than what you're used to wearing. This means that it's extra-important to pick your feet up off the ground as you walk. If you let your feet drag, it's easy to catch the toe of your shoe on the ground. This can lead to tripping or stumbling, so be aware of this common issue.

, No matter what solutions you're using for your too-big shoes, almost nothing provides the support of a shoe that fits properly. Try to avoid using too-big shoes for longer treks like day trips and hikes. You will spare your feet the discomfort of blisters, cuts, and sore spots caused by big shoes sliding around as you walk.


More importantly, you'll also reduce your chance for injury. Ankle injuries (like painful twists and sprains) are more likely in shoes that are too big. This is especially true in athletic situations.

, This may seem obvious, but it bears mentioning: the tricks above will only go so far. If your shoes are more than one or two sizes above your normal shoe size, no amount of padding will help. Don't risk pain and injury just to wear a pair of new shoes. In these cases, you'll want to switch for a better-fitting pair of shoes — even an old, worn-out pair is usually a better choice than a pair that's far too big.

",How to Sew a Tiered Skirt," Making a tiered skirt is an easy, quick project, but you will need to have all of your materials ready to go before you begin. You will need:Fabric in the colors and prints of your choice. You can use different colors or prints, or just one type if you only want the layered look.
A sewing machine.
Scissors.
Measuring tape.
A ½” to ¾” wide piece of elastic long enough to go around your skirt’s waistband.;
, You can make your tiered skirt any length you want it to be. However, you will need to know how long you want your skirt to be before you get started. This measurement is important for cutting your fabric and ensuring that your pieces are even.To determine how long you want your skirt to be, you can use a skirt that is the length you want your tiered skirt to be. Measure the skirt from the waist to the bottom hem and add 4” to this number to account for the hem, seams, and waistband.
You can also measure the length on yourself or the person for whom you are making this skirt. Measure from the natural waist to the spot where you want the skirt to end and add 4” for the hem, seams, and waistband.
If you plan to make your skirt with more than three tiers, then you will need more than 4"" of extra fabric to work with. Add an extra inch for each additional tier. For example, if you want a four tiered skirt, then add an additional 5"" inches to your length total. If you want to make a five tiered skirt, then add 6"" to your length total, and so on.

, After you have your length, you will need to divide this number by the number of tiers that you want your skirt to have to get the length measurement for each of your pieces. To get this number, divide the total number of tiers you want and write it down.For example, if your total skirt length is 30”, and you want to make a three tiered skirt, then you would divide 30” by 3 and get 10”. That means that each of your pieces will need to be 10” long.
To add more tiers to your skirt, divide your total length by the number of tiers you want. For example, if you wanted to create a five tiered skirt, then you would divide the total skirt length by 5.For example, if your total length is 35” and you want a five tiered skirt, then you would divide 35” by 5 for a result of 7” per piece.

, Each of your tier pieces will need to be a different width to ensure that the skirt flows outwards towards the bottom. To determine how wide to make each piece, you will need to know the waist measurement for the person who will be wearing this skirt. Measure the person’s waist and record this number. Then, you will need to use a different equation for each tier. For example, if creating a three tiered skirt, then you would need to:Multiply the waist measurement by 1.5 for the first tier. Therefore, if the person’s waist is 30”, then the first tier will need to be 45” wide.
Multiply the waist measurement by 2 for the second tier. For example, if the person’s waist is 30”, then the second tier will need to be 60” wide.
Multiply the waist measurement by 2.7 for the third tier. So, if the person’s waist is 30”, then the third tier will need to be 81” wide.

, After you have your measurements, measure and cut your fabric. Use the divided length measurement and the tier width measurements to determine the dimensions of your pieces. When you have measured each piece, cut the fabric according to these dimension.


For example, if you are making a three tiered skirt for someone who has a 30” waist and wants the skirt to be 26” (total of 30” with added 4” for hem, seams, and waistband) long, then your measurements would be 10” by 45” for the first tier, 10” by 60” for the second tier, and 10” by 81” for the third tier.
If you are using multiple kinds of fabric, then consider which one you want to be the top, middle, and bottom tier before you start cutting.

, Fold over each of your fabric pieces so that the short ends are lined up and the right sides (print or color sides) are facing each other. Then, sew along the short edges to form each piece into a circle.If you prefer, you can wait to add a seam on the skirt until after you have sewed all of the tiers together. This may be a better option if you are planning to do more than three tiers., Take your top tier piece and fold over about ½” to 1” (depending on the width of your elastic) of fabric of one of the long edges so that the wrong sides (non-print or non-color sides) are facing each other. This will be the waistband of your skirt. Sew along this edge to create the waistband.Make sure to leave enough space to add your elastic in later.
Leave a small 1” to 2” gap in the seam to insert the elastic.

, It is easier to hem the bottom of your skirt before you start to gather your pieces and sew them together. Fold over about ½” of fabric of one of the long edges of the bottom piece (your largest tier). Then, sew along this edge to create the bottom hem.

, You will be sewing the tiers together, but first you need to gather them. You will start by gathering the bottom tier and sewing it onto the bottom of the middle tier. To gather the bottom tier, sew a baste stitch into the top of the bottom tier (not the edge that you just hemmed).If you want, you can sew a permanent stitch over the baste stitch when it is gathered to your liking.However, sewing the middle tier to the bottom tier will create this permanent stitch, so it is not absolutely necessary to stitch over the baste stitch.

, Line up the edges so that the right sides of your fabric are facing each other. Then, pin along these edges about ¼” to ½” inch from the edge of the fabric.Be sure to line up the center seams on the bottom and middle tiers. If you did not create the center seam yet, then make sure that the ends are even.
You can adjust the gathering before you start pinning the pieces together to make sure that the pieces are the same length.
After you have pinned all the way around the pieces, sew the pieces together, removing the pins as you sew.

, Next, you will need to repeat the baste stitch on the top of your middle tier, but this time you will be gathering the fabric so that it is the same size as your top tier piece. Add your baste stitch and then adjust until the middle tier piece matches your top tier piece.

, After you have gathered the middle piece to match the top tier piece, begin pinning the wrong sides together. Pin all the way around the pieces and then sew the two pieces together.Make sure that you line up the center seams on the middle and top tiers.
Remove the pins as you sew.
If you have more than three tiers, then you will need to continue to baste and stitch until you have added all of your tiers.

, To finish your skirt, you will need to add the elastic to the waistband. Slide your elastic piece in through the gap that you left in the waistband at the beginning. Then, use your fingers to work the piece through the entire waistband.It can take a while to work the piece of elastic through the waistband.
Attaching a safety pin to the end of the elastic before you insert it into the waistband may help you to pull it through a bit easier.

, After you have pulled the end of your elastic through the other end of the waistband and it is going all the way around the waistband, sew the two ends of the elastic together. This will secure the elastic in a circle inside of your fabric waistband., After you have sewed the two ends of the elastic together, close the opening in the fabric waistband by sewing the gap closed. After the gap is closed, you can trim away any excess thread and your skirt is ready to wear!,"

Wear a knee-length skirt when in doubt.",How to Pick the Right Hemline for a Skirt1," Mini skirts show more skin, creating the illusion of a longer leg. If you have a height of 5'4"" (about 163 centimeters) or less, a skirt that falls out somewhere between your mid-thigh and knee will provide your legs with the greatest amount of length.;
, Skirts that drag down to your calf or ankle can overwhelm your lower half with too much fabric, making you look short and frumpy as a result. If you do opt for a longer skirt, go for a fitted style that hugs your legs instead of a full, flowing style.

, Midi skirts fall out at the mid-calf and may divide the length of your legs in a way that also shortens the appearance. If you do not need to worry about this shortening effect, however, a midi skirt may make a nice option.

, Long gypsy skirts can look especially elegant on taller women, since the extra fabric compliments their figure rather than overwhelming it. Stick with a hemline that stops just above your ankles. Showing the thinnest part of your ankles keeps your legs looking lean and slender.

Decide what kind of straps you want.,
Put on your dress.,
Pin one end of the measuring tape at the neckline of your dress.,
Swing the measuring tape over your shoulder.,
Note the measurement.,
Add to this number.",How to Make Straps for a Strapless Dress1," Different straps will require different amounts of fabric, so before buying your fabric you will want to figure out what kind of straps you want to sew on. The most common strap type is a straight back strap, where the straps are attached to the front and go straight over your shoulders, where they attach to the back of your dress.
Another strap type is a cross back strap, where the straps start in the front on one side and then cross in the back and are attached to the other side of the dress in the back.
The third basic type of strap is the halter strap, which attach at the front of your dress, go up your shoulders and tie behind your neck.;
, Once you decide what straps you want, you will need to put on your dress to get accurate measurements for your straps. You also need a flexible measuring tape to take the measurements for your straps. The measuring tape will mimic the straps of your dress so you can see how much fabric you will need. , Wearing your dress, pin one end of the measuring tape where you would want your strap to start in the front of your dress. Both straps will be the same length, so it doesn’t matter which side you are measuring from. Make sure you are using the beginning of the measuring tape, the end of the tape that starts at zero. This will make measuring a lot easier.

, With the end of the measuring tape pinned in the front, put the other end of the tape over your shoulder. Reach back with your arm and pin or hold the measuring tape to where you would want the strap to attach to the back. If you chose a straight backstrap, the measuring tape should be swung over the same shoulder.
If you chose a cross back strap, the measuring tape should go over your shoulder and go diagonally across your back.
If you chose a halter neck, the measuring tape should go up your front to the back of your neck.

, Go to a mirror, still with the measuring tape pinned in the back or held in place with your hand. With your back to the mirror, look over your shoulder. You should be able to see where the measuring tape in the back is being held in place. Take note of the number in inches where the strap should end.

, You will want to make the length of fabric you purchase a little more than the actual measurement of the measuring tape. This gives you some leeway when you are making the straps. For straight back and crossback straps, add four inches to the number. For instance, if your strap was 16 inches (40.6 cm), add four inches onto this so the final measurement is 20 inches.
For halter straps, add about 12 inches (30 cm) on to this number. You will need enough fabric to be able to make a tie in the back, so you will need more excess fabric.

Opt for an off-the-shoulder dress for a casual look.,
Look for a button down dress for a formal occasion.",How to Style a Khaki Dress1," Khaki can be worn in both the warmer and cooler months. When selecting a khaki dress to wear, keep the weather in mind. Pick a dress that won't be too warm or too cold for the occasion.For cooler months, try a knit khaki dress. The knit fabric will keep you warm while you enjoy wearing your khaki.
For warmer months, go for a shorter khaki dress. Khaki dresses come in short, sheer fabrics that will keep you cooler as temperatures rise.;
, If you're going for a night out, go for a more fitted khaki dress. A tighter look that clings slightly to your body can accentuate your figure. This can be great for a date night or going out to somewhere like a bar or club.Keep in mind that fitted dresses can be read as somewhat formal. You may want to opt for a different look for a more casual night out.

, If you want something more casual, look for an off-the-shoulder khaki dress. A dress that falls off one or both shoulders will have a more casual, laid back feel. You will still be able to feel slightly dressy without feeling too formal or fancy.An off-the-shoulder dress would work great for a casual get-together with friends or something like casual Friday at work.

, Khaki dresses can actually be quite formal. If you want to wear khaki for a more formal occasion, opt for a button down khaki dress. This can work great for the office, especially when paired with something like tights or panty hose."

First take your measurements.,
Calculate A, B, and C. For Example:









With hips ""X"" measuring 36"" and desired length ""Y"" measuring 30"".,
Draw a trapezoid on a piece of newspaper using your calculations for A, B, and C.








,
Use the pattern to cut three trapezoids out of your favorite fabric.








,
Sew the trapezoids together at two seams as shown in the diagram along the blue lines.,
Finish the waistband, bottom hem, and open sides as desired.,
Attach two ties, shown as green wavy lines in the diagram.








,
Then wrap, button, tie, and you're done!








",How to Make a Wrap Skirt to Fit Any Size," Measure around your waist or hips, wherever you want the top of the skirt to be (we'll call this measurement ""X""). Now measure the desired length of your finished skirt (we'll call this measurement ""Y"").









X = waist/hip circumference; Y = length





;
,






The top of trapezoid ""A"" should equal 30% of 1.5 times your waist measurement ""X"" after adding 3 inches (7.6 cm) for seam allowances. (Use the formula A = * .3.) A = 36 + 3 = 39, 39 * 1.5 = 59, 59 * .3 = 18

The length of trapezoid ""B"" should be your desired finished length ""Y"" plus 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) for seams. (Use the formula B = Y + 1.5.) B = 30 + 1.5 = 32

The bottom of trapezoid ""C"" should equal 40% of 1.5 times your waist measurement ""X"" after adding 3 inches (7.6 cm) for seams. (Use the formula C = * .4.) C = 36 + 3 = 39, 39 * 1.5 = 59, 59 * .4 = 24


,,,









Make sure to sew with the correct sides of fabric together! Connect the three trapezoids on the ""wrong"" sides of the fabric, so when you wear your skirt, you won't see the stitches.







, Attach a button and sew a buttonhole where red dots are shown in the previous diagram. The dot on the left should be the hole and the dot in the center panel is the button, so you should sew the button on the inside of the garment.

Find a fabric for your straps that is the same color as your dress.,
Find a fabric that matches one colour in your dress for patterned dresses.,
Find a fabric that complements, not matches, your dress.,
Make sure the material of the fabric suits the material of the dress.,
Buy enough fabric.",How to Make Straps for a Strapless Dress2," After you have figured out the measurements for the straps, you will need to decide what fabric to use for your straps. You will want the straps of your dress to look like they match your dress. The easiest way to do this is to find a fabric the same colour as your dress. Most fabric at stores like Jo-Ann Fabrics have fabrics organised by colour.
You may want to bring your dress along with you if you are matching the colour of the strap to the dress.

, Finding the right strap colour for a patterned dress is less straightforward. Pick one of the more dominant colours in the dress and find fabric that matches that colour. For instance, if your dress is beige with yellow flowers and green leaves, try to find fabric that is either beige or yellow, depending on what you prefer.
Even though the straps aren’t patterned, matching the fabric to the main colour in the dress will make the straps look like they belong on the dress.

, If you don't want your straps to match your dress exactly, you could also find a fabric that looks good with it, even if it's not the same colour. For example, if your dress is a pastel yellow, you could find fabric in a pastel green that would look good with your dress colour. More extreme contrasts in color and texture may be more suitable for casual rather than formal dresses.

, If the materials look mismatched, the straps will look out of place.


The easiest way to do this is to match the fabric of the straps to the fabric of the dress. For instance, if you are wearing a silk dress, find a silk fabric for the straps.
You can also pick fabric for the straps that adds a decorative element to the dress. For instance, you can use a lacy or differently-textured fabric to liven up a basic dress.

, Use the measurement in inches you calculated to buy enough fabric for the straps. Many fabric stores measure in yards. You will very likely only need a half a yard, though you may need more if you are making halter straps. "
"
Decide how thick you want your straps.,
Multiply this number by two and add ¼ inch.,
Cut the fabric.,
Make the second strap.",How to Make Straps for a Strapless Dress3," You may want thin spaghetti straps, or you may want straps that are a little thicker. Decide in inches how thin you want your straps. Keep in mind that a slightly thicker strap could give you more comfort and security if you are worried about your dress slipping down. If it’s a formal or elegant dress, you may want to sew thinner spaghetti straps.
If it’s a casual dress, you could go either way.

, This will be the measurement for the width of your fabric when you cut it. You need to multiply the number because you will be folding the fabric in half width-wise and sewing it to create your strap. For instance, if you want your straps to be half an inch thick, multiply this number by two and add ¼ of an inch so that your width will be 1¼ inches.

, According to your measurements for the width and length of your fabric, cut the fabric. You may want to cut along a ruler to make sure that you are cutting straight. For instance, say you calculated that you needed 20 inches (50.8 cm) of length for your strap and 1¼ inches of thickness. If you got a yard of fabric, cut a 20x1¼ inches rectangle. This will be the material you will use to make your strap.

, Since you are making two straps for your dress, cut another rectangle the same measurements as the first rectangle. You can lay the first rectangle you made over the fabric and cut around it if that makes it easier.

"
"
Fold the fabric in half.,
Sew a ¼ inch allowance.,
Cut a small slit on one end of each strap.,
Insert a bobby pin into the strap.,
Work the pin out through the other side of the tube.,
Turn the tube inside-out.,
Iron the straps.",How to Make Straps for a Strapless Dress4," You may need to pin the fabric for it to stay folded. Make sure to pin near the crease of the fabric, because you do not want to put the pins in places that you will be sewing. Your fabric should be folded so that the wrong sides face outward and right sides, or sides you want to show, are facing each other. You want the wrong sides facing out because you will soon be turning the strap right side out.

, Use a sewing machine or hand stitch to Sew down the length of the fabric ¼ inch from the edges of the fabric using a running stitch. Then trim the edges of the fabric to make the allowance slightly smaller. Make sure to use a thread that matches the colour of the strap. Do this for both straps. , Both of your straps should now look like tubes, with a little excess fabric after the seams. Take a set of small scissors and cut a small slit into the tube, about ½ inch from the end of each strap. , Take a bobby pin and insert it so that one prong of the pin is inside the tube and one prong is outside. Push the bobby pin down the slit, still with one prong inside the tube and one outside. You can also use a safety pin, but be careful not to prick yourself when using one.

, The easiest way to do this is to scrunch the fabric of the strap around the bobby pin. Hold the bobby pin vertically with the base of the pin facing downwards and the prongs facing upwards.
Pull the fabric down by scrunching it until you see prongs of the bobby pin emerge out of the other end.

, Grab portion of fabric with the slit near the base of the pin. Pull up. This will turn the tube right side out, so that the excess fabric is hidden inside the tube. , Now that the straps are made, iron them to make them flat. If you are having trouble getting the straps to lay flat before you iron them, safety pin the straps. Leave them this way for an hour or so and then come back and iron. "
"
Turn the dress inside-out.,
Pin the straps in the front.,
Hand-stitch the straps to the inside of the dress.,
Pin the straps to the back of the dress.,
Sew the straps in place.",How to Make Straps for a Strapless Dress5," You need to turn the dress inside-out because you will be sewing the straps to the inside of the dress. This way the stitches will be less visible when you are wearing the dress. , Place the straps so that they start two inches below the neckline of the dress. Pin them close to the top of the neckline, a little further down from where you will be sewing. , If your dress has a lining, sew the straps only onto the lining of the dress. This way you won't be able to see the stitching when you are wearing the dress. If your dress does not have lining, make sure to use thread that matches the color of the straps to make the stitching less noticeable. Hand-stitch vertically so that the two inches of strap fabric is stitched against the dress. Then stitch horizontally about ¼ inch from where the straps hit the neckline.
If you are sewing halter straps, this is the final step. Halter straps tie at the neck, so you do not need to sew the straps in the back.

, If you are sewing straight back straps or crossover straps, you will need to also pin and sew the straps to the back of the dress. Keep two inches of the strap below the neckline. Pin the straps to the lining about ½ down from where you will be sewing.


If you are making crossback straps, you will need to cross the straps diagonally so that the straps are pinned to the opposite sides of the dress as in the front.

, Follow the same sewing procedures as you did when sewing the straps to the front of the dress. Make sure that you are only sewing the straps into the lining of the dress if your dress has lining. "

Wear gladiator sandals with khaki.",How to Style a Khaki Dress2," When selecting shoes, know that khaki tends to pair well with gray. If you want a shade that will easily match with your khakis, go for gray shoes. Something like light gray heels will compliment a khaki dress well.However, if you don't love gray, you can go for other neutral shades. While gray is generally a good color with khaki, it is not the only option. Blacks and browns can also work with khaki.

, Suede and khaki go great together. Suede shoes, especially heels, are a great addition to your khaki outfit. Try pairing a midi khaki dress with a pair of suede heels. This can be a great look for either the office or a night out., If you want something a little bit different, try leopard-patterned shoes. While the look is a little bold, it can be perfect to add some flare to khakis.Leopard pattern shoes may work best for a more dramatic, form-fitted dress. They may look a little off when paired with something like a casual off-the-shoulder khaki dress.

, If you want a more casual look, go for gladiator sandals. They can pair well with looser, more casual khaki outfits. They can also work for a more casual day in the office. Gladiator sandals add some style to your outfit without being too formal.If you want something very casual, try just wearing plain sandals with khaki. This can work great for something like a casual afternoon lunch.

Define your waist with a belt.,
Throw on a scarf.,
Carry a stylish purse.,
Wear complementary jewelry.",How to Style a Khaki Dress3," If your khaki dress is a little loose around the middle, cinch it at the waist with a belt. Not only will a belt highlight your figure, it can add some flare to a khaki dress. You can go for a skinnier belt or something thicker to accentuate your frame.Stick to colors like brown and black, which go well with khaki.
A belt tied around a button-down khaki dress adds a professional feel.

, A scarf is a versatile accessory that goes with any number of outfits. A scarf can be a great addition to a khaki dress even during the warmer months.Neutral colors tend to compliment khakis, so stick to colors like browns, grays, and blacks.
As khaki is a solid color, a scarf can make things more interesting by adding a little pattern. Opt for a floral, checkered, plaid, or polka-dot scarf to add some flare.

, A khaki dress can pair well with a number of purses. Stick to neutrals, like grays and blacks, and choose a purse in a style you like.Account for the type of dress you're wearing. A small clutch purse would go well with a form-fitted khaki outfit while a larger, bulkier purse could pair with a casual off-the-shoulder dress.
Like a scarf, a purse can be used to add patterns. Opt for, say, a checkered black and white purse to pair with a khaki dress.

, Jewelry can go well with most outfits, including khaki. As khaki is often seen as more casual, sometimes dramatic jewelry works well. You can try something like a double pendant necklace, a heavily beaded choker, or a statement necklace.Lighter colored jewelry, like white or cream jewelry, looks great with khaki as it stands out a bit more against khaki's darker shades. This tends to show up more strikingly than gold or silver jewelry.

Make a dress using your favorite skirt.",How to Make a Simple Dress," Measure from the top of your shoulder (usually where the seam is on a shirt) down to where you want the hem of the dress to be. Next, measure around your hips at their widest point. Add 1-2"" to the shoulder-hem measurement and at least 4"" to the hip measurement, for seam allowances (more if your shoulders are broader than your hips). If you want the skirt to be a bit more full, add 6-8"".For example, let's say that from my shoulder down to my knee (where I want my hem) is 40"" and my hips are 36"" around. This means that I will want a piece of fabric that is ideally 42"" wide and 42"" long, although it can also be 42x21 and still work.
Technically the fabric will be broken down into four identical rectangles (one side length measurement by one quarter hip measurement, plus seam allowances). That means that as long as you have four pieces of fabric in that rectangle size, you can use them just fine.
Traditional seam allowance is 1/2"" along each edge.;
, You can use any fabric that you want. White or brightly colored summer fabrics are most traditional, but you can also use an old tablecloth, curtains, or scarves too.


Stretchy fabrics like jersey work well for this dress but are difficult to work with. You need very particular settings on your sewing machine (most notably a perfectly set, loose-but-not-too-loose foot). Tread carefully.

, Cut the fabric into four identical rectangles. As mentioned above, they need to be the length of your shoulder-hem measurement with the seam allowances. They also need to be as wide as your hip measurement divided into quarters and a seam allowance for each of those quarters to be joined.


Using the measurements from the first step, our example rectangles would need to be 42"" long and 10.5"" wide.

, Take two of the rectangles and pin a short side on one piece to a short side on the other, with the facing sides of the fabric touching. This will form the shoulder seam. Sew the two pieces together by hand or using a machine, following a line about 1/2"" from the edge of the fabric.


When you pin two pieces of fabric, your natural inclination might be to make the pins outline the imaginary line you'll be sewing along. However, you want the pins to go perpendicular to the sewing line, so that you can sew right over the pins without having to remove them (although you should).

, Sewing the shoulders together should have left you with two very long strips. Place the strips facing sides together and then pin them along one long side. This will become the center line for the dress. Now measure and then mark how low cut the dress should be in both the back and front.


For each side, measure down from the shoulder seam and then mark that spot on the fabric with sewer's chalk (or similar).

, Now, sew up from the bottom hem, moving toward the shoulder on the side that you pinned. Stop when you reach the mark for either the back or front neckline. Lock in your stitches, cut the threads, and then repeat from the other side.


Lock in your stitches by reversing the machine and sewing for about 1/2"", sew as normal to return to your stopping point, and then reversing the stitches again. This allows you to cut the threads and release your dress, without risking the strings coming loose over time.

, Take this opportunity to hem the bottom edge of the dress, pinning it either half an inch or an inch up (depending on how much of a seam allowance you left yourself) and then sewing straight across.

, Now you'll want to make an elastic waist. Get a roll of elastic tape, either 1/4"" or 1/2"" should work fine. Measure around your waist at the smallest point, as well as around your waist 2"" above and 2"" below that line. Now, measure down from your shoulder to the smallest part of your waist. Using that measurement, mark the same line on the dress, as well as the 2"" above and below lines.


This design (using three levels of elastic) creates a puffed, Boho type of look. You can stick with just the center waist elastic and just do one cinched line if you prefer.
You do not have to create this elastic waist, however. You can also just a belt to cinch the dress at the waist. This may work better than the elastic if the material is very thin, silky, or intricately patterned.

, Cut the elastic strips so that they are at the same size as your waist when they are not stretched. Then, cut those in half, one half for each side of your waist. Pin one end to one side of the dress (inside the seam allowance line) and then pin the other side to the other side. Find the middle and pin that at the center of the dress. Now, stretch the sections and pin them to the fabric evenly. When you release the elastic, the dress should gather in a way that looks nice.


Don't forget to do this for each side of the dress, both front and back.

, Once the elastic is pinned in place, you can sew it to the fabric. Don't forget to lock in your stitches, just like you did with the center seam.

, You should now have one large rectangle with a neck hole at the center. Place the panels so that the facing sides of the fabric are touching again (folded at the shoulder seam) and then pin the two remaining long sides together. Measure 5"" or more (depending on how large an opening you need for your arms) down each long side from the shoulder seam and mark this like you did with the neck opening.


Measure around your arm and then divide that number in half. Add at least 1"" to make sure that the sleeves are comfortable. You will probably want to add more, since the sleeve are meant to fit loosely. Just be sure that you don't go too far down, or you'll end up showing off your bra.

, Sew up from the hem and stop at the mark you made for the arm opening. Lock in your stitches as before with the center seam.

, You should now have something that looks like a dress! You can technically wear it just like this but it might be better to finish the rest of the edges and add any other finishing touches that you want to make it look nice and professional. You can:


Add bias tape to finish the edges. Get single fold bias tape. Splay open one of the three sides and place this facing side down onto the inside of the fabric edge to be finished. Sew it into place. Now fold the rest of the bias tape around so that it covers the edge of the fabric. Sew it into place from the front side. Do this for the collar and sleeves, as well as the bottom hem if you want to.
You can add belt loops to the waist, by making small rectangles of fabric and sewing them into place.
You can also add other materials and details to your dress. Consider pockets, lace trim, or a lace back.

, Once that is in place, all that's needed to complete the look is a nice belt or other accessory to cinch in the waist.

, By adding a skirt onto an existing shirt cut off at the bust, you can easily sew a cute empire waist dress. This is perfect for a soft feminine look on a summer day.

, An old bedsheet can be converted into a dress, providing plenty of fabric for a short, summer dress. This requires minimal sewing skills and is easy to make.

, By sewing a tee shirt or other top into a skirt, you can quickly make a nice dress in just a few minutes. Simply align the edges with the facing sides together and then create a seam around the waist.


Take into account that you won't be able to zip or unzip your skirt, so this will only work with stretch waist skirts.

Allow for different styles in the same color.,
Think about blue.,
Consider neutrals.,
Mix greens and blues.,
Consider complementary colors.",How to Style Mismatched Bridesmaid Dresses1," In general, different dresses flatter different body types. If all your bridesmaids are different shapes and sizes, let them pick out dresses cut to flatter their personal style in one color. This way, everyone can choose a dress they feel comfortable in, but will still match to a degree.Think about what your wedding colors are. If your colors are, say, pink and black, have everyone wear pink.
Consider how specific you want to be. Do you want everyone to choose a shade of pink they like or would you rather everyone went with a specific shade?
You can pre-select options at a bridal boutique. For example, have a few options for your bridesmaids available to choose from. This way, you can pick dresses that you know are similar cuts and colors while still giving your wedding party some choice.;
, In general, blue is a versatile color that comes in different shades. Blue can be flattering on a variety of skin tones and hair colors. Blues also tend to go well together, even if people are picking different shades. If you want the same color, but different styles, blue can be a great option., Not everyone has one single color for their wedding colors. You may simply be going for an overarching color scheme. If you just want a particular scheme, think about shades of neutrals. While neutrals sound dull, varying shades of browns, blacks, and grays can look flattering on the wedding party.A neutral scheme also allows some variation when choosing dresses. You can, say, have half the party in solid black dresses and the other half can wear striped gray and black dresses.
Neutrals also go with a lot, allowing your bridesmaids to express themselves with accessories. If your maid of honor's favorite color is green, she can easily pull of a emerald necklace with black bridesmaids dresses.

, Green and blue is a great general color scheme to follow for a wedding party. Instead of having bridesmaids choose the exact same shade for their dresses, let them pick something along the blue/green spectrum. Dresses can be shades like green, blue-green, aqua, and turquoise.You can add things like yellow-greens and clover shades in accessories to add some variation. For example, bridesmaids can carry bouquets of tulips or wear yellowish necklaces.

, If you want, you can have bridesmaids wear different colors that go together great. For example, half the party can wear blue while the other half wears yellow. This way, bridesmaids have options if they don't like one of your wedding colors. Think about what your wedding colors are, and let bridesmaids have a choice between these colors rather than forcing them to wear one or the other."
"
Encourage similar styles of dresses.,
Use a shared theme.,
Mix and match prints and solids.,
Aim for similar lengths.",How to Style Mismatched Bridesmaid Dresses2," If you're going with slightly different colors, ask that everyone wear a similar style. This will help make the party look uniform, even if everyone is going with different shades or colors.For example, you can request everyone wear form-fitted dresses, longer dresses, or dresses with a particular neckline.

, A shared theme can help unify mismatched dresses. You can go with one overarching style theme to define your dresses. Think about the general theme of your wedding. If you're going for something vintage, for example, ask that people look for dresses with an old-fashioned cut or style. You could even take your bridesmaids on a trip to a vintage shop to pick out dresses.Many people prefer a similar color scheme as well as a unifying theme. Let your bridesmaids know if you want them to opt for dresses of a particular color.

, It can be fun to create some contrast with different prints and styles. You can have half the wedding party wear solid colors while having the other half wear prints. This will allow for some spontaneity on your big day. If you prefer a less rigidly uniform wedding party, mixing prints and solids is a great idea.You can still stick to one color scheme while mixing and matching. If your colors are gold and silver, for example, half the party can wear solid silver or gold dresses. The other half can wear patterned dresses that incorporate both silver and gold.

, Dresses of similar length look great together for photos. When choosing different styles of dresses, encourage everyone to keep the length the same. Let your bridesmaids know if you want floor length gowns, gowns cut above the knee, and so on."

Have similar beading.,
Add some sparkle.,
Tie everyone's looks together with matching bouquets.,
Use matching accessories.,
Allow for two differences per dress.",How to Style Mismatched Bridesmaid Dresses3," Beading is a great accessory for a wedding dress. If you want a hip, bohemian style for your bridesmaids, have everyone opt for dresses with beads. You can simply request everyone go for beaded dresses, or you can ask that beading be similar. For example, look for dresses with beading on the skirts., For an elegant style, look for sparkly bridesmaids dresses. Sparkles can be a unifying embellishment that fits all the dresses. You can still have similar cuts and styles, but ask that all the dresses have a little sparkle., If you want everyone to look similar but different, use bouquets to your advantage. You can have matching bouquets made. You can also have bridesmaids hold bouquets with the same flowers.If you're using a particular color scheme for your dresses, have the bouquets match this color scheme.

, Similar or matching accessories can help make mismatched bridesmaids dresses look more uniform. Everyone can carry the same clutch bag, wear the same necklace, or wear similar earrings. This can help if your dresses are a different style or color., As your bridesmaids add embellishments, you want to make sure the dresses are not too different. Encourage your bridesmaids to embrace their own style, but ask that they limit personal embellishments to two differences per dress. This way, your bridal party will not look too mismatching."

Choose your dress color based on popularity.,
Base your choice on your favorite color.,
You can also choose the color based on the other colors for your wedding.,
Choose the color of your dress based on the season.,
If you have a summer wedding, you might want to go darker and richer in color.,

Last thing to remember: once you find a dress you like, but want to keep looking just in case, HOLD THE DRESS!",How to Select a Wedding Dress Color," White, champagne, and ivory-colored dresses are among the most popular. However, there are many other colors to choose from: black, blue, aqua, teal, green, sea green, kelly, bisque, light bisque, pink, dark pink, light pink, orange, yellow, wine red, cherry red, and many more.;
, What is your favorite color? What will the groom like? (Most likely he won't care; he isn't marrying you based on how you look going down the isle.)

, What colors are the flowers? The decorations?

, If you are having a spring wedding, you could make a selection from pastel colors: mint green, lavender, baby pink, or a soft sky blue.

, For example, you may choose jewel colors: dark sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green, and other jewel colors; namely, purple, deep pink, yellow, orange, etc.

,, The possibilities are endless!

, If you find a gorgeous wedding dress that is expensive, you might want to try looking for the exact same dress, but cheaper. If you fail at that, than get the dress you found in the first place! No one sees how expensive it is. The same goes for inexpensive dresses. If you find a pretty one, but worry people will think it's cheap, don't! No one should care on how much money that dress cost.

, If you don't find a better dress and someone buys the dress you like, then you are kind of screwed.

Try on the skirt.",How to Make a Ruffle Skirt," Wrap a tape measure around your waist, keeping the tape measure parallel to the floor and taut against your body. Mark down your waist measurement so that you'll be able to remember it more easily.


You should measure the area of your body where you want the skirt to sit. Your natural waist is usually a good choice if you aren't sure, but if you want the skirt to sit higher or lower, move the tape measure higher or lower accordingly.;
, Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to your measured waist size. Measure and cut out that much elastic.


The extra inch (2.5 cm) will allow you to overlap the elastic when you sew it into the waistband.

, Figure out where on your body you want the bottom hem to land, then measure from your waist down to that point. Keep the measuring tape perpendicular to the floor, and mark this measurement down.


Keep in mind that the waistband will add another 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the skirt. When determining your ruffle measurements, subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your desired length before using that figure to calculate your ruffle width.

, Ask yourself how many ruffles you want, then divide your desired length by that amount. That will tell you how wide your finished ruffles need to be.

, Calculate the length of your connector pieces by multiplying your waist size by 1.5. Calculate the length of your ruffle pieces by multiplying the connector length by 2. The width of the connector and ruffle strips will be the same and can be calculated by adding 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the desired width of your finished ruffles.If you want to make the ruffles appear even fuller, make the ruffle strips 2.5 times as long as the connector strips.

, You'll need one connector piece for each ruffle piece. Cut out the strips of material according to the dimensions you figured out previously.


If your fabric is not wide enough to cut out a full connector or ruffle strip, you will need to sew two separate, smaller strips together to form one full strip. When the length of both strips are added together, they should equal the total length of your full strip plus 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Sew the strips together at the short ends with a 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance.

, To prevent the connector strips and ruffle strips from unraveling, you will need to hem one long side of each strip using a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance. Fold the material under 1/4 inch (6 mm) and press in place with an iron. Fold the material under by another 1/4 inch (6 mm), masking the raw edge, then press in place again.


If you have a serger, you can serge the raw edges instead of folding out a hem. Doing so will make the skirt more light-weight.
Pressing the hems will make it easier for you to sew them in place since the hems will stay put without the use of sewing pins.

, Use a straight stitch to sew across each hem. Backstitch at each end to secure your stitches.


Hemming the strips before you sew them in place will make it easier since the material is still straight and flat at this point.

, For each ruffle strip, sew a loose stitch straight across the top long side of the strip. You can do this with a sewing machine or by hand. Pull the tail of thread at the end of the strip to bunch up the material, creating ruffles. Continue gathering the ruffles until the strips shrink down to the size of your connector strips.


The ""top"" edge of each strip is the edge directly opposite the hemmed edge.
You may need to play around with the gathers after you shrink the strip down to even them out along the thread.
To sew the gathering stitch by hand, simply sew a loose straight stitch across the top edge of the material, making each individual stitch 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) long or so. Leave a long tail at the end to work with for gathering the material.
To sew the gathering stitch using a sewing machine, set the stitch length to its longest position and set the tension as high as possible. Leave a long tail, then adjust the gathers by pulling on the bobbin thread.

, Place the first ruffle piece below the first connector piece, right sides together, and lining them up at the top seam. Pin the pieces together, then sew them in place straight across the top edge. Use a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.


Due to the nature of the ruffles, using more pins to hold the pieces together is better than using a few pins. The extra pins help prevent the ruffles from moving around or getting folded in undesirable ways.
Check the tier when you finish sewing the pieces together to make sure that there are no weird bunches or folds.
If desired, you can serge away this connecting seam, but doing so is not necessary.

, Open up the connected strips so that the right sides are now visible. Iron along the seam to flatten the material.


When spreading out the tier on your surface, the connector piece should be above the ruffle.

, Place the next ruffle strip over the connector piece of your bottom tier with the right sides facing out. Place the next connector strip on top of that with the right side of the strip facing in. Line everything up along the top edge, pin in place, then sew straight across the top edge with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.


As before, you should use a lot of pins to help secure the ruffles in place as you sew.

, Fold the connector piece of your second tier up so that you can see the right side of the material. Iron along the newly created seam to flatten it out.


This connector piece should now lie above the rest of the skirt.

, The rest of your ruffled tiers should be sewn to the top of the skirt in the same manner as your second tier.


Sandwich the ruffle layer in between the attached connector of your previous tier and the new connector strip. The skirt and ruffle strip should face out, but the new connector strip should always face in.
Pin the layers in place before sewing along the top edge with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.
Flip up the top connector piece and iron out the new seam before moving onto the next layer.
Repeat as many times as needed until all of your ruffles and connectors have been added.

, Pin in place, then sew along the joined edge with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.


Stitch across the edge from the bottom up, stopping just short of the top connector piece. Do not sew the ends of the top connector piece together yet.

, With the skirt inside-out, fold the top connector piece toward you, creating a pocket equal to or a little larger than the width of your elastic. Pin and sew this pocket in place.


Sew along the open edge of pocket with as small a seam allowance as possible. Do not sew the short ends of the pocket closed.
Note that you should not need to fold the open edge under the pocket to hide it. This end should already be hemmed if you followed the instructions carefully, so the raw edge is already taken care of.
Consider ironing out the waistband pocket to help flatten it once you sew it together.

, Attach a small safety pin to one end of your elastic strip and a large safety pin to the other end. Insert the small safety pin and attached elastic end into the waistband pocket, then use your fingers to push the safety pin all the way through the pocket and out through the other side.


The small safety pin makes it easier to feed the elastic through the pocket, while the large safety pin prevents the other end of the elastic band from working its way into the pocket.

, Overlap the ends of the elastic by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Pin in place, then sew them together with a needle and thread.

, Tuck the ends of the elastic into the waistband pocket, then bring the raw edges of the pocket together. Stitch them up using a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.

, Turn the skirt right-side out again, then slip it on and check yourself out in a mirror. The skirt should fall out to your desired length and the elastic should hold it snug against your waist.


This step completes the process.

Consider heel height.,
Think about your current wardrobe.,
Give them a test run.,
Pair them with cropped pants.,
Rock them with cuffed jeans.,
Wear them with longer skirts and dresses.,
Wear your mules with tights.,
Wear mules with wide legged pants.,
Add a pair of flashy socks.",How to Wear Mule Shoes," Mules with tall heels are very in right now, but you can get them in any height. There are mule flats, mule platforms, mules with thin heels and mules with big, chunky heels. Think about what kind of heels you’ll be most comfortable in.;
, If you’re considering buying a pair of mule shoes, it’s great to find a pair that you can easily incorporate into your current wardrobe. If your day-to-day style is a bit dressy and you wear a lot of blacks and grays, you may want to buy some dressier, black leather mules. If you’re more of a jeans and t-shirt kind of person, you might want to instead grab some lower, more casual mules. You want to have plenty of outfit options to pair your mules with!

, Because mules are backless, they might take some getting used to. This is especially true if they have a bit of a heel, especially if you aren’t used to wearing heels. Walk around in the shoe store before purchasing your mule shoes. Then, wear them around the house to get used to them and break them in before wearing them out for the day.

, These are the perfect bottoms to pair with your mules. They highlight the backless aspect of the shoe while baring a bit of skin around the ankle, without overdoing it. For a professional look, you can’t go wrong by pairing nice mules with cropped, structured black pants. Top your outfit with a button-down or blouse to complete the look.

, For a more casual look, wear your mules with jeans. Jeans that are frayed around the ankle or cropped are perfect. If you have a pair of full-length jeans that you love, cuff them up a bit to show your exposed heel.

, You aren’t limited to pants when you’re wearing mule shoes. If you want to wear a skirt or a dress, however, it’s best to choose ones that go to or below the knee. The big appeal of mule shoes is the open heel. With a longer skirt or dress, that heel is highlighted. Shorter hemlines can show an excessive amount of skin, which takes the attention away from the great footwear.


If you do want to pair them with a mini skirt or dress, pair them appropriately. A flouncy, lightweight skirt or dress would pair best with a daintier mule. A heavier, structured skirt or dress would look great with a more substantial mule with a chunkier heel.

, It may seem like tights would take away the effect of the bare heel, but they can actually look great with mules. On chillier days, slip on a pair of tights with your favorite mules to transition them into colder weather. However, make sure your tights are completely opaque. Sheer tights and mules don't mix., Men and women alike look excellent in a pair of wide legged pants and their favorite mules. Because the hem of the pants swing a bit while you walk, you can show a flash of heel that adds some interest to your ensemble. Whether cropped or floor length, this is a combination that can be used in both casual and professional outfits., It's been a major trend to pair ordinary suits and dress pants with colorful, patterned socks. Pairing mule shoes with these fun socks can add a pop of color and interest to your outfit. Whether you're wearing a pair of tailored black dress pants or some cropped denim, a pair of bold, whimsical socks can really transform your outfit."

If you’re wearing long cowboy boots, a cowboy hat would be a good match. Consider the type of outfit you’re wearing. A beret can work for jeans or dress pants, but it would not look as good with a dress. A floppy and cloche hat would be a great match for a dress., Match your accessories with the material or color of your books. For example, if you’re wearing leather boots, wear leather accessories.

Wear Jordans primarily comprised of bold colors with an outfit that is also bold.",How to Wear Jordans," The vast number of styles and colors of Jordans to choose from make your options almost unlimited. One of the first ways to narrow your choices is to choose a pair based on the occasion you’re wearing it for.


If you’re planning to play a game of basketball and would like to wear Jordans, choose a pair of high tops. The shoe will cover your ankles, which helps to cushion your ankles from injuries. To ensure you’re fully protected from injuries, tie the shoe all the way up to the top.Jordans are popular form of casual wear. The low or high top versions of Jordans can be worn with jeans or shorts, and even casual skirts or dresses.;
, There are over 100 options to choose from when selecting Air Jordans.Choosing which shoe you want to wear boils down to what you do or don’t like, and what colors you’d prefer.


If you prefer a classic or original style, you can choose the first ever released pair of Jordans: the Air Jordan I. Beyond that, explore the brand’s numbered series, which includes Air Jordan I to Air Jordan XX3.
Take a look at the retro Air Jordans, which are becoming more popular now. Look also at the different silhouettes of the shoe to see which style you prefer. Women tend to prefer the silhouette of the Air Jordan IIIs for their softer, rounder shape.
Peruse collections of the Air Jordan special editions, re-releases, vintage collectables, and hybrids of various Jordan models.

, Air Jordans are known to be pretty expensive. Some people are willing and able to shell out several hundred dollars for an exclusive pair.If you have a budget, price will be a significant factor in your decision. It’s also a helpful way to narrow down your selection of Jordans to choose from.

, Jordans are meant to be a statement piece. And they don’t have to fully match what you have in your closet. The multifaceted looks of Jordans allow for you to dress from the bottom up, which means you can dress around the shoe and dress to accentuate its features.

, It’s best to wear Jordans with slim fitting jeans to allow your Jordans to stand out. Wearing baggy jeans with Jordans are not recommended, as they’ll cover and overshadow the shoe. Relaxed, slim jeans will provide a better fit for men. While skinny jeans will work fine for women.You’ll want to choose a shade of blue jeans that blends well with your Jordans. Dark blue jeans work well because the colors of your shoes will pop against the dark colored denim.
Jordans can also be paired with various shades and prints of cargo pants, and styles of shorts. Depending on the color and style of your shoe you can experiment with different, and even bold, colored pants. You can also wear camouflage or floral prints.Both low and high top Jordans work well for women wearing shorts or casual dresses.

, A pair of low-cut, neutral colored socks that fit around your ankles will pair well with your Jordans, especially if you’re wearing low tops. Jordans are worn best when they’re allowed to shine. You don’t want a distracting pair of patterned socks, or a pair of long socks extending past your ankle, to distract from your shoes

, Jordans are meant to be shown off. If you’re wearing jeans, you’ll want you to keep your shoes uncovered. You can do this by tucking the jeans into your shoe around your ankles and pulling the tongue of the shoe upwards.

, Accentuate your Jordans by blending colors from your outfit with your shoes. Jordans are meant to be the centerpiece of your outfit. Wearing too much of a bright color can pull the attention away from your Jordans.


If, for example, you’re wanting to match the red trim of your Jordans, it’s best to add a splash of red to your outfit. You could wear a scarf with red patterns, a necklace or bracelet with a red pendant, or red-rimmed shades. You could accessorize with a red hat, backpack or purse. Or wear a shirt with a red print or pattern.
It’s okay for your outfit to contain large blocks of demure colors like gray, black, dark blue or white, or camouflage print. Even if your shoes contain the same neutral color as your outfit, it won’t draw away from your Jordans. It’ll accentuate the shoe and make it a cohesive part of your outfit.

, Men can wear a t-shirt, button down, or sweatshirt. Women can wear the same, including a few more options depending on their style. If they are dressing in more feminine wear, they can wear a tank top, a shirt with a midriff, and even a dress. The colors in your top should work to accentuate your shoes, so choose either neutral colors or tops with sprinkles of bold color in the print.

, Jordans are essentially an athletic shoe, created originally for the basketball court. If you enjoy the sport, and want send the message that you know how to play even before you hit the court, wearing a pair of Jordans will help.


High top Jordans are not only stylish, but they serve the functional purpose of protecting your ankles while you’re on the court. To keep your ankles fully protected and secure, tie your shoes all the way up.
Wear athletic shorts and a loose fitting athletic shirt. Athletic wear is typically made with a breathable fabric that will keep you from becoming overheated during strenuous activity.
Select your actual size for your shirt and shorts. Men shouldn’t wear anything too large, and women shouldn’t wear anything too tight. While its possible it might interfere with your performance, an ill-fitted outfit might also detract from the look of your Jordans.

, Jordans worn off the court are worn best with casual outfits. When wearing jeans, make sure they’re fitted. For men, your jeans should be relaxed and fitted. Women can wear either relaxed and fitted, or skinny jeans.


Tuck your jeans into your shoes to keep your Jordans uncovered. Pull the tongue of the shoe upwards. And if wearing high tops, it’s not necessary for them to be tied all the way up.
Pair your jeans and Jordans with a complimenting top. Choose a top that blends well with the rest of your outfit. Depending on the weather, you could choose a fitted v-neck short-sleeved or long-sleeved t-shirt, a shirt that buttons up the front, or a sweatshirt. Women could also choose a tank-top.
You could then pair your top with a loose fitting jacket, like a jean-jacket, sweatshirt jacket, camouflage or leather jacket.

, Jeans aren’t the only type of bottoms that can be worn with Jordans. There are alternatives. You can wear either cargo pants or cargo shorts, shorts made of any type of material, and even fitted sweatpants. Women can also wear leggings.


Put together the rest of your outfit as if you’re wearing jeans. Since you’re still dressing casually, you can pair much of the same outfit choices with softer pants that you would with jeans.

, For men, wearing anything resembling formal wear with Jordans just doesn’t work. Women can create a semi-casual outfit with Jordans because they have more style choices like casual dresses and skirts. They can choose to wear either low top or high top Jordans with a slim fitting skirt or dress made from a softer material, like cotton or polyester, or even leather.

, The color combinations you choose to wear with your Jordans will either make or break your outfit. Because Jordans are meant to be the centerpiece of the outfit, it’s best to coordinate colors from the bottom up.

, For example, if your Jordans are mostly white with black trim, go for black or gray jeans or shorts. Your top could either be a mix of black and white, like a striped shirt or a white shirt with black trim or a greyscale image, or it could be a solid neutral color.

, Choose a shade of blue jeans that seems to be most complimenting to your Jordans’ color scheme. You can let the bright color in your Jordans be the focal point of your outfit by choosing a top that is a neutral color, like a light gray or white. You can also choose a neutral colored shirt that has splashes of colors, such as a shirt with a printed image containing similar colors as your shoes.

, This can be tricky if you aren’t good at pairing contrasting colors or patterns well. But if you have an eye for understanding color pallets, then you can create an entertaining outfit. It’s best to choose only one part of the outfit, aside from your Jordans, that you’d like to stand out. If you select a pair of boldly colored pants or jeans, or a pair of pants decorated with a print you admire, your shirt should be a solid, preferably neutral, color.

Think carefully about what style to get.,

Wear pants with wider legs if pairing with thin high tops.,
Roll the bottoms of jeans to create a bit of volume to offset the sneakers.,
Dress up your sneakers.,
Pair shorts with high tops for a summer look.,
Tie the laces.",How to Wear High Tops," Which type of sneaker do you want to wear: thin or thick? A thin high top is something like a pair of Converse sneakers, shoes made of a light fabric that, when tied to the top, rests snugly against the leg. An example of a thick version would be a Nike Air Force 1 or Reebok Freestyle that is wide at the ankle and has more bulk.The issue with thin high sneakers is that if tightly laced all the way up to the top, the shoes can make your ankles look awkward and small.
With chunkier sneakers, be aware that they might make your feet appear larger than they are.;
, What have you purchased in the past? What brand not only looks great but fits your feet? Converse? Nike? Reebok? Or do you want to go upscale and wear Raf Simons, Michael Kors, or Isabel Marant sneakers?


The most important thing to remember when buying high tops is to ensure that they're a good fit. This does sound trivial but it’s easy to get the size and fit wrong, especially with online purchasing., Consider what would suit your personal style and also what you have in your wardrobe that complement them nicely.Like many things, high tops are at their best in simplicity. Black is the best and safest bet for both men and women, like a pair of Reebok Classic Black Hightops. Remember that black basically goes with everything. The next best choice is white or another block color, like red, navy, etc.
Small injections of color can be fun; you want what you wear to reflect your personality. But keep such injections of color small or limited to one color. If you’re thinking of going for a bright block color, the success of the look depends entirely on your surrounding outfit.
If you are looking at the pair of sneakers that look like Skittles, pause for a minute. You might like the color, but you should also think about whether or not that color suits you, fits with your wardrobe, and is something you can and will wear for months. Novelty colors are fun and can look great, but they can also get tiresome.

, This is a great look and very contemporary - and it works for both men and women, since skinny jeans are popular for both! Be smart in pairing your skinny jeans or other skinny pants or tights with sneakers. For example, if you're wearing black jeans, wear colored high tops. If you're wearing colorful jeans, maybe go for a more subtle shoe choice.


As a general rule, don't wear converse the same color as your jeans (unless they're both black because black is a classic and basic shade).This look really highlights the shoes and accents the lower half of your outfit.

, Dress your Converse or similar thin sneaker with pants that are wide at the bottom or allow for a peek of skin to pop out between the pants and shoes – this will keep your body proportions feeling right. This outfit is a great option for most women!For men, however, pairing baggy pants with high tops is a strict no-no. Wearing baggy paints with high tops creates a bulky look and makes men look clumsy and unkempt instead of cool and stylish. Instead, men should pair their high tops with a pair of casual straight or skinny jeans, a cool T-shirt and an open cardigan (preferably the same color as the high tops)., This is a nice spring-and-summer look that works for both men and women, given the recent fashion trend of cropped pants.Make sure not have any visible socks peeking out.
Cropping or rolling your pants helps to focus attention on the shoe while purposefully showing a little ankle. This look really only works with clean, smart sneakers of a single color.

, For women, consider wearing dresses or skirts with high sneakers. This is a great style for women that will highlight your legs and make them look long and lean.


It's particularly ideal to wear clunkier shoes with skirts or dresses. Because the shoe has weight, it can stand on its own and usually looks best without baggy pants or tights competing with it.
You may want to avoid dresses or skirts with thin high tops; sometimes this look can be a little dated. Think skater girls, such as Avril Lavigne, circa 2003.
Wear socks with your high tops
Men can also dress up their high tops though not perhaps with a skirt in most cases. Instead, a well-fitted trench coat can look very chic and urban-modern with the right high tops. Take care, however, to not end up looking like you're wearing a costume from the film ""The Breakfast Club""!, This is especially a good option for men, who may not feel comfortable wearing shorts with sandals in the summertime. For women, pairing shorts with their high top sneakers is super modern and also, again, highlights their figures and great legs!

, This is a key component of wearing high tops as a fashion statement. You want to look cool, not like a slob who can't be bothered to tie his or her laces. "

Wear a pointed-toe style.,
Opt for laces that crisscross over the top of the foot.,
Look for stylish features and eye-catching materials.",How to Wear Lace Up Flats1," Pointed-toe flats are a classic look and pointed-toe lace ups are by far the trendiest design. The sharp toe looks sleek and polished, and these versatile shoes can be easily dressed up or down. Many people find them to be a fashionable alternative to heels. Because of their current popularity, you’ll find an extremely wide variety to choose from, as well as a range of price points.Pointed-toe lace ups are slimming for the legs, as opposed to a rounded toe, which can have an opposite effect. If you have muscular legs, go with a pointed-toe style.;
, The way the laces work for these flats can vary widely from brand to brand, so be sure to check out the many different designs. The crisscross laces are one of the most popular varieties. Look for laces that crisscross before you wrap them around the ankles. These look great with jeans and pants, since the crisscross detail adds an additional dimension to your outfit.When wearing this style, be sure to cuff your jeans just slightly above the ankle, which will expose the strappy lacework.
Try to find a pair with a zip closure at the heel, which makes them extremely easy to take off and on., Basic details are great, but definitely try out some of the more complex design features like peekaboo details, unusual lacework, studs, cut out details, tassels and embellished fabrics. The detail work is what makes these shoes so special, so the more the better. Plush materials like velvet, suede, leather, and snakeskin can really set lace up flats apart, as well.


Open toes, cutaway designs and cut out details can make legs appear longer and leaner, which is a bonus.Even when the design looks complex, the shoes typically aren’t hard to wear, so you don’t need to worry about that aspect.

Buy a basic black pair.,
Elongate your legs with nudes and neutral tones.,
Opt for an eye-catching statement color.",How to Wear Lace Up Flats2," Black shoes, along with matching a large portion of your wardrobe, will always look stylish and sophisticated. A pair of black lace up flats with a pointed toe can look very elegant and can easily replace black heels with many of your dressier outfits. Look for a sleek pair with a glossy finish. Patent (or faux) leather is a great choice, as well as black suede.


If you opt for a complex or unusual design, buying them in black can make them feel a little more accessible, especially if this is your first pair.If you’re able to splurge, buy a designer pair of black lace ups. You’ll get a lot of mileage out of them and they’ll likely last you several years. The trend has been and continues to be popular, so you don’t have to worry about them going out of style any time soon.

, Flats in general tend to emphasize the legs, and because lace up flats tie around the ankles or calves, they tend to draw even more attention to these areas. If you have muscular calves, wide ankles or short legs, opt for a nude-colored pair. These can help lengthen and slim the leg.To intensify this effect, choose lace up flats that very closely match your skin tone – look for hues like nude, blush, tan or brown., The versatility of flats means you can more easily pull off a bright or unusual color, especially if you keep your outfit in neutral tones like black. Neon colors are very popular in the summer time, and a pair of cherry red lace up flats will always look fashionable, especially with a pointed toe.Animal prints and metallic materials can also look very chic.


Many people already consider lace up flats to be statement shoes, so wearing a pair with a bold pop of color emphasizes that even more.
Try a bright orange color, which has been an on-trend color lately."

Cuff your denim or wear them with ankle-length jeans.,
Contrast feminine flats with edgy or menswear-inspired styles.,
Spruce up a casual outfit with lace up flats.,
Wear them with a dress or skirt.,
Tie them however you want to.",How to Wear Lace Up Flats3," When it comes to lace up flats, you want to show the laces! These shoes look great with jeans and pants, but don’t hide the laces under your pant leg. Pair your lace ups with cropped pants, ankle jeans, or roll up the hems of your pant legs just above the ankle.You can still wear lace ups with regular jeans, but they lose a bit of their pizzazz when the laces are hidden.


Ankle-length skinny jeans are very popular with these shoes. For a casual look, opt for a pair of black or distressed jeans.
Baggier “boyfriend” jeans can also look great with lace up flats, as long as you cuff them., Lace ups tend to look very feminine, so pairing them with contrasting clothing can really make an impact. For example, you could wear a pair of lace ups with skinny jeans and a biker jacket. These dainty-looking shoes also look great with clean lines and classic designs, like structured blazers or even a slim-cut suit.Try wearing a pair of glossy black lace ups with cuffed trousers or dress pants.

, If you’re dressed down in a simple outfit, lace ups can add a little energy to your overall look, especially if you choose a statement pair with interesting details or a bold color. They look great with basic neutrals, too. For example, try wearing something very simple, like a fitted black t-shirt and black shorts, with a pair of bright orange pointed toe lace up flats. The shoes give this easygoing outfit a very trendy edge.Wear a basic neutral colored dress with a pair of animal print lace ups. Opt for warm, natural colors like tan, beige, sand and camel.

, Lace flats are quite dainty and work well with dresses and skirts. The look is very feminine. Dresses and skirts also allow for the entire shoe to be visible, which draws attention to the details and laces. Try wearing a black pair with a soft floral printed dress. You could wear statement red lace ups with a black skirt and top, too. These flats are extremely versatile, so definitely try additional combinations.

, As long as the laces are showing, you don’t need to get too hung up on how you actually tie these shoes, as long as you’re comfortable. Different kinds of ties can create a variety of looks, as well. You can tie yours in the front (which is the most typical choice), on the side, or even in the back. You can knot the laces or tie them in a bow, either way is fine.For a playful look, try tying your laces in a bow in the back.

Wear your Converse with skinny jeans for a modern look. If you have high-tops, you might even tuck the hems of your jeans inside the tops of your Converse to show off the side patches.

The length of the rectangle needs to be 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) shorter than your waist-to-ankle measurement.Make sure that the length of the rectangle goes with the grain of the fabric, or it won't stretch right.

, Add tissue/paper towels into the back of your shoe near your heel. This can easily make up for the size. You can not do this with sandals or shoes with no back.

, Sometimes adding a pair of supports (available in most shoe and drugstores) can make a better fit, and perhaps support your feet better.

, Walk around in your shoes with the tissues in them. Make sure they are still not loose. If they are still loose, add more tissue to your shoes.

, Although shoes that are slightly too big are better than wearing a pair that's slightly too small, it's still not good for your feet. If at all possible, get shoes that fit your feet.

Pick a style.,
Choose the right color.,
Select an appropriate material.",How to Wear Ugg Boots1," When people think of Uggs, the first image that comes to mind is the classic monochrome sheepskin boot. Comfy and soft, the original Uggs come in two styles – essential tall and classic short. Though these are great options, the Ugg company now makes a variety of different boots that suit different needs. Choose a style that best compliments your wardrobe and lifestyle.


If you’re looking for a boot that is simply comfortable and warm, one of the classic styles might be the best choice. The classic short is a bit more subtle if you don’t want your boots to be immediately noticeable, while the essential tall is a more visible addition to your outfit.
If you want a boot that’s waterproof and a bit more durable in harsh weather, Ugg has lots of options to offer. While their alternative boots don’t have the classic, recognizable sheepskin Ugg look, they’re both fashionable and functional. For example, the Adirondack boot is made of waterproof leather and suede with wool lining on the inside for super low temps. Check out the Ugg website, http://www.ugg.com/women-boots/, for a full list of alternative styles.;
, When it comes to choosing the color of your Uggs, you should consider how this will complement your complexion, hair color and wardrobe. Lighter hair colors and complexions tend to pair well with a natural earth tone such as chestnut or brown, whereas a darker hair color or complexion looks great with deeper colors such as black, grey, or blue. Most importantly, pick a color that you love!


If you have a lot of warm colors (red, yellow, orange) in your wardrobe, consider a tan or brown boot. The combination of warm colors and tan/brown boots gives you a natural look. If you’re more into neutral colors (black, grey, white) a more neutral boot would pair nicely with your wardrobe. , Snow and rain will ruin your classic sheepskin Ugg boots. While meant for cold weather, this style of Uggs is not waterproof. In places that have chilly winters but not a whole lot of snow, a classic sheepskin boot could be a great choice, since they won’t have as many opportunities to get wet. If you live in a place with consistent snowfall such as the Northeast or Midwest, it might be worth it to look into Ugg boots made with durable waterproof materials.

Add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to that measurement for the top and bottom hem allowances. Measure your fabric and cut it down, if needed. Make sure that it's still 2 yards (1.8 meters) wide.

, Your fabric should now only be 1 yard (0.9 meters) wide and four layers thick., Align the folded edge of your skirt with the folded edge of the fabric. The top edge of the skirt should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) below the top edge of the fabric.If you don't have a pencil skirt, do the following:

Wear Uggs with long pants.,

Feel free to wear a skirt or cute dress.,
Accessorize.,
Avoid wearing Uggs with formal clothing.,
Don’t wear Uggs in warm weather.",How to Wear Ugg Boots2," Uggs are meant to be worn in cold weather, which means they go best with fall or winter clothes. Try tucking trendy jeans into your Uggs if you want the boots to be the star of your outfit. For a more subtle look, wear flared pants over your Uggs. Be bold and try out a pair of dark red or green skinny jeans, but be sure to color coordinate with your boots!, If you’re more into leggings than pants, wear your Uggs over a pair of warm leggings. You can wear single shade leggings in an earth tone for a classy look, or a patterned pair to spice things up. Combine with a loose sweater or top and you’re good to go!

, As long as you’re also wearing tights or leggings, go ahead and wear a blouse and skirt or winter dress with your Uggs. As a rule of thumb, though, make sure your outfit is relatively casual. Uggs aren’t meant to be worn with ball gowns.

, Don’t be afraid to dress up your Uggs with some fun accessories. Throw on a puffy vest or a big scarf to keep warm and look fashionable.Since Uggs are monochromatic, spice up your outfit with some long earrings, a necklace, or a brightly colored winter hat.

, Uggs, though trendy and high end, are meant to be a casual accessory. They’re generally not appropriate for work, or a formal dress event such as a wedding. Wearing Uggs with fancy clothing will look unnatural and will make the boots stick out in an unpleasant way. Instead, wear when hanging out with friends, to a casual meal, to university, or to work (depending on the accepted dress code of your job).


One of the best things about Uggs – you can wear them with sweatpants! Tuck a pair of sweats into Uggs when you’re running errands on a lazy winter day. Pair with a tight long sleeve shirt and you’ll be warm, comfortable, and casually fashionable., No matter how much you love your Uggs, try not to wear them in warm weather. Though comfortable, Uggs are sheepskin boots designed to keep your feet warm. If you wear them in warm weather, you not only run the risk of making a fashion faux pas, but also ruining your boots with excess sweat.

Wear socks.,
Avoid getting wet.,
Treat stains and keep your boots clean.",How to Wear Ugg Boots3," Though it may be tempting to wear Uggs barefoot, the sweat and bacteria on your feet will shorten the lifespan of your boots. Perspiration and bacteria get into the wool lining, damaging the boots and creating an unfriendly odor. Wearing socks will keep your boots looking and smelling fresh for longer.If you do get an unwanted odor, try sprinkling some baking powder into your Uggs and let sit overnight. Baking powder kills bacteria and removes bad smells. Even if your boots don’t have a particularly pungent odor, putting some baking powder in the lining over the summer will keep them fresh for next season., Classic Uggs are, unfortunately, not waterproof. Wearing your boots in the rain or snow will inevitably lead to the formation of bacteria, which causes bad odor. If you’re dying to wear your Uggs in wet weather, make sure to buy a waterproofing spray to protect your boots.

, If your boots become stained or water damaged, use a leather or suede shampoo that you can pick up from your local pharmacy. Scrub your boots down and let sit overnight. Stuff with newspaper to help with drying and to retain shape. Be aware that some shampoos lightly change the color of your boots, but will leave them looking good as new.If you have a particularly nasty grease or oil stain, sprinkle with talcum powder, cornstarch, or chalk and let sit overnight.
If you have a harder stain, such as wine or marker, try spraying a little hairspray on the trouble spot and let sit for a few hours. Then coat with a bit of dish soap and allow to dry. You can repeat this process as many times as necessary until the stain is gone."

If your legs are long and thin, you can select styles with more details and colors, from ankle-high up to knee-high.If your legs are short and/or full, try nude ankle-height gladiator sandals that are close to your skin tone. Alternatively, any solid color with low ankles will work. Shoes with a long vertical strap and height to the heel will help to lengthen the appearance of your legs.;
, Gladiator sandals can make feet appear wider. If you have wide feet or thick ankles, select a style with diagonal straps instead of horizontal straps, which can visually widen your feet. If your feet are thin, you can opt for styles with thin straps and without a lot of detail if you want to widen the appearance of small feet. , Some styles of gladiator sandals have long straps that you tie around your legs. There are two ways to tie these sandals properly. You can tie them around your ankles, or just under your knees. Either way, wiggle your feet and legs around after tying the straps to make sure that they’re secure.To tie around your ankles, keep all of the straps below your calves. Wrap one strap clockwise and the other counterclockwise around your ankle until you have enough tie left to finish it off with a knot.
To wrap straps around your legs, make as few revolutions as possible – you may want to wrap it only once or one and a half times around your leg. The “X” of the straps should hug the back of your calf muscles so that the straps don’t fall down. Tie the straps in a knot just underneath your knees.

, Certain styles of gladiator sandals are more dressy than others. If you want to be able to wear your sandals for dressy occasions, you may want to choose a metallic finish and/or thin straps. You can also purchase gladiator sandals with stiletto heels!, The standard style of gladiator sandals – with flat soles and tie-up straps – are easy to make room for in your suitcase. Try them on first and walk around. Make sure that the soles are not so thin that your feet might hurt if you need to walk on pavement or other flat surfaces.If you plan to wear your gladiator sandals while travelling from place to place, you may want to select a zippered style so that you can take them on and off easily at airport security checkpoints., Gladiator sandals look good paired with large, abstract patterns. Select one patterned piece, such as a dress, top or shorts to wear with your sandals, and keep any other clothing pieces a solid color. Try not to choose micro prints, which can compete for attention with your sandals., Wearing gladiator sandals with a little black dress can add interest to your outfit. Wearing them with a white dress adds edge. With either option, you can transition from day to night styles using the same outfit!For this style, stick with neutral tones like white, black or brown to maintain the elegant, understated look.A solid metallic finish is also a great way to dress up a cocktail dress., Dress up denim shorts and a t-shirt with gladiator sandals and simple yet elegant jewelry, such as gold or silver necklaces and/or bracelets. Gladiator sandals also pair well with short denim skirts.You can elongate the appearance of your legs by wearing heeled gladiators with skinny jeans., Gladiators pair well with short skirts. You can also wear a midi dress, which has a hem that falls mid-calf. Alternatively, you can wear a long dress or skirt with gladiators.Choose simple, flat gladiators if you want to wear them with a long skirt or maxi dress.Try gladiator sandals with a striped, printed or chambray midi dress. You can also wear your gladiators with a shirt dress!, Mid-calf gladiator sandals look great with capri pants or a short skirt.You can pair mid-calf or knee-high sandals with a short romper or jumpsuit. These styles show enough leg to showcase the style of gladiators with higher straps., Test gladiators before buying them by walking around in them first. They should feel comfortable. If your toes are slipping out or the shoe is rubbing the arch of your foot in an uncomfortable way, look for a different pair., Don’t wear socks with your gladiators. Make sure that your feet are in well-groomed condition. Aim for styles that make your feet appear smaller rather than larger.If you have large and/or wide feet, look for styles with diagonal or vertical straps rather than horizontal.

, Try shorts that fall just below the knee.You may want to pair your gladiators with slim, tailored shorts. Gladiator sandals tend to visually shorten the leg. If you have short legs, opt for sandals that stop below your ankles. For longer legs, you can wear styles with straps that go above the ankle bones.Choose neutral tones like black or brown for your sandals. Style the rest of your look with a smart-casual vibe.

, If you don’t want to draw too much attention to your gladiators by wearing shorts, try pairing them with wide-legged trousers such as linen pants, and a simple shirt. This is a good summer or vacation look, and you can also add a lightweight linen jacket. Try this look with leather sandals in dark shades or earth tones."

Go for flats made of leather.,
Look for flats with straps or a buckle.,
Check the flats for a good bottom grip.",How to Wear Flats in Winter1," To ensure your flats can withstand the wet snow and damp weather of winter, go for flats made of leather. Canvas and cotton flats will get wet easily and make your feet cold. Leather flats will protect your feet from the cold and make it easier for you to walk around snowy or slushy areas in winter.Another benefit of leather flats is that you can wipe them off with a cloth to keep them clean and free of snow or slush. Canvas and cotton flats are harder to wipe off and can end up getting stained or ruined in winter.
You may try leather ballet flats, flat leather slippers, or flat leather lace up shoes. Flat leather boots may also be a good option for keeping your feet warm and protected during winter.;
, Having straps or a buckle on the flats will make it easier for you to walk or run around outside during winter. You may opt for flats with stylish ties or straps that go over your ankle. Or you may buy flats with a buckle across your ankle to keep them in place.You can search for flats with straps or buckles online. You can also look for flats in this style in shoe stores.
Try the flats on before you buy them to make sure the straps or buckles do not irritate your skin or squeeze your ankle.

, Flip the flats over and check that they have a rubber bottom with solid grip lines on the soles. Check that the soles are firmly attached to the rest of the shoe and have good grip support on them. This will make it easier for you to avoid sliding or slipping in winter when you are wearing the flats.


You may try walking around the store in the flats to make sure they have good grip on a slick surface, such as a polished or tiled floor. Make sure you feel solid and stable in the flats.

Many flats also come in narrow, normal/medium, and wide widths. If you have very narrow or very wide feet, this is something you might want to consider.

, Most flat shoes will come in different heights: below the ankle, above the ankle, and boot height. Here are some examples of the different types of flats:


Below the ankle flats, such as Converse, moccasins, loafers, pointy-toed flats, and ballet flats, help legs appear longer.
Above the ankle flats, such as low boots, military boots, high top Converse, and sandals with ankle straps, tend to make legs look shorter.
Flat boots are great for the winter, and can help legs look more slender. Consider getting boots that have a slight dip in the front. These can be flattering on all body types., The more versatile a pair of shoes is, the better. Having fewer shoes that you can build outfits around will also help save space in small closets.

, Everybody can wear flats, but certain styles paired with certain outfits look more flattering on certain body types than others.


If you have a petite body, consider pairing flats with skinny jeans that hit at the ankle. This will help to make you appear taller. Stick to more pointed toes rather than rounded toes.
If you have an hourglass shape, wear flats with dresses that finish above the knees.
If you have fuller shaped legs, choose flats in a lighter color. This will make what you are wearing the focal point, rather than drawing attention to your legs and feet. Nude-colored shoes also tend to make legs look longer.
If you have a tall body, consider pairing flats with a loose top and leggings.
If you want to make your legs look longer or leaner, opt for a very slight heel.

, There are different types of flats and pants, and some styles look better paired together than others. Certain types of pants, when paired with a certain type of flat, can also make your legs look longer or shorter.

They look especially good with ballet flats, sandals, moccasins, and canvas sneakers. This pairing also helps your legs look longer, especially of the flats are open-top (such as ballet flats).


Above the ankle flats can also be worn with shorter pants.

, If you are wearing above the ankle flats or boots, however, be sure to tuck the pants inside the boot. The one exception to this are high-top Converse sneakers; the jeans won't fit into the narrow cuff of the shoes and should be born over them.

, They will also help your legs look longer. If it is cold, you can consider wearing some tights under the shorts for a punky sort of look.


Below the ankle flats can also be worn with shorts, but they will make your legs look even longer. If you have very long legs to begin with, keep this in mind.

, They should never be tucked into a pair of boots, however, or they will bunch up.


Consider wearing a pair of pants that are the same color as your boots. This will help your legs look longer. It will also prevent the shoes from ""dividing"" your leg in half.

, Like with pants, different types of flats look better with certain dress and skirt lengths. This section will give you a few tips on how to pair your flats with skirts and dresses., This will help your legs look longer. Mini skirts are especially great for this.

, Try to match the color to your shoes.You can also go for a pair of sheer, nude tights as well.

, A-line and pencil skirts work great with pointy-toed flats and dressy sandals.

, Try to match your shoes to one color of your outfit. For example, if you are wearing blue jeans, a white shirt, and a brown belt, you could wear a pair of brown shoes.


At the same time, you can also wear a contrasting color—just make sure that the tone or saturation are the same. For example, you pair some skinny pants with white canvas sneakers and a black shirt. Keep warm with a black jacket and a red, plaid scarf.

, If you pair fancy shoes with a fancy outfit, you will look overdressed. Instead, consider pairing simple flats with a fancy outfit, or fancy flats with a simply outfit. This will create a nice contrast, and prevent your outfit from looking too busy., Choosing shoes and outfits for work can be difficult. You want to look good, but you also want to meet the company's dress code requirements. Most important of all, you want to be comfortable, especially if you will be on your feet for long periods of time. Here are some things to consider:


If you work retail, refer to your company's dress code to learn what colors and styles of shoe are acceptable. Consider choosing a simple, comfortable flat, such as loafers or sneakers. Most companies will ask you to wear a solid-colored black or brown shoe.
If you work in an office, sneakers might be too casual and heels might be too painful. Consider getting a pair of pointy-toed flats. They are the best alternative to painful heels while still looking formal. They work great with dress pants and pencil skirts.A cute work outfit can consist of a white blouse with lace insets, a black pencil skirt, and black pointy-toed flats with ankle straps. Polish up your appearance with some red lipstick, a ponytail or braid, and a classic pearl necklace., Like with work, you want to look good while meeting any dress code requirements (if there are any). You also want to be comfortable, especially if you need to walk far to get from class to class. Choose shoes that are comfortable, and don't wiggle or slip off your feet; the last thing you'd want is to lose a shoe while you are hurrying to your next class. Here are some cute outfit ideas to get you started:


In the fall, pair some skinny jeans with pointy flats, a loose-fitting blouse, and a jacket. Keep your hair loose and your makeup simple.In the winter, consider pairing some skinny pants with cozy boots. Wear a long cardigan or sweater over a fitted shirt, and cinch them around your waist with a thick belt. Accessorize with a loose scarf, and keep your jewelry to a minimum; you don't want it to get caught on anything.
In the spring and summer, consider pairing some light-colored ballet flats with a flirty, pastel knee-length skirt and a white blouse. If it is colder, switch the skirt out of a pair of skinny jeans.

, Try to pair simple flats with a fancier outfit. Most people associate simplicity with comfort, and comfort with casualness. A simple pair of canvas sneakers or ballet flats does not mean that the rest of your outfit has to be mundane. Here are some ideas to spruce up the rest of your outfit while still looking casual:


Accessorize. Wear some jewelry, a cute belt, or a scarf. If you can, try to match your accessories to your shoes. This will tie your entire outfit together.
Go with layers. This is a great way to make any outfit more interesting. It will also give your more opportunities to match a piece of your outfit to your shoes. An example of layering would be: skinny jeans, a scoop-necked white blouse, and a green cardigan. Finish the outfit off with a pair of green, pointy-toed flats and a brown belt.
Match your shoes to your outerwear. If it is chilly, you can layer your outfit further by throwing on a fashionable coat, a cute jacket, a cozy cardigan, or a flannel shirt. This will not only keep you warm, but it will also make your outfit look more interesting. Again, try to match the color of your outerwear to your shoes.

, Flats can look casual, but they don't always have to be. There are a few things that can make any pair of flats look dressier. Here are some things you should consider:


Pointy-toed flats can look very formal. They are the next best thing to heels.
Flats made from patent or metallic materials tend to look more formal than fabric ones.
Dress sandals with embellishments, such as silver chains, rhinestones, and brooches can also look very dressy. Try to match your jewelry to these embellishments.

, Most flats are going to be warm-weather type shoes. As such, you should avoid wearing sandals, ballet flats, and pointy-toed flats during the cold months. Save those for the warmer months. When the cold weather rolls around, stick with boots. You might be able to wear sneakers during the colder months, depending on how wet, snowy, or cold it is.

, This does not mean that you have to wear thick socks with every type of flat, however. Here are the types of socks you should pair with different types of flats:


Wear open-top, below the ankle flats (such as ballet flats) with thin, sheer socks. You can also get low-cut or hidden socks. Below the ankle shoes that do work with socks include: brogues, loafers, creepers, derbies, and Converse.
Avoid wearing ballet flats and other open-top flats with socks and tights. This causes the fabric to bunch up and wrinkle in the toe area.
Pair above the ankle flats and boots with socks or tights.

, Most flats lack proper arch support. This can make them uncomfortable or painful to wear for some people. If your flats are not comfortable enough for you, check the inside sole and see if there is enough arch support. If not, get a shoe insert that has extra padding in the arch area. It will make them more comfortable to wear.

, Socks help absorb sweat. When you don't wear socks with your shoes, your feet sweat. This can lead to blisters and embarrassing odors. This does not mean that you have to wear crew socks with every pair of flats that you own. For example:


Ballet flats and other types of flats that leave the top of the foot exposed won't look very good with crew socks. Consider wearing them with low-cut or hidden-liner socks. They will protect your feet, but they won't show beyond your shoe.
Flat sandals will have to be worn barefoot. Fortunately, all those open spaces give your feet plenty of ventilation and reduce sweat.

, If you own a pair of flats that slip off the back of your heel with every step you take, you may end up with calluses and blisters on the back of your heel. You can keep your shoes in place with some heel inserts. For example:If your shoes fit well and only slip a little, you might just need a little bit of cushioning, such as a strip of adhesive suede or moleskin.
If your shoes are a little bit on the large side, consider getting a cushioned heel insert. It's shaped like a long oval, and sticks right onto the inside of your shoe's heel. They are usually made out of foam or gel.

, If you have a pair of ballerina flats that dig into your heel, or some flat dress sandals that bite into your toes, you might want to consider getting some moleskin. This will help soften any sharp edges and reduce friction. Simply cut the moleskin to the shape of the affected area, peel off the paper backing, and stick it right into the shoe.You can buy moleskin in shoe supply stores, in the shoe department of a department store, or in the orthopedic section of a drugstore/pharmacy.

, Unfortunately, it is very difficult to make shoes made from synthetic materials (such as plastic, vinyl, and pleather) bigger. Fortunately, it is possible to make shoes made out of natural materials (such as fabric, leather, and suede) bigger. Here are a few tips:


If your shoes are made from a natural material: put on a pair of thick socks, then put on the shoes. Turn on a hair dryer and blow the warm air over the shoes for a few minutes. Wait until the shoes cool off, then take them off. They should now be a little bit larger.Use a shoe stretcher. Buy a shoe stretcher and put it inside your shoe. Twist the knobs until you get the size you need. Spray the shoe with a special she stretching spray. Wait for the spray to dry before taking the stretcher out.Take the shoe to a shoe cobbler.

, You can pad out large shoes made from natural and synthetic materials. You can use insoles and heel inserts to make your shoes a little bit smaller.

Wear Authentics for versatile classic cool.,
Wear slip-ons for an easy ""everywhere"" look.,
Wear C&L low-tops for a slightly classier look.,
Wear patterned prints for a bold ""hipster"" look.",How to Wear Vans1," The Vans Authentic is the classic canvas-and-rubber low-top shoe that most people are casually familiar with, even if they may not know it. These shoes, which bear a passing resemblance to Converse's classic Chuck Taylors and come in a wide variety of colors, are highly versatile. Authentics will look good with almost any casual outfit, so feel free to experiment!Pairs well with: Jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, printed long-sleeve shirts, skirts, vintage wear.







Style tip: Match the color of your Authentics to the clothes on your upper body for a deliberate, put-together look.





;
, Slip-ons are all about ease. With no laces to bother with, a pair of slip-ons can come on (and off) in seconds, making them perfect for when you're on the go. Slip-ons aren't just a high-class version of slippers, however — just like Authentics, they look good with virtually any casual outfit.



Pairs well with: Jeans, t-shirts, shorts, sweats, PJs, yoga pants, skirts, denim cut-offs, skinny jeans.







Style tip: Keep a pair of slip-ons by the door for convenience's sake — this way, you'll look good even when you have to rush out of the house at a moment's notice.







, Vans' ""C&L"" (or ""canvas and leather"") line of shoes looks just like ordinary Authentics, but with real leather trim along the top of the tongue and heel. This minor change makes a world of difference, giving the shoes an air of class similar to what you'd get from a nice pair of topsiders or yacht shoes. Though these shoes look good everywhere, they're best with outfits that are just a little more formal than you might ordinarily wear with Vans.



Pairs well with: Fitted jeans, blazers, semi-formal button-ups, sweaters, semi-formal skirts and dresses.

Style tip: For the best possible look, take care of your leather. If it gets dirty, clean it gently with a damp cloth. If it gets wet, allow it to dry slowly at room temperature (drying too fast can cause it to crack.) If it gets too dry, rub a little leather care cream into it., Vans has a wide range of low-tops made from canvas with a printed pattern on it. These patterns can range from well-known designs like camouflage and floral prints to more unconventional designs like bandana patterns, starry nebulae, and much more. Though the best outfit for each shoe depends on what the pattern is, in general, these shoes are best for giving yourself a ""hipster"" or ""indie"" look, as they tend to be popular with the young ""in-the-know"" crowd.



Pairs well with: Skinny jeans, chinos, band tees, flat-billed baseball caps, ""punk"" wear, ""hip hop"" wear, fake glasses, weird haircuts.







Style tip: The variety of patterns available for purchase are constantly changing, so check online for the latest deals and limited-edition items. For instance, for the 2014 holiday season, Vans released a limited-edition shoe patterned with the artwork from ska-punk band Sublime's album 40 oz. To Freedom in honor of the band."

Try to understand the knot.,
Give your string some slack outside the knot.,
Get a firm grip on two strands of the knot with the tips of your fingers, one in each hand.,
Gently work the two strings back and forth until you feel some looseness.,
Get a good grip on the slack spots and pull open the knot.",How to Untie Shoelace or String Knots1," If you are untrained in knot theory, this can be tricky, but opening a knot is much easier if you know which loops and intersections are holding it together. Study it for a moment and try to determine which direction each loop should be pulled to loosen the knot.;
, You won't be able to untie the knot if the ends outside of it are pulled tight.

, Depending on how thin your string is, this might be impossible. If you need to use your fingernails.

, To untie a knot, you need to create slack. Depending on how you are holding the knot, that can mean pushing instead of pulling. Be gentle but firm—tugging the wrong way too hard can just tighten the knot further. Move on to a different pair of loops until the knot loosens. Keep working the knot from different angles, trying different combinations until you get one or two spots of looseness.

, Just make sure you don't accidentally pull the knot tight again. Pull one end of the string back through the open loops to undo the knot. Once the knot opens up into a series of crossing loops, the surest way to get it untied for good is to trace one end back through the loops until there are no intersections.

Flatter your figure.,
Consider comfort and quality.,
Wear boots for the weather.,
Use a bold boot as a statement piece.,
Follow fashion trends.",How to Wear Boots1," Pick out your boots according to the setting and activity you will be doing.


Choose ankle or knee-high boots with a low heel or no heel for walking around town, attending a sports game, or other casual occasions.
Choose heeled boots for a party or nighttime outing that is a little dressier.
Get a quality hiking boot for hiking or work boot for outdoor work that will support your ankles and feet against rough terrain and labor.;
, Find a boot that will work with the proportions of your body.


If you have wide calves, look for boots with elastic panels, slightly stretchy fabric, or adjustable closures like buckles or laces that will allow more room for your leg. Find a boot with an angled top or wear tights that match your boot color to make your legs appear long and lean.If you have skinny calves, do the opposite: wear contrasting tights and choose boots that have ruffles, straps, or other three-dimensional detail.If you have short legs, favor slim-fitted boots with heels to add length to your legs. Wear these boots with a slim-fitting skirt or pants, or tights in a matching color, to add to the appearance of length.If you have wide feet, go for boots that have a round or almond-shaped toe rather than a pointed one. Avoid straps or buckles near the base of the boots, and try wearing bootcut pants over them to minimize the width of your feet., Look for well-made boots and spend a little more if you have to so that they’ll last longer.


Signs of quality boots are that they’re made of genuine leather, have a thick sole with good tread, and they seem solidly constructed (no loose threads, zippers that stick, etc.).
To find the most comfortable boot, make sure you try on several sizes and walk around in them. Choose the size that feels comfortable, holds your ankle and heel in place, and has ⅜-½” of space beyond your big toe when standing., Invest in boots appropriate for bad weather so that you don’t ruin other boots that are not meant for rain, snow, etc.


Get a quality pair of rubber boots (or Wellingtons) for rainy weather, which you can also line with boot liners for warmth.
For cold weather, try Uggs or other shearling boots, moccasin boots, or knit sweater-like boots.

Place the shoes on a flat surface.,
Tie a basic knot.,
Make a loop with one of the laces.,
Use your other hand to wrap the other lace around the loop.,
Pull the shoelace through the hole to form another loop.,
Hold both loops and pull them tight.",How to Tie Your Shoes1," Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe.If you’re demonstrating this technique to someone, point the toe side of the shoe toward them so they can see your hand movements.
To make it easier for children, color the bottom of the other shoelace brown, the middle part of the lace green, and the top part of the lace brown. This way, when you instruct them to make a loop with the lace, it can look like trying to form a “tree” by always making sure the green part of the lace is at the top of the loop, like the leaves at the top of a tree.;
, Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe.







, You should be holding the lace between your thumb and your first two fingers.








If you are using the “tree” trick, instruct your child to form a loop with the colored lace so the brown parts of the lace are on top of each other (the trunk of the tree) and the green part sits at the top of the loop (the leaves of the tree).

, You should be holding it over your fingers and around the loop. Wrap the other lace toward you rather than away from you.








Again, if you are using the “tree” trick, instruct your child to wrap the shoelace with the knot over the “trunk” of the tree.

, You should use your free hand to pull the shoelace through. There should now be a hole between the looped shoelace and the wrapped shoelace. Pull the wrapped shoelace through so it comes through this hole.








Another way to explain this is to have your child poke the knot on the shoelace through the hole to make another loop.

, You should now have a nicely tied shoe.


You can also instruct your child to pull the knot and the top of the tree trunk to either side, tightly.

Go for a very casual look.",How to Wear Backless Shoes," Avoid buying backless shoes if you walk quickly or tend to have a long stride.Look for backless sandals, such as Crocs, if you have high arches, swollen ankles or leg inflammation.Don’t buy backless heeled shoes if you tend to rely on the straps or backs of wedges/pumps to keep your feet securely in your shoes.;
, Try the shoes on in a store, if possible. Walk around in them and make sure they don’t cause pressure on your feet. Choose the next half size up if your feet are in between sizes. Opt for the larger size if your feet are slightly different sizes.Once you’ve found shoes that fit well, you can buy the product in the correct size online if you don’t want to purchase them at a department store, outlet mall or wholesaler.
If you can’t try the shoes on first, measure your feet and check the measurements of online products.
Don’t assume you can “break them in.” Look for shoes that feel comfortable right away., Choose backless sneakers or casual clogs for an informal look. Opt for pumps or loafers to dress your look up a bit for a night out. Avoid wearing backless shoes to a job interview, as mules are more casual than business casual.For a trendy look, pair backless peep-toe heels with black or white slimfit pants.Wear backless loafers with just about anything, from a shift dress to rolled-up jeans.

, Add traction to the inside of your shoe with textured shoe inserts. Such inserts can also help to prevent pain in the ball of your foot from wearing heels.You can find shoe inserts online, at drug stores, or at sports supply stores.

, Don’t flex your toes to hold your shoes on. Clenching your toes can cause muscle spasms in your legs, blisters and foot pain. Avoid dragging your feet as you walk., Examine your shoes occasionally to make sure they are still in wearable shape. Look at the tread on the bottom of the shoe as well as the midsole. Replace your shoes if you find any indication of uneven wearing., Looked for cropped trousers, which are a great companion to mules. Display just enough ankle to showcase your shoes. A pair of black cropped pants accompany most types of backless shoes well for a chic street style.For example, try stiff jeans with frayed hems that cut off at the ankle.
Pair nude, square-heel, backless pumps or sandals with wide-leg cropped pants and a nice tank top. Instead of cropped pants, you can substitute shorts for a summery look., This is a bit more of a risk than pants, but can still work. Look for hemlines that are midi-length or longer. If you want to go with a shorter hemline, wear a heavier shoe style with heels, and make sure the amount of leg you’re showing isn’t overdone.For example, wear open-toed backless shoes with an above-the-knee leather skirt, a tucked-in top, and a super-long trench coat. The coat ensures that the bare-leg look doesn’t go overboard., Wear backless, pointed mules with long, ripped and cuffed jeans, or with shorts.Add backless sneakers to just about any casual look.For example, pair backless tennis shoes with slimfit jeans, a loose cotton dress in a neutral shade, or casual wide-leg pants."

You can also try nude/tan, white, and gray as well. Silver and gold are also both considered to be neutral, and are ideal for evening looks.


Plan ahead. Avoid mixing contrasting colors, such as black booties and a white dress. This will ""cut"" your legs in half, and make them appear too short.;
, The more slender your heel is, the more chic and sophisticated your outfit will look. A sleek, slender heel is also ideal if you want a more dressy look.

, Shiny materials make things look bigger. Matte materials, such as leather, suede, or canvas, make things appear smaller., Ideally, the cuff of the boot should extend just past the ankle as well.You might also want to skip excessive details, such as heavy embellishment or lots of straps. These will only add bulk to your boots, and thus to the ankle area., These styles tend to be more comfortable than ones with high heels and pointed toes, especially after hours of walking. They are ideal for casual, day-time looks., The pointed toes and higher heels automatically make these styles look fancier than their casual counterparts. They are feminine, and great for elongating the leg. They are ideal for date nights where you won't be doing a lot of walking., Depending on what body shape you have, different boot styles will help balance your body out. Listed below are some ideas based on the four main body types:If you have a pear-shaped body, your hips are wider than your shoulders. Opt for a simple pair of ankle boots with a heel.
If you have an inverted triangle shape, your shoulders are wider than your hips. Try a pair of brightly colored boots. Heavily-embellished styles will also work. This will give the illusion of curvier legs.
If you have a rectangle body shape, your hips, wait, and shoulders are the same size. Try a pair of detailed boots, as this will give the illusion of curves.
If you have an apple body shape, your widest point will be your waist or torso. Opt for a pair of brightly colored or heavily-embellished boots. This will draw the attention away from your waist, and give the illusion of curves.

, Much like body type, different boot styles will help balance things out like height, curves, or lack of curves. Listed below are some ideas based on different height and size combinations:If you are short and slim, go for heeled boots that cover the ankle. This will make your legs appear longer. Avoid boots that end at or below the ankle.

, This will extend your legs, and give you a longer, sleeker look.


If you are tall and curve, skip the cuff details. Too much detailing along the cuff will draw too much attention to your calves, and make them appear thicker than they actually are. Instead, opt for plain cuffs.
If you are tall and slender, you can go with any style of boot.

, Anything that ends about mid-thigh would be idea. The shorter your dress is, the longer your legs will appear. Long dresses (knee-length and loner) are generally not recommended for ankle boots, as they tend to shorten the leg.


If you must wear a longer dress, consider wearing some opaque tights that match the color of your boot. The ideal combination is black boots and black tights. This will make your legs appear longer.

, Long dresses are generally not recommended for booties, because they tend to make the legs appear too short. You can resolve this by getting a dress whose hem ends just above the boot. If you want to wear a maxi-length dress, try one with a slit up the side.Both of these tricks will help keep your legs from looking too short or stumpy.


Try pairing longer dresses with fancier boots that have slimmer heels and toes. Casual boots, with wide cuffs and chunky heels will look better with shorter dresses., This will allow your accessories (such as wide belts and layered boho necklaces) really shine through without making your outfit appear too cramped. The dress can have a pattern on it, if you'd like, but tone down the embellishments, such as beading and embroidery.

, Bulky, heavy boots will ""weigh"" the dress down. Some embellishments, such as a simple strap, won't take away from the look, however., Depending on what sort of dress your wear with your booties, you can draw the focus away from certain areas, and direct it to others. Here are some tips based on different body types:If you are short and slim, try bubble skirts, rompers, and mini dresses. To make your legs appear longer, wear some opaque tights that match the color of your boot.
If you are petite and curvy, try an A-line dress that ends just above the knee if you are petite and curve. Avoid wearing dresses that end below the knee, as this will make your legs appear shorter.
If you are tall and curvy, try a long tunic-type dress or a semi-voluminous dress with dark tights. This will help make your legs appear more slender.
If you are tall and slender, try a dress that ends just above the knee.

, Not all boot styles go well with all dresses. Creating contrast between boot and dress styles can make a boring outfit look more interesting. The wrong type of contrast, however, can make your outfit look clashy, and not in a good way. For example, thick, chunky booties won't look good with a lacy evening dress.Here are a few tips to keep in mind when putting your outfit together:Pair boots with pointed toes and slender heels with fancier dresses. Pair boots with rounded toes and flat or chunky heels with casual dresses.
Try sleek dresses with boots that have sleek heels. If your dress is simple, then you can go wild with the accessories.
Try cowboy styled boots with high-waisted dresses for that vintage feel.

, Note any details on your boots, such as studs or beaded trim. Choose accessories, such as belts or jewelry, that match these details. If your boots are plain, look at the style of your dress instead.


If you are wearing simple, leather boots and a boho styled dress, try adding a wide, leather belt, some feather earrings, and a rustic necklace made from natural stones.
If you are wearing a simple dress with leather, studded boots, try adding a matching, studded leather belt, and some silver jewelry.
Leather ankle boots, a sleeveless tribal patterned midi, a long necklace, and a fedora all look fabulous for a boho look.

, Something as simple as a matching jacket can make a flirty, girlish outfit look more formal and business like. For example, a fit and flare dress with slender-heeled booties will give you a flirty and girlish look. Adding a jacket and/or belt over the dress will immediately give you a more businesslike look., If your boots already have a lot of zippers, studs, or straps, you might want to keep the rest of your outfit looking simple. This also includes your dress. Instead, try a simple belt, scarf, or a pair of stud earrings.If your accessories and dress are too detailed as well, your entire outfit will look too busy.

, A simple dress and boots are like a blank canvas. Try adding some longer earrings and a statement necklace. You can also play around with other accessories, such as a belt, bag, and hat or scarf. Try not to go overboard with your accessories however; if you add too many, your outfit will appear too cluttered.

, Black tights and black booties are great for making your legs appear longer, but they won't make your outfit look very interesting. Patterned tights, however, will.Make sure that your patterned tights match your outfit somehow. For example, if your dress has roses on it, try tights made from lace with a rose design. If your boots have a chevron print on the cuff, try tights with a chevron weave.

, For a more chic look, try a slim belt over a plain sheath dress with slender-heeled boots.

Tie a starting knot.,
Form two ""bunny ears"" with the laces.,
Fold and thread the left loop.,
Fold the right loop over the back.,
Tighten.",How to Tie Moccasins1," To start, cross the left lace over the right lace. Wrap this left lace around the right lace and pull tight to complete a basic starting knot.;
, Bend the left lace in half, forming a loop, and pinch the bottom of the loop together with your fingers. Repeat the same thing with the right lace and hold that loop secure with your other hand.


Hold the two loops side by side for the moment.
Quickly gauge the approximate size of each loop. They do not need to be perfectly even, but the two loops or “bunny ears” should be roughly equal in size.

, Fold the left loop over and around the right loop, and then gently pull it through the hole that forms between the two loops. Do not tighten yet.

, Bend the right loop forward so that it crosses under the left loop and the entire knot structure. Feed this loop through the same middle hole that you just fed the left loop through.


This can be done simultaneously with or immediately after taking care of the left loop. Note, however, that the left loop will need to be folded over before you begin working with this right loop. Otherwise, the middle hole you need to push the right loop through will not be created yet.
After pulling the right loop through the center hole, the two lace loops should be about the same size again.

, Pull the right loop to the right and the left loop to the left to tighten the knot. Use even pressure on both laces to form an even, tidy bow.


As long as you apply enough pressure and tighten the knots thoroughly, they should not come undone, even with slippery leather laces.
You might have to push the knot together a little as you tighten it.

Wear boots over slim-fit pants.,
Wear boots under wider pant legs.,
Let your boot complement the rest of your outfit.",How to Wear Boots2," Choose ankle or knee-high boots like cowboy boots or riding boots to tuck pants or jeans into. Slouch boots are often roomier if you’re having trouble fitting your pants under boots. Wear skinny or narrow fit pants for this look.


To show off ankle boots with pants that are a little too long, roll the bottoms over once or twice to create a cuff. It’s okay to leave a little skin showing between pants and boots. Choose light-wash jeans for this look.

, Choose narrow, smooth boots without a lot of extra bulk like buckles or straps if you want to wear pants over them. Bootcut jeans and pants are made for this. They should be wide enough to easily fit over your boots, and skim the top of where your foot is.

, Stick with neutral color boots (black, brown, or gray) to wear them with any outfit. A good rule for both men and women is to match your boot color with your belt color, too, if you’re wearing one. In general, wear brown with brown and black with black.


For an evening look, pair heeled boots with a super skinny pant and shiny top.
If you want to wear a bright statement boot, pair it with more muted color clothing.
Try out motorcycle boots paired with black pants and a leather jacket for an edgier look, or combat boots with jeans, a loose plaid shirt, and a beanie for a grunge look.

, Keep the second knot loose. Notice there is a circle shape formed by the knot. Hold the circle shape with your hand and lay it flat against the shoe.







, Make sure it comes up through the circle and over to one side. You can keep it loose, but make sure it does not slide all the way out of circle.

Wrap the rest of the lace around the loop.,
Feed the end of the lace through the top of the loop.,
Repeat with the left lace.",How to Tie Moccasins2," Bend the lace into a loop near the base of the shoe and pinch the bottom closed with your fingers. Your loop should use up about one half to one third of the lace, and the rest of the lace should dangle to the side.


Note that this method does not begin with the usual starting knot. In fact, in this method, the two laces are not tied together and the ends are not secured.
Essentially, this is a decorative technique used to take care of the laces in a manner that keeps them from getting in the way as you walk. The coils formed by this knot method will stay firmly in place if secured well, but they will not secure the shoe to your foot like other knots will.
Make sure that your moccasins are tight enough to be worn as slip-on shoes when using this lace tying method.

, Starting with the portion of the hanging end that is closest to the base of the loop, create a tight coil around the entire loop.


You can wrap your coil in whichever direction you please.
Make this coil as tight as possible without disrupting your grip.

, Coil the remaining loose end of the lace around the loop by wrapping it in the same direction several times. Each coil should be directly on top of the last one. Continue wrapping the lace end around the loop in this manner until you reach the top of the loop and have only a short tail left.


Make sure that each coil or wrap is immediately above the one before it. Otherwise, the overall coil you end up with may not be secure enough to hold together.
Wrap the laces around as tightly as possible without losing your grip. You should be left with a very tight coil of leather lace when done.

, Take the remaining shoelace end and feed it through the small remaining gap at the top of the loop. Then tug upward on the on the coil to pinch the top of the loop closed.


The tighter you tug on the coil, the more secure your coil will be. If you tug the lace tightly enough, it should not unwind very easily.

, Use the same technique on the left lace to create another, separate coil. Try to make your left loop the same size as your right loop for a symmetrical look.

Tie a starting knot.,
Form a loop with the right lace.,
Wrap the left lace around.,
Pull both loops together to tighten.",How to Tie Moccasins3," Cross the left lace over the right lace. Wrap this left lace around the right lace and pull tight to complete a basic starting knot.


Pull the two laces together firmly to secure this knot in place.
Note that this is the same “starting knot” used in the double slip knot method. This starting knot forms the basis for many different lace tying techniques.

, Pull about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of the right lace up and fold over into a loop.


Do not cross the ends over each other. Instead, simply pinch the loop closed toward the bottom with your fingers.
Note that if you are left-handed, you might find it easier to start with the left loop instead of the right.

, Pass the left lace over the right, wrapping it snugly around the back of the right loop. Use your index finger to push the left lace through the center hole created in between the two laces. As you push the lace through, you should notice a second loop forming from the left lace.


You should continue to hold the right lace loop in place as you work with the left lace.

, Grab both loops with your fingers and pull them outward to tighten the knot securely.


The left lace loop will be pulled to the right and the right lace loop will be pulled to the left.
This knot is the standard knot used to tie most shoelaces. You can use it to tie your moccasins, and if you practice enough to create an even, smooth looking loop, the appearance can be quite flattering. Since it is not as secure as the double slip knot or boat shoe knot, however, you might find yourself re-tying your moccasins more often if you stick with this method.

Slide the boning material into the spaces between the ribbon and skirt.,
Try on your cage skirt!",How to Make a Cage Skirt," Use a tape measure to take the measurements. Make sure to write these measurements down and keep them to guide you through your project.circumference of waist
circumference of hips
distance from waist to mid-thigh
distance from waist to knee
distance from waist to mid-calf
distance from waist to ankle;
, If you want a full length cage skirt, use your waist to ankle measurement; if you want a knee length cage skirt, use your waist to knee measurement; etc. Note this number for when you go to purchase your fabric.

, To do this, lay the boning in a circle on the floor around you and keep widening or narrowing the circle until the hoop is the size that you want the largest part of your skirt to be.


You can also use a simple math equation to figure out how long to make your boning strip. For example, if you want your skirt to be 30"" across at the widest part, multiply 30 by Pi (3.14) and use the rounded result (94inches) as your boning length., The total amount of fabric you will need is based on your choices for the length and width of the skirt. Add one inch to the width for the hem and add two inches to the length for the hem and waistband. Have your desired fabric cut to this length and width or do it yourself., Unless you plan to wear the skirt on its own, you can use any color or type of fabric that you want. The skirt or dress that you wear over your hoop skirt will cover it. However, you will want to consider a couple of things as you choose a fabric.


Consider the transparency of the dress you will wear the cage skirt underneath. If the dress or skirt that you will wear the cage skirt underneath is light or slightly transparent, you will want to choose a light color fabric for the cage skirt.
Consider the ease of sewing with the fabric. You may have a hard time completing this project if you choose a slippery fabric like satin. To make this project easier, opt for a light cotton or some other easy to sew fabric., The hoops should be spaced about 4-5 inches apart to make sure that your skirt has a nice shape. Therefore, the number of hoops that you will need will depend on the length of your skirt. Divide the length of your skirt by 4 or 5 to find this number.


For example, a skirt that will be 35"" long should have 7 hoops because 35 divided by 5 equals 7. You may end up using one less hoop than you calculate since you will need to leave 2 inches below your bottom hoop and a couple of extra inches above your top hoop.

, The hoops should become smaller as you move from the bottom to the top of the skirt. Therefore, if the length of boning for your bottom hoop is going to be 94"", the next hoop might be 87 inches, then the next one might be 80"", and so on.Add up the lengths to determine how much boning material you will need to purchase.

, There are some different things that you can use to provide structure for your hoop skirt. Choose something that works for your budget and seems sturdy enough to create the structure you desire. Some materials you can use include:1/4"" plastic strapping material used for wood shipments. Home Depot throws this away so often they'll just give it to you
1/4” steel or plastic boning material (look for it in the sewing sections at crafts stores)
1/4” poly tubing (look for it at a hardware store)

, You will need some strong scissors to cut your boning material. Measure before you cut each piece. You may also want write the measurement on a piece of paper and tape it to each piece to help you keep the pieces organized.

, You will need 1” wide ribbon to secure the hoops to the skirt.The amount of ribbon you will need will depend on your number of hoops and the width of your largest piece of boning. So for a skirt with seven hoops and a 94"" piece of boning, you would need 658"" of ribbon (94 times 7 equals 658).


You will probably need to convert this number into feet or yards to make purchasing the ribbon easier. , Pick a strong ribbon material. Avoid lace or mesh ribbons. The color of the ribbon does not matter if you will only be wearing your cage skirt underneath another skirt or dress. If you plan to wear the hoop skirt alone, then you will want to choose ribbon colors that go well with your fabric.

, So if your fabric measures 35” by 94”, then you should cut your ribbon pieces into 94” strands. You will need the same number of ribbon pieces as boning pieces.

, This large piece will be the skirt. Before you sew, fold your fabric in half width-wise and match up the two shorter ends of the fabric so that they are perfectly even. You can pin the edges together or just sew them together right away. When you sew the ends together, make sure to leave about ½ inch of material at the seam., Pin the ribbon pieces to what will be the inside of your skirt. Remember to space the ribbons about 5” apart, but also leave 2” below the lowest ribbon and an extra 2” (7” total) above the highest ribbon.

, Sew along the long edges of the ribbon pieces. Stay very close to the edge of the ribbon as you sew so that you will be able to slide the boning into the space between the skirt and the ribbon.


Do not close off the seam at the ends of the ribbon. Make sure that you can lift up the ribbon a bit and that you can slide the boning into the tube you have created.

, Take about an inch of fabric at the top of your skirt and fold it in half. Pin the fabric and then sew it leaving about ½” of space between the thread and the edge. When you are done you will have a closed tube of fabric at the top of your skirt.


Cut a small hole in the tube you have created. Attach a safety pin to a piece of ribbon and close it. Use the safety pin to help you work the ribbon through the tubing.
When the safety pin comes out the other side, remove the safety pin and gently tug the ends of the ribbon to cinch the waist. You can even try on the skirt at this point to get the waist to where you will want it to be.

, Make sure to slide the correct lengths into the correct spaces. After you have the pieces in place, sew the edges of the ribbon to prevent the boning from coming out. Double stitch the edges to make them extra secure., After you have finished sewing the boning into place, you are done. Try on your hoop skirt to see how it looks. Wear it under another skirt or a dress to get the full effect.

Choose a fashion tape.,
Tape the dress.,
Use alcohol on your skin to remove any oils.,
Attach tape to skin.,
Attach extra tape as needed.,
Remove the tape from the skin.,
Remove the tape from the dress.",How to Keep a Strapless Dress Up1," There are many types of fashion tapes available on the market. Before purchasing one, read reviews about different brands, and read the label carefully to make sure it will be suitable for the fabric of your dress.


Look for tapes that are bit wider, as they will have more surface area, meaning they will stay stuck longer.
It is reported that some celebrities actually use toupee tape for their red carpet events, instead of fashion tape.;
, The tape will be sticky on both sides, and will typically have a sticker you have to remove from both sides in order to keep it sticking to everything before you’re ready to use it. Carefully apply the tape all the way around the top of the dress, as close the top edge as you can.


Apply another layer below the first for extra protection, if you wish.
Make sure you apply firm pressure to the tape before moving on to the next step.

, Tape cannot stick to a surface that is oily. If you have oily skin, or have just put lotion on, use a cotton pad with rubbing alcohol on it. Gently swipe the pad across the part of the skin where you wish to attach the tape.

, Once you are ready to go, put any undergarments you wish to wear on, and then the dress. Peel the backing of the fashion tape off, and then attach it to the skin


This will require you to apply firm, direct pressure to the area of skin you are attaching the dress to. It may be helpful to have someone help you do this part.

, At this point, you should be good to go; however, if you notice spots that feel a bit insecure, you can carefully attach more tape.

, Before removing the dress, pull the tape slowly and gently away from your skin. If there is extra residue left on your skin, you can use oil (e.g., baby oil, olive oil. vegetable oil, etc.) to gently remove it with a cotton ball.

, Pull the tape away from the fabric before washing according to the label's instructions. If there is any residue left on the fabric, you can either pull it away with your fingers, or you can try rubbing it away with a warm, wet wash cloth.


Be gentle if you use a wash cloth! If you scrub too hard, you might ruin the fabric. If the fabric is very delicate to begin with, you may consider taking it to a professional cleaner, who can clean the delicate fabric properly.

Get together everything you need to fix your dress.,
Measure the ribbon to fit your waist.,
Cut the remaining ribbon into four equal parts.,
Remove the boning in your dress.,
Insert the new boning into the space where the old boning was.,
Leave 1/2 an inch (1.3 cm) of the bottom portion of boning free from the dress.,
Sew the bottom of the boning to your stay.,
Continue this process with the three remaining pieces of boning.,
Sew your hook and eye clasps to each end of the stay.",How to Keep a Strapless Dress Up2," For this method, you will need one to two yards of fabric covered boning, fabric scissors, thread, a sewing needle and fabric pins, enough Grosgrain ribbon to fit around your waist with at least an extra 10 inches (25.5 cm) to spare, and two hook and eye clasps., Fit the ribbon around your waist, with 2 to 3 extra inches (at least 7 cm).This is what will make your waist stay.

, These ribbon patches will be used to sew the boning into place., Many strapless dresses come with boning already in them; however, this boning is usually of poor quality and very flimsy. Take your fabric scissors and carefully cut a small hole into the lining so that you can pull the boning out.


Do this carefully! You don’t want to damage the dress lining too much.
Skip this step if your dress does not have boning already.

, Don’t worry if you didn’t have boning in your dress before. You can simply sew the boning to the lining of the dress.You will need to use at least four pieces of boning. Two pieces will go in the front and two pieces will go in the back. Be sure to space the boning evenly!
If you are sewing the boning directly onto the dress (and not using the old boning spaces), make sure you leave at least 1/4 inch of space (3 cm) at the top and at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) before the bottom of the waist. Do not sew the bottom of the boning, but leave it free (and not sewn into the dress).When sewing boning to the dress lining, make sure you do a line of stitches on the top of the boning to keep it from poking you. Be cautious when sewing, you don't want your needle to go all the way through the liner to the outer fabric!, You will need this “extra boning” in order to sew it to the stay (made from the Grosgrain ribbon).

, You can do this by using the small patches you cut out earlier and placing the boning between the stay and the patch. Sew backstitches from the top layer (the stay) through the fabric of the boning and then through the patch.


Grosgrain ribbon has a smooth side and a ribbed side, make sure the smooth side is facing out so that it does not create lines in your dress., Before you move on to sewing the next piece of boning, try the dress on and pin the stay to make sure you will sew the boning to the right part of the stay., Once you have completed the boning, you will need a way to keep your waist stay closed. To do this, sew one half of the clasp to one end of the ribbon and the other side to the other end. Repeat this with the second clasp.This will allow you to clasp the waist stay together, similar to how you would do with a clasp bra.

Find a seamstress.,
Explain to your seamstress what you would like.,
Schedule a second fitting.,
Speak up.",How to Keep a Strapless Dress Up3," You can find one in the phone book or by searching online for “seamstress” plus the name of your town or city.


Be aware that some seamstresses are very busy, and alterations can take some time. If you need the dress very soon, you may have to try another method if the seamstress cannot finish it in time.

, Although he/she may tailor the entire dress to fit better, you should make it explicit that the dress falls down, so you want it tailored to fit your bust better.

, It is important to make sure you try the dress on at the seamstress’ shop before taking it home. This way, you can make sure it fits just right.

, If you try the dress on, and it still feels a bit loose, say this! A seamstress uses a measuring tape to see how the dress should fit, but a misplaced pin could throw measurements off. If you don’t feel right in the dress, then kindly explain that.


Be sure to be courteous. Do your best to be gracious to the person who makes your clothes fit.

Find a strapless bra.,
Have plenty of safety pins on hand.,
Put your bra and dress on.,
Pin the bra and dress together.,
Pin all around the dress.",How to Keep a Strapless Dress Up4," This method requires you to wear a strapless bra. If you don’t have one already, you will need to buy one.


Make sure it will not show through the dress! If you are wearing a white dress wear a nude colored bra instead of a white one.

, These are what you will use to pin your dress to the bra.

, Before you can begin pinning them together, you need to have them on.


It will be very helpful if you have someone help you with the pinning!

, From the inside (e.g. insert the pin from the inside of the bra to the outside of the dress. This will hide the larger part of the safety pin.If your dress has a lining, you can try pinning the dress only through the lining so that the pin doesn't show on the outside at all. Make sure, though, that the lining is strong enough to support the dress! If the lining is very thin, and the dress fabric quite heavy, it may tear the lining.
Alternatively, if there is no lining or you want the extra support, pin through the entire dress, but make the space between where the pin exits the fabric and then re-enters the fabric as small as possible so that it will not be too visible.

, You don’t have to pin every inch of the dress, but have enough so that the dress is well adhered to the bra. You don’t want the dress to fall down in some areas and remain in place where it is pinned.

Count their models.,
Find out how to contact them, if you need to.,
Keep in mind that if you don't want to buy a prom dress online, you can always get one from a store.",How to Identify a Scam Prom Dress Site," Most reviews can help you see if the website is a genuine prom dress selling site. Some reviews may be fake, so watch out! Video reviews are the best, for usually they show evidence of purchase and how it really looks in real life. Google (insert prom dress website name) scam or (insert prom dress website) reviews.;
, Don't use some mysterious, fly-by-night, unknown websites. If a dress site is popular, chances are that they are a good company and you can rely on them.

, Is the price of the dress you want to cheap to believe? Are there ""90% PERCENT SALES!!!"" all over the page? Better quality dresses are expensive- don't get a $50 prom dress from a website.

, Often, prom dress websites have models for their dresses. If there are 5 consistent models they use over and over again they are most likely fake. If they use 15+ models, they should be real and you're good to go.

, Do they have many ways to contact them? Real websites have emails to contact them, phone numbers, and a street address. Most of the scam websites don't have any of those.

, Stores are safer, for you can see how the dress fits your body shape and how it looks on you. You can also borrow one from a close relative or a close friend if you can fit in the dress.

Short women or girls look really good in knee-length skirts that fall right below the knees. It’s not true that short women can’t wear knee-length skirts.If you’re very tall, you will look great in a skirt that falls right at the mid-calf point. That doesn’t mean you can’t try a knee-length skirt, but it’s something to consider.
Women over 40 look good in knee-length skirts, which are slimming, and show the calves.;
, There are many styles of knee-length skirts, and different body types look better in some than others.


Knee-length skirts don’t have to be boring, and they don’t have to come in a boxy, shapeless style. There are pencil skirts, full skirts, balloon skirts, and A-line skirts, for starters.
Pleated skirts are great on apple-shaped women because they camouflage the stomach area.
Hourglass shapes look great in pencil skirts because they slim the thighs while still showing off your curves. Skirts with details on the bottom, like ruffles, also show off the curves.A-line skirts look great on women with pear shaped bodies. They minimize a larger lower half. If you're very thin, avoid bulky skirts, and try belts!Women with straighter bodies and not a lot of curves could try wearing a baby doll dress on top of the knee-length skirt. This will give the illusion of curves.

, Since the knee-length skirt is a little simple in concept, you can make it seem different and stand out even more by choosing a bold color.


Think bright colors like bubblegum pink, mustard, lime green, and peach. Pastels work well, but gem colors do too. You could try wearing a knee-length skirt with pleats. Choose it in a bold color, like lipstick pink, so it doesn’t look like you raided grandma’s closet.
Knee-length skirts with mermaid hems are another way to make the style seem more up-to-date and very romantic. Consider pairing a red mermaid hemmed skirt with a simple white sleeveless shirt.
Pay attention to how color and pattern work with your with body type (bold accentuates features, so placement of bold elements can be important.) For example, if you want to slim your hips, darker colors will work better on the bottom, and you could save the bold colors for the shirt. Navy, gray, dark brown, and black are slimming; brighter colors can make areas look bigger.
That doesn’t mean you can’t make a black or white knee-length skirt work; you can, especially if you choose a colorful shirt. However, play with the color palette, and don’t be afraid to go bold. It’s a good rule of thumb to follow, though, that if you go bold on the bottom, pick a neutral color for the top, like a white or black shirt.

, Knee-length skirts are no longer avoided by celebrities, even in the summer. You can look good in a knee-length skirt too. It doesn’t have to look dowdy. Play around with the fabric choice.


One way to make a knee-length skirt stand out is to pick one in an interesting fabric like lace. For example, some people wear knee length skirts in plaid. Want to really get attention? Try wearing tulle. This ballerina-like fabric is great for a night out.
If you go with such a bold design or fabric, it’s a good idea to be simpler on top. One winning look is to pair the skirt with a crop top and a denim jacket or shirt.Eyelet fabric is considered very romantic and another way to jazz up a knee-length skirt. Again, because this is a busier fabric, it’s best to choose a simpler top, such as a tight unadorned white shirt. The reverse is also true. If you wear a solid-color knee-length skirt, you could go bolder with your top, by even wearing an eyelet shirt!

, If you choose a solid-colored knee-length skirt, you’re going pretty traditional. So, it will make for an interesting contrast to pair the skirt with a more modern shirt.


Pick a shirt with an edge that speaks youth. For example, you could wear a cropped shirt, or a black shirt with shapes cut out in the sleeves. Crop tops are a great idea if you’re younger. Celebrities wear this look all the time. If you're wearing a belt, you will likely want a shirt that doesn't have a lot of fabric or a busy pattern. The belt itself will be the attention-getting item.
You could choose a graphic T-shirt with a statement on it that is young and sassy. You could wear a plaid shirt or a shirt with gemstones or polka dots. Some people wear patterned knee-length skirts, but because of the amount of fabric, you might want to choose a solid color and save the pattern for the shirt.
You could also play with contrasts in fabric, pairing the skirt with a denim shirt, for example, or with a T-shirt. Some people wear sweatshirts with the knee-length skirt. Again, play around with contrasts., Since the knee-length skirt can be seen as dowdy or just traditional in some corners, you have more leeway to spice up the top.


A good rule of thumb is to not wear tight all over clothes. In other words, if you wear a more form-fitting shirt, don’t wear a tight or revealing top. The reverse is also true.
Thus, because the knee-length skirt is classic, you could wear a shirt that shows a little cleavage or is just a little more form-fitting.
Wear a long sweater. One common look with a knee-length skirt is to wear a slouchy sweater. This can give the entire look a cooler vibe.

, Which knee-length skirt you choose can depend on the formality of the occasion.


Skirts with more going on, such as pleats, ruffles, or other detailing, are going to work better for a night out, and they might seem frivolous for work.
Stick with simple pencil or A-line skirts for business occasions, and the simpler the better if you're in a more informal setting too.
Fabric matters here. Lace, velvet, tulle and other more luxurious fabrics work better for a night out. The shirt matters too. You can dress a skirt down fast with a crop top or T-shirt, and you can dress it up fast with a silk buttoned-down or other professional shirt.

, One way to make a knee length skirt look really classy is to wear a belt. This will draw attention away from the hemline and back to your waist.


Some people prefer to wear a wide belt with a knee-length skirt. You could try choosing a wide belt in an interesting color, like mustard.Other people prefer to wear thin belts with knee-length skirts, but there’s more material with a knee-length skirt, so a wider belt might be a better choice so the belt is more visible.
With some pencil skirts, you will want to wear the belt a little bit higher to create sort of a vintage look. Remember that knee-length skirts are sort of a throwback style of the old classics.

, Remember that knee-length skirts can be pretty formal. They don’t have to be (if you wear, say, a cropped top), but they often are.


Go with the formal feel, and carry a vintage clutch. Play up the 40s and 50s feel of the skirt. You don’t want to carry too big of a purse with this look because, again, you want the skirt itself to make the statement.
You could try carrying a clutch in a color that doesn’t match yet complements the skirt color. For example, if your skirt is black, you could carry a ruby-red clutch or a lime-green one.
Keep other accessories simple. Maybe wear a brooch on your shirt (depending on the shirt). Maybe wear simple diamond earrings. But, again, you want to let the skirt draw the attention.Wear bracelets, necklaces, rings, scarves, hats, and fingerless gloves.

, It might seem counter-intuitive to wear boots with a knee-length skirt because that’s not going to show much of your legs. As long as you let a few inches of leg peek out, it will look good.This look is very popular, especially in the winter, and it can look great. In fact, you can wear boots with a lot of different skirt lengths.Boots in leather or suede look great. You probably won’t want to wear knee-length boots with this look, though. Ankle boots look especially good with knee-length skirts.However, people have tried to wear knee-length boots with knee-length skirts and have pulled it off. Pick boots in a different color than the skirt if you try to do so. Wearing tights with a knee-length skirt works if you choose tights similar in color to the skirt. Otherwise, you won't be showing enough leg to create a streamlined look.

, Try strappy heels with a knee-length skirt. Remember that the skirt is pretty formal and almost vintage.


If your shoes are flats or too simple, the entire look might be boring. Wearing strappy high heels is a great way to jazz up the dress. Strappy heels will elongate your legs.
You can also pair a knee-length skirt with flats, though. You should probably avoid wearing shoes that are too busy with a lot of lacing and other decoration. You don’t want the shoes to compete with the skirt.
Some people even pair knee-length skirts with tennis shoes. You will avoid looking too frumpy if you accent the skirt with trendy or youthful fashion choices.

Add the finishing touches.",How to Make a Flower‐Filled Tulle Skirt," Measure around your waist first. Divide that number by 3.14. Divide the answer again by 2. Record that number as your ""waist radius""., Chiffon and organza make great choices here. You can also use a light silk fabric as well, but avoid anything too heavy, like satin. If you want something with more coverage, use two layers of fabric. Stack them together and fold them both at the same time.


You will be adding the tulle later one. This is just for the base of the skirt.
Something light in color, such as white or ivory, would work best.

, Tie a pen to a piece of string. Pin the string to the middle of the folded part of the fabric. Make sure that the string is the same length as your waist radius, then use the string as a compass to draw an arch on the fabric., Decide how long you want the skirt to be.

Make sure that you are using a heat setting suitable for the type of fabric you are working with.
Make your sewing more durable by backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.

, You don't have to do this, but it will make the hem of your skirt stiffer and give it a ruffled effect. Use a matching thread color and remember to backstitch.

Horsehair bands come in different colors. Use one that closely matches your fabric.

, Make sure that the right side is facing up, and the wrong, hemmed side, is facing down.

, Get lots of fake flowers in a variety of sizes: large, medium, and small. Gently pull the flowers off of the stems, then discard the stems. If you can't pull the flowers off, you will need to cut them off, just below the base, with some sturdy wire cutters.


Choose flowers that are relatively flat, such as daisies. Certain types of roses and dahlias may also work.
Choose a color scheme. Try something with only warm tones, or something with only cool tones.

, Start with the largest flowers first, then fill the gaps in with your medium and small flowers. Try to place most of the largest flowers towards the bottom of the skirt, and the smaller ones towards the middle. Avoid going too high up the skirt.Try adding some large, statement/fancy flowers. Don't get carried away, however!
Don't arrange your flowers in a straight horizontal or vertical line. Try to arrange them in a more organic pattern.
You can use as many or as few flowers as you want. The more flowers you use, the fuller your skirt will be!

, Once you are happy with the arrangement. pick up the flowers one by one, and glue them to the fabric using hot glue. If you don't have any hot glue, you can use fabric glue instead, but it will take longer to dry.

, If you went with a very full design, pick the skirt up and bend it here and there. If you notice any gaps between your clumps of flowers, fill them in with smaller flowers, petals, or leaves. This way, when you wear the skirt, you won't get any gaps showing between the flowers when the skirt moves., Measure the length of your skirt first, from waist to hem, and add a couple of inches/centimeters. This will be the height of your tulle. Next, measure along the hem of your skirt, from side-to-side, then add a couple of inches/centimeters. This will be the width of your tulle.

, Fold the tulle in half first, then use your measurements to cut out a rectangle. The folded part of the tulle will make the bottom of your skirt. It should match the length of the hem.Use fine, tulle netting. Avoid the stiff tulle with large holes meant for hat-making.

, Unfold the tulle fabric first. Sew a straight line along the top edge of the tulle using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Sew another line just below that using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Your stitching is now ready for gathering.


Repeat this step for the bottom edge of the tulle.
Use the longest stitch length you can. Do not backstitch.

, Go back to the top edge of your tulle. Find the bobbin threads from the two lines you sewed. Gently tug on them at the same time to gather the tulle. Keep gathering until the tulle is the same length as the waist of your skirt.Repeat this step for the bottom edge of the tulle.
You may have to gather from the other side of the tulle as well. Only pull on the bobbin threads, however.

, Turn your skirt so that the front is facing you. Pin the top, gathered edge of the tulle to the waist of your skirt. Flip your skirt over so that the back is facing you. Pin the bottom, gathered edge of the tulle to the waist of the skirt as well. The tulle will fold around the hem of the skirt, sandwiching the skirt inside it.You want the tulle layer to be the same length as the skirt. If the tulle is too long, pull it past the waist of the skirt.
Gently fluff out the bottom edge of the tulle so that it's the same length as your skirt's hem.

, Start by sewing along the waist of the skirt, removing the pins as you go. Next, go to the left side edge of your skirt. Shift the tulle so that it matches up with the chiffon, then pin it in place. Baste the layers into place, removing the pins as you go, then repeat for the right side.


Do not fold and sew the skirt in half just yet. You are simply sewing the layers together to make things easier later on.

, Measure the waist of your skirt first. Cut ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) wide bias tape according to that measurement. The bias tape can be the same color as your skirt, or a contrasting one.If you can't find a matching color, try making your own bias tape.
If you choose a contrasting one, try matching it to one of the flowers.

, Open up the bias tape, and slide it over the top edge of your skirt. Pin it in place, so that the waist part of your skirt is sandwiched inside of it. Sew along the both edge of the bias tape using a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance and a matching thread color.


Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.
Be sure to remove the pins as you sew.

, Fold the skirt in half, so that the side edges match up. Make sure that the wrong side is facing out. Sew along the side edge using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Stop when you are 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) from the waist., This will give you a cleaner finish. Be sure to pin everything in place. Do not iron the tulle, or it will melt.

, Place an invisible zipper over the slit. Make sure that the top of the zipper matches up with the waistband of the skirt. Check the slit from the inside of the skirt, and make sure that the zipper is not visible.Even though invisible zippers won't be visible in the end, try to use a color that matches your skirt.
Don't worry if the bottom of the zipper extends below the slit.
Iron the zipper flat first. This will help it lay better., Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. When you reach bottom of the slit, backstitch a few times across the zipper. This will help keep everything in place. , Use a sharp pair of scissors to trim off any loose threads. Cut off the excess zipper above the waistband. Turn the skirt inside out, and give it a shake to fluff everything out.

Pick a longer skirt or dress.,
Wear undergarments for extra protection.,
Try wearing bike shorts over your underwear.,
Put on leggings to prevent showing too much.",How to Avoid an Upskirt1," Your odds of revealing too much decrease significantly for every extra inch of length. Here's a good test to try: can you sit down and stand up comfortably without feeling like you've revealed too much? Can you stoop at the knees to pick something up from the ground without having the skirt inch up past the middle of your thighs? If the answer to both questions is ""no,"" you might need to consider a longer skirt.


A skirt that comes past the knees will also make it easier to get into and out of a car without revealing too much.;
, If you're truly paranoid about someone seeing up your skirt, you can try to lessen the potential embarrassment by wearing undergarments with plenty of coverage. Here are a few options to try:


A slip: In addition to preventing static cling, a slip can provide an extra layer of coverage between you and your skirt. Select one that's slightly shorter than the skirt you plan to wear, and is of a coordinating color (that is, a black slip for a dark skirt; a white or flesh-toned slip for a light skirt).Boyshort-cut underwear: This underwear should cover your hips and rear completely, as well as provide frontal coverage from the top of the thigh up to the top of the hips. Even if your skirt accidentally rides up, boyshort-cut underwear will make sure you are still covered sufficiently.Pantyhose: Most pairs of pantyhose should have an opaque ""top"" section, running from mid- or upper-thigh to abdomen. (This differentiates them from stockings, which usually stop at the mid-thigh.) A black pair of pantyhose makes any upskirt peek more difficult.

, Bike shorts are usually made out of stretchy material such as lycra or spandex, and can be worn over your underwear to provide an extra layer of coverage. Because they're so fitted, you shouldn't be able to see that you're wearing them once the skirt is on., In the winter and fall months especially, leggings can be worn under a skirt or dress to provide extra warmth. They will also help ensure that even if your skirt does ride up, you will not show too much skin."

Choose a longer, fitted skirt on windy days.,
Smooth out your skirt as you sit down.,
Cross your legs or ankles when you sit down.,
Be careful when you're walking up stairs.,
Avoid sitting on the floor or ground.,
Stay away from glass railings and elevators.,
Move carefully in your skirt.",How to Avoid an Upskirt2," Loose and flowing skirts can easily blow up on a windy day and they are very difficult to manage. In order to avoid showing too much skin as a result of gusty wind, try wearing a tight or fitted skirt that hugs your body.If you don’t feel comfortable in a tight skirt, or that is just not your style, you can try using skirt or dress weights to keep your dress down even on a windy day. Purchase small weights at any sewing supply store. Then sew the weights into the bottom hem of the skirt. This will help hold the skirt in place., Use one or both hands to smooth your skirt from mid-thigh downward as you sit, especially if you're wearing a skirt with a slit in the back. This makes sure you're sitting evenly on the fabric without it bunching, and also closes off any potential space that could be too revealing.

, Crossing your legs will close any gap between your thighs, though it might reveal a bit more of the underside of your leg. Be sure to cross your legs carefully in order to avoid exposing your underwear while doing this. If you want to play it really safe, cross only your ankles - this will draw your legs closer together without exposing any additional skin.You can also situate your hands on your lap so that they cover any area that might be exposed while sitting. This is a good idea if you want to avoid an accidental upskirt while taking a photo or exiting a vehicle., Take stairs one at a time, and try to keep your steps as close as possible. If your skirt has a slit in the back, try to walk so that no one is directly behind you. When you're traveling in a group, hang back and start up the stairs last. This way no one will be behind you and able to see up your skirt.If you're on an escalator that does not have glass sides, position yourself so that your rear is against the side. This prevents people several steps beneath you from trying to glance up your skirt.
On an escalator with stairs, try to position yourself in the middle of a stair and keep your legs close together. You can also use your hand to smooth your skirt in front to avoid an upskirt from below.

, If at all possible, try not to sit down on a flat floor or stretch of grass. You might be covered while you're sitting, but lowering yourself and standing back up might put you in a revealing position, especially if you have to maneuver around high heels.

, Many two-story malls and shopping centres use glass railings and elevators. If you are worried about an upskirt, avoid standing or walking too close to a glass railing. People on the ground floor may be able to see up your skirt. The same thing applies to glass elevators. Do not stand along the glass. Instead, situate yourself in the middle of the elevator so that you are not visible from the ground.

, If you are worried about people seeing up your skirt you should make sure that you manage your movements. Avoid jumping and twirling, or any movements that may cause your skirt to ride up and reveal too much skin.Try out a bunch of different movements in front of the mirror before going out to see what happens to the skirt as you move. This will give you an excellent idea of what movements to avoid when in public.

Pay attention to your surroundings.,
Know the local laws regarding voyeuristic photography.,
Report inappropriate upskirt photography to the local authorities.,
Publicize any instance of upskirt photography.",How to Avoid an Upskirt3," When you are travelling through public spaces it is a good idea to pay attention to what is going on around you. Many upskirt photographs are taken in highly populated areas, such as subways, malls, and busy sidewalks. If you see someone acting suspiciously, you can keep your distance from them to avoid an upskirt.

, Upskirt photos are a growing concern as more people have high definition cameras on their smart phones. Often these pictures are uploaded to websites. It is difficult to charge people who post these images because many websites are hosted internationally. Also, many states are just now creating laws to deal with these types of photographs. For example, in 2014 in Massachusetts a law was passed to ban the practice of upskirt photography. Those charged can receive up to 2 1/2 years in prison or a $5,000 fine., Although you can do your best to take extra precautions and cover up while wearing a skirt, the major problem is that people are taking upskirt photographs in the first place. Laws will likely begin to change as more instances are reported. As a result, it is important that you make a report anytime you are a victim of inappropriate voyeuristic photography or you witness it taking place.You can also report the incident to a store manager, security guard, or any other public or private authority in the area.
When you report an incident it is important to provide detailed identifying information. For example, description of appearance, an account of what happened and where it happened, license plate number, or any other details you think are important.

, Reporting an upskirt photograph to the local authorities is one way to help change laws. You can also publicize your experience by talking with the media or posting your experience on social media. Many celebrities have talked openly about having inappropriate photos taken of them and posted online. This type of publication may help to sway public opinion and lead to the implementation of more laws."

Set up online sale alerts.",How to Find Cocktail Dresses on Sale1," Instead of heading for the full priced dresses, find the racks that contain marked down dresses. Most department stores will mark down merchandise anywhere from 20%-80% off the original price.


Racks are usually grouped according to percentage off. Start with the racks containing the most mark downs if you are on a tight budget. Go towards the back of the store or section if you are having trouble finding the clearance racks.;
, This is extremely important for saving money on a dress, especially a dress that is part of this season's fashion. Most major clothing and department stores run sales around holidays, like Labor Day, Presidents' Day, Independence Day, and Black Friday.Watch for circulars or television commercials advertising these sales around holidays. Most stores use every small and large holiday for an excuse to have a sale.

, Many clothing and department stores offer coupons to encourage consumers to come to their stores. These coupons can be found in advertisements received through the mail, in newspapers, or sometimes in the front of the stores.


Search online for coupons. Sometimes, stores provide coupons on their websites or mobile apps that are not well publicized through sales papers or commercials. Googling a store's name plus the word ""coupon"" may also yield coupons you can use.

There will be an Air Jordan “Jumpman” logo on the lid and also on the side of the box. The printed colors on the packaging should appear even and uniform, with no areas of fading. The texture of the box itself will be consistent.The boxes vary in color and style depending on the year and type of Jordans, so you may want to run a Google image search to see what the current boxes look like.;
, Make sure all of the words on the box are spelled correctly. Ensure that the Jordan Jumpman logo appears complete, without any unusual looking proportions or fading. Everything on the box should be aligned properly, with nothing looking unusual or crooked.If you are unfamiliar with the Jumpman logo, Google the image and make sure the logo on the box looks exactly the same.

, All Air Jordan boxes will have an official manufacturing sticker on the side. Check for the accurate style name of the shoe, the shoe size, color combination, and country of manufacture.

See if you can perform a Burn Test.,
If you really need to know, consider a Chemical Test.,
Remember that Old is Gold.",How to Determine if Silk is Genuine," This is a quick spot test that one can do especially before buying a silk saree. The idea is to rub the silk with your hands. If you feel warmth on rubbing it, go buy it! It’s real. With artificial or synthetic silk, it is impossible to experience warmth on rubbing. One more thing, real silk sounds like walking on fresh snow. If you don’t know how that is supposed to sound like, go figure!;
,  If the silk that you are planning to buy is not very heavy, this test is perfect! Genuine silk of lower ply can be easily threaded and pulled through a wedding ring because silk is naturally flexible and smooth. On the other hand, artificial silks would scrunch up and would be impossible to pull through.

, Of course, genuine silk is almost ten times costlier than the synthetic ones. Sometimes the synthetic silk is priced much higher and looks like silk to an untrained eye but mostly low price is a very good indication of its poor quality.

, Silk is especially known for its lustre. The lustre is usually because of the combination of threads which gives a particular sheen to the material. The colour on the surface appears to change as the angle of the light changes. Artificial silks, however, gives a white sheen no matter what the angle of light falling on it.

, Hand woven silk boasts of uniqueness. There are minor variations in the evenness of the texture which is quite noticeable. But fret not! These are natural and expected. These imperfections are what lend distinction to the product. Machine woven silks look perfect. They are flawlessly even in texture and hence… lacks character! Synthetic fibres look perfect too even though sometimes slight imperfections are deliberately included so that they could pass off as real silk.

, This is perhaps the best and most definitive test to find genuine silk. You can take a few threads from the material and burn it with a flame. Genuine silk burns with smell of burnt hair. When you burn the edge of real silk fabric, the flame is invisible and it will stop burning as soon as the flame is removed. The ash produced hence, is black, crispy and brittle. It turns to powder when twisted in fingers.With the artificial silk, it is quite the opposite. When synthetic silk is burnt, there is a flame and smell of plastic. No ash is produced. Needless to say, you might need to exercise caution with this step. You don’t want to end up setting fire to the silk saree showroom. Right?

, If you have a lab with necessary chemicals on the standby, ready for some experimentation, what’s stopping you? For starters, you need:Mix all the below and dip a small piece of silk that you want to test into the solution. Real silk dissolves in a few minutes while artificial silk would not dissolve.


16 grams Copper Sulphate
8 grams Glycerine
1 tablespoon caustic soda
150 cc of water

, The older the silk gets, the more beautiful it becomes. With the fake silk, it is quite the opposite. The fake silk tends to fade with time. But again, it is a better idea to buy a genuine silk rather than end up with a fake one.Now that you are armed with some really good tips for the next silk shopping spree, sleep easy. You are going to get the silk saree you so rightly deserve. And yeah… Don’t forget to take along that lighter as well. Who knows when it might come in handy!

Put on thick socks under the shoes.,
Heat the shoes with a hairdryer.,
Stretch with your toes and fingers.,
Repeat several times.",How to Stretch Shoes1," Wear thick socks, or several pairs of thin socks. Pull on the shoes over the socks.;
, Turn on a hairdryer, set it to the highest setting, and hold it several inches (10+ centimeters) away from the shoes. Warm the whole shoe, but focus on the areas that feel tightest. Keep heating until the shoe feels warm and slightly flexible to the touch. This can take anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on the shoe and the power of your hairdryer.


Overheating can damage your shoe or leave marks. Keep the hairdryer at the recommended distance to avoid this.

, Turn off the hairdryer. Wriggle your toes and heel. Bend and stretch the outside of the shoe with your hands. Keep doing this until the shoe cools down again.

, Walk around and see if the shoe feels comfortable. Usually, you'll need to warm and bend it at least two or three times. When it seems a little stretched, take off your thick socks and try walking around in thin socks or barefoot.

All of the information listed on the manufacturing sticker should also be on this tag. Make sure the information is exactly the same as what’s on the box sticker, especially the style number.The stitching on the tag ought to look uniform and neat.
Spelling errors on this interior tag are almost always an indicator of inauthentic Jordans.

, Jordans have a very specific label under the tongue. Lift up the tongue and check out the underside. You should see the words “greatest player ever” embroidered there. The embroidery should be white, easy to read and look professional., Double check the details on the logo located on the back of the shoes (or sometimes on the tongue). The logo should appear crisp and uncompromised. Look at the hands, basketball and feet to ensure everything looks properly proportioned. Nothing should look blurry or smudged.Fake Jordans may have an uneven or lumpy Jumpman, with poor stitching and unusual proportions.

, The spaces between the shoelace tabs should be even. All of the shoelace tabs will be the same size and shape. Make sure they are all attached firmly, with the same amount of tension. Fake Jordans will often have some shoelace tabs that are looser than others., Inspect the shoes carefully for neat and professional looking stitching. Everything should look evenly spaced, with no unfinished edges or frayed threads. The stitching on the heel is often a giveaway – if it looks poorly done or uneven, question the authenticity of the shoes., This is where the side fabric transitions into the front of the shoe. It is usually a different fabric and color than the toe section. On real Jordans, the midsole point will be in front of the bottom lace hole. On fake Jordans, the midsole point will often match the bottom lace hole.


View the midsole tips. The “mountains” of the sole molding should be sharp tips, not curved edges.

, Go to Footlocker.com or Nike’s own site to find the authentic colorways. Colorways are a color combination that is updated with each new style of shoe. Occasionally there are special edition colorways.


If a site or individual seller is selling a colorway that is not listed on any direct Nike supplier site, it is a counterfeit product.

Be doubtful of any new Air Jordans that are sold for under $100.,
Make sure the shoes are labeled “100% Authentic.” If you’re looking at a pair online that are listed just as “Authentic” you should be suspicious.Don’t buy Air Jordan shoes that are advertised as “custom,” “sample,” or “variant.” This indicates that Nike did not commission them.,
Confirm that the shoes come with the right box.,
Avoid online purchases unless the images are clear and detailed.,
Avoid buying Air Jordans from an overseas seller.,
Check seller feedback on sites like eBay.",How to Tell if Jordans Are Fake3," Many of these shoes are limited edition and sell out quickly, so there is no motivation for a seller to drop the price below retail value. It is very rare to find Jordans for under $100. If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.

, If you’re looking at Jordans online and no style number is included, email the seller to inquire about it.

, Fake Jordans are often sold in boxes that list details which don’t match the shoes themselves. Real boxes will feature correct colorway descriptions and all style numbers should match. If the shoes you’re considering don’t come with a box at all, purchasing them is not recommended., When buying shoes online, make sure multiple pictures are posted and you can clearly see the detail in each one. If a photo of the interior tag with the style number isn’t included, email the seller to request one. Stock photos of shoes are usually a red flag. The descriptions should be clear, not vague.


If the images provided are extremely small, ask the seller for better ones. If they aren’t provided, avoid the purchase.

, Unless you are sure of the seller’s authenticity, avoid overseas purchases. Nike may import from their overseas factories, but they supply from major hubs in the United States and Europe. Most fake Jordans are manufactured in Asia, especially China.Your chances of purchasing fake Jordans go up substantially if the shoes are shipped from Asia.

, Look for established sellers with a lot of solid feedback. Avoid buying from sellers who have very little or no customer feedback; the merchandise is most likely inauthentic. Before you bid on a pair of Jordans, do your homework and make sure all of the information and pictures look right.Trust your gut; if something feels off about the sale, it’s safer to avoid it and buy from someone else.

Repeat if needed.",How to Stretch Shoes2," Fill a zip-locked plastic bag partway with water, squeeze out the remaining air, then seal it tightly. Put this inside a second zip-locked bag to minimize the chance of the bag bursting.


Water can damage your shoe and shrink it. Make sure the seal is tight and there are no leaks.

, The bag should fit inside the shoe tightly, but not so tight that you have to force it in. Use more than one bag if there is still room in the shoe, and make sure the tight area of the shoe has a bag of water pressed against it.

, Put the shoes in the freezer with the bags of water inside them. Over the next several hours, the water will freeze and expand. The bags of ice will press against the interior of the shoe, stretching it outward.

, After the water is completely frozen, take the shoes out of the freezer. Let the bags of ice thaw and melt for at least 10 minutes. Take out the ice, or wait until it is easy to pull out the bags without breaking them.

, You can repeat with fresh bags of water immediately, making sure they tightly fill the slightly larger shoes. There is a limit to how far a pair of shoes can be stretched, but two or three sessions of this can stretch it a little farther than one.

Walk the shoes in carefully.",How to Stretch Shoes3," If the shoes are tight on all sides, fill it with something that can fill the entire space. Crumpled newspapers are commonly used, but there are more effective options:


For sneakers, ball up socks you don't want to wear again and dip them in fabric softener.
For shoes made of stiff materials, use hard, round objects such as golf balls.

, Shoe stretchers and shoe trees are sold for this purpose at shoe stores or department stores. You can use any stiff object that can just barely be squeezed into the shoe. A stiff wire coat hanger can be cut with wire cutters and/or bent into shape with pliers to adjust the length.


Be careful while handling cut coat hangers. Wear thick gloves if you have to force the cut end into the shoe.

, Leather shoes will be more supple after they are treated with a leather conditioner product, or with saddle soap. Rub this product onto the leather before or during one of the stretching methods above, to make it more effective.


Suede shoes, with a fuzzy feel to them, may require a special suede conditioner.

, You've probably already tried this, but shoes will stretch slightly as you wear them. Just walk around and use the shoe for its normal purpose, and follow these precautions to avoid injury:


Wear uncomfortably tight shoes for no more than an hour or two of light use, such as an evening at home.
Carry bandages (band-aids) around. Whenever you feel chafing or uncomfortable pressure on your foot, stop and apply a bandage to the affected area. This will help cushion the area, and prevent blisters from forming.
Carry spare shoes to change into.

In order to accessorize properly, you should take note of your dress’s length and add accoutrement accordingly.


If your strapless dress is short, play up your shoes. Depending on how much walking you’ll be doing and how comfortable you are in heels, you can select some flashy peep-toe pumps or towering stilettos in which to prance the night away.
Long strapless dresses are elegant and visually striking. They don’t require flashy jewelry to make them look refined, so it can be a good idea, If you’re wearing a floor-length dress, to let it (and your décolletage!) do the talking.If you’ve opted for one of these show-stopping full-length gowns and you find yourself a bit unsteady on heels, consider kitten heels or simple ballet flats. A floor-length gown will likely obscure your shoes most of the time.;
, You can take a cue from the color and print of your dress in order to determine which accessories you want to use.


If your dress is monochromatic or otherwise understated, you can make your footwear the focal point of your entire outfit. To do so, slip on some brightly colored wedges or strappy stilettos.On the other hand, if your dress features a bold print or pattern, go for a solid, neutral hue of shoe.Think about breaking up a monochromatic dress with a belt. A thick, shiny, or ornate belt can take the place of a statement jewelry piece while adding visual interest the solid blocks of color.Imagine a little black strapless dress as if it were a blank canvas. The little black dress (LBD) is what you make of it, so go bold and colorful with a statement jewelry piece can transform a simple, minimalist look into a fancy and sophisticated one., The overall look and tone of a strapless dress depends heavily on how it is cut to fit the body, so, before deciding on accessories, you might want to think about how its design.


If your strapless dress is form-fitting and hugs the body, don’t ruin your sleek look with a clunky handbag. Rather, choose a small, elegant clutch that complements your dress..A loose, flowy strapless dress can be simultaneously comfortable and flattering. If you want to add a little structure to your dress, though, pop on a wide belt and immediately accentuate your waist. This easy step can also wholly transform your dress from a single article of clothing into an entire, coordinated outfit., Just because your undergarments won’t be visible, does not mean that they aren’t an important and even integral part of your ensemble! No matter which strapless dress you choose or what accessories you add to it, the right strapless bra is essential to support your breasts and define your waistline."

Take stock of your jewelry box.,
Consider leaving your neck and collarbone unadorned if you don’t have a piece of statement jewelry you want to wear.,
Play up your shoes.,
Emphasize one feature of your face with makeup.",How to Accessorize a Strapless Dress2," If you have a particularly stunning or stage-stealing piece that goes with your dress, use it! The key is pick one bold statement piece as the focal point of the outfit, and smaller, less conspicuous pieces as the supporting accoutrement.


Think of earrings as an almost-mandatory element of your strapless look, as bare lobes can look out of place when hovering above bare shoulders. Even if you are donning a statement necklace, pop on some small stud earrings that will complete the look but won’t compete with it.
If you want to showcase your neck and collarbone by leaving them unadorned, opt for a pair of sparkly or dangling (or both!) earrings.
Never wear a statement necklace and statement earrings. Choose one!If you wear earrings and a necklace together, make sure that they complement each other and that at least one of them is understated.,


Flaunting a bare neck and collarbone with your strapless dress means that you can play up a different statement accessory. An eye-catching belt or shawl can make for just as effective a statement piece as jewelry.
Going understated on jewelry can also allow you more liberty with your makeup. Feel free to add a pop of drama with smoky eyes or scarlet lips.

, Your shoes are an accessory as well as a necessity. If your strapless dress is simple and you have a pair of show-stopping heels you’ve been dying to trot out, here’s your excuse!


Designer pumps always make great statement pieces, especially if they add a pop of color to your ensemble like the signature red soles of Louboutins.Can’t afford designer heels? No problem! Trendy glitter-encrusted pumps and booties are instant scene-stealers, and they can be found at a range of online and brick-and-mortar retailers.If your beachfront wedding makes heels a problem, you needn’t rule out the possibility of popping on a statement shoe. Find a pair of strappy, lace-up gladiators and prance away!, If you don’t consider makeup an “accessory,” think again! The right makeup will elevate whatever look you’re going for, be it sweet and simple or posh and sophisticated. Just be sure not to overdo it and risk looking clownish or garish.


If you want to play up your eyes, select a dark eyeliner, shadow, and mascara. Pair the dark eye with a nude or neutral lip.For daytime or more casual gatherings, polish off your easygoing ensemble with some light mascara, pink blush, and dewy lips."

Review the event’s details and think about how you’ll likely be spending your time at the event.,
Bundle up with a stylish wrap.,
Camouflage your trouble spots.,

, Since your strapless dress necessarily exposes quite a bit of skin, it’s a good idea to bring along some kind of cover-up. Stash it in your purse just in case, or don it at home and make it part of your outfit.


Even if you are attending a summertime event, a gauzy cover-up can come in handy in case of gusty winds or rain showers.For cooler seasons, throw on a fur stole, cardigan, or blanket scarf.If you have trouble matching separates, ask the salesperson for help in selecting a cover up at the same time as you’re shopping for your strapless dress. Already own the dress but still need the cover up? Bring a picture of the dress and your friendly salesperson can still assist!

, If you’re anxious about exposing your arms, shop for a matching cardigan or lightweight jacket at the same time as you purchase your dress. This will allow you to experiment with lots of options and ensure that you find a combination you feel confident wearing for the entire event.


If you have other trouble spots, think creatively. Sport an eye-catching necklace that will draw attention to your face if you feel insecure about your body. Wrap a scarf around your neck if you have scars or wrinkles on your décolletage, and pop some high heels on your feet if you struggle with stocky legs in order to make them appear longer and leaner., No matter what you’re doing or where you’re going, you’ll need some kind of vessel in which to carry your essentials.


If you’ll be dancing or travelling from place to place, or if your prone to misplacing things, select a clutch with a strap.
You can still be stylish if you have a lot of things you need to carry with you. Whether you’re a new mom who needs a diaper bag or a professional continuously saddled with her computer, you can find the right slouchy hobo bag or tote that seamlessly blends fashion and utility., You don’t want to be squinting through your friend’s birthday or find your mascara smudged in the wedding pictures, so make sure you grab a pair of sunglasses for the sake of both looks and comfort.


For a black, classic dress, opt for oversized retro square frames. For a breezy summer get-up, don a pair of gold-rimmed aviators or colorful round frames.

If you are wearing a light pink dress, choose pink or rose-colored accessories to go along with it.
Matching doesn’t have to be exact. Even if you are wearing a light pink dress, you can choose dark pink or magenta shoes to go along with it. This adds some funkiness to your matching.;
, Instead of matching your accessories to the overall color of the dress, match them to a secondary color in your dress. This works especially well with patterned dresses, because there is more than one color you can match with. If you are wearing a white dress with pink and blue flowers, wear pink or blue accessories. This is a great way to match with your dress in a more nuanced way.

, If your dress is an extremely bright color like bright yellow, wear neutrals to offset it. If you match your accessories directly with your brightly colored dress, you may look eccentric rather than put together. White, black, tan and brown are all neutrals that look good with almost any color. , A patterned dress already has a lot going on. If you throw in accessories that are patterned or intricate, the look becomes too much. Make sure that your shoes and your bag are solid-colored. Try to wear simple accessories like stud earrings or plain silver bracelets. These accessories will help your dress make its statement.

, If your dress is a neutral color like white, beige or tan, adding a bright accessory gives your outfit oomph.

Many metals look better with either a warm or a cool tone. Metals like gold or copper look better with warm tone colors because these metals have a warm undertone. On the other hand, silver jewelry looks better with cool-toned colors. "

This emphasizes your arms and balances out the top of the dress. , If you are wearing a dress with a high neck, wear a long necklace to make the look more interesting. Because a crewneck is a simple design, you can wear bigger accessories without it looking overdone. A necklace will bring attention up to your face and it will tie the outfit together. , One-shoulder dresses make a bold statement. To balance the asymmetry, wear a bracelet or cuff on the opposite side of your body as the strap of the dress. This is a great way to compliment this style of dress. , Strapless dresses showcase your arms and your shoulders. Wearing a necklace breaks up this area and doesn’t allow the dress to shine.

Fill a resealable plastic bag with water.,
Position the bag in the boot.,
Place the boot in the freezer.,
Thaw the ice before removing it.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Stretch Leather Boots1," Fill roughly one-third to one-half of the bag with water. Squeeze out as much air as possible before sealing completely.To remove the air, seal most of the bag, leaving only a small gap open in one corner. Gently squeeze the portion of the bag without water in it until the plastic sides come together. When you have brought the sides together as closely as possible without spilling water, seal the remaining gap.
Use plastic bags marked as ""freezer bags"" to reduce the risk of breaking the bag inside the freezer.
Choose the best size for your boot. If the toe or heel needs to be stretched, a quart (liter) size bag should suffice. If the entire foot portion or calf portion of the boot needs to be stretched, choose a gallon (4 L) size bag.
Alternatively, you can skip the water-filled bag altogether and use freezer gel packs if you have them.
Do not place water or ice directly against the leather. Water can cause leather to become brittle.;
, Place the bag of water in the shoe inside the problem area.


This is easiest to do when the problem area is the toe or heel, but it can still be done for larger portions of the boot.
If you only need to stretch the calf portion of the boot, stuff the foot with balls of crumbled newspaper and place the bag of water inside the calf portion. The newspaper should prevent the bag from slipping down into the foot portion of the boot.
Make sure that the water presses against all sides of the boot in need of being stretched. Otherwise, the boot may not stretch evenly.

, Carefully place your boot in the freezer and let it sit 8 hours to overnight.


As the water freezes, it will expand, stretching the leather out in the process.

, When you pull your boot out of the freezer, you should let the ice melt for at least 20 minutes before you try to remove it from the boot.


If you try to pull the bag out immediately, you may damage the boot.

, Try your boots on and see if the leather has been stretched enough. If not, repeat the process to stretch the boots a bit more.

Slip your boots on.,
Heat the tight areas of your boots using a hair dryer.,
Keep the boots on until they cool.,
Check the fit.,
Apply leather conditioner to the boots.",How to Stretch Leather Boots2,"


If you do not have any thick socks, put on two to four layers of normal socks.
Having a thicker layer of socks will make it easier to stretch the leather further.

, Force the boots onto your feet over the socks.


Note that this will likely feel very uncomfortable, but this short-term discomfort will lead to greater long-term comfort.
If you find it impossible to fit your leather boots on over the socks, remove a layer of socks or opt for a slightly thinner pair.

, Any problem area in need of stretching should be heated with a hair dryer, set to high heat, for at least 30 seconds.


Flex and stretch your feet inside the boots as you heat them up to stretch the leather out further.
Make sure that each problem area receives 30 seconds of heat.

, Turn the hair dryer off but keep the boots on your feet until the outside feels room temperature when touched.


If you remove the boots before they cool, they will likely shrink back down.

, Once cool, strip the socks from your feet and try your boots on again. If they feel comfortable, keep them as they are.

Check your boots a few hours later.",How to Stretch Leather Boots3," Pour 70% rubbing alcohol into a 2 oz (60 ml) spray bottle and tighten the spray nozzle on securely to prevent any leaks.Use 70% rubbing alcohol instead of a higher concentration. It contains 70 percent of concentrated ethanol or isopropyl alcohol by volume, which is safe to use with leather boots, but higher concentrations could prove too abrasive for the leather.

, Generously spray the rubbing alcohol over the area of the boot in need of being stretched. Make sure that the area is quite damp when done.


Do not spray areas that do not need to be stretched.
The area in need of being stretched should be sprayed evenly.
Give the rubbing alcohol 20 to 30 seconds to soak into the leather before proceeding.

, After the alcohol has soaked into the leather but before the boots dry, slip the boots over your feet. Keep the boots until they dry completely.


For best results, keep the boots on as long as possible before removing them, even after they dry.
The leather should stretch as soon as you slip the boots onto your feet. If it still does not budge, spray more rubbing alcohol over the problem area of the boot and try again.

, After you remove the boots and let them sit undisturbed for a few hours, try them on again. The leather should still be fairly stretched, and the boots should still be comfortable.


If the leather still feels a little tight, repeat the process to stretch the boots out a bit more. For even greater success the second time around, where extra-thick socks or an extra-thick layer of socks to stretch the boots out even further.

Read the label carefully.,
Test the spray first.,
Spray the problem area.,
Wear the boots immediately.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Stretch Leather Boots4," Before using a stretching spray, read any warnings and instructions provided on the label.


Some stretching sprays may not be safe for all forms of leather. As a result, you should verify that the label does not warn against use on specific types of leather boots.
The instructions are usually fairly similar, but there can be slight variations here or there. To ensure the most benefit and least amount of damage, follow the instructions carefully.
Also make a note of the active ingredients used in the stretching spray. Some sprays are made of little more than rubbing alcohol, in which case, they can be used interchangeably with rubbing alcohol for the purpose of stretching your boots out.

, Spray a small amount of the stretching spray onto a hard-to-spot area of the boot, like the very top back or very bottom of the leather, near the sole of the boot.


Some stretching sprays may stain certain types of leather, especially if the leather is light in color. Performing this test can save you from creating a large stain on a clearly visible portion of your boot.
If the area you test stains, do not use the spray for the rest of the boot. If it does not stain, the spray should be safe to use.

, Douse the tight area of the boot with your stretching spray, as well as the surrounding area. Make sure that the spray is evenly spread out over the entire area.


Apply the spray from a distance of 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm).Let the leather absorb the spray for 30 seconds or so.
You do not need to spray areas that are nowhere near the portion of the boot you plan to stretch.

, Put the boots on your feet as soon as the leather has absorbed the spray but before it feels dry to the touch.


Keep the boots on your feet for as long as possible to maximize the stretching effect.

, Slip off the boots when necessary, but check them again a few hours later to see if the stretch held. If not, repeat the process a second time.

Choose the right footwear stretcher for you.,
Wedge a boot stretcher into the foot of the boot.,
Open the wedge once inside the boot.,
Slip the boot onto a calf stretcher to stretch the calf portion.,
Crank open the wedge.",How to Stretch Leather Boots5," In general, you will want a boot stretcher to stretch the foot of the boot and a calf stretcher to stretch the calf portion of the boot.


The difference between a boot stretcher and a shoe stretcher is that a boot stretcher has a long handle sticking up, allowing you to access the stretching mechanism in spite of the boot's tall sides.
If your leather boots are ankle height, you can probably manage to stretch the foot with a shoe stretcher instead of a boot stretcher.

, Carefully position the wooden wedge of the boot stretcher device into the foot of the boot.


Make sure that the long handle sticks up and out of the boot. You will need to be able to reach the handle and turn it without difficulty.

, Turn the handle to open the wedge up. The screw device should push open the wedge, stretching out the toe area in the process.


Let the leather sit in this position for several minutes before returning the wedge to its original size and removing it from the boot.

, Pull the boot over the calf stretcher so that the entire calf portion fits on.


Stop directly above the ankle of the boot to avoid damaging or distorting the foot of the boot.

, Turn the crank at the top of the device to open up the wedge. Open the wedge as far as it will go to stretch the boots as much as possible.


Let the boots sit on the calf stretcher for several minutes to maximize the effect.

Sprinkle some powder in your shoes.,
Stick a paper towel or dryer sheet in your shoe.,
Smooth out the tongue.,
Try wearing socks.",How to Stop Your Shoes from Squeaking1," Sometimes squeaking may be caused by friction between your insoles and shoe soles. You can use baby powder, talcum, or corn starch to address squeaking due to friction.


If your shoe has a removable liner, take it out and sprinkle corn starch, talcum, or baby powder on the bottom of the shoe. Then, place the liner back in and see if it fits more snugly. These powders can reduce moisture, resulting in less motion between the liner and the shoe.If your shoes are squeaking when you walk across a tile or wood surface, then you can also try applying a bit of powder to the bottoms of your shoes. Just be careful when you walk because applying powder to the bottoms of your shoes can reduce the traction of your shoes, so it may be easier to slip and fall.;
, If you don’t have any cornstarch or baby powder handy, then a paper towel or dryer sheet can also stop your shoes from squeaking. Stick a folded paper towel or dryer sheet in between the sole and insole of each of your shoes.

To do this, you will need to take out the insole place the towel or dryer sheet into the bottom of your shoe and then replace the insole.

, Sometimes shoes will squeak because the tongue is rubbing against the inside of the shoe. You can easily fix this by smoothing out the tongue with a bit of sandpaper. Get some fine grit sandpaper or a nail file and rub it against the outer edges of the tongue (where the tongue rubs against the inside of the shoe.

If you prefer not to sand the tongue of your shoes, then you can apply a bit of athletic tape to the edges of the tongue instead.Wrap the athletic tape around the tongue's edges so that the areas that rub against the inside of the shoe are covered.

, If you wear shoes without socks, the moisture caused by your feet sweating may be causing the squeaking. Simply wearing socks might reduce squeaking. Try wearing socks with your shoes for a few days and see if the squeaking goes away."

Learn how to use this method properly.,
Fill two resealable bags partially with water.,
Push the bags into the area you want to stretch.,
Leave the boots in a freezer overnight.,
Thaw for 20 minutes or more.,
Remove the bags and try on the boots.",How to Stretch Boots1," This is an easy and effective method for small to medium adjustments, but you shouldn't expect a full size change. For that you'll need a shoe stretching liquid and/or boot stretcher.


This method works because the water will expand when frozen, pushing into the shoe. It has nothing to do with the boots becoming wet, which could actually shrink or damage them.;
, Fill two Ziploc bags or other freezer-safe plastic bag roughly 1/3 full of water. Squeeze out as much of the air as possible before sealing.Use a bag that will fit snugly into the part of the boot that needs stretching. A quart (liter) bag works for most toes and heels, while you may need a gallon (4 liter) bag to stretch the calf of the boot.
To remove the air, seal most of the way and leave a small gap. Gently press the portion of the bag containing air until most of the air has exited and the plastic is nearly flat.
Bags not labeled for freezer use may break later in the process, leaking water onto your boots and potentially damaging them.

, Put each bag of water into one of the boots. If you want to stretch the toe, tilt the boot forward and gently push the bag as far as it will go.


If you need to stretch the calf, keep the bag from slipping by stuffing the toe with newspapers.

, Freeze them in a freezer or icebox and leave them there for 8-12 hours. Unlike most liquids, water expands when it freezes, pushing the boot outward from the inside.


If the bag slips out of the toe when you move the boots, tilt the boots forward and prop them up on a block of wood, or anything else that will keep them stable.

, Remove the boots from the freezer and wait for the ice to melt before removing the bags. How long this takes depends on the temperature.


Don't try to remove the bags right away, as you could damage the boots trying to pull them out.

, You should feel a noticeable difference in the stretched area. If it's still insufficient, or if the boot starts to shrink back, you can repeat this method to stretch it out further.

Apply oil to your shoes.,
Fix any damages.,
Ask a professional.",How to Stop Your Shoes from Squeaking2," With leather shoes, the material may shrink or stretch in response to weather conditions. If you think that this may be the cause of the squeaking, then try applying a bit of shoe oil or vegetable oil to the seams (where the leather of your shoe meets the sole). Be careful not to use too much as oil can stain leather shoes.Use a dry cloth or paper towel to apply the shoe oil to the seams of your shoe. Wipe off any excess oil and let the shoes sit overnight.

, If the heel or sole of your shoe is loose, fixing this may help with squeaking. You can use glue, as long as it's a strong, adhesive variety. Multipurpose glue or strong craft glues may also work. Simply glue the loose ends together and see if this stops the squeaking., You may not be able to fix problems with squeaky shoes on your own. Oftentimes, steel pieces in shoes can cause squeaking issues. Unless you have professional shoe making experience, it's unlikely you'll be able to fix this problem on your own. If your shoes do not respond to at home treatments, take them to a professional in your area."
"
Remove the soles or inserts.,
Use newspaper.,
Place the shoes in shoe trees.",How to Stop Your Shoes from Squeaking3," If your shoes tend to squeak when you're sweating or going sock-less, it may be due to moisture. Drying the shoes may help. Before drying your shoes, remove any soles or inserts. Hang them to dry in a warm, dry room., Once the soles have been removed, place crumpled newspaper inside your shoes. Old newspapers can soak up some of the moisture. You do not need to use more than a couple of sheets. If your shoes are sopping wet, you might want to replace the newspaper every few hours., If you want your shoes to dry faster, consider placing them on a shoe tree. A shoe tree will also help them maintain their shape as leather shoes especially might stretch or shrink when wet."
"
Select a shoe stretching liquid.,
Prepare a work surface.,
Test a small area.,
Rub or spray the tight area.,
Put on one or two pairs of thick socks.,
Walk around in the boots.,
If they require a lot of stretching, use a boot stretcher.",How to Stretch Boots2," A 50/50 mix of rubbing alcohol and water will work if you don't want to buy a specialized stretching fluid. This will greatly increase the speed of breaking it in by walking, or combine with boot stretchers to make more extreme changes.


Leather stretching liquids will not work for synthetic boots, and vice versa. Some are specialized for patent leather or other subtypes, so read the label carefully.
Check the label for special instructions. If a specific product requires a different method, follow its instructions.
Dilute the rubbing alcohol with equal parts water before using to avoid abrading the boot's material., Lay down some black and white newspapers to catch spills and drips, or work over concrete where they won't matter.


Don't use colored newspapers, as the ink can transfer onto the boots.

, Pick an unobtrusive spot on one of the boots, such as the back heel or the inside lip. Apply a small amount of the liquid there and wait for it to dry. If it leaves a stain, try a different liquid or stretching method.


Only test the inside lip if it is the same material as the outside of the boot.
Check for stains under both natural and artificial light if possible.

, Apply the area you want stretched and surrounding areas until the leather is damp or the synthetic material is visibly wet.


Apply a spray about 5 inches (12 cm) distant from the boots.
You can apply the liquid to the outside or inside of the shoe. It should stretch either way.
If the liquid begins to run off the shoe, stop and wipe off the excess.

, Make your feet bulkier to stretch out the shoe more.


If the shoes are only slightly abrasive, one pair is fine. Use two for more significant stretching.

, Do this while they're still wet and flexible. Wear them the rest of the day and walk around as much as possible to maximize the stretching.


Do not walk around in boots that are causing you pain. Skip to the next step instead.

, There's only so much you can achieve by wearing thick socks. If the boots are still too tight, buy a boot stretcher and use it to stretch the boot overnight:


Find a boot stretcher that stretches the correct area. Some are specialized for toe, instep, or calf stretching, while ""two-way"" varieties increase the general size of the foot area.
Place the boot stretcher into the shoe. Push the foot-shaped object to the end of the boot. If you are using a calf stretcher, just place it in the ankle shaft of the boot.
Turn the handle of the stretcher a couple times until you see the tight area visibly stretch outward. Don't make it so tight.
Leave the stretcher in between 8 and 48 hours. A small adjustment can be made overnight. A full size difference requires a day or two.

"
"
Select the correct stretcher.,
Prepare the boots with shoe stretching fluid (optional).,
Wedge each stretcher into a boot.,
Turn the handle to expand the stretcher.,
Wait.",How to Stretch Boots3," Pick one designed to stretch the area you need, or you'll expand the boot in the wrong places.Stretchers are an excellent way to achieve significant stretching, especially when paired with shoe stretching liquid.


A two-way stretcher will stretch the foot's length and width.
A toe stretcher lifts the toe portion higher.
A vamp or instep stretcher lifts the foot portion higher.
A calf stretcher will widen the shaft of the boot. The term ""boot stretcher"" can also refer to this variety or to any long-handled shoe stretcher, so the packaging carefully.
If you don't know your boot size, bring it in to the shop to compare to stretchers. Stretchers apply to a range of sizes, so the fit doesn't need to be perfect.

, The boots will gain much needed flexibility if you apply shoe stretching liquid first, making adjustments easier.


If you don't want to buy a shoe stretching fluid, mix rubbing alcohol and water in equal amounts to increase your own.
Make sure the liquid you use is suitable for your boot material, then apply on the tight areas until the shoe is wet. Continue to the next step immediately.

, Use the knob to adjust it to a snug fit before placing it in the boot. If the handle is swallowed up by the ankle, you'll need to either unzip the boot or use a stretcher with a longer handle.

, Rotate the handle, usually counterclockwise, to make the wedge wider. You should feel or see the boot expanding slightly in the area the stretcher is designed to affect.


This typically takes 1-3 turns, but you should judge the amount by looking for a slight expansion and a tight feeling.

, Typically you should leave the stretcher in for 24–48 hours, but if you're worried the boots might become too loose, you should test them after 8 hours of waiting.


If you test the boots and they are still tight, you can put the stretchers back in immediately or first apply additional shoe stretching liquid.

"
Be aware of the risks.,
Wear thick socks inside the boots.,
Turn on the hair dryer.,
Wear them until they cool down.,
Test with normal socks, then repeat if needed.,
Apply leather conditioning cream (optional).",How to Stretch Boots4," Too much heat can damage boots, so never hold the hairdryer against them or heat them too long. This method is good for making your boot more comfortable, but cannot stretch it to a new size.

, A second pair of socks will allow for greater stretch. You won't need to wear the boots for long, so don't worry too much about hurting your feet.

, Aim the hair dryer at the area of the boot that needs stretching. Hold it a few inches (about 10 cm) away from the boot and only turn it on for a few seconds.Move your foot around inside the boot or curl and stretch your toes for better stretching.

, Walk until the boots have lost the heat from the hair dryer.


If it's painful to walk in the boots, remain seated and stretch them by flexing your toes and foot.

, If the boots have not stretched enough, heat and walk again.

, Heat can dry out leather and make it brittle, so apply a leather conditioner afterward if using this method on leather boots.


There's no need to moisturize synthetic material such as vinyl.

"
"
Avoid getting your boots wet.,
Don't expose your boots to prolonged high temperatures.,
Don't force your feet into a painful boot.",How to Stretch Boots5," You might have heard someone recommend soaking your leather boot to wear it in faster. Even if this works, you risk damaging the material and it may shrink back as it dries.


When stretching your boots with ice, be careful to only use freezer safe bags and make sure the seal will hold tightly.

, They can weaken the material. If the boots do get wet, let them dry naturally rather than putting them in front of a fire to minimize shrinking.


Use moderation when stretching your boots with a hairdryer for exactly this reason.

, If walking in the boot causes you pain, you'll need a stronger and safer method than simply ""walking it in."" Try stretching it with ice, or use a shoe stretcher for even greater adjustments.

Investigate Nike shoes sellers on the Internet.,
Avoid sellers that substitute stock shoe photos for pictures of actual Nike shoes.,
Avoid items that claim to be ""custom,"" ""variant"" or ""sample"" Nike shoes.,
Avoid Nike shoes priced far below their normal value.,
Don’t buy shoes that are available before the official release date.,
Verify your Nike shoes.",How to Spot Fake Nikes1," Be extremely cautious when purchasing Nike shoes on the Internet. Since you don’t actually have the physical product in front of you, you can very easily be throwing money at a fake shoe. To avoid purchasing a fake:


Read website ratings and reviews before buying anything. Bad reviews is an obvious sign that the seller is not reliable or reputable. However, be careful because some sites will choose to only show “good” reviews. Do a third party search by inputting the seller in a third party search site and examining their reputation there instead of on the seller’s site.
Ensure you are protected from fraud. Some online websites provide their customers with a return policy, even if the seller is a third party of the site. Having security that you will get your money back will protect you losing if you do happen to purchase fake Nike shoes.;
, A stock shoe photo is more aesthetically appealing but it’s not what you should be looking for when purchasing shoes online. A photo that is obviously shot within a home ensures that the pair actually exists and its condition can be matched with the photo.


You could try to contact the seller and ask them to take another photo of the shoe with an item that determines the date or authenticity of the photo. For example, ask the seller to take a photo of the shoe next to today’s newspaper.

, True Nike shoe samples only come in men's U.S. size 9, 10, 11, women's 7 and children's 3.5. There are also no such real Nike shoes that are “custom” or “variant”.


View the seller's entire inventory. For unknown reasons, counterfeiters tend not to sell U.S. sizes 9 or 13 and above.
Older Nike shoes that are out of production are almost never available in a full sizing run. For example, if you're searching for a pair of vintage Nikes and find a site that has a stock of 200, they are likely fakes.

, The shoe is either fake or extremely damaged.


Generally, a Nike shoe that is priced in half is most likely fake. A reasonable discount is more realistic, especially if the shoe is a limited edition or vintage.
A seller might price it extremely high and offer you the chance to haggle to a ridiculously low price. Be careful, especially since you don’t have the physical shoe to verify its state and existence.
Check the shipping estimation. If it will take between 7 and 14 days to deliver your shoes, they are likely traveling from China (a verified source of fake Nike shoes) or from another distant country.
If you must order Nikes online, it's best to purchase them directly from the company's website or from the list of authorized , It is almost guaranteed that any shoe available before the official release date will be a counterfeit.


These shoes may look like an upcoming design but are most likely modelled very closely to look like it. Early release photos allow counterfeits to be produced without originals to be compared with and many people fall into the trap of attempting to get their hands on a pair before everyone else.

, Once you find shoes you like, take more steps to verify their authenticity.


Double check with Nike or a trusted retailer's website to compare them with an image of the original shoe.
Ask the seller to verify that the shoes are authentic. You can also ask for their supplier's contact information for further information.

"
"
Examine the packaging.,
Examine the condition of the shoes.,
Examine the SKU number on the box and the labels inside of the shoes.,
Try the shoes on.",How to Spot Fake Nikes2," Most fake Nike shoes do not come in an original Nike box. Instead, they are shrink-wrapped in clear plastic or don’t come in a box at all.


Most of the boxes for fake Nikes are hastily glued together and therefore not as sturdy as true Nike boxes.

, If you have owned similar Nike shoes in the past, compare them to your new shoes. If the two pairs significantly differ in quality, your new shoes are likely fake and may fall apart within the first several days of use.


Real Nikes are always softer and grayer than fake ones. This is because they are made from real leather, while fake Nikes are manufactured from pleather.
The midsoles of fake Nike shoes tend to have visible dots from the manufacturing process, unlike real Nikes.
Check the lacing. Real Nike shoes are usually fully laced, while fakes tend to skip every other lacing hole.

, Every pair of authentic Nike shoes comes with an SKU number that is identical to the SKU number on their box. If the numbers are missing or do not match, they are likely fakes.


Check the tongue label. Often, fake Nike manufacturers put outdated sizing labels on the inside of the shoe. For example, a fake label may tell you the shoe was designed in 2008 when in fact Nike first manufactured that item in 2010.

, The soles of most fake Nike sneakers feel plastic-y and don't have much traction, while real Nike shoes have BRS 1000 rubber soles.


Most fake Nike sneakers do not fit true to size. They generally are 1/2 size smaller and significantly narrower than real Nikes. Try the same Nike shoe in a trusted retailer to get an accurate reading of how it feels.

Fill freezer bags with water.,
Check the bags.,
Place the bag in your shoe.,
Place your shoes in the freezer.,
Remove the bags of ice.",How to Stretch Your Shoes With Ice," Fill two plastic baggies with water: one bag for each of your shoes. Use strong plastic baggies made specifically for the freezer, so they don’t break when the water freezes into ice. Depending on what area of your shoe you’re trying to stretch, the amount of water used fill the baggies with will differ:



Toe: 1/4 of the way with water

Toe and instep: 1/2 of the way with water

Toe, instep, and ankle area: 1/2 - 1/3 of the way with water;
, Make sure the bags are sealed and remove any extra air from within the bag. This will help keep the bag from popping in the freezer, allow all the water to fill out the shape of the shoe without bubble pockets, and make inserting the bags into the shoes easier.

, Be careful that the bag doesn’t open or rip as you’re putting in your shoes.


Try to get the bag as close to the toe of your shoe as possible (if that is the area you are trying to stretch out).

, Leave your shoes with the baggies of water in the freezer for at least 4-8 hours.This ensures that the water has enough time to freeze into ice.

, Let your shoes sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before you try and take out the bags of ice. Allowing the ice to thaw will make it easier to remove the baggies.After allowing the baggies to thaw, if the bags of ice still won’t come out of your shoes, you can try waiting longer for most of the ice to melt, or try to break the ice and then remove the bags.
These two alternatives are better than pulling on the baggies, ripping them, and then having open bags of water and ice in your shoes. The water could potentially damage your shoes.

, Pull the left lace straight across the shoe and push it down through the fourth eyelet. Pull it through until taught.








, Repeat steps 5 through 8 until you reach the last eyelets nearest you. Remember:

each time you run the lace beneath the eyelets you will skip one that has already been laced before you pull it up through one
when you pull a lace across the shoe it will go down into the eyelet directly parallel to the one it came up through.

, Once you've reached the last eyelets, once again ensure that they are even. You may have to do a bit of adjusting further down the shoe., Repeat all of these steps in exactly the same way for your second shoe."

Own a pair of All Stars.",How to Spot Fake All Star Converse1," One easy way to spot a counterfeit is when the All Stars come in a box that is obviously not Converse. Fresh shoes also come with tissue in the packaging. Sometimes they’ll even have paper stuffing in the shoes. If you don’t see any of the “typical” signs of fresh shoes, they're probably worth suspicion., The real patch has a navy blue star, whereas the fake one may have different shade of blue. Also, the original will be stamped with only a star and Taylor's signature. Be leery of emblems that are not clear. Many fake ones look blurry and have other design elements or words.


All Stars also come in such a wide array of styles and colors. The logo won’t always be blue and sometimes the patch is made of rubber.
Examine the star itself and be sure it is a clean print.

, Shoes made before 2008 will have the ® symbol under the All Star logo. If you see this symbol on shoes made after 2008, be cautious. Check the stitched logo as well. Although it may appear authentic, if you spot a patchy or unclear logo, it’s fake., The All Stars logo will be printed very clearly on the top of the tongue. It is fake if the print is blurry or the thread in loose around the print. The traditional tongue is made of a thin canvas. Pay attention to the stitching around the border the tongue.


As a general rule, if the stitching is loose or uneven, it’s counterfeit., In real Converse, the inner sole will have the word Converse printed sharp and plain. Be aware if you are buying a used pair. A used pair’s insignia will appear more faded than a new pair, but this doesn’t necessarily mean they’re counterfeit.

, This is painted on the top edge of the sole. It should be smooth and perfect. If it is shaky, not crisp looking or uneven, it is a red flag.

, The best way to understand All Stars is by having an authentic pair. If you’ve never owned them, purchase a pair from a trusted seller. Once you have a pair of Converse All Stars, you’ll know all the quirks and attributes of the shoe.


Save the location of where you spotted a deal for next time. Even authentic All Stars will need to be replaced.

"
"
Compare the price.,
Be aware of payment methods.,
Consider the source.,
Ask questions.,
Be vigilant when purchasing abroad.",How to Spot Fake All Star Converse2," If the price is ridiculously low, it is best to check more carefully or walk away. Usually counterfeits are considerably cheaper than authentic Converse. The cheaper price makes up for not having genuine Converse. If you opt to save money, be prepared to see your shoes deteriorate fast. Cheap sweatshop shoes will never match Converse standards for construction and materials.


Standard All Star high tops will typically sell anywhere from $50 to $100 depending on the style.

, If you are okay with buying counterfeit Converse, you do need to be careful of how you pay for them. Typically a cash only vendor is a bit of a red flag. When purchasing online, be aware of what website you are on. Have you shopped there before, or do even recognize the site? Be sure that your web browser is secure (https://) when you’re checking out.Many web browsers even have a padlock at the top corner to indicate no one can steal your information.
Expect a confirmation email when purchasing from an untrusted website.

, Always be vigilant when you’re at a flea market or other sorts of vendors. Sometimes vendors will lead you to a strange and potentially dangerous location to purchase counterfeit goods. These vendors are conducting illegal operations. Have your guard up and remember you can have a much safer transaction at a department store.Ask yourself if the price is worth the poor construction and dangerous environment.

, You never know, when you are at markets outside department stores, if they’re actually counterfeit. Ask questions when you see a price too good to be true. You can detect a lot from the seller's body language. If you suspect he’s lying, he probably is. Use your best judgement.


It is not fair to assume all open air markets sell counterfeit goods.

, If you plan to shop abroad, review travel advisories from the Department of State before going to a location. They will have information of the scene of counterfeit sellers in that location. U.S. Customs can potentially confiscate an item they deem to be questionable.Many vendors abroad target tourists with counterfeit goods. Have your guard up, but don’t act unless you are sure you’re being deceived.

Hold the boutonniere correctly.,
Lay the boutonniere flat against the left lapel of the suit.,
Move the boutonniere so that the flower is on or just below the broadest part of the lapel, covering the top button hole.,
Lift the lapel to expose the back, holding the flower in place with your non-dominant hand.,
Push the pin through the back of the lapel and through the stem of the boutonniere.,
Guide the pin back through the stem and lapel, as though sewing a stitch.The pin should be secure and lay vertically against the lapel.,
Wiggle the boutonniere to make sure it is securely fastened.,
Use a second pin if you need extra support.",How to Pin on a Boutonniere1," The floral center should be facing you, and away from your date's chest. The greenery, such as the leaves, should be facing away from you, toward your date's chest.;
, Think of it as going above your date's heart. It should be roughly equidistant between the left and right edges of the lapel., Position the stem at a slight angle so it is running parallel to the edge of the lapel., Inserting the pin from the back will keep the pin hidden so the metal won't catch the light when you take pictures., Position the pin so that it is facing down. The point of the pin should go through the stem where it is thick, just below where it attaches to the petals., The overall movement is a simple push out all the way through the fabric and the flower stem, then weaving back in through the flower stem and fabric.


You can also think of the pin as going forward through the fabric and stem, then back through the fabric again. The head of the pin and the point of the pin will both end up on the back of the lapel, hidden from view.

, Take a step back and examine the placement, making sure it is not askew or starting to pivot on the pin., If the boutonniere is heavy, you may want to secure it with an second pin. Simply stitch the pin through the lapel and boutonniere as you did before, with this second pin about half an inch below the first."
"
Figure out where to position the boutonniere.,
Pinch the fabric of the shirt between your fingers of your non-dominant hand and slide the pin through with your dominant hand.,
Slide the stem of the boutonniere between the shirt and the pin.,
Pinch the unpinned fabric on the other side of the boutonniere stem and push the pin all the way through.,
Stretch the shirt so that the fabric you pinned together lays flat against the chest.",How to Pin on a Boutonniere2," If there is a pocket on the left side of shirt, this will make things easy--you'll want to pin the flower through the top middle of the pocket, where it may be slightly reinforced and a little stronger. If there is no pocket, you will pin through the upper left side of the shirt. You can imagine pinning it above the person's heart or where a pocket would be located.Because the pin will be visible, you may want to choose a fancy gold pin or one with a decorative head., It will appear as though you are pinning the fabric together. Push the pin completely through this fold of fabric.Unlike on a lapel, the pin should be held horizontally, or parallel to the floor. With this method you are pinning the stem tightly against the chest and not actually piercing the stem of the boutonniere with the pin.

, The pin should be over the stem and holding it against the fabric. You want the pin to cross the stem near the top, where it meets the petals of the flower.Make sure the boutonniere is facing the right direction, with the flower facing toward you and away from the person wearing the boutonniere.

, It should again be as though you are pinning together the fabric pinched between your fingers.Imagine that the stem of the boutonniere is in a valley and the two folds of fabric that you pinned on either side are mountains.

, When you look at the pin, it should go into the shirt, then out, then over the boutonniere stem, then into the shirt and then out a final time.The shirt should be smooth and the flower secure.

Feel the weight of the fabric.,
Slide the fingers of your non-dominant hand under the collar of the dress, leaving your thumb on the outside.,
Place the corsage on the dress, right below the shoulder and across from the armpit.,
Hold the pin horizontally and weave it into the fabric and then out again, as though sewing a single stitch.,
Pass the point of the the pin over the stem of the flower.,
Weave the pin into the fabric and then out again, again like a simple stitch.",How to Pin on a Boutonniere3," The fabric of the dress may not be sturdy enough to support a corsage on its own, especially since they are often larger than boutonnieres. If the fabric is sheer, lace, or just feels very lightweight, you'll want to incorporate a slip or bra strap to make sure the corsage stays up., You'll want to lift the fabric up away from the skin so there's no danger of poking your date.The corsage, like the boutonniere, should be pinned to the left side of the dress.


If you are pinning through a bra strap to secure the flower, use your fingers to lift that away from the skin as well.

, Hold the arrangement in place with your thumb, making sure it is positioned straight., Start from the side closest to the arm, so the head of the pin is pointing to the arm and the point of the pin is pointing toward the breast bone.


If you are using the bra strap, the pin should pass through the dress and the strap, then out again.

, The stem should be held tight between the fabric of the dress and the length of the pin., Smooth the fabric of the dress so that the corsage lays flat against the chest. If you examine the pin, it should go into the dress (and possibly bra strap), then out, then over the stem of the flower, then into the dress and back out again."
"
Locate the buttonhole on the left lapel of the suit and make sure it is open.,
Slide the stem of the flower through the buttonhole, angling the stem down.,
Push the flower into the buttonhole until the stem is not visible.",How to Pin on a Boutonniere4," Suits rarely come equipped with this buttonhole, which is specifically for a boutonniere, since wearing a flower in your lapel is not really in fashion. To be functional, the buttonhole should be open (not sewn shut), reinforced with stitching, and have a latch 1-2 inches below it on the back of the lapel.If your jacket is lacking any of these elements, visit a dry cleaner or anywhere they do alterations and ask them to cut a buttonhole for you.Don't do this with a rented or borrowed jacket. Just pin the boutonniere to your lapel instead.

, The stem should pass through the latch as well, which will hold the flower in place.The latch is essentially a thin cord (often silk) sewn onto the back of the lapel to help secure the flower and hold it upright., Only the flower should be seen from the front of the lapel.If the stem is too long, give it a snip so it won't peek out from under your lapel.

If you have an olive complexion, you should consider a cool white to help balance things out. Champagne, rum, and silk white will also work.
Medium complexions with pink or blue undertones should consider creamy ivories and whites. These will keep you from looking too rosy or flushed.
If you have a dark complexion, you are in luck: you can wear any shade of white. Dark complexions with olive undertones should avoid yellow or ivory shades of white, however.;
, White dresses come in all sorts of materials, from breezy cottons and linens, to heavier wools and crepes. While a flowing, white maxi dress would look wonderful at the beach or at a picnic, it would not be appropriate for the office; a dress made from wool or crepe would be more suitable and professional., Choose a simple bra and pair of underwear, without any lace, beading, or other embellishments. Match the color to your skin tone as much as possible. Avoid wearing other colors, including white. Colors, patterns, and textures will all become visible under your dress., Tuck your hand into the dress. If you can see your hand, then you will need to wear a white slip with the dress. Choose a plain slip that is a few inches/centimeters shorter than your dress. Even if you are wearing nude undergarments, a sheer dress will still show off too much of your figure. A slip will help make everything look smoother., White dresses are a blank canvas and a great excuse to add just about any color you want to your outfit. Red heels are a classic pairing, and you can finish the look with a wide, red belt, red lipstick, or a red clutch. If red isn't your thing, try emerald green instead. A cool blue is yet another option, but you mind want to avoid anything with stripes, unless you are going for a nautical look., Silver or gold heels are a great choice for white dresses. For an evening look, try a strappy sandal. For a daytime look, try something bold, such as a bootie.You can also try copper, bronze, or any other metallic shade, such as pearl., These work with both long, maxi dresses and short, thigh-length dresses. For an evening look, try a metallic shade, such as silver or gold.You can also give your ensemble a boho feel with leather gladiator sandals. These goes especially well with looser, tunic-style dresses., Leather is a wonderful combination with white.Paired with a loose, flowing dress, it can give your outfit a carefree, boho look perfect for the summer. If you want something more formal, you could try suede pumps in tan or beige instead.

, Finish the look with a wide, red belt, red lipstick, or a red clutch. If red isn't your thing, try emerald green instead. A cool blue is yet another option, but you mind want to avoid anything with stripes, unless you are going for a nautical look., Black and white is a classic combination, but it can look very stark and severe. It is best let for evenings or formal events.If you want to try black shoes, try a pair of black ankle booties with a summer dress. Balance the look out with a black clutch, bangle, or belt., They will make your outfit appear too bridal, monochrome, or nurse-like. If you really want to wear white shoes, try a light silver color instead, or perhaps a pearly white., Plain white dresses are perfect for making your favorite statement necklace stand out. Try to keep the occasion and the style of dress in mind, however. A loose, flowing, maxi dress would look better with a boho-style statement necklace made from leather, glass beads, and feather pendants. A white satin dress would look better with a silver, diamond necklace., If big, bulky, statement necklaces aren't your thing, you can certainly wear other things. Long, chain necklaces are a great option. You can also try on a pair of chandelier earrings or bangles. You can even stack different types of matching bangles to create a unique look!, Like shoes, you can't go wrong with a silver belt or a gold clutch. If you are already wearing metallic shoes, however, you should match the color of your accessory to the shoe. For example, if you are wearing gold sandals, you should wear a gold belt, not a silver one., These go especially well with long maxi dresses. You can take your outfit to the next level by adding some colorful beaded jewelry as well.If leather isn't your thing, you can also try anything in beige, tan, or brown., You can't go wrong with a wide belt in red, blue, or pink. Finish off the outfit with a matching clutch. This will help break up the monochrome and add a splash of color to your outfit. It is great if you want something subtle without appearing too dull or mundane., White dresses can look a little plain, but you can make your outfit stand out by layering other clothing pieces on top. You can wear a solid color or even a patterned one, just make sure that it matches the style of your dress. Listed below are some ideas:If you like to keep things casual, pair a little white dress with a leather jacket and sneakers.
Pair a sleeveless dress over a collared shirt. This will give your a vintage, jumper look. Complete your outfit with a matching belt.
Add a detachable collar. If the collar is fancy and beaded, you can even use it in place of a statement necklace.
Throw on a matching scarf or hat. If you already had on a pair of shoes, a belt, and a purse, and still feel that something is missing, try adding a hat or a silk scarf.

, For a smoky effect, apply a deep grey or richer purple.

, If you have fair eyelashes, apply a coat of mascara on top of your eyelashes as well. (For an extra kick, use a metal eyelash curler, and heat it with your hair dryer for about 10 seconds before you use it. The difference is dramatic, and the effect lasts all night. Just be careful not to get the curler too hot; test it with your fingers first.)

Make sure the weather is sundress-appropriate.,
Next think about the occasion for which you're dressing.,
Decide whether you want to wear a long or a short sundress.,
Pick out a color and pattern.,
Consider the neckline of your sundress.",How to Wear a Sundress1," A good general guideline is seventy degrees or above, but don't be afraid to break that rule if you've got a heavy jacket or you don't mind the cold.;
, A party? A picnic? A trip to the mall? If you're attending anything that could be considered a formal event, save the sundress for next time.

, If you don't like your legs or you don't want your dress blowing up Marilyn Monroe-style, a maxi dress is probably your best bet.

, Solid colors work best if you're going for a simple look, although floral prints can also be very tasteful. Animal prints and sequins are best left for days when you're feeling daring, so think about your usual style as you're deciding whether or not to purchase a new, boldly patterned sundress.

, If you want to avoid tan lines, a strapless sundress may be the best choice for you. If you prefer not wearing a bra but still want support, try on a sundress with a halter top. You can also experiment with the various styles of shoulder straps that come on varieties of sundress models.

Wear silver.,
Mix silver and gold.,
Add some black or gunmetal.,
Stick with blue tones.",How to Accessorize a Silver Dress1," An all-silver color scheme keeps things simple and elegant.


It works best if your dress is a light, shimmering hue of silver.
You should also try to match the hue of your accessories to the hue of your dress.
Stick with delicate, dainty jewelry and simple silver heels with little adornment, emphasizing the simplicity of this option.;
, This creates another elegant, classy look, but one with more variety and visual interest.


Look for two-toned jewelry that mixes gold and silver. Each piece should have a two-toned element for the sake of consistency.

, These tones are a little less feminine and more masculine, so you can get away with bulkier jewelry and accessories if you go this route. You could even consider black leather bracelets and heavier black heels or boots to create the edgy look. This results in an overall bolder look.

, Colors are a versatile option and can either look elegant or bold. Just stick with cool hues.


Blues and blue-tinted shades of purple or turquoise work best.
Avoid warm colors, since these are more likely to clash with the cold tone of a silver dress.

Do your makeup with care.,
Style your hair.,
Take along a purse or other bag, just in case.",How to Wear a Sundress2," For a scarf to work with a sundress, it should be made of a light fabric, like cotton or silk. (Do not, under any circumstances, pair a thick, woolen winter scarf with a sundress.)

, Unless you live in Alaska or someplace else where it snows in the summer, try to avoid wearing a bulky jacket over your sundress.

, Long or short necklaces and bangle bracelets look great with sundresses, and chandelier or feather earrings plus a ballerina bun is an especially good combination.

, Obviously they won't be of much assistance if it's cloudy outside, but on sunny days they can be a real asset (fashionably and for the health of your eyes).

, If you've got a multi-colored patterned sundress on, pick your favorite color out of the design and find a polish that matches. Brush on a couple of coats and you're good to go!

, Flip-flops, flats, and even ankle boots will work, but never wear running shoes or Uggs; they're just too clunky for the streamlined summer look you want to achieve.

, You don't want to look unseasonably dark, but you could put on some mascara and foundation if your skin's a little blotchy. Add eyeshadow and lip gloss too, but remember, nothing too dramatic.

, Loose curls, pulled back, fishtail braid, whatever you're in the mood for--it'll make your full outfit look that much better.

Enjoy your sundress!",How to Wear a Sundress3," At first you might feel self-conscious, especially if this is out of your usual range of style or if it's the first time you're wearing a sundress this year--but if you act like you're the most beautiful person to ever put on a sundress, people will start to believe it!

, Nothing looks stranger than someone wearing a nice floral sundress and a frown at the same time. The two just don't go together, and besides, why wouldn't you want to show off your pearly whites?

Choose an unobtrusive necklace.,
Pick out a simple bracelet.,
Balance out the look with silver earrings.,
Add a touch of silver to your hair.",How to Accessorize a Silver Dress2," A silver dress is already a bold fashion move, and adding a loud necklace will only make your outfit seem unnecessarily gaudy. Your necklace should not compete with your dress.


If sticking with silver or silver and gold, a dainty chain with a simple pendant works nicely, depending on your dress’s neckline.
For an appropriately bolder look, wear a necklace with chunky black or blue beads mixed with gunmetal. It can be a choker or a long loop that drapes across your torso.

,


A delicate silver or two-toned chain bracelet adds a touch of class.
Thin silver bangles are festive yet feminine.
A thick, chunky bracelet in black, gunmetal, or deep blue adds contrast to your dress but avoids clashing or competing with it.

, Earrings can add just enough sparkle by your face to help correct the potential imbalance caused by having too much silver concentrated on the middle of your body. Choose the right posts, hoops, or dangling earrings to match your color scheme.

, Sparkly, decorative hair clips can either be playful or elegant, depending on the design. These, like earrings, can also help balance out the silver on your body.

Mix and match your diamond accessories.,
Wear all diamonds, but keep it subtle.,
Choose one strong diamond piece and pair it with a few less extravagant pieces.,
Keep the diamonds off the dress.",How to Accessorize a Silver Dress3," Pair one or two key diamond pieces with non-diamond jewelry. For example, you could wear a diamond pendant or choker with thin silver bangle bracelets.


Avoid matching diamond jewelry with black or gunmetal accessories. Diamonds look best when paired with other feminine pieces, and many black and gunmetal pieces are too masculine to coordinate well.

, Match a simple diamond pendant with a dainty diamond bracelet and diamond stud earrings.

, For instance, you could wear chandelier earrings with a simple diamond pendant, or a glamorous diamond tennis bracelet with diamond stud earrings.

, Diamond jewelry may blend in with the silver fabric. For bracelets and earrings, this does not pose much problem. This can, however, make selecting a diamond necklace difficult. Avoid long necklaces that position the diamond element directly above the material of the dress. Also avoid extravagant diamond necklaces that throw too many diamonds directly above the dress’s neckline.

"
"
Stick with heels for elegance and class.,
Consider a metallic or patent leather flat.",How to Accessorize a Silver Dress4,"

Try a silver sandal with thin straps, an open toe, and a narrow stiletto heel to create a very feminine look. Gold-tone accents can provide some contrast without taking away from the elegance of the look.






Black heels do not need to be as delicate as silver heels when matched with a silver dress, but you should still avoid shoes with a chunky platform heel.






Colored shoes can look tacky if done incorrectly. Choose a deep blue-tone if going with a solid color shoe. Otherwise, pick out a silver, black, or gunmetal heel with colored stones or other accents.







, Flats are a casual style of shoe, and most will not work well with a silver dress, which is naturally formal. Some metallic flats or shiny patent leather flats are dressy enough, however, to match with simple matte silver dresses.

"
"
Carry a small clutch.,
Wear a large shoulder bag.",How to Accessorize a Silver Dress5," Clutch handbags are feminine and classy. Select a simple, solid print clutch decorated with a few gemstones or another similar touch of sparkle.

,


If going for a slightly bolder look, choose a large silver or gunmetal shoulder bag.
A black or dark blue bag may also work, but could appear too casual to match well with your dress.
If you want to include black or color on your bag, it is best to do so by selecting a bag with colored accents instead of a solid color print.

Apply a foundation that matches your natural skin tone.

,
Layer on a bronze-tinted blush, but don't overdo it.,
Don't hold back on your eyeshadow color.,
Apply black eyeliner to your eyes.,
Finish your eyes with black mascara, if desired.

,
Stay away from bright red lipsticks.",How to Accessorize a Silver Dress6,", Keep your cheek color light.


Consider a pink blush if you have fair skin.
Choose a peach blush if your skin is medium tone.
Try a plum shade if you have darker toned skin.

, Apply dark, shimmering metallic shades to make your eyes stand out.


Avoid light silvers or grays, even if you opted for all-silver accessories. If you want to keep the all-silver look, opt for medium to darker shades of gray.
Go with either dark bronzes or coal grays if you accessorized with silver and gold accessories.
Try adding some variety into your look with a color eye shadow. Stick with blue tones. Think dark blues, eggplant violets, and deep turquoises.

You may add liquid glitter liner over the black liner to give your eyes a bit more sparkle.

Put on ankle-high shoes.,
Wear leggings or stockings.,
Throw on a pair of slim pants.,
Throw a sweater on top.,
Make your jacket part of the outfit.,
Don't forget the warm accessories.",How to Wear a Skirt in the Winter," Winter is a great time for wearing longer skirts. They provide more warmth than shorter skirts, and they can still be fashionable. You can even go for an ankle-length skirt.Pick out a skirt that extends somewhere between your mid-calf and the top of your foot, a few inches above your ankle. Longer skirts will keep you warmer, but a skirt that’s too long will drag on the ground, getting wet and muddy.;
, Shorter skirts are not going to provide much warmth. However, if you choose a fabric like wool, you are going to get a bit more warmth out of them. Denim, suede, and velvet can also offer more warmth. After that, you'll just need to pair them with something warm, such as leggings and a sweater.
, A knee-length skirt offers a bit of warmth (though not as much as a full-length skirt). In addition, you can wear it in a variety of situations.Knee-length skirts can be made to look professional, trendy, or flirty, depending on how you accessorize them.

For instance, a pencil skirt paired with a button-up shirt and suit jacket can look professional, while a pencil skirt paired with a fancy top can serve for an evening out.

, Use a mini-skirt to create a chic look. Mini-skirts in winter seem to defy common sense. As a result, wearing one gives your style an edgy twist. Matching the skirt with suitable leg coverings will keep you both warm and fashionable.

For instance, try a mini-skirt with patterned leggings and an oversized sweater.

, This advice may sound a little odd. However, layering skirts can provide you with extra warmth and look fashionable at the same time. Try a longer flowing skirt under a slightly shorter (less flowing) skirt, for instance, and it can be like having a petticoat on.Try a button-up dress with out any ruffles, and throw it over a ruffled skirt. Just button a few buttons at the top of the dress.

, If your look demands a shorter skirt, knee-high boots may be just what you need to stay warm. Try a pair in leather to amp up the fashion level. You could also try suede for a softer look.If you want something a bit more daring, try a pair of thigh-high boots.

, Ankle-high boots are an obvious choice for winter. They can be fun, fashionable, and warm. You don't have to stick to boots, though. For a little whimsy, try a pair of ankle-high sneakers. It's warm, plus you'll get great traction.Almost any length skirt will look great with ankle-high boots. Try a pencil skirt, for instance, or even a full-length skirt.

, Leggings and stockings add warmth, and they can make a fashion statement at the same time. Most are made of cotton, polyester blends, or spandex. They come in a variety of colors, so choose one that works well with your skirt. Black, brown, and other muted neutrals are safe options for most skirts, but you may consider choosing a bolder color or pattern to give your outfit a bit of pizzazz.For instance, try a pair of tartan leggings under a red mini skirt for a bold look.
For something more neutral, throw a pair of tan stockings on under a full-length skirt.

, While this look isn't for everyone, a pair of pants underneath your skirt can add warmth and be fashion-forward at the same time. Try a slim pair of pants in a neutral color. Some fashionistas even advise a skirt over a pair of wide-legged jeans.Try a pair of skinny jeans underneath a red calf-length skirt.

, A chic sweater on top can be just the right note to make an outfit. Plus, it has the added bonus of keeping you warm. You can also layer a long-sleeved shirt under a sweater vest for a different look.You can even pair an oversized sweater with a short skirt.

, You need your jacket when you're out and about, but don't worry, you can just incorporate it. For instance, a long jacket belted over a long skirt can be quite chic.For a short skirt, you can go short or long with your jacket, depending on the look you want.
, Add a chic scarf for extra warmth and a splash of color. Also, don't forget gloves. A sleek pair of leather or suede gloves goes with most looks. Add a knit cap on top, and you've got a recipe for winter warmth with sleek style.For instance, you could pair a tight-fitting sweater with suede gloves, a big chunky scarf, and a matching knit hat.

Wear your shoes at home.,
Wear thick socks and add heat.,
Gather a few socks for each shoe.








,
Roll the socks into small balls.








,
Gently stuff each sock deep into the shoe until the shoe is full.,
Wait overnight.,
Freeze the shoes with a bag of water.,
Stuff your shoes with wet newspaper.,
Fill the shoes with oats.,
Use a rubbing alcohol spray.,
Do the ""mashed potato"".,
Use a shoe-stretcher on leather shoes.,
Hire a professional.,
Choose shoes that fit.,
Choose stretchy shoes.",How to Stretch New Shoes," This is the easiest option: if your shoes are not so tight as to be completely unwearable, simply put them on and wear them around the house, until they have adjusted to your feet. This might take a couple days, but it's so natural, it's practically organic!






;
, Put on the thickest socks you have, and squeeze your feet into the shoes (leather only). Heat the tight area of the shoes using a hairdryer and bend your feet back and forth as much as you can for 20 to 30 seconds.









Remove the heat source but leave the shoes on until they have cooled. Try the shoes on with your normal socks or stockings.
Repeat until the shoes have stretched enough. Once stretched, apply leather shoe conditioner to restore the moisture that might have been depleted by the heat.Note: heating shoes could weaken glue bonds—use with caution on vintage shoes.

,,,









Repeat on the other shoe.

, Next day you will see a difference.








, Fill a hole-free resealable sandwich bag, thick balloon, or similar plastic bag about one third to halfway with water and seal tightly, one bag for each of your shoes.









Place a bag inside each shoe and push into place so that it fills your entire shoe. Place your shoes in the freezer, and let them sit until the water freezes, or overnight. As the water freezes, it will expand into your shoes, gently stretching the leather.
Remove from the freezer and let them thaw for about 20 minutes before trying to remove the bags. Try the shoes on again to see how the shoes fit and repeat if needed.
It's recommended that you don't use this method on expensive shoes.

, Scrunch up wet newspaper, and stuff it into your shoes. Stuff in as much as the shoe will fit, but be careful not to distort the shoe shape when using this method; if the shoe appears distorted, remove newspaper and re-stuff until the shoe shape looks right.









Let the shoes dry. Remove the newspaper and try on the shoes. There should be more give.
Note that this method can also include freezing the shoes for added expansion. Wet socks can be substituted for newspaper.

, Try this old cowboy trick for leather boots: fill your boots with oats, or any grain that swells up when wet.









Pour in enough water to cover the grain. The grain will swell overnight.
Clean out the oatmeal. It's probably not a good idea to make breakfast with the leftovers.
Wear them for a few days as they dry and adjust to your feet.

, Fill a spray bottle with 50 percent rubbing alcohol and 50 percent water. Spray the inside of each shoe and wear for about 20 minutes.









Alternatively, simply rub alcohol directly onto the parts of the shoe requiring stretching.
Quickly put the shoe or boot on while still wet, as the alcohol will dry quickly.
Another variation is to take a pair of cotton socks, soak them in rubbing alcohol and squeeze out the excess. Put on the socks and wear with the shoes until the alcohol dries. Repeat several times if necessary.

, Peel a spud (a big russet is best), and push it into the shoe overnight. Make sure it is large enough to create a small bulge in the shoe.









Potatoes do not smell bad (they actually trap odor), and any potato residue left over will easily wipe off with a damp cloth.

, A shoe stretcher is shaped the same as a foot and is usually made from wood, such as cedar or maple, with screws and adjustments that help to stretch the shoe.









Look in the closet-organizer section of your local hardware or organizational stores, or check out garage sales and thrift stores.
A shoe stretcher can adjust width or length (check its ability when purchasing) and will fit in either the left or right shoe.
Known as ""dry stretching,"" a shoe-stretcher can take several days for it to have an effect; check the fit every now and then.
Some shoe stretchers include little buttons you can insert into holes for localized stretching, for example to fit over an area with a bunion or corn.
Use a shoe-stretching spray or oil in conjunction with the shoe-stretcher. You'll find the spray or oil at shoe stores, shoe repair shops, or from wherever you purchased the shoe-stretcher. The spray or oil will help to make the shoe material a little more supple, helping it to stretch evenly and speeds up the process.

, Take your shoes to a professional cobbler for stretching. Some have machines that can gently apply pressure and heat to shoes to stretch them just the right amount.









The precision and ease of using this service can be well worth the effort and cost, especially for expensive or delicate shoes.
Expect the service to take around 24 hours.

, As much as possible, choose shoes that already fit and don't need stretching or don't need very much stretching. Ensure this by:









Having your feet measured whenever you buy shoes. Feet are three dimensional, and all measurements should account for not only length but width and depth as well.Measure both feet. Most people's feet are identically sized,however some people have feet which are two different sizes, and some people even experience up to a whole size difference between feet.
Trying the next size up if a pair is a bit too tight, even if you think you normally wear a certain size. Proportions vary between manufacturers, and the only way you can tell is by trying on the shoes.
Checking the sizing standard for your shoes. That is, is it European, UK, or US? Is it men's or women's? Even if multiple size standards are listed, there's not a strict correspondence between US and European shoe sizes, so if you're used to one and not the other, try on the nearby sizes.
Asking about half sizes and multiple widths. Not all shoe stores carry them, but the good ones do.
Buying shoes in the second half of the day, when your feet are at their most swollen after walking and standing on them during the day., As a rule, real leather is more conforming and has more give than synthetics such as plastic, PVC, etc.









If the shoe is synthetic, be sure to purchase it in the right size from the start as it's unlikely to have any give; indeed, the point of such materials is often that their molded shape has no give and endures.
Be careful with fabric shoes, as any stretching might weaken the fibers.
Shoes with an elastic gore will be stretchier. An elastic gore is an elastic fabric panel inserted into a shoe.
Different leather has different stretchability. Kangaroo leather is considered to have more stretch than cow leather, for example.
There's a limit to how far shoes can reasonably stretch. If you just need to loosen things up a little around the toes, you'll have better success than if the whole thing needs to get a lot bigger.
And some shoes should fit properly from the beginning, no matter what, such as walking shoes. If the shoe needs too much stretching, either don't purchase it, or purchase a pair a half to one size up, or switch to a better fitting style or brand.

Very tight, short, or otherwise revealing minis tend to be favored by younger wearers, or those with good physiques.

A-line skirts This is the basic skirt that has been customized to a great extent. With slight flare having rough shape of capital letter ‘A’, it fits at the waist while slightly touching hips and thighs; it is broader at the hem.

Older wearers are likely to feel more comfortable in minis that don’t cling. Consider such choices as kilts, wraps and pleats.The Early Show advice also suggests that darker colors are better for a more professional and elegant look.A high-waisted mini can give the impression of hanging lower on the leg than it really does, making it more work appropriate.

A casual, mid-length mini goes with everything and is good for everyday use.;

If you'd like to dress your skirt up with nude tights, pair them with a closed-toe shoe.

For an older, mature look, consider opaque tights.Choose black, chocolate brown, plums and steel greys for the colors. Leave lighter colors to the teenage crowd, as they tend to emphasize their legs.

Leggings or half-leggings can make a miniskirt more modest, sporty, and versatile.

For a spunkier look that works especially well with simple skirts, buy fishnet or patterned tights.

Over-the-knee socks also look good with miniskirts.

, Experiment in the mirror and see what looks best with your mini. Here are some suggestions:

Boots of differing lengths and miniskirts are a classic pairing.

High heels can spice up a miniskirt and make your legs long longer.

For a more girlish look, wear flat shoes such as ballet flats or flip-flops.

To slim your legs, avoid wearing shoes that are too dainty or delicate, as these will make your legs look larger.

Wedge shoes work well because their heaviness counteracts the shortness of the mini skirt and provides an ""anchor"".

, Most of us aren't blessed with long, skinny legs. That doesn't mean the mini is out; it means paying a little extra attention to what enhances your legs.

If you want to bare your legs, consider getting them waxed. Waxing plucks the hair from the roots and generally lasts longer.

If you need tanned legs quickly, a fake tan suffices. Try a tanning salon or special makeup, but be aware of the potential health threats.

If you'd like to keep your legs pale, apply sunscreen to your legs daily and avoid tanning. In some areas, such as many parts of Asia,being and staying pale is valued.

If you don't want to wear stockings but would like to enhance the look of your legs immediately, blend some sheer highlighting powder or lotion up the front of your legs. This will make your legs look thinner, and more toned. Start just above your ankle and blend up along your shinbone, avoid the knee and continue the line up the front of your thigh. Make sure the line is very well blended so that there is a subtle sheen. Do not use highlighter that is too glittery or colored.

, The top you choose to wear with your skirt can dictate how you pull off the whole look. Consider:

Wear the right shoes.",How to Wear a Maxi Skirt1," Walk in it, swish around in it and see if it feels comfortable first. If you're tripping up, it's too long. Then check how it looks in the mirror––the more streamlined styles will be the most flattering, while the flouncy Bohemian styles can add weight and don't flatter all figures.


The texture of the fabric will affect the suitability of the skirt for your figure type. Try on maxi skirts in different fabrics to find the fabric you think looks best or drapes well on you.
Just as pleats on shorter skirts don't work for all figure types, pleated maxi skirts may not suit your figure type. Don't despair, just try a different style of maxi skirt instead.;
, The fit of the skirt determines the style of top you'll choose. If the style doesn't match, the overall look can be dowdy. Some suggestions include:


Looser, flowing skirts tend to look best when the top fits well, as this tones down the overall enlarging effect of a billowing skirt.
For skirts that fit tightly, looser tops make an ideal contrast.
Cropped tops look great with maxi skirts, as the skirt keeps lengthening your body even though the top stops at your waist. A cropped top with heels can help elongate a shorter figure; indeed, if you have a shorter silhouette, make sure that the top stops at your natural waistline. Slouchy tops can look good with a maxi skirt but check the final look in the mirror before deciding. Sometimes adding a belt will improve the final look, especially a broader belt that cinches in under the ribs or around the waist. The slouchy top look tends to be carried off best on leaner, taller bodies.
Layered tops work well for taller figures., There is no hard and fast rule on this––you'll need to experiment in the mirror. But here are some tips:


Don't tuck in where doing so creates an unsightly bulge or somehow disturbs the flow of the skirt.
Thin cashmere or similar style thin width sweaters can look elegant when tucked into the waistband of a maxi skirt.
Layering can allow you to tuck in the t-shirt or shirt while leaving the other layers untucked, such as a cardigan, jacket or coat. Leaving the outer layers unbuttoned can be a good look, as the top of the skirt will be easy to see.
Obviously, if the skirt is tight around the waistband, tucking in may prove uncomfortable. Instead, try layering or a cropped top.
The texture of the top and skirt do not have to match but they must be complementary.

, There are two options here––monochrome (all one color) or matching colors. Avoid using colors that clash, as with any clothing.


Monochrome can look very slimming and elegant, as the same color all the way down your body creates a sense of elongation. However, be careful to match the shades well or it can look slightly off color.
Don't mix patterns. A patterned skirt works best with a solid color top and vice versa. Definitely avoid mixing up spots, stripes, florals and diagonals.

, If you're petite, wear heels to give you the added height to cope with the skirt length and to elongate your silhouette. If you're taller, flats or heels will work with a maxi skirt, although heels are usually preferred for evening wear. Most heels will work well with maxi skirts but always check in the mirror before deciding.


Beaded sandals are appropriate for a flowing, Bohemian maxi skirt look. Espadrilles also look very casual and beach-like.
Wedge shoes look great with maxi skirts and give you added height to carry off the longer skirt.
Rugged styles can look great with many maxi skirts.Avoid flats that are completely closed in, or loafers. These look frumpy with long skirts. Pointy toes and knee-high boots don't work either. And clogs and sneakers tend to look too chunky or dowdy.

a fitted skirt (one that fits you well)
scissors
pins
sewing machine;
, Take your stretch fabric and fold it in half so that the shortest edges are even with each other. Then, fold your fabric again so that the long edges are even.








If you have chosen a print fabric, make sure that the print is facing in.
Lay your fabric on the ground when you are finished.

, You will need to have a couple of strips of fabric to use for your waistband, so cut in a straight line a few inches away from the narrow edge of the open part of your fabric. Do not cut along the folded side. 








Set these strips aside for now.

, Fold the fitted skirt four times length-wise and then place the waistband of the folded fitted skirt over the edge of the folded corner of your stretch material. Use the width of the folded fitted skirt as a guide for how wide to make the waistband of your circle skirt.








To create the waistband, take your scissors and cut a half circle for the waistband that is about the same width as the width of the folded fitted skirt.
It is better to cut the waist a little smaller. Remember that the fabric is stretchy and you can always make it a little wider if you need to.
If you prefer, you can also measure your waist circumference with a measuring tape. Just divide the number by four to determine how wide to make the cut for the waist.

, Next, take your scissors and cut along the outer edge of the bottom of the skirt (the unfolded part). Make sure that the bottom of the skirt is about the same length all around. You may need to trim more or less fabric off of some areas to create a nice circular shape.








Don’t worry if there are a few jagged edges at the bottom of your skirt. You will be hemming the bottom edges, which will cover up any minor imperfections.

, Unfold the fabric once so that is it just folded in half. Then unfold your fitted skirt and hold the waistband of it up against the waist of your circle skirt. This will help you to determine if the waist is the correct size.








If it is too small, then you can make it a bit wider.

, Next, take the fabric that you set aside for your waistband and place it next to the waist of your skirt. You should have two strips on top of each other with the patterns facing each other (if the fabric has a pattern). Place the strips near the waist and cut the edges of the strip so that you will have enough to hem the waistband.








Since the waist is a half circle and the strips are straight, you may want to measure for this part or at least cut a little more fabric than you think you will need.

, Take your waistband pieces and make sure that they are lined up. If the fabric has a pattern, it should still be facing in. Take your two waistband pieces and sew them together along the short edges. Then, hem the long edges by folding about a half inch of the fabric over and sewing along the edge of this fabric.








Use a regular stitch to sew the waistband.
You do not need to use any elastic for the waistband since you are using stretch fabric.

, Open up your circle skirt and lay it out on your table or floor. Then take your waistband and start pinning it onto the waist of your circle skirt. As you pin on the waistband, make sure that the print side of your waistband faces the print side of your circle skirt.








The edges of the waistband and the circle skirt edge should be even as well.
Start by pinning one edge to the circle skirt and then pin the opposite edge. Then, pin the part of the waistband that is halfway between the two pins you just placed. Then, pin the part of the waistband across from that pin. Keep pinning in the way to ensure an even distribution of the waistband.

, After your waistband is pinned to your circle skirt, start sewing along the edge of your waistband and circle skirt waist with a zig-zag stitch. Remove the pins as you go.








Make sure that you stretch both pieces of fabric a bit as you sew to make sure that they will be even and smooth.
After you are done, just flip the waistband fabric over and tuck it into the waist when you wear it.

, Before you hem the skirt, you will need to fold the edges over. Create the fold about a half inch away from the edge of the skirt bottom all the way around. You can pin the edges if you want to be sure that the hem will be even or you can just fold the edges as you go.








Another option is to start with a baste stitch to mark the hem fold. You can sew a baste stitch about ½ inch away from your skirt edge and then use this stitch as a guide as you fold over the material and sew the hem. Fold along the baste stitch as if it is a perforated line. Then, you can either remove the baste stitch or fold over the edge again and sew.For even more accuracy, try sewing a piece of ribbon onto the inner edge of your skirt bottom. Then, fold over the ribbon and sew again. The ribbon can also help to provide some structure and added body to your circle skirt., Sew the hem using a regular stitch. Make sure that the edges are even all around the skirt. If you are worried about making a mistake, then you can always start with a basting stitch and then go over it with a regular stitch when you are happy with the results.








Hemming a skirt can be a challenge because of the curved edges. Go slow and try to be patient.
Try ironing the edge before you sew. You can also iron the hem edge flat before you sew it in place. This may reduce the chances of puckering material or uneven spots., After you finish the hem, trim away and loose excess threads along your hem and waistband. Now your skirt is ready to wear! You can wear a circle skirt lots of different ways, so have fun experimenting.








Try pairing your circle skirt with a fitted t-shirt and pair of sandals for an easy spring or summer look, or wear it with tights, a sweater, and some boots for a cute fall or winter look.

Pair the fishtail and the mullet.",How to Choose the Right Skirt for Your Figure," There are many choices out there and it's useful to know the basic shapes if you're not already skirt-conversant. The following are fairly standard skirt types from which other variations can be found:Pleated skirt - in a short style it's good for sports, knee length it's a classic style and is great for anything

Mini and micro-mini – short skirts
Bubble skirt – bulges at the hem like a bubble

Pencil skirt – slimline, and classy, in dark colours and just above the knee it's guaranteed to make you look and feel great,
Flip skirt – fitted from waist but then flares around the hemline

Sarong – a wraparound skirt
A-line – shaped pretty much like the letter A, can be any length
Handkerchief – tends to hang in graduated hem lengths, with a diagonal hem cut
Fishtail – slim waist, billows around hips, narrow around the knees, flares at the heels, like a mermaid's tail
Peasant – billowing, wide, layered style skirt, usually three-quarter length.;
, The following guide is general and there may be some variations depending on the specifics of your own body shape:



Short figure: The best skirts for short figures are tapered straight (slim) skirts and A-line skirts but avoid stiff A-lines as they can make you appear squat. Length should be around the knee; if it's either too long or too short, the skirt can make you appear even shorter although if you have shapely legs, a shorter skirt can make them seem longer. Suitable styles include button-fronts and wraparound skirts, as long as they are not stiff. And off-center slit can help to elongate the legs. Vertical embellishments or detailing will also help create the feeling of length. Things to avoid include hem detail, mid-calf length skirts, patch pockets, and girly skirts.Thick waist: If you have a thick waist, wear skirts that draw attention to your legs and away from the waist. Wear long and full skirts or short skirts. Avoid skirts with any embellishments around the middle, as these will draw attention to the waist.Curvy figure: Skirts with subtle tapering are ideal, and A-lines and wraparounds are also suitable. Choose skirts with a flat front, side or back zippers, drop-waists or no waistband if you have a thick waist (or keep if you have a waist to show off), flat textures with little stretch, and soft, fluid fabrics to float over curves. As with the short figure, an off-center slit can help draw attention to the legs and not the curves. Skirts to avoid include box styles, stiff fabrics, pleats, patch pockets, full styles, and any horizontal patterning. Don't wear any skirts that are too tight.Larger stomach: Wear lightly tapered pencil skirts and A-line skirts that drape. Avoid waistbands or remove them, avoid anything clinging or tight, bias cuts, pleats, wraps, darts in the front, gathered or bulky styles, and front pockets. How to Choose Makeup Colors|Dark colors and flat textures are best. Don't wear sarongs.Boy-like figure: Skirts suitable for this type of figure include most styles although if you are concerned that your legs are too skinny, wear a long skirt with a slit or buttons on the front to increase the leg appeal. Pleating is good for slim hips and you can wear slanted pockets, patch pockets, gathering, belts, and thick waistbands. A small waist can be given added attention by the use of a wide belt.Bottom-heavy figure: This figure is flattered by a moderate A-line style or loose, softly draped skirts, and wraps and the good news is that skirts flatter your figure more than pants. A tapered knee-length skirt can work if it's not too severe, and avoid waistbands. Details should be vertical, and prefer dark colors. Avoid pockets on the skirt, pleating all the way around, bias cuts or trims, Lycra fabric, hem detail, a lot of flare, or horizontal embellishment. Don't wear any skirts that are too tight and avoid any skirts that have pleats above the hips.Flat bottom: Wear Lycra fabrics, tight skirts, and bias-cut skirts.Long waist, short legs: Select straight skirts to give your legs length. The best length for the skirt tends to be between mid-thigh and above the knee. A belt in the same color as the skirt can visually shorten the upper body. Wear short tops or jackets, tone the pantyhose with the skirt, and rely on vertical embellishments to give a sense of length.Short waist, long legs: Look for skirts which are straight and have a dropped waist. Skirts that hip-hug or are low-rise, no waistband, and low-slung skirts are also a good choice. Tops that fall past the waistline can swallow up some of the leg-length and fluid skirt fabric can hide the short waist. Avoid anything on the skirt that interrupts the line of the top coming over the skirt (for example, pleats), belts that don't blend in, high or wide waistbands, and horizontal detailing near the waist zone of the skirt.Large thighs: This figure is flattered by skirts that are loose and drape or have soft pleats. Avoid wearing Lycra-blend narrow skirts.Thick ankles: If you have thick ankles, skirts are best when long and loose and with above-the-ankle boots. Any skirt with hem detail, embellishment, or flare in the lower half will draw attention to the ankles, so avoid this., Hem lengths change constantly, but it's important to stick with the length that flatters you most. The best way to find this out is to check out the skirts in your wardrobe that you feel best in (or try a few lengths on at the store). Note where the hem falls. InStyle suggests that this will often be on the leanest part of your legs, which is usually mid-thigh or just above the knee.Find up to three lengths that flatter you best and aim to keep with those when shopping for skirts. You can do this with ease provided you are honest with yourself about those dowdy skirts you've been hanging on to for too long; we're all born fashion-conscious, sometimes it just needs reawakening!


Hems should sit straight when on, with no dipping front or back. If not, try on another skirt.

, The 1950s glamour girl look comes from the flowing, flirty shape, making this skirt perfect for both work or a night out. Not only that but this skirt works for basically every figure – giving a cola bottle silhouette to a Twiggy figure, and coasting over the lovely bumps of the fuller figured lady, this really is the Little Black Dress of skirts. All you need to worry about is length and fabric.


Too long and it's a granny skirt, too short and you get that 1990s look heavily inspired by Empire Records or the late 1960s. This is all well and good if you've got thighs that like being out and about, but if you're a little more shy, one bend over and the whole world's your audience! Generally the perfect length is just on or over the knee, as the curve of the hem subtly complements your lower leg by 'cutting off' the knee.
If you're a vintage fan, this is a great skirt to hunt out in vintage stores. You can often get a beautiful 50s cotton skirt, perfect for holidaying, and often in a kooky, unique fabric. But don't forget the power of evening wear - you should be able to find sheer, layered fabrics, perhaps with glittering details at the hem. And don't forget: for the perfect 50s shape, pull in your waist with a wide belt, and slip a full petticoat underneath the skirt!

, A great little slinky skirt, particularly prevalent in the pin-up style, this is a great way of looking sexy whilst covering up. Find the right fit, and these slinky delights will make you look and feel very sexy indeed. But some words of warning – underwear and fabric. Be sure to choose smooth underwear underneath and go for a heavier gauge fabric. This way the fabric coasts over your curves without illustrating them.


Make sure you buy the right size skirt. You should be able to fit a finger between yourself and the fabric, comfortably.
If you love your waist, have a look for the nautically inspired high waisted numbers that have been out and about lately.

, The mini is great fun, and essential for a 1960s party. But it really comes down to confidence, no matter what size you are. If you're slim, you can go for any shape of mini, and may particularly enjoy the flared, flirty style that's popular on and off. If you're a little curvier, a straight mini in a heavier gauge fabric (denim that isn't too elasticized is a good example, or basically anything lined) may be your best bet.

, The A-line is a bit of a 1970s style but really it's a very simple, unfussy shape, which can be perfect for smart casual work wear. Just be careful with it, as occasionally it can give a never-ending widening look.

, The trumpet skirt usually floats in and out, rippled hem skirt (it's the one your aunt always wears to weddings with a suit jacket). In the right fabric, with the right lining, it can really float over your figure, giving the idea of an hourglass (especially when cut on the bias). But if you have a big hip and upper thigh region, it may accentuate this region, and can really draw the eye to the flaw, so avoid in this case.

, This skirt style was a big hit in the 80s and now is found in even more stylish fabrics. Depending on the length and quality, this can be a really good way of showing off your figure by exaggerating it – it's a trick of the eye that Escher would have been proud of. These tulips often have a wide band around the base (which just about stops it from being a puffball) so it's not recommended for the slimmer ladies, as it's designed with curves in mind, and if there's a gap there, you won't have that sexy wiggle look at all!

, An eighties nightmare for those that had it the first time around, the puffball can really be seen as a fun wardrobe item! If you simply have to wear one for that 1980s party later, bear the length in mind. Often the waist can be very high without the necessary concession in length, and soon all Queen and country knows your secrets! And if you buy one on a whim and end up hating it - why not turn it into a funky handbag by sewing either side of the waist together and attaching a handle to the top?

, The pencil's roomier, more sensible cousin, a straight skirt can look subtly glamorous. Not too easy to translate to the evening but wonderful for a slim lady about town.

, A stretchy fabric maxi skirt can look super cool, especially with clunky boots and a denim jacket. But if you're a little curvier, look for a denser fabric that doesn't cling (even go up a size, if you can bear it!) or even a staggered, silky gypsy style. Watch out (especially in maxi dresses) for hidden in and out shapes around the hips. And don't get one that's too long because nobody likes to fall over.

, They're both stars of the 80s, both beloved by drag acts, and also, both a bit fishy. If you look back at some of the amazing 1950s evening silhouettes, you'll see the occasional fishtail, and depending on how it's carried out, it can look okay. But if it's too tight and you look like a mermaid that's tied at the knees, you'll be uncomfortable, annoyed, and need cutting out at the end of the evening. However, it can balance the width of your hips, in much the same way as flared trousers, drawing the eye elsewhere.

Clean your shoes before applying any additional substance.,
Select your oil.,
Read the label on your leather oil.Beware of leather oils which contain pine tar, castor oil, mineral oils, and other toxic chemicals.These ingredients might harm or cause the decomposition of your leather shoe.,
Apply the oil to your shoes.",How to Soften Leather Shoes1," Oil should not be used until after cleaning your shoes. To clean your shoes, use a damp cloth and lightly wipe away any grime or grit attached to the surface. Wipe them again with a dry cloth to ensure they are dry and ready to get oiled.






;
, Applying oils to your leather shoes will restore and nourish them, leading to softer shoes. There are many oils which can soften your leather shoes and prevent or reduce stiffness. Mink oil, saddle soap, coconut oil, and foot oil are all useful for softening leather shoes.Seek the aid of a qualified shoe repair professional to help you decide which kind of oil might be best for your shoes.
Olive oil has many adherents, but some report that it leaves oily spots behind and leads to deterioration of the leather., Carefully read the label before purchasing a particular leather oil.


Consult the sales staff from whom you purchased your leather shoes as to which oil is best for your shoes.

, Pour a bit of oil into a small, clean dish. Wrap two fingers with a clean cloth or torn-up t-shirt. Dab the wrapped fingers lightly in the oil of your choice. After dipping your fingers, lift them out of the oil and allow the excess to drip off. Then, bring your hand to the cleaned surface of your leather shoes and rub the oil into the surface of shoe with gentle, circular motions.









After applying one coat, let it absorb thoroughly into the shoe.
Depending on your shoe, you might need to wait several hours or a full day before applying another coat. If you can see your shoes are still oily, or feel greasy to the touch, let them continue to sit until the oil has done its work.
After the oil has been absorbed, evaluate the softness of the shoe. If you wish it to be softer, apply another coat in the same manner as the first and evaluate the softness again. Repeat as necessary.

Obtain some rubbing alcohol.Rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol is readily available at drug stores and supermarkets.,
Pour some alcohol into a small dish.,
Apply Vaseline to the shoe.Wherever you applied the alcohol, apply Vaseline.,
Use a curling iron on your shoes.",How to Soften Leather Shoes2," Don’t try to use regular alcoholic beverages to soften your leather shoes; you’ll only end up making them smell like booze.

, The amount you’ll need depends on your shoe. If you have a tall shoe or boot, you’ll need more than if you have a shoe that only extends to your ankle. Dip a cotton ball in the alcohol and rub it all over your leather shoe wherever exposed leather is visible. Remove the laces, if present, to apply the alcohol to the exposed leather on the tongue and on the inside of the shoe. Let it sit and dry for about thirty minutes., Use a small brush or an old toothbrush to work the Vaseline into the shoe. Apply the Vaseline in such a way that only a thin layer is left on the shoe. Let the shoes sit overnight. After allowing the shoes to sit and soften, wipe them down with a dry cloth to remove any excess Vaseline.


If your shoes have not as soft as you’d like after a single coat, repeat the process again until your shoes are as soft as you want them to be. Sometimes you’ll need to apply several coats to reach the level of softness you want.

, A variation of the above method involves skipping the alcohol altogether and going straight to the Vaseline-rubbing step. After doing so, instead of allowing the shoes to sit overnight, take a hot curling iron and move it slowly around inside the shoe. Start at the heal and work your way slowly down the sides of the shoe where you applied the Vaseline. The heat will help the pores of the leather open up and better absorb the thin layer of Vaseline you’ve applied.

Walk around in your shoes for half a day.One way to soften leather is to wear it.,
Wear the shoes again for just half a day two days later.And then wear them for another half day two days after that.,
Be patient.",How to Soften Leather Shoes3," Repeatedly wearing leather shoes will help them become more pliable. However, if you walk around in new leather shoes all day, they might start to hurt. You can minimize that chance by wearing them for just half a day, then swapping them for some more comfortable shoes.


If your feet start to hurt while wearing the shoes, take them off and swap them for another pair, even if you haven’t worn them the whole half-day.

, Continue wearing the new shoes every other day in half-day increments. When they feel softer, try wearing them for a full day. Continue to wear them as regularly as you wish thereafter.


Feet are sweaty. If you wear the shoes two days in a row when they’re new, they will not have time to adequately dry out, especially when they are new and still tight around your feet.

, Breaking in a new shoe can take time. Leather often requires a long break-in period in order to become as soft as you may want it to be.Thinner leathers like calfskin will likely soften more easily, but if your shoes have a lot of stitches and needlework, they will take longer to break in. You can speed up the softening process by wearing a pair (or two) of socks when walking about.

Take a look at the three places (other than home) you frequent most.,
If you expanded three to five, are there redundancies in what is expected?,
Take stock of your current shoe collection.,
Decide if there are holes in your shoe wardrobe that can be cheaply filled.,
In shoes, quality is more important than quantity.",How to Simplify a Shoe Wardrobe (for Men),"


What are the shoe expectations for those locales? If you answer work, gym, and mall, then perhaps you need a pair of dress shoes, athletic shoes, and casual shoes.;
,


If, say, church is your number four place, you may be expected to wear dress, or depending on denomination, casual shoes again.

, Reduce your collection down to essentials, if possible.


It is not necessary to own six pairs of athletic shoes, unless you have different athletic events that require specialized shoes (if you are in a soccer league, for example). A pair or two of cross training shoes (one for good, and one for bad weather) is all you need. You can replace an old pair if they get too worn, or demote your old ""outdoor runners"" to ""grass mowers"".
For dress shoes, black and medium to dark brown are often necessities for men in the office, and of course, belts to match help out a lot.
Remember, the more shoes you own, the more decisions you need to make about what shoes you will wear that day.

,


For men, Black and Brown Dress shoes, two pairs of athletic shoes (newer and older), and one or two pair of casual shoes may be the backbone of most wardrobes. If one lives in a snowy environment, he may purchase a pair of boots to offset the snow, as well.

,


Most medium to large cities will have at least one or two cobblers still in operation. Purchasing a $100 pair of dress shoes is expensive, but you can get them repaired or re-soled for around $30-$50.
Athletic shoes, if frequently used for the intended purpose, may wear quickly. Honestly assessing the condition of them, and placing them in a rank, will assist in cutting clutter. Think in a three-tiered system: Tier 1 is your newest pair, used for good weather or in the gym. Once they begin to show significant wear or damage, they can be demoted to Tier 2, which are used for outdoor running in bad weather conditions. Tier 3 shoes are relegated to grass-mowing or softball-practice duty...and should be discarded once a new pair of athletic shoes are purchased.
Casual shoes are often worn with jeans or shorts, and can allow some unique flair in a wardrobe. If dress shoes and athletic shoes cover most occasions, 2 pairs of causal shoes could be sandals and boat shoes, or leather flip-flops and upscale athletic shoes, or perhaps even cowboy boots for the urban cowboy. This is where your personal style can shine out.
Unique circumstances may dictate additional shoes, i.e., snowy weather determines a pair of boots, and a substantial time in the locker room may suggest a pair of cheap plastic flip-flops.

Determine your shoe needs and budget limits.,
Choose an evening or late afternoon to do your shoe shopping.,
Plan to spend at least an hour or two trying on shoes.,
Wear the right kind of socks or stockings, or bring some along, for the kind of shoes you are shopping for.,
When you get to the store, make friendly eye contact with the clerks.,
Find a style you like in the approximate size you wear.,
Try on the pair of shoes.,
Never buy a pair of shoes that aren't perfectly comfortable in the store!,
Find out about frequent buyer cards or promotions, but don't let that dictate your choice of shoes or the store.,
Remember that people look at your face and your smile much more than what you're wearing on your feet.",How to Shop for Shoes," In this case impulse purchases can be expensive. Remember that spending wisely on really good shoes rather than several less expensive, though trendy, pairs is usually a better investment of time and money.;
, Research shows that our feet swell a bit as the day goes on, and buying shoes later in the day will avoid getting shoes that are a half-size too small.

, Relax beforehand, maybe have a snack or a meal, while you plan your shopping adventure. If you can target an area that has several good shoe stores, so much the better!

, If dress shoes, thin trouser socks or stockings; if athletic shoes or boots, thicker, more absorbent socks. Sounds like common sense, but you'd be surprised how many people forget about this, and end up with shoes that don't fit!

, Someone will be more likely to help you get the shoes (if they are in the back) than if you don't.

, Remember that some European manufacturers use a different sizing system, and ask for help if you need it.

, How do they feel? Do they pinch anywhere? Try the next size up. Do they feel as if your feet are swimming in them? Try the next size, or half-size, down. Once you get a pair of shoes where there is no gap at the back of the heel, ask your feet if there is any pinching at the toes, either on top or on the sides. If so, put the shoes back and try another style. NEVER buy a pair of shoes that don't feel good firsthand, thinking that you will 'break them in' later on. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, that never happens. Once you find a style you really like, try to find duplicate pairs online. After all, shoes eventually wear out, and having extras of that perfect pair of shoes just makes sense. And so you can shop online for the exact same shoe, keep the original box or write down the style name, number, size and color so you have it for next time.

,!

, You really want high-quality shoes that are comfortable and will last you a few years, not just the latest style!

, Shoes should be comfortable first, so that you smile more, and fashionable second!

Make sure that no matter what type of shoe you buy, the upper part of the sole (where the balls of your feet are in relation) MUST be smooth.,
Look for flats with a little bit of arch support.,
Avoid heels.,
Get a pair of trainers.",How to Select Swing Dance Shoes," It doesn't have to be completely traction-less, bu you need to be able to spin 360 degrees in them without taking an extra step. If you are unable to do this yet or you're not a dancer, just go with the safest bet and find the smoothest sole possible. HOWEVER, it is equally important that the entire bottom of your shoe is not smooth. Try to find something with a little traction on the heel. Otherwise, you are going to slip and go flying.;
, Otherwise, your feet will be killing you the morning after a long night of dancing, trust me. Gel in insoles are cool if you feel like going that direction. Also very important: don't buy flats that could potentially slip off of your feet. A good way to test this (other than dancing, obviously) is to stand on your tip-toes and see if they feel loose. If they do, chances are they will come off, and that won't be fun. A way to troubleshoot an adorable pair of flats that don't look like they will stay on while dancing is to attach a piece of elastic on the top part of the shoe. This usually works, just make sure that it is firmly attached on both sides: I usually just staple it to the inside of the shoe, if they're not a pair of flats I care about. If you're more awesome than I am you can sew them on yourself, how's that for snazzy.

, Swing is often fast and involves some stylistic kicking, so if you're not careful you could remove your partners kneecaps. If this is not a deterrent for you though, wear low heels, with a thick, sturdy base. Lightweight though, this is important. It will hinder your dancing if you feel off balance and like your feet are abnormally heavy. As I mentioned above, make sure they are not going to fly off your feet (otherwise you run the risk of removing someone's eyeballs as well).

, These are where it's at. You don't have to worry about weight generally, or having them fly off of your feet. I highly recommend Keds brand, they are what I usually wear. Most trainers don't have super-smooth soles right when you buy them, but if you dance enough the traction beneath the balls of your feet should wear down pretty quickly. Plain white is awesome (and looks very professional), but there are a whole rainbow of colors just waiting for you.

Put your shoes on.,
Mark your laces.,
Cut the laces.,
Consider cutting length from middle of the lace.,
Wrap adhesive tape around the ends.,
Apply glue to the ends.,
Use heat shrink tubing.,
Melt the ends.,
Start at the bottom eyelets.,
Crisscross the laces.,
Tie your shoe.",How to Shorten Shoe Laces," While you can eyeball how much of the laces you want to cut off, it’s usually best to try on your shoes to see how much excess lace there is on each side. Tie your shoes as you normally would for the most comfortable fit, and take note of how long the laces are so you can decide how much you want to remove.When you’re trying to decide how much of the laces that you want to cut, think about how you prefer to tie your shoes. If you don’t want to double knot the laces, tie them normally and see how much of the length you’ll need to take off on each side.;
, You’ll need to know exactly where to cut the laces, so it helps to mark them at the right spot. Use a felt tip pen to draw lines on each end of the laces to indicate the excess that you want to remove.You can leave your shoes on when you mark the laces, but it’s often easier to use a ruler to determine how many inches you want to remove from each end with the shoes on and then remove the laces to mark them.
Shoelaces come in standard sizes, such as 30-, 40-, or 54-inches, so once you figure out how much excess there usually is on your shoes, you’ll know where to mark laces of the same length in the future.

, They’re usually fairly easy to cut, so any household scissors should do the trick. However, you’ll want to make sure that it’s a sharp pair to minimize fraying when you cut the laces. Follow the marks that you made to ensure that you cut at the right spot.Don’t cut all of the excess off one end of the lace. You’ll wind up with one finished end and one unfinished end, so they won’t match when you relace your shoes.

, Instead of trimming the excess from each end of the lace and having to finish the ends, you can opt to take out the extra length from the center. You'll wind up with two pieces that each have an aglet at one end, so you only have to tie them together to create a single lace.Try on the shoes, use a ruler to see how much extra there is on each side, add the numbers together, and cut that amount for the middle of the lace.
Tie the pieces of the lace together as tightly as possible, and secure it further by applying a small amount of instant glue to the knot and allowing it to dry. If there is any excess lace outside the knot, make sure to trim it away. You can also sew the two pieces together.

, Lay a piece of adhesive tape sticky side on a flat surface, and place the lace towards the center. Take your time rolling the tape tightly around the lace to form a sturdy, finished tip, also known as the aglet. If there is any excess lace protruding past the tape, trim it with scissors.To make the tip extra sturdy, you can place a couple of dots of glue beneath the end of the table before you seal it over the lace.
Finishing the ends with adhesive tape usually creates a tip that resembles plastic aglets on store bought laces well enough that you can get away with cutting the excess length off only one end of the lace if you prefer.

, Cover the tips of the laces with a small amount of glue, and as it starts to dry, press on the glue to help it absorb into the lace and reduce the thickness. Once the glue is completely dry, you can trim off any excess and apply another thin coat to increase the aglet’s durability and give it a smoother look.Don’t use “instant glue”, such as Krazy Glue, because it will bond with your skin, making it impossible to shape the end of the lace.
The best type of glue to use is one with an acetone-based solvent, such as Elmer’s Clear Household Cement or Tarzan’s Grip. They dry clear, and are waterproof, so they form ideal aglets.
If you don’t have any glue on hand, you can use clear nail polish in its place.

, Usually used to insulate electrical joints, the tubing is strong and flexible enough to work as effective aglets. You’ll need to cut the tubing lengthwise to match the size of most aglets, which is typically about a ½ inch. Slip a section over each end of the lace, and then hold the tubing over a candle, lighter, or other flame so the material can contract.Choose a diameter of tubing that will slip over the end of your laces. In most cases, 4 to 5 millimeter is a good fit.
When you’re placing the tubing over the ends of the lace, it often helps to twist it into place so you don’t wind up fraying the lace.
It doesn’t take much heat to shrink the tubing, so make sure to hold it a far enough distance from your flame. If it starts to smoke or bubble, it’s too hot.
If you have a small, travel-size hair straightening iron, you can use that to safely heat the tubing. Gently clamp it over the end for five to ten seconds to shrink the tubing and finish the laces.
Clear heat shrink tubing will provide the most similar look to factory-made aglets.

, If your laces are made of a synthetic material, you can actually melt the material itself to create a smooth, finished tip. Hold the end of the lace over a candle, match, lighter, or other flame to melt the material just enough to form a sealed edge.Make sure not to hold the lace too close to the flame, or you may light the entire lace on fire. It’s best to melt the lace over a sink in case a fire does occur.
Don’t touch the synthetic material of the lace once it starts to melt because it may stick to your skin.

, When you’re lacing your shoes, you should always begin with the eyelets closest to the toes. That allows you to pull the laces from one set of eyelets at a time to tighten them and provide the most comfortable fit. Push the tips of the laces through the pair of eyelets and adjust until the length is equal on both sides.Whatever method you use to finish the ends of your shortened laces, make sure you’ve give them proper time to dry or cool before lacing your shoes.
Many shoes features two rows of parallel eyelets, with one set closer to the shoe’s tongue and one further. For wide feet, use the eyelets closest to the tongue to provide more space for the foot. If you have narrow feet, lace the shoes through the eyelets furthest away from the tongue to bring up the shoe for a closer fit.

, While you can lace your shoes in a variety of ways, crisscrossing the laces over one another works well for most people. Once you’ve threaded the lace through the bottom eyelets, pull the right side across to place it through the next highest eyelet on the left side and do the same to the left to the right. Continue alternating all the way until the final set of eyelets.Crisscrossing your laces usually provides the most comfort because the shoelace crossover happens in the space between the two sides of the shoe, so they aren’t pressed against your foot.

, You should do it as normally would, but because you’ve shortened the lace, you shouldn’t need to double knot or tie the lace. When it’s knotted, you’ll be able to tell if you’ve trimmed it sufficiently.If you haven’t cut enough of the lace off, trim a little bit more and repeat the steps for finishing the tips.

Consider the color of the shoe.,
Since we are trying to create the look of longer legs you must go with a pointed toe on your shoes.,
Look for nice straps and detailing.",How to Shop for Shoes That Make Your Legs Look Longer (Women)," Every time our outfit has a transition to a new color it creates a visual break which can tend to make things appear shorter. For example wearing dark blue shoes that cover your ankles will create a line above your ankle which will make your leg appear shorter. But “I love those blue booties” you say? No worries just try to find some matching blue leggings to wear with them, that way the color will be the same from your toes up to where your skirt or dress start which will help create the illusion of longer legs. If you prefer to go without tights or leggings choose a nude color of shoe.;
, It will also help if you can find a pair that you like with an open top as this makes it appear that your leg starts lower down creating a longer appearance. Avoid rounded or square toes as this unfortunately has the opposite effect and could make your legs look stubby. It’s possible that you could make an open toe work for you but by sure to test them out in the mirror before heading out.

, As for straps across the ankle they should be avoided at all cost! They draw a visual break high up on the ankle and will definitely make your leg appear shorter. Also, bows, gems, feathers etc... anything else that creates a bulky look on the shoe should avoided as this will make the shoe look larger and make your legs appear shorter. Go for sleek lines and try to adopt the “less is more” philosophy when picking shoes out that will help make your legs look longer.

Don't let price be the sole criteria for your selection.",How to Pick the Right Shoes," Obviously, you will not want cowboy boots on if you are headed to the beach, but on the other hand, flip-flops are not appropriate in a pasture full of cattle. Here are some general suggestions for activities paired with suitable footwear:


Hiking: Low cut boots, or brogans, with sturdy uppers, good ankle support, traction soles, and sufficient arch support.
Cold-weather outdoor activities: Look for traction again, and consider insulated and possibly water repellent boots, especially if you expect to be walking in snow or slushy ice. Be sure the boots are large enough for a good pair of thick socks. You may want to consider more than one pair of socks, instead of insulated boots, since multiple layers will keep your feet warmer, but if the temperature rises during the day, you can remove a layer so that your feet don't sweat too much.
Athletic shoes: This is one of the most diverse lines of footwear, with specialized shoes for almost every sport, such as tennis, golf, basketball, soccer, skateboarding, and even bowling,so you will probably be better off talking to a knowledgeable sales person at a shoe store to find the most suitable type for a specific need.
Dress shoes: Here, style may be the primary concern, but you should consider how much walking will be involved in your plans, and choose shoes that are comfortable. For men, generally black or brown shoes will work with most business or evening attire, but ladies will most likely want to find a color and heel height which compliments their apparel.;
, Our feet carry a load with each step we take, day in and day out, and the arch of the foot is a mechanical marvel that acts as both a shock absorber and balancing mechanism, and being sure to keep it supported will help maintain its health.

, Soft soled shoes are generally quieter and more comfortable than stiff, inflexible soles. Some very hard soled shoes will mark hard surfaced flooring like vinyl composition tiles, and in some instances, such as hospital environments, the tapping of hard soles can be disturbing to people in the workplace, as well as patients.

, Most shoes are traditionally made from leather, but there are many grades and types of leather, and each has its own distinct characteristics. Suede don't require polishing, as do patent leathers, and very fancy shoes may be made from exotic animal skins, even alligator or ostrich skin. Many people are reluctant or refuse to wear any shoes or clothing made from animal products, so synthetic materials or natural fibers will be their preference.

, This means looking at the length and width, and here, there is no substitute for the help of an experienced shoe salesman. Not all feet are created equal, and many people find that their feet are not symmetrical, which may even mean buying a different sized shoe for each foot.

, Heels of women's shoes are often raised in the thought that the lift will make them look more graceful, or thinner, but if this is accomplished at the expense of comfort, or even the health of her feet, it may not be a wise choice.

, Double row stitching on the uppers, sealed seams with gussets, reinforcing rivets, and Goodyear Welt construction are indications of well made, durable shoes or boots.

, Put both shoes on, lace them up, and stand in them for a few moments. Wiggle your toes to make sure they have sufficient space to keep them from being cramped. Walk around a little bit to get a feel for the balance. Look at them critically to see if they are right for you. Get the opinion of the salesperson and any friends who may be accompanying you on your shopping trip.

, Cheap shoes will not last as long, or be as good for your feet, as will more expensive, better quality ones.

Going outside to spray your shoes is the best option if the weather is good. Otherwise, go into a garage or open the windows in the room.Keep your kids and pets away while you spray your shoes.;
, Since Scotchgard protects fabric by creating a waterproof seal, you don’t want to get it on things besides your shoes. Cover your floor or table with old newspapers or a large cloth of some kind. If you spray the shoes outside, no covering is necessary., Leaving your shoestrings in the shoes will create a zigzag pattern on the tongues of your shoes. Take them out so the tongue is totally exposed. Spray the shoestrings separately from the shoes if you wish.

, The front edges of your shoes most likely cover the edges of the tongue. By pushing the tongue down into the shoe a little bit, you’ll uncover the whole tongue so it gets sprayed.

, The contents of the can tend to settle over time, meaning it’s not mixed as well as it needs to be. Shake the can for about 10 seconds to completely mix it up again. It will still spray even if you don’t shake it, but it won’t coat the shoes as well., Scotchgard can cause colors to fade in some fabrics. To check this, spray a small spot inside the shoes and rub the spot with a white rag. If the color comes off the shoes, it’s best not to use Scotchgard on them.Most fabrics that can be washed can be protected with Scotchgard. If the shoes have the “X” symbol, like some clothing, don’t use Scotchgard.
For suede shoes, be sure you are using Scotchgard Suede & Nubuck Protector. Don’t use Scotchgard on leather shoes.

, Spray the shoes with a light mist that covers them completely. If you hold the can too close, it will saturate the shoes and not cover them well. Holding the can beyond 12 inches (30.5cm) will make the spray miss the shoes too much., Press the button that releases the spray. As you mist the shoes with the Scotchgard, move the can in a sweeping motion. Make sure that you cover the shoes completely, except for the rubber soles., After spraying the shoes, let them sit right side up for a few minutes. This gives the Scotchgard time to soak into the shoes and dry completely. Set a fan blowing on the shoes to speed the drying time.

, One coat of Scotchgard may be enough to give your shoes plenty of protection. On the other hand, if you really want total waterproofing, apply one or two more coats of Scotchgard. You don’t want to totally saturate the shoes, but spray them again as you did the first time.

, To make sure that the protectant has fully set into the shoes, leave them to dry for a full day. Since fumes from the Scotchgard may linger, leave the shoes outside or in your garage. Make sure they won’t get wet, though."

Take them for a test walk!",How to Make Shoes," If you're planning on making a shoe, it's undoubtedly important you have some idea what kind of shoe you would like to make. Shoes are incredibly diverse, and there are plenty of types you can make, not limited to loafers, sneakers, sandals, boots and high heels. Try to imagine what kind of shoe style would suit your individual style the most.


It may be helpful to sketch out a few ideas. Manifesting your ideas with an illustration can come a long way towards planning out your shoe.
If you're new to shoe making, it's probably best to stick to something simple. A basic laced shoe goes without some of the finesse of more complicated types, and you can still add plenty of flair to a basic formula.;
, Before you think about making your shoe, it's important you have an accurate and well-detailed set of plans to work on. After all, you don't want to be making design decisions on the go; shoemaking is a very precise business, and the slightest mishap could keep the shoe from turning out well.


Basic shoe templates are available on the internet. Do a search and look up some 'recipes'. If nothing else, it might give you inspiration for your own design. Online art outlets like www.etsy.com may have more elaborate shoe templates for sale.
Designing your own is only recommended if you've made a shoe before. If that's what you're ultimately looking to do, try stitching together something basic with a free template, and put that experience towards making your own the second time around.

, You can save yourself a lot of time and give your shoes a more professional look if you harvest parts from other shoes you don't use anymore. In particular, shoe soles are good as they'll give you a reference for the rest of your stitching. Provided they're in good enough shape, you should salvage the parts you think might work in your new shoe, taking care to remove them slowly and carefully with a scalpel knife.

, While specific lists of ingredients will depend on the certain type of shoe you're looking to make, it generally goes without saying that you'll want a few sheets of good leather and a firm fabric.


If you don't have a sewing and stitching kit, you'll need to buy or borrow one to make your shoes.
Rubber, leather and fabrics are all good for the chassis of the shoes.
While its recommended that shoe soles be taken from old shoes or bought as pre-fabricated supplies, you can make a functional and waterproof sole using a few sheets of cork. Each sheet need not be more than 1/8 inches thick.
Remember to get at least twice as much as you think, so you'll have enough to make a pair!

, A last is a block in the shape of a human foot shoemakers use to guide their work. To do this, you'll want to make a cast mould of your foot; that way, the shoes you'll be making will be custom-fitted for you personally. Get a box filled with an alginate jelly and place your foot in, ideally up to the ankle. Let your foot rest for 20 minutes while the jelly solidifies, then slowly remove your foot. Make sure to remove your foot slowly; you don't want to damage anything once it solidifies.
It's highly recommended you do this for both feet at the same time. The idle time is best to get over with early on in the process.
One positive thing to mention about this step in the process is that you can ideally reuse these lasts fir each subsequent pair of shoes you try to make. Make a point of keeping them somewhere safe, where they don't run the risk of being broken.

, Now that there's a proper mould of your foot, you can pour casting material into it. Depending on the type and quality of casting material, the solidifying time could take anywhere from half an hour to overnight. Be patient-- it may be a good time at this point to work on other parts of the process if your plans are settled enough.

, Once the last has solidified, it's time to take it out and get it ready. Cover your last with a colourless masking tape. That will keep it from being damaged as easily, and you'll be able to draw your designs directly on the last.


Outline your design on the last itself. Before you get to putting the pieces together, you'll probably find it helpful to give the last an outline of what you want the shoe to look like around it. While you shouldn't rely on it for concrete measurements, having an idea of what it will look like in three dimensions will help as you're figuring out where each stitch should go.

, Using your template or personal design, cut each necessary section of fabric or leather out using a surgical knife or scalpel. You may find it helpful to use a ruler or protractor to help you with the incisions.


While cutting your pattern, you should leave at least an inch of extra material along the bottom edge of the shoe, as well as a centimetre or so, where the different pieces of the upper join together. This will be your seam allowance.

, A fluid stitch is one of the most skill-testing parts of making your own shoe. Be meticulous and slow as you're piecing it together; while it may be easier to go faster, bad stitching will certainly show in the final product, and your shoe won't look as good as it should Try to get the stitches as close to the end of each piece of fabric as you can. Overlaps might leave unnecessary ridges on the shoe. If you intentionally cut your pieces to be slightly bigger than necessary for the sake of having stitching space, remember to take that into account. You don't want to end up with a shoe that's too big, or too small for the sole.


While fabric won't be any problem to stitch through, you may have an issue with leather. Leather is notoriously sturdy, and you won't be able to stitch it fluidly. Rather, it's recommended you punch holes in it before connecting it to your other pieces.

, Eyelets are the holes you'll need to fix your laces through. Chances are your shoe design will use these. Evenly space the eyelets apart from one another (just less than an inch, in most cases) and offer enough of them (4-5) to encase most of the laces. If you're the DIY type, you can make these incisions with a scalpel easily enough. If you're going for a more professional-looking product however, there are specific eyelet-making tools you can order from a specialty outlet.

, If you purchased a pre-fabricated sole or nabbed a pair from old shoes, you won't need to worry about this step. If you're trying to make a purely homemade set of shoes however, picking up a few sheets of cork is your best bet. Cork has a comfortable amount of cushion, and it's waterproof.


If you have the fabric stitched together already, you can use that as a point of reference while making your incisions, although you should ultimately rely on the empirical measurements laid out in your template.
Your last should come in handy here as well. Cut the sole out of the cork sheet, leaving a little extra space around the last so your foot will ultimately have some breathing room.
If you're wanting some extra cushion and height, you can add a second or even third layer of cork to your sole. Just cut it out in the exact same dimensions, and superglue the layers together.
Give the glued cork soles some time to solidify once you've finished gluing them.
You can make a shoe heel by adding an extra layer to the posterior third of the sole.

, It's recommended you pick up a shoe-specific adhesive to glue your fabric to the sole. Apply the glue slowly and evenly. This will maximize the waterproof seal for your shoe, and keep it sturdy. If your blueprint suggests any additional stitches, do those as well.


Make use of the last inside the shoe as you're putting it together. It will make a great point of reference and support while you're getting the tricky stitches done.
If you're a real pro with stitches, don't be afraid to spice up your stitching style. Stitches themselves can be an interesting aesthetic tool. If you're feeling more daring than the rest of us, you can experiment with irregular stitching patterns, so long as they're fundamentally sturdy enough to do their practical job.

, By this point, you should have relatively functional shoe. Add laces through the eyelets if you haven't already. To make the shoe look as good as it can be, you'll want to trim the excess fabric. If there are some really ugly seam marks on the shoe, you can add a new layer of leather or fabric to cover it up. Now that you have the body of the shoe, you can start thinking about adding more aesthetic flair to it.

, It's generally assumed you'll want to make two shoes to wear at the same time. After the basics of the first shoe are done, it's time to move onto the second. Keep in mind that you're not wanting to make a copy, but a mirror image of your original shoe. Try to keep it looking as close to the first as you possibly can. Any possible slip ups you made on the first will look worse if they're not reflected on the other shoe.


If you were frustrated making the first shoe, you should find making the second is a lot more enjoyable.

, A leather-based shoe will own  with its own natural waterproofing abilities, but you're going to want to do everything you can to make sure water isn't able to get in. Getting a relatively inexpensive sealant spray and give your shoes a thorough going-over is a smart idea, especially if you live in a wetter part of the world. , Let's face it; most of the time you're making something from home, it's because you want to put your own unique spin on it. You have plenty of chance to do so even after the shoe is made. Taking a leather paint and adding an inventive design to the sides of the shoes is a fun and effective way to add style to your creation. There are countless ways you can stylize your shoes. Look online for some ideas if you're in need of inspiration. , Now that your spiffy creations are finally finished, it's time for the defining moment of trying them on and putting them to use. Try walking down the hallway or the street and get a hang for the way they feel. Are they comfortable? Do you think they could keep out water if you accidentally stepped in a puddle? If this is your first time making shoes, it's perfectly normal for there to be issues. If you're not satisfied with the end result, you can always put the expertise you've gained to good use and make another pair. If it's just the insole that's uncomfortable, you can buy gel-based insoles (like Dr. Scholl's) to give your feet some much-welcomed cushion.

Decide if comfort is a priority.,
Choose between insulated or uninsulated boots.,
Decide if you need waterproof boots.,

Weigh fashion versus function.Sometimes the cutest boots are not the most comfortable or sensible, but they are the right boots for you.,

Buy at the end of the season.",How to Pick the Perfect Pair of Snow Boots," Are you planning on trudging long distance through the snow on a regular basis, or are you going to use the snow boots rarely and for short periods of time? Decide how comfortable they need to be based on how they will be used.


If you are going to use these boots a lot you may want to invest more money in them.
If you are only going to use them sporadically, maybe you can buy a less comfortable, and thus probably less expensive, pair.;
, You want your feet to be warm enough while tromping through the snow, but not too warm. Take into consideration what temperature it will be when you wear the boots and how warm you like your feet to be.There may be some boots that come with removable linings so that you can increase the insulation of the boots. Look for this option if it interests you.
Sometimes you need less insulation because of how active you will be when wearing the boots. If you are going to be very active, for instance if you are going to be snow shoeing for hours on end, you need to take the amount of heat your body will produce into account when picking a level of insulation.

, Most people will want waterproof snow boots, so that their feet don't get wet. However, there are different levels of waterproofing. The most watertight boots tend to be less stylish than other boots that aren't designed to be used in very wet conditions. However, there are plenty of boots available that are semi-waterproof and quite attractive.


If the boots are only water-resistant, not waterproof, you should consider getting an extra liner to switch to if the first gets wet. If the boot dries quickly you can use another liner while the first one dries.

, Taller boots will also give you more ankle support. On the other hand, a shorter boot will give you more flexibility of movement and the boots will be easier to put on and take off.


Fairly tall boots will ensure that your whole foot and ankle are protected from the snow.
There are some tall-ankled boots that are actually quite flexible and some that are not. If you want a boot that covers your ankles but is still flexible, be sure to prioritize that functionality.

, In other cases you will decide to get the most comfortable boots even though they are not very attractive.


If you can't find the perfect boots that are cute, comfortable, and well made, then you will need to make some decisions about what aspect is most important to you.
Try to find a pair that looks good. You want relatively attractive snow boots because in the winter you may be wearing inside buildings as well as outdoors.

, It can be hard to order snow boots without trying them on because they can fit a little different than normal shoes. If you are trying on a bunch of snow boots it's best to start trying on boots in your regular size. This will give you an idea right off the bat whether you can stick with that size or whether you need to move up or down a size.


Boot sizing can vary dramatically. Some boot manufacturers vary their sizes based on the assumption that you will wear thick socks in their boots.
The variation in snow boot sizes is why is can be difficult to buy them online. However, if you need to buy some online without trying them on first, consult the manufacturers sizing guide and follow that. You should also make sure you are ordering from a seller that offers free exchanges, including the seller paying for shipping, just in case you need to switch to a different size.

, Do you want to be able to easily take the boots on and off? Or do you want them to be very secure when you are wearing them, so that you won't have to worry about trudging through deep snow? Your decision should be based on how you are planning on using the snow boots.If you are doing an active sport in your snow boots, then you probably want them to be very secure on your feet.
If you are using your snow boots for quick trips out of the house, for instance just to take the garbage out, then you probably want a boot that can slip more easily on and off.

, You need to figure out what size will work best for you, whether it is your normal size or not. It may be that you want the same size boots as you wear in regular shoes. However, you may want to get a size up if you want to wear thick socks with your boots.


When it comes to snow boots, err on the side of them being too large if you think you might need to wear thick socks. It's better to have a little extra room than too little room.
Don't be afraid to buy a size larger or smaller than you normally wear. After all, shoe sizes are only there to guide toward a shoe that fits your feet perfectly.

, Don't be bamboozled by the brand name. Many times people don’t make the right decision in choosing a pair of snow boots because of the brand name or the style of the boot. Unfortunately, this can have an effect on your feet when walking in the snow.


For example, shearling boots are very popular and trendy boots currently. They're made with the finest sheepskin for comfort and warmth but they're not made for the snow. These boots may be very thick and warm, but they're not water resistant and are easily stained by the salt and snow.
However, there are some brand name boots that are known for their quality. Boot makers that have high quality goods may be the best known for a reason. You need to do your research and figure out if a brand name is all hype or if they are the best of the best.

, It is a good idea to shop around for the best deal when buying snow boots. Check the price at local stores as well as online. The perk of getting the boots locally is that you can probably get them right away and you won't have to pay for shipping. The perk of buying snow boots online is that you may have more options to choose from and they may be cheaper.


Make sure that you are comparing the exact same boots when shopping around. Slightly different styles may have different costs and different qualities.
Even if you want to try the boots on in a store, it doesn't mean that you have to buy them there. Try them on in the store to figure out what size works for you, or to figure out if they fit you well at all, and then buy them where you can get them cheapest. This may very well be online.

, If you are buying a quality pair of boots they should be guaranteed for life from manufacturing defects. This means that if the stitching fails or the fabric splits, they will repair your boots or send you a new pair.


Some damage to boots will probably not be covered by a guarantee. If the damage is caused by something that the boots are meant to withstand, then you may have to pay for replacements. For example, it you accidentally run over them with your car, the manufacturer will probably not repair them for free.
Boots that have good guarantees are usually more expensive. However, think of the cost as an investment and remember that instead of buying a new pair every year, you may be able to use these boots for years into the future.

, Snow boots are usually more expensive when everyone goes to buy them at the beginning of winter. If you plan ahead, however, you can get a much better deal.


Try buying your snow boots in early spring, when stores are trying to get rid of all their winter gear. Prices could be much, much lower than they were a few months earlier.Look for discontinued styles as well. These could be even cheaper!

Understand that babies do not need to wear shoes if they have not yet begun to walk.,
Buy your baby a pair of good shoes once he begins to walk.",How to Put Shoes on a Baby1," Rigid shoes that do not allow your baby’s feet to move around can actually hurt your baby’s feet and inhibit them from developing correctly if he has not begun to walk yet. Before your baby begins walking, he really only needs a pair of non-slip socks or booties to get around in. Aside from keeping his feet warm in the cold weather, the only other reason to put shoes on a non-walking baby would be to complement his outfit and add to his style.;
, Your baby’s first pair of shoes should be a strong, yet flexible shoe that has a good grip for walking. These shoes will help to protect your baby’s feet and give them the room they need to grow and develop properly. Your baby’s balance will not be perfect when he or she is beginning to walk, so a good pair of shoes with non-slip soles is very important because falls will happen.


When buying your baby’s first shoe, also be sure to thoroughly check how well the shoe fits before you leave the store. Have your baby stand up in the shoe to make sure he has enough room for his foot to expand and move about freely. Also check to ensure that the shoe does not slide up and down on the back of the foot because this may cause the shoe to rub excessively against the surface of his skin, which can give your baby blisters.
It will be easier to find the right fit if you shop for your baby’s shoe in the afternoon or early evening. Your baby’s feet can swell up later in the day so if you buy shoes early in the day, the shoes may not fit properly later in the evening.

Look for shoes that look like they have good workmanship.,
Specifically for online purchases...make sure the sellers stands behind their product.",How to Recognize Quality Khussa," Many manufacturers will use inferior leather for the uppers of the khussa and some use poor quality leather for the entire shoe. To avoid this, the uppers should not be a different color leather than the soles. The shoe should look stiff, not floppy (good khussa leather starts off very stiff and then breaks in to conform to your foot). The leather should appear thick, not thin. Poor quality leather can be bad for sensitive skin and can take on an offensive odor over time.;
, Khussa are often referred to as Indian shoes, but they are made in India, Pakistan, and China. Pakistan is widely recognized as providing the best quality handmade khussa shoes. Leather is cleaned with a process using salt; Pakistan has huge supplies of salt and uses it liberally. Salt is very expensive in India and is used sparingly to clean leather. Pakistan is also world-renowned for their quality hand stitching (many high end shoes are made in Pakistan, as are sports balls, including the world's best soccer balls). Stitching techniques are passed down through families for many generations. Chinese khussa are normally very low quality and cheaply made.

, If the shoe looks slapped together, it probably is slapped together. Are there plenty of close-up pictures?

, Will they be there for you after the sale to answer questions? Do they have a return policy (does it allow returns if you get the wrong size)? Does the return policy cover shipping? If not, how much is their shipping? Is there a restocking fee? Are they easy to contact?

Put your baby’s shoes on gently.,
Continue to gently slide the shoe onto your baby’s foot, guiding his toes up to the top of the shoe.,
Check your baby’s foot once the shoe is on.",How to Put Shoes on a Baby2,"


You will need to uncurl your baby’s foot gently before you begin to put the shoe on.
If your child will be wearing sneakers, put a pair of socks on your baby first. Make sure that the socks you choose will not be too hot and will help your baby’s feet breathe. Cotton and cotton blends work well to prevent overheating.
You will need to gently slide the shoe onto your baby’s foot. It is important to make sure that you do not pinch the skin of the foot, as this will not only hurt but can also leave red marks on your baby’s foot.

, Try to stabilize his foot with one hand while you slip the shoe on with in the other. If your baby is resisting, he may stiffen his foot and try to curl his toes upwards. Gently stroking his foot while sliding the shoe on can help him to relax and relax his foot.

, When you have finished putting the shoe on your baby, check to make sure that the shoe fits him correctly. You don’t want the shoe to fit too tightly, however, you don’t want it to fit too loosely either. If the shoe is either too tight or too loose, it can cause your baby to develop painful blisters on his feet. If the shoe is too tight, it can interfere with your baby’s foot receiving the proper circulation that it needs. Be sure to check your child’s foot regularly and watch for signs of redness and irritation.

Check for flat feet and also watch for how your child turns his feet when he is walking.,
Know that your baby may develop minor foot problems as well.",How to Put Shoes on a Baby3,"


Your child will be born with flat feet and will not develop an arch until later on. It is important to make sure that your child has developed a proper arch by the time he reaches the age of three.
Some children also turn their feet inward or outward when first learning to walk. Your child will most likely correct this on his own as walking becomes more second nature to him. However, if this condition does not correct itself, you may need to take your child to a foot specialist.

, It is important to check your baby’s foot often for minor foot problems such as blisters and athlete’s foot. Blisters and athlete’s foot can occur if your baby’s shoes do not fit properly. This is true even in young babies who are not yet walking.


Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection that can cause a rash and is most likely to occur if your baby’s foot is too damp because of sweating.
Blisters are usually caused by your baby’s shoes continuously rubbing against his foot. If your baby does develop blisters, it may be a good idea to have them checked out by your pediatrician, as blisters can also be caused by hand, foot and mouth disease. This is a very common viral infection that can also cause your child to have a small fever.
Be sure to check your baby for ingrown toenails and warts that can grow on his or her feet. Warts can develop from not wearing proper footwear at swimming pools and other public places.

Be careful matching the color to the dress or outfit; this can easily look overdone. A complementary contrast is often preferable.
Know the pageant rules about shoes in advance. Read these before going out to purchase the shoes, just in case they have specific height or style requirements.;
, While most high heels are going to be the same size as your usual shoe size, it's important to try the shoes on before buying them. Slight variations in sizing within different brands can mean all the difference between comfort and pain. Ask for a sizing from the retailer, then begin looking for the shoe.

, This requires wearing them indoors for a few days in a row, at selected times of the day, and giving your feet breaks in between. This gives the shoes time to stretch and mold to your feet. (See below for a suggested walking approach.)


Sit down when putting on high heels.
If the shoes aren't breaking in well, there are some processes you can use to help to speed this up; you'll find extra help in the article How to break in high heel shoes.
Return the shoes if they aren't breaking in as they should and they're uncomfortable. In case this is needed, it is advised that you walk only on carpet indoors, so as to avoid scuffing the soles.

, Stand up carefully, placing your weight against something through holding or leaning onto it. For example, a wall or a chair-back. While leaning on this object, take tiny steps forwards and backwards, to help you get used to walking with these heels on.

, Each day, try to use the wall less and less until you are able to balance on your heels and walk by yourself without anything supporting you. When you walk, make sure to stand up straight with good posture because this is how you will need to walk during the pageant.


More advice on walking in high heels can be found at How to walk in high heels.

, If you are using your own clothing, combine it with the shoes. This will allow you to get a feel for the movement of both clothing and shoes together, allowing you to practice what it will feel like at the event. It will also alert you to any potential snags, such as a long dress getting caught on the heels, and so forth.

, For example, walk on stairs or steps, walk on different floor textures and walk on a slippery area (with great care), just in case you will encounter any of these floor types and differing levels.

, This will reassure you that you are comfortable with the heels on, and your outfit. Walk down a length of floor and also walk on steps or stairs, just in case. This practice will not only provide confidence but aids your muscle memory too.

, Every little bit helps but be careful not to err and fall over.

, When you're on stage, it's your time to shine. Walk with your head held high, and work it! The judges will most likely give you the best score if you look like you know what you're doing. Just do your absolute best and all of that practice will pay off in the long run.

, Try to get plenty of rest the night before the party. That way, you’ll be able to stay up late if it’s a late night party. Even if it’s a daytime party, you still want to have the energy to be sociable and feel your best.Some people will drink coffee or another caffeinated beverage before going out for a late night party.
Eat a protein-packed meal before going out. Even if there will be food at the party, you don’t want to arrive starving.

, Listening to some of your favorite music is the perfect way to get excited about a party. It can get you energized and ready to dance, or just put you in a good mood.You can listen to music while you’re getting dressed, or while you’re driving to the party!
Sing along. You’ll feel confident and expressive, which is a great way to feel when you arrive at a party.

, Think about who will be at the party and how you want to interact with them. This can be especially useful if you’re shy or don’t go out very much. You can make small goals, such as, “I will talk to two new people,” or “I will introduce myself to my new coworker that I have a crush on.”You can even practice in the mirror if you’re really shy. Practice introducing yourself to someone by saying, “Hi, I’m ___. How do you know the host?”
Think of topics you can talk about with other guests. Do you follow current events? Have you been working on an interesting project? Can you share a humorous story about the host?

, Usually, it’s assumed that people will arrive at a party a little bit after it’s supposed to start. This is called being “fashionably late.” If you’re shy, you may want to arrive well after the party has started so that you can avoid having to make conversation if there are only a couple of people there early on.For dinner parties, children’s parties, or parties where a space has been rented for the occasion, aim to arrive on time. Being late to these kinds of parties can be considered rude.

, You’ll want to plan your outfit at least partly based on what type of party it is. For example, you wouldn’t wear the same outfit to a cocktail party that you would to a Memorial Day barbecue. Choose something that’s appropriate to the occasion but that you feel comfortable and good in.Look at the invitation for clues about what to wear. Some invitations may say something like, “black tie optional” or “space-age theme!”
If the invitation doesn’t indicate what to wear, you can call or email the host to find out what’s appropriate. You can also ask things such as, “Will the party be indoors or outdoors?” if you’re concerned about the weather.
If you don't know what to wear, there are books and websites that can help you decide based on the occasion.


, Even for formal parties and gatherings, there is a spectrum of what is expected. The event might be semi-formal, business formal, white tie, black tie, black tie optional, or creative black tie. Find out which style is appropriate for the event before you choose your outfit.Black tie implies that women will wear long evening gowns and men will wear black tuxedos.
White tie indicates that women should wear long evening gowns and men should wear a black dress coat (tailcoat), with matching pants that have a single stripe of satin or braid in the US. In Europe or the UK, they should have two stripes.
Business formal implies that both men and women should wear suits.
Creative black tie means that women can wear shorter dresses, such as cocktail dresses. Men may wear more whimsical or trendy items, such as colorful cummerbunds.

, A casual get together may be truly casual, such as a neighborhood potluck or barbecue. It can also be ""business casual"" which is very different. Dress appropriately for however casual the event will be.


For men, business casual can mean going without a suit jacket, or wearing dark jeans instead of suit pants.For women, dressy casual means wearing nice shoes such as heels or classy flats with a tailored shirt and dressy pants or a nice skirt.For a truly casual party, wear something you feel comfortable in and that you're excited to show off to a larger social group.

, Kids are sometimes invited to adult parties, such as wedding receptions or holiday parties. However, they're most often invited to parties with and for other children. Even as a kid, you want to dress appropriately for the occasion.


For another kid's birthday, it's usually appropriate to wear the same kind of thing you'd wear to school or to the park. You want to be comfortable and wear something that you might spill soda or ice cream on.
For a holiday party or another more formal gathering, kids should wear clothing that reflects the style of the party. Boys should wear suits and girls should wear fancy dresses.
If there will be swimming or other kinds of water fun at the party, bring a bathing suit!

, Parties are sometimes held outside.This can be true of barbecues, weddings, garden parties and more. Make sure to dress appropriately for the occasion while keeping the weather in mind.If it's a summer event, dress in light clothes. You don't want to sweat through your outfit or feel overheated.
If the event is during a colder month, wear a coat or sweater. Make sure it goes well with your outfit in case you end up needing to wear it during the party for any reason.
For holiday parties, be sure to dress festively, emphasizing holiday colors.

, Whether or not your friends will be attending the party, they probably have good ideas of what would be appropriate. Ask one or two friends whose opinions you trust.You can even post a photo of your outfit on social media to get your friends' opinions!

, Everyone has different routines for before they go out. Do whatever makes you feel fresh and confident. Start with a shower and then complete any other grooming routines you need to do.Brush your teeth.
Do your hair and makeup if you wear it.
You may want to shave.
You may want to clean or polish your nails. Or, you may have had those professionally done earlier in the day or week.
Parties are great opportunities for perfume or cologne. Wearing a scent can give you a little extra boost of confidence.

, Now that you’re clean and feeling fresh, you can put on the clothes you’ve already laid out. Check yourself out in the mirror and make sure everything fits the way that you imagined. Take the time you need to make sure the outfit is comfortable enough to wear throughout the party.Make any changes that you think you need. You don’t want to feel uncomfortable or unconfident at a fun party.
Make sure your footwear and accessories (if you have any) will go well with your outfit. Try it all on together. Make sure your shoes are appropriate for the party. You don’t want to wear sneakers to a fancy gala, or high heels to a bowling party.
You may want to bring a jacket, scarf, or umbrella, depending on the weather.

, You’ll want to bring your phone, some money, and your ID to the party. You may also bring other things, depending on the type of party. However, make sure you have whatever you’ll need for the night.You’ll want enough money to get home, even if you need to pay for an expensive cab ride at the last minute.
If the party is going to be very big and you might be dancing or putting your bag down, you may only want to bring the bare necessities. That way, you don’t have to keep track of a bulky bag and you don’t risk losing your entire wallet if the party gets a little crazy.

, Going to a party is always more fun with friends. Find out if other friends are going and ask what their plans are. They may want to travel together, have dinner beforehand, or make other plans with you.If the party has an online invitation, you may be able to see who’s been invited and who’s going.
Be sensitive when asking if a friend is going. Remember that they may not have been invited and might not even know about the party.

, Some parties are small and by invitation only. However, some parties are given with the idea that the more people come, the more fun the party will be. If the party is open to all, ask a friend or two if they’d like to join you.With more intimate parties, hosts often expect that invited guests will bring one person who is their date. Check with the host if this is the case, and invite a date to come with you if appropriate.
If you’re not sure whether it’s okay to invite others to the party, ask the host.
Let your friend know what to expect. For example, if the party has a theme or a dress code, make sure your friend knows so that they can dress appropriately.

, You need to know how you’ll get to and from the party. If you plan to drink alcohol at the party, this is especially important, since you’ll want to have a designated driver or a plan that includes public transportation, a cab, or another safe means of getting home.Check with your friends about their plans. Does one of them want to be the designated driver? Does one of them live within walking distance of the party? If so, maybe you could crash on their couch afterward.
Check the public transportation schedule if you plan to use it. If the party goes late, make sure that you’ll still be able to make the last bus or train.
Keep the phone number for a taxi service with you in case you end up needing it.
Clarify with friends if you’ll aim to all leave the party together or not. Do this before the party starts so that if you lose track of each other at the party, you already know what the plan is.

Buy a pair of cheap canvas shoes.,
Go online and find some space pictures.,
Obtain some acrylic paint.",How to Make Space Shoes1," Make sure the shoes are a solid color. Converse, Vans, and Keds work great for this project, but you can use any shoes you'd like.









White works well as it's a good canvas for any color, but black offers a natural space template to work off of, too. Colors show up less well on black, but you don't necessarily have to paint the entire shoe evenly to cover the material.;
, Print them out and use them as templates when you get down to business with your shoes. They'll give you ideas and make your shoes look a little more convincing, apart from just visually pleasing.








, If you don't have some already, you can find them fairly cheaply at craft stores. You'll probably want blue, purple, pink, white, and possibly some metallic colors (if you're staying authentic). However, all the colors of the rainbow exist in the universe, so go crazy with your imagination if that's more down your alley.









While you're at it, get a paint tray!

"
"
Gather your materials.,
Line the soles of your shoes with tape.,
Take out the laces.,
With sponges, start painting on the base colors.,
Add detail to the shoes.,
Add the stars.,
Dry your shoes for about an hour.,
Put your laces back in.








,
Sport those bad boys around the town!",How to Make Space Shoes2," It's time to get started! Lay down some newspaper on the floor, grab your shoes, turn on some music and sit down to start creating. You'll need:









Masking tape
Your paints
Sponges (one for each color, ideally)
Paintbrushes
Paint tray
Water

, This is to keep any paint from getting on them. You could risk it, but tape will give you a nice, symmetrical (clean!) line when you're finished.









If you don't have masking tape, electrical, painter's, or medical tape work well too.

, You know how to do that part, right?








, This is where a tutorial can't really guide you -- you'll have to decide where which colors go and how much color to put on. The important thing to do is to start with dark colors, end with light colors, and to blend them together. Experiment with combining colors, too, to produce gradients.









White can be used to provide a hazy effect, like the Milky Way.
If you're using black shoes, you may need to use a thin layer of white as a primer to make your colors show up more intensely (especially the lighter colors, like pink).

, A good way to create details is to paint as normal then blot with a paper towel to create a softer look. Continue adding details around the shoes, using whatever method you think looks best.








, Using a toothpick, toothbrush, or small paintbrush, flick little specks of white paint onto your shoes. To avoid creating a masterpiece all over your floor, hold your device just a few inches away from your shoes. If you mess up, just rub it in! Tada, cloud! But when it comes to the universe, there's very little ""messing up.""









It may be necessary to mix the white paint with a bit of water -- acrylic paint can be a little thick and hard to flick.
Once you are done with your stars, leave the shoes out where no one can mess with them and let them dry for a day or so.

, Grab a blow dryer and blast the shoes to speed up the drying process. If you don't have one, let them sit for an hour or so before you move on.








,, Keep a notebook handy to count your compliments.

Embrace glamour!,
Consider an evening dress or cocktail dress - but don't feel limited to those choices.,
Don a pair of high heels.,
Add sparkle with your accessories.,
Carry a clutch purse.,
Style your hair.,
Put on glamorous evening make-up.",How to Dress for a Gala1," Extravagant gowns and glitzy accessories are the way to go, even if that may be a little outside your comfort zone. Formal clothing will honor your host, or your date, and the event. This is the time to wear proper formal wear!;
, Generally, evening gowns are longer, reaching the floor. Sometimes it has an asymmetrical hem, or a dramatic leg-slit. Cocktail dresses are shorter, typically just above the knee. Although traditionally evening dresses were the only appropriate choice, cocktail dresses are usually acceptable nowadays. In fact, sometimes the line between the two is blurry.


If Ellen Degeneres does not have to wear a dress for the Oscars, neither do you! Although a glamorous dress is the ""go to"" look for a woman, there are other options available. It may take a bit more research, and be aware that your daring choice may be a bit unexpected at a gala.
Consider a menswear-inspired outfit, (such as the one Ellen Degeneres wore at the 2014 Oscar Awards), a pantsuit, or a sophisticated pant and top combination. Just be sure the overall impression is formal and in good taste.

, Good choices include stilettos, open toed shoes, and those with straps. Avoid over chunky, thick soled shoes like clogs. Make sure the color of the shoe complements the color of your gown. It does not need to match exactly, but needs to coordinate.


If in doubt, opt for a black shoe.
You can also spice things up by choosing a shoe with a little bit of sparkle on it.
Satin shoes are almost always appropriate for gala events.
Do not wear any shoe with a wedge, cork or wood in its design, nor is it usually appropriate to wear any form of boot.
Wearing flats may make it difficult to walk without tripping on a long hem. Consider instead a heeled shoe or a shorter hemmed dress.
If you cannot or do not wish to wear high heels, you can find flats that have glamour and embellishments. A good woman's shoe store should have staff who can guide you.
If you have a male date, try not to loom over him. If you are a taller woman, opt for lower heels or flats if possible.

,


If your gown already has a bit of shimmer to it, keep your accessories low-key. Choose simpler dangle earrings. Wear a nice necklace and bracelet that match the glitz on your dress without competing with it.
Jewelry needs to be in good taste. Actual valuable jewelry--such as pearl necklaces, diamond earrings, gold bracelets -- are the traditional accessory for women.
Costume jewelry is often entirely appropriate, as long as it is sophisticated. For instance, a rhinestone necklace is unlikely to be confused with an actual diamond necklace...but it gives your gown a wonderful sparkle.

, Clutches are the standard in formal handbags. Larger handbags or ""mommy purses"" are considered too informal. Choose one that compliments the color of your dress or shoes. Another option is a small purse with very thin straps.

, Consider going to a professional stylist to make your hair look as elegant as possible.


If you would rather save the money and style your hair at home, use a straightener to make your tresses as silky smooth as possible.
Alternatively, use a curling iron and styling products to create large, voluminous curls that will last all evening.

, Typically, a gala event calls for more dramatic make-up than you wear on a typical day. One reason is that lighting is often subdued, and galas are at night, and so your make-up needs to be a bit more dramatic than at school or work.


Keep your foundation and blush looking natural.
Use eyeliner and mascara to outline your eyes and lashes. Apply heavy, smoky eye shadow. Compliment this look with a neutral, glossy lipstick, but stick with a shade that looks good with your skin tone.
Apply minimal color to your eyes and make the focal point your lips with a bold red or deep brick shade that compliments your skin tone. The darker your shade of lipstick, to better it is to first apply a lip liner to your lips to prevent the color from bleeding.
Really dislike make-up but willing to try a very minimal amount? Try a subtly tinted lip gloss, and a very light featherweight foundation (either powder or lotion). It does not take long to do, it is not dissimilar to sunscreen and Chap-stick, and gives a little enhancement without being overly dramatic.

Stick with black shoes.,
Keep yourself tidy.",How to Dress for a Gala2," Ensure that it is of high quality. A black or dark navy or grey suit may work.

, Whether you wear a tuxedo or another high quality suit, you must wear a jacket. Black wool and midnight blue are both appropriate choices unless otherwise specified in your invitation, and you can go for either a single-breasted or double-breasted cut. You may end up taking off the jacket at the after-party, but the formal jacket is considered important for a gala event.

, Your trousers should be made of the same material and shade.

, If wearing a tuxedo, make sure to pair it with a proper tuxedo shirt. With a tux rental, it comes as part of the package.

, Bow ties are a traditional, widely accepted choice for galas and other formal occasions. A black long tie may also work if made of a nice material. Some other neckwear, such as cravats, bolo ties, and such may or may not be considered appropriate for your region.

, Choose shoes made of patent or highly polished leather. ""Novelty"" choices such as Converse sneakers have no place at a proper gala.

",How to Dress for a Night on the Town (for Guys),"


Before you even look at that closet, hit the shower.;
,,


Your face should be clean-shaven and your sideburns clean cut, unless you can pull off the mop top.
Acne should be kept under control, birth marks can't be helped but some Oxy pads or Clearasil will be more than enough.


Lean into the mirror, consider the probability that girls will be talking to you from less than two feet away.
Use a nose hair trimmer even if you don't think you need to.

Your unibrow should be kept in check (read NO UNIBROW).


Comb your hair. Your hair should be styled, or at the very least not messy or grungy. If you can pull off the bald look (not many can), go for it.
Sport facial hair at your own discretion, but mustaches aren't exactly what's hip right now (coming from a white guy).

,,


Not brushing, flossing, and using a little bit of mouthwash is a cardinal sin in her eyes, and unpardonable.

,,,, Your clothes should be in good shape (stains and holes are a BIG turnoff), and not wrinkly. If you have to, iron your pants or shirt.


Trying to go out in a button-down while attempting to hide a missing button, whether at the bottom of the shirt or on the cuffs, is a classic mistake.
Girls are very keen on minuscule discrepancies like these and will be the first ones to notice.

,, This also goes without saying, but consider where you're going tonight and remember Carmine Lupertazzi's dictum: A Don doesn't wear shorts!


Unless you're going to a summer night barbecue, pants or jeans are the way to go. Dockers and slacks work best, but if you have the moxie to wear khaki's then have at it.
Faded jeans with modestly sized holes is what's hot in the streets nowadays, but if you decide to go down this road, don't look like you're ready to go to a Grunge concert.
Your pants should go down past your shoes and at the back of the heel stop before the rubber sole.

,, You can't go wrong with a polo, button-down, or long-sleeve shirt, but wear a T-shirt at your own peril, and avoid shirt pockets!

, If you must wear jewelry, try something like low keyed.

,,,


Unless you're over 35, a leather watch-strap is more often than not inferior to a metal band (non-expandable).

, You're probably not going to a millionaire summit meeting, so try not to wear more than two or three rings, if any. Find a piece that is unique to you, it's a good icebreaker and many girls will compliment your trinket of individuality!

,


Is everything in place?
Are your pants congruent with your shirt?
Does your jewelry clash with your outfit?
Are your shoes stylish without being tacky?
Is your collar shaped around your neck correctly?

,,,,


Whether at a casual dinner, bar, club, lounge, or hangout spot, your clothes are only as good looking as you carry them. Now go out there and do some work, son!

Leave out anyone likely to spoil the night by acting spoiled or pining for their male counterpart. Send out the invitations with enough time to get back to you.


Ensure that everyone has confirmed they're coming and that you have organised some form of transport.
Arrange for a designated driver. If someone is going to be driving, ensure that they won't drink.;
, To make sure that you're not rushing, start to get ready approximately 3 hours before you have arranged to go out. This doesn't mean you'll be full-on prepping but it does give you time to relax in between getting ready, allowing for a leisurely preparation time.

, It should be something you're comfortable with because confidence is the sexiest accessory. Wear something that you can move in easily, that fits well and shows off your best self.


If you like them, heels add an additional spark to an outfit. However, if you struggle to walk in heels, find lower heels or sexy low/flat shoes.

, Treat yourself to a luxurious bath before heading out. Use bath oils that refresh rather than relax though; you don't want to end up getting sleepy!

, Apply moisturiser, preferably scented, to help feel pampered. Moisturiser will help make the makeup stay better throughout the night.

, It's best not to go out on an empty stomach, as this will make you feel the effects of alcohol quicker. Also, you may be tempted to overeat unhealthy foods if you're hungry. Have a light snack if you'll be eating later, or a meal if you're only going out for drinks and dancing.

, For a night out, it is best to focus on a certain feature. This might be: eyes with false eyelashes, smokey eyes or dramatic eyeliner, or focus on your lips using either gloss or bright lips.

, Decide on a style that will suit your outfit and where you're going. Either straighten, curl or create an interesting up-do. Also, make sure you're happy with the hairstyle, so that you won't be playing with it all night. Beauty is meant to be effortless!


Avoid wearing your hair in too tight a style; it'll cause headaches and scalp pain.
If it's going to be an active girl's night out, choose a style that won't fall out when moving.

, Take your time and get the whole look just right.

, Remember these important things: ID, money, bank card (in case of emergencies), key, flat shoes to change into, mobile phone, essential makeup for any touch-ups and camera (or use the one with your phone).

, Let someone trusted know that you and your friends are going out. Give this person a contact number and get theirs. Give them a tentative time for your return home and let them know that you might call them if you need any help. It is important that someone is aware of your movements and that they're prepared to help out if needed. Hopefully, they won't be needed at all but it's better to be safe than sorry.


It's also a good idea for all of you to organise a pre-arranged meet-up area should you get separated during the night. Exchange phone numbers for those of you with mobiles and promise to text one another if you get separated and to go straight to this pre-arranged spot to regroup.
Another thing to do is to organise a secret signal to help each other out if any one of you needs to get away from someone coming on too strong or who is boring. Have a keyword or special phrase that will let the rest of you know to come to the rescue. And regardless of this, you should all keep an eye out for one another during the night.

, Then head out for a fantastic night out with everyone ready for fun.

Choose simple, feminine jewelry.,
White gloves add a nice touch to your outfit.,
If the weather calls for it, wrap the look together with a nice shawl or cardigan sweater.",How to Dress for a Formal Tea1,"


The skirt should be no shorter than knee-length, and you should avoid dresses that show too much cleavage or expose too much of your back.
Avoid bold, loud patterns. A dress with a delicate floral pattern works well, but other simple patterns and plain colors are also suitable.
Not all sundresses are appropriate for a formal tea. If you would wear it to the beach or to a barbecue, it is likely too informal for this type of event. When in doubt, pick the more tailored dress that has a zipper closure to the one with an elastic band around the waste and wrinkled straps that tie at the shoulders.;
,


The heels do not have to be high, nor do they have to be closed at the back, but flats are not formal enough.
Dressy, heeled sandals work for an informal tea, but not for a formal tea.
Avoid flip-flops at all costs, and no sports shoes whatsoever.

, Hats are nearly a necessity for formal tea.


A wide-brimmed straw picture hat is a safe option that looks nice on most women.
Other Victorian or vintage style hats may also work, depending on the rest of your outfit.

, Necklaces, bracelets, and earrings made of pearls or faux pearls work best. Minimize that amount of sparkly jewelry you wear.

,


Keep them at the wrist; long gloves should be avoided.
Crochet and net gloves work best, but satin gloves also work well.

, Choose white, off-white, or other light colors.

Long-sleeve shirts are more formal and appropriate. If you get hot, you can neatly roll up your sleeves.
Make sure you choose a lightweight material if the weather is hot.

, Both dark and light colored slacks are acceptable.

, You do not necessarily need to wear it, but you should bring one along, even if you only intend to carry it. Not having one may prohibit you from entering the event, so it’s best to be prepared.

,, For example, if you’re wearing a smart pair of khaki pants, make sure your socks match their color.

,, This may be optional, depending on the information in your invitation.

Choose dresses than enhance your upper body if you have a pear-shaped figure.,
Enhance your form if you've got an hourglass figure.,
Draw the eye up if you have an apple-shape.,
Draw attention downwards if you have a full bust.",How to Determine Your Dress Size," You'll need to measure the fullest part of your bust to get the proper measurement. Make sure that the measuring tape (a dress maker's soft tape measure for preference) goes under your arms.Keep the measuring tape snug but not too tight. If you do it too tight (if your bust is popping out over the tape) then you'll get the wrong measurements and your dress won't fit properly.;
, Bend to one side (doesn't matter which) and find your waist's natural crease. At the crease, measure around your waist, making sure that the measuring tape is a bit loose.


You can also find your natural waist by measuring 2 inches up from your belly button. It's usually the smallest part of your waistline.

, Stand with your feet together. Measure around the fullest part of your hips and rear. This is typically midway between your crotch and your belly button. Again you'll want to keep the measuring tape somewhat loose, so that your dress size doesn't end up being too small.

, Keep in mind that size charts tend to be different for different stores and that even with your measurements and the size chart, you may be surprised by the wide array of sizes you will seem to fit into. However, you can use this size chart as a basic guide.


Always choose the larger size if your measurements come between two sizes, especially if you're ordering online.
Avoid the dress size generators, as they tend to give you the wrong sizes. Dress size generators claim to be able to tell you your dress size in each store (since so many stores size their women's clothing differently).If you are looking at European sizes, you'll want to check out this chart, which converts American sizes into European sizes.







, Some stores don't use the typical 6, 8, 10, 12. Instead they use letters like XS, S, M, etc. Fortunately these letter sizes tend to correspond to specific numerical sizes and you can figure your size out based on that.


In American Sizes; Size 2 is XS, Size 4 is S, Size 6 is M, Size 8 is L, Size 10 is XL, Size 12 is XXL. This is what it usually is, although sizes may still vary depending on the store.

, Most, if not all, online clothing websites have a chart that explains their sizing measurements. Sometimes dresses will run bigger or smaller than your typical size, so you will want your measurements handy to check against the website's sizing guide.


It's a good idea to shop at the same websites, because you're more likely to already know what size works best for you.

, Once you know your measurements you'll need to check out the different sizing at different stores. Many stores and many brands operate on their own sizing when it comes to dresses. A lot of times you can check the label to find where your measurements fall.


At Target, for example, a small at Target (in numeric size: 0 or 2) has the bust of 85.09 cm to 86.39, waist measurements of 66.04cm to 67.31cm, and hip measurements of 91.44 cm to93.98 cm.At Top shop, an American size 6 has a bust of 87 cm, a waist of 69.2 cm, and a hip measurement of 91.5, which is smaller than the generic size chart., Sometimes the best way to find out the dress sizes at different stores is to ask a salesperson. You won't be the first person to be confused and salespeople know that most stores have a different sizing method for dresses. As long as you know your measurements they should be able to help you.

, If you've got a straight body (narrow hips, no bust, no rear) there are certain dresses that will flatter your body better than others. Fitted sheaths and classic shift dresses work well for this body type.Empire waist or A-line skirts on a dress help to give you some curves, if you don't have much in that area.
You can also create a more dramatic effect by having an off-the-shoulder dress. The neckline of a dress like this draws more attention to the collarbones and arms.

, Pear-shaped basically means that you're fuller at the hips and rear and smaller around your bust. Open-neck and strapless dresses are good for drawing attention to your upper body, highlighting your assets.Empire waists, full and A-line skirts also enhance your hips and help you look fabulous!

, This means that you've got a full bust and full hips, with a narrower, defined waist. You'll want to go for dresses that nip in at the waist and show off your figure.


Wraps, knit dresses, and sheaths that have a waist are good bets for showing off your figure.

, This basically means that your narrowest point is at your ribs, above your natural waist. Empire waists are a good bet for drawing attention upwards, since their waistline sits right below the bust.


Choose a dress with details around the neckline, because this will draw attention upwards.
Full skirts or A-line skirts on a dress can give you the appearance of an hourglass figure.

, When your bust measurement is fuller than your hips and rear measurement, a good look is to draw attention away from your bust and even out your top and bottom by the dresses you choose.


V-necks and halter tops can create a slimming effect (and look good with fuller busts).
A-line and full skirt dress styles will help create a balance between the top and bottom. Choosing dresses with details at the bottom can also help draw attention downwards.

Formal events like Go Red for Women will require a nicer dress.
For some events it may not be appropriate to wear a red dress. For example, you may not want to wear a red dress to a funeral in the United States.
Choose a red that will benefit your skin tone. Blue reds for pale skin, bright and orange reds for darker or tan skin.
Going to a garden party may not be the best place to wear red as it may not match with the theme of the party and the material at such parties tends to be cotton, which may not show off the color red as well.;
, If you don't do this, you may be disappointed. You need to be realistic in where you can shop and what your options are.

, What do you think your body type is? Are you thin, muscular, or athletic? Knowing this information will help you pick the right red dress. Ask a friend, parent, or adult what they think your body type is.


For smaller women: Lighter colours will draw more attention to your figure. Stick with bright reds to flatter your figure.

Patterns: Patterns draw attention to an area of the body. You can select a pattern that draws attention to your small waist, or select a pattern that draws attention to the bottom of the dress and your legs.


For larger women: Stick with darker reds or maroons. Darker colours draw less attention to the body.

Patterns: Avoid bold patterns in the mid section, instead draw attention away from the belly by looking for patterns near the bust line. Try to stick with a pattern that is in a different shade of red and not overly bold.



, Look at fashion magazines and websites to get a general idea for styles that you like. Check the names of the labels that women are wearing in those pictures.

, Go for one at Ross or Dress Barn. Some stores are more likely to carry dresses. This includes places like Kohl’s, JCPenny, Macy's, Target, bridal boutiques. The types of dresses these stores carry may change by season. They might have sales on dresses that you may want to be aware of when planning your budget.


Season: Red is always in style, unlike some colours there is no ""best time of the year"" to buy red. Most retailers from designer labels to department stores will always have red options.

, Mark all dresses down that you like. Write down why you like them.

, Go to the shops where the dresses you like are located (Or order them off the Internet). Try them on for size and fitting. Make sure they are not too tight or too loose.


For smaller women: Select a dress that fits closer to the body and flatters your curves.
For larger women: Look for dresses that are fitted in the chest and flare out at the waist. This style will make your waist appear smaller.

, Go back to the store and try it on again. If it fits perfectly, then that is your dress. Put it on and wear it with pride. If not, go down to your second choice and see if that is the dress for you.

Rub the dress with an anti-static dryer sheet.,

Apply moisturizing lotion on your body where the dress is clinging.,
Buy a dress made out of natural fibers.",How to Stop Static on a Dress Clinging to You1," Hold the skirt of the dress away from your legs and rub the underside of the fabric with the dryer sheet. This will be more difficult if the static is toward the center of your chest or an area that is hard to get the dryer sheet under. Do your best. This should help remove the static quickly and easily. If you do this correctly the static should immediately transfer to the dryer sheet. , Spray the outside of the dress anywhere you can feel the static clinging to you. You can use an old Windex bottle or a bottle you use to spray your plants, just make sure it’s something that doesn’t spray too much water. The plan is to slightly wet the fabric in any area where you feel the static cleaning to you.This will help remove the static quickly, but don’t spray too much or over too large of an area. You don’t want to be damp on your way to whatever event you are wearing a dress to. Don't worry, the static won't come back once your dress is dry again.

, This spray is available at some pharmacies and can help you quickly remove any static from your dress easily. Once again, you'll want to use the spray to spray the outside of your dress in any place that you feel the static. The spray will put you back about $20.00, but some people swear by them. . If you have time to go buy the spray or if you have the spray on hand this is a great option to get rid of the static.

, Hold the aerosol spray far enough away from your body that it isn't a completely direct hit on your dress. Arms length should do the trick, and be careful to close your eyes so you don't accidentally spray yourself in the face. You can also rub lotion on your hands and then rub your body underneath the static parts of your dress. Once again, make sure you don’t rub too much. Unscented lotion is probably the best bet too, as you don’t want to smell really strongly of moisturizing lotion. , Any piece of metal that goes directly into the ground should instantly remove static. Try to avoid touching metal objects that are not grounded, such as doorknobs. You might give yourself a big static shock and sometimes these can be pretty painful. A metal fence is a great example of a piece of grounded metal.

, The lotion prevents static from building up on your skin. If the static can’t build on you then it won’t stay on the dress either. This option because more difficult if the dress has static all over it, but if the static is localized you should give this option a shot. You can also use some talcum baby powder but this is much messier than moisturizer and has a very recognizable smell. If you choose to follow this option just get some on your hands and rub it gently on your skin wherever the static sticks your dress. Use very little.

, Synthetic fibers are the ones that end up getting so filled with static. It gets complicated quickly, but basically natural fibers retain moisture more easily and therefore prevent there from being too many charged electrons flying around on your dress. If you want to prevent static electricity issues going forward, it's probably just to buy a dress made out of natural fibers. Problem solved! "

Boost the humidity in your house.,
Hand or machine-wash the dress on the gentlest cycle available.,
Hang dry your dress on a hanger in a doorway.,
Walk around barefoot.",How to Stop Static on a Dress Clinging to You2," This might help you fend off all static problems in the future. All you have to do is buy a humidifier at your local hardware store and set it up in your house. Static is especially common in the winter when the air is very dry. The static will die down over time with a humidifier. If you don’t want to buy a humidifier, you can also just hang your dress up in your bathroom after you take a shower. The humidity will be higher in there and it will take care of the static.

, But first check the label to see if the dress can be washed. Look for a label in the dress that has washing instructions. It should tell you if you are allowed to machine wash and dry the dress or if it will ruin the fabric. Definitely check this before putting your dress in the wash. If you do decide to put it in the wash, adding baking soda to the washing machine can help reduce static cling. If you are machine drying the dress, put a dryer sheet in with the dress, then take the dress out of the dryer while it's still slightly damp.

, Have the hook hanging on the door frame. If you hang-dry your clothes anyway, like on a clothesline, make sure that it is on a hanger for the last 10 minutes of drying rather than hanging directly on the clothesline. This will prevent it from getting wrinkled and will prevent static build up.

, This sounds silly, but it will really reduce the static that you collect on your body. If there’s no static on you there will be no static on you dress, so walk around barefoot if you know you’re going to have to put your dress on soon. You can also put aluminum foil around the bottoms of your shoes to prevent static build up, but walking around barefoot is probably easier. "

Avoid wearing a brand new pair of sandals for a long walk.,
Take short walks in the sandals.,
Wear thick socks with your sandals.,
Step into a bucket of water.,
Try out exercises to prevent foot pain.",How to Make Sandals Comfortable1," Wear your sandals for short intervals of time at first until they're broken in. Otherwise, you risk blisters, cuts, and feeling uncomfortable. You may also experience leg and foot muscle pain if you’re not used to the sandals yet. Try to take it easy for the first few wears.The lack of arch support and often the lack of cushioned support in sandals means that sandals are unsuitable to wear for long periods of time. The only exceptions are those built for hiking, but they are made for walking first.;
, Walk around your house and garden to help break them in. Visit the beach and walk on the sand. Then, remove them and go barefoot to give your feet a break. Don’t wear the sandals longer than is comfortable for you., If your sandals are a bit tight, wear thick socks with them to stretch them out. The look may not be ideal, so you can choose to only wear the sandals with socks around your house. To speed up the process, you can take a blow dryer to the sandals while you are wearing them with thick socks.Wool socks are ideal to wear.

, This method only works for leather sandals. Step into a bucket of water for a for a few seconds while wearing they sandals until they are wet. Once they are wet, pat the excess water off with a towel to avoid discoloration. Then, wear them while they are still damp. The dampness will allow the shoes to soften and conform to your feet as you wear them.If you don’t want to step into a bucket of water, you can use a spray bottle to spritz water onto them.

, Sandals that lack support can damage your feet over time. They don’t connect to your foot properly, which causes tension and pressure on your feet and legs. You can prevent this by exercising and strengthening your arch and toes.To strengthen your arch, put your foot flat on the floor. Place a penny under the ball of your foot and a pen under your arch. Flex your arch muscle. You should be pushing down on the penny, but not the pen. Keep your toes relaxed. Repeat five times.
Limber up and strengthen your feet with toe curls. Stand on a towel. Lift your toes and flex your foot. Then, put your foot back on the towel. Curl your toes inwards and try to create space under your arch. Repeat five times on each foot."

Use soap on your sandals.,
Wear Band-Aids or moleskins.,
Buy arch support.,
Use heel grips.,
Waterproof your sandals.",How to Make Sandals Comfortable2," This method will only work for leather sandals. Rub soap around the areas the sandals are likely to rub against your toes, feet, ankles, and heels. This will help to slightly stretch the leather. The soap will also soften the friction between it and your sandals. The best type of soap to use is saddle soap. Apply it with a damp cloth and wipe it off until the shoe is dry., Put a Band-Aid inside of the sandal in places you think it might rub. Use thick Band-Aids or moleskins. Flimsy Band-Aids will probably peel off throughout the course of the day. Moleskins are usually pretty thick, but be sure to purchase a moleskin with an adhesive.You can buy the Band-Aid Friction Block Stick. It is $8 and looks similar to a small stick of deodorant.

, If you feel the lack of arch support, or lack of cushioning is spoiling your experience of walking, add an inner step to the sandal to provide cushioning and support. Special insoles can be purchased that add softness to the insole zone of a sandal. Look for insoles that are cushioned for hard, flat sandals, and shoes. It’s ideal if they absorb moisture as well.Dr.Scholl’s has a variety of arch supports.

, If your find that your sandals are slightly too big, you can insert a heel grip into the back. The heel grip will prevent slipping and make up for the extra space. Heel grips come in several different materials, including sponge, suede, and rubber.Pedag and Dr.Scholl’s make heel grips.

, You should only waterproof your sandals if they are made of fabric. Waterproofing your shoes can prevent water from seeping inside of them, which can cause rubbing and blistering. To waterproof your shoes, buy some bees wax and rub them on the entire outside fabric portion of your sandals.Depending on the type of sandal, it may already be made of a waterproof material.

Choose a type of sandal.,
Pick a sturdy material.,
Choose a good brand.,
Try shoes on towards the end of the day.,
Make sure they fit correctly.",How to Make Sandals Comfortable3," Think about what activity you need the sandals for. The activity you need the sandals for determines what type of sandals you need to buy. Choosing the wrong sandal for your activity can make the wearing experience very uncomfortable, even if it is typically a comfortable sandal. Along with type of sandal, you should consider if you would like an open or closed toe design. Some types of sandals are:A hiking sandal is meant to have rugged outsoles, stiff midsoles, and tough toe boxes. The straps of a hiking sandal should tightly cover the foot.
A water sandal should be lighter than a hiking sandal. It should also be water resistant. This type of sandal would come in handy for walking on the beach, rafting, and walking around the pool.
A fashion sandal is meant to be worn mostly for looks. You should not use this type of sandal to take part in physical activity. It is meant to be worn to occasions, such as weddings and parties.
Huaraches are ideal for walking. They are more lightweight than a hiking sandal. Huaraches usually have a rubber sole and webbing splits around the big toe.

, It is better to invest in a higher quality material that will support your feet better and last longer. The type of material you choose depends on the type of sandal you need. Some high quality materials are leather, suede, and fabric straps. These kinds of materials prevent blisters and allow your feet to breathe. Nylon webbing and polyurethane are ideal materials for water activities. For the soles, look for memory foam, ethylene-vinyl acetate, and durable rubbers that will last long and provide support., Look for brands that are well-made, quality, and specialize in sandals regularly. Some sandals are built better than others and will feel more comfortable than lower quality brands. For example, Birkenstocks and Tevas are known for their support and comfort (but not necessarily their fashionista mark of approval). Havaianas flip-flops are comfortable and stylish.Ask for the advice of the salesperson when shopping, or look online for recommendations.

, Your feet are the smallest when you wake up in the morning. As the days goes on, your feet swell. It is best to try on sandals during the late afternoon or evening to avoid buying sandals that will be too small.Consider how much your feet will swell after physical activities like hiking.

, Even if you have the best quality sandal made for the activity you need it for, it will not be comfortable if it doesn’t fit correctly. No part of your foot should hang over the sandal—neither your toes nor heels. Your foot shouldn’t be the exact size of the sole. The sandals shouldn’t be too large, or sliding and rubbing will occur, which causes blisters.Make sure the toe box is wide enough to accommodate the widest part of your foot.
Check the straps to make sure that they fits tightly, but do not suffocate your feet.

Bring the water to a simmer over medium heat., You will need about 2.8 ounces (79.38 grams) of olive oil and 1.1 ounce (31.18 grams) of white beeswax.For extra shine, try using half beeswax and half carnauba wax., As the beeswax heats up, it will start to melt. Once it melts completely, give it a stir so that it blends in with the olive oil., Use a coffee grinder or food processor to grind 1½ teaspoons of black or brown oxide. Stir the powdered oxide into the melted mixture. Keep stirring until the oxide has blended completely into the mixture, and no streaks, swirls, or specks remain.Remember to clean your coffee grinder or food processor well after this, or you risk contaminating your food.

Scuff the soles on abrasive surfaces.,
Abrade the soles directly with sandpaper.,
Use a nail file.,
Wear your shoes and wait for the soles to naturally wear down.",How to Make Shoes Less Slippery1," If your slippery shoes are a new pair, there's a good chance that they're slippery simply because their soles are perfectly smooth and unworn. Soles generally get a little more grip once they soften and small nooks and abrasions have been worn into them because these properties allow them to make better contact with the floor. Thus, wearing your soles down somewhat can often noticeably improve your traction.


To do this, try walking around on a rough surface like, for instance:

Concrete (the rougher, the better)
Gravel
Rocks, boulders, etc.
Textured metal grates, walkways, etc.


If you're not embarrassed, you can even try taking your shoes off and scuffing their soles on the ground with your hands.;
, Aren't in a situation where you can easily scuff your shoes on a rough surface? Worried about slipping while you're waiting for your soles to wear down? Try an abrasive like sandpaper instead — simply take off your shoe and rub the smoothest parts of the sole that touch the floor until they develop a rougher, more textured feel.


For this task, a fairly coarse sandpaper is best, though finer sandpapers are better than nothing. If possible, use about a 50-grit paper.
Note that this may not work on certain soles, especially those with a ""natural,"" cardboard-like texture (as is often used for some sandals and flats.), If you don't have sandpaper, a nail file or similar tool usually works well. Use it exactly like you used your sandpaper — scuff the smooth, flat parts of your shoe that come in contact with the floor to give them some texture.


Metal files are typically the most durable, convenient tools for this task, though even simple emery boards can work. As with sandpaper, coarser files work best here.

, Another way to make your shoes less slippery is to simply wear them as much as you can. Over a few days to a few weeks of use (depending on how often your wear your shoes), the simple action of walking should take the slickness out of your soles.


If you use this method, take care to switch to a different pair of shoes whenever you anticipate a situation where slipping is likely (like dancing, walking in the rain, and so on.) You don't want to risk hurting yourself simply to make your shoes more wearable.

Invest in grip pads.,
Alternatively, buy a spray-on coating.,
Use hairspray.,
Use puff paint.,
Use masking tape.,
For high-quality shoes, consider seeing a shoe repairer.",How to Make Shoes Less Slippery2," If your slipping problems are coming from an older pair of shoes, the issue may not be that your sole isn't worn enough, but rather that it is too worn. In this case, you may want to consider adding material to the bottom of your shoes to give you more grip. Perhaps the most ""professional"" way to do this is to apply shoe pads designed specifically for this purpose to the soles of your shoes.


These textured pads typically attach to the material of the sole with an adhesive. Note that some users complain that this adhesive can leave shoes with a ""sticky"" feeling once the pads come off.
Grip pads are sold at many higher-end wardrobe supply stores for fairly cheap — usually no more than $10 or so for a single set., In addition to adhesive pads, there are also spray products designed to be used on the soles of shoes to give them more grip. These products, usually sold as ""traction sprays"" or ""grip sprays,"" can vary in quality, so talk to an employee or spend time reading customer testimonials before making a purchase.


Traction sprays are usually sold at the same places at grip pads for a slightly higher cost — usually about $10-20.

, Don't want to spend money on traction-adding products? Several products that you probably already have in your own home may also give good results. However, it's important to note that these improvised solutions are not guaranteed to work as well as the professional ones above. One home remedy is hairspray — simply spray a generous coat on the soles of your shoes for a little extra ""stick"" (especially on smooth-bottomed dress shoes.) Give the hairspray at least half a minute or so to dry and become tacky before walking in the shoes.


Keep in mind that this solution is temporary and will require re-application. In addition, hairspray may rinse off in wet weather., ""Puff"" paint (also called ""dimensional fabric"" paint) is a type of paint that's frequently used in arts and crafts products for children like making tee shirts. When puff paint dries, it gains a somewhat rough, textured quality, making it a good choice for adding grip to the bottoms of shoes. Simply apply a thin coat to the sole, leave the sole for a few hours to dry, and test out your solution!


While puff paint should last longer than hairspray, it will need to be re-applied semi regularly for maximum effectiveness.
If you have the time, consider painting a design into your shoe — it's a great way to make your shoes truly unique and express your creativity.

, One simple ""last resort"" technique for improving the traction of your shoes is to simply stick a few rolls of masking tape on their soles. Lay two rolls of tape in an ""X"" pattern on the widest, flattest parts of your soles for maximum effect.


Be aware that, as the tape loses its adhesive quality, you may need to add more masking tape.

, If you've got a pair of shoes that is especially expensive or that you treasure too much to modify with the tricks above, consider bringing it to a professional cobbler or shoe repairer. These professionals may be able to fix your shoes by modifying or replacing their soles.


Note, however, that the services of a cobbler often do not come cheap. Depending on the quality of your shoe and the difficulty of the work being done, a single pair of shoes can cost over $100 to fix.Thus, this solution is best saved for your very nicest pair of shoes.

Doing this may be violating your job's code of conduct. More importantly, however, it may leave you vulnerable to injury — non-slip shoe requirements exist for a reason.


When in doubt, simply get a new pair of non-slip shoes. Note that most non-slip shoes are rated with a scale called the ""coefficient of friction"" (CoF). For most jobs that require non-slip shoes, a coefficient of about 0.5-0.7 is ideal (check with your employer for rules specific to your job.), If you're testing out a new traction-adding technique for the first time, don't put yourself in a situation where you'll need it until you've tested it out. Taking the time to do something as simple as walking around your house or making a trip around the block can sometimes tell you all you need to know about how effective your solution is.

, If you're dealing with a pair of shoes made from a fine material like leather, be sure to check the packaging for any products you intend to use on them before doing so. Though problems are likely to be rare, some products may cause certain shoe materials to discolor or degrade, making them a very bad choice.


For example, the chemicals in hairspray have been known to damage certain types of leather, which means that care must be taken if using hairspray as a temporary fix for a slippery pair of leather shoes., The methods in this article aren't perfect and may not work for shoes that are very slippery. While it can be tough to say goodbye to an old pair of shoes that have permanently lost their grip, the alternative — a nasty slip and fall — is worse. If your shoes' soles are truly beyond hope, stop wearing your shoes and look for a new pair.


If your shoes are still in reasonable condition but are too slippery for your work or hobbies, consider donating them to a charity like Donate Your Old Shoes. This way, someone else may be able to get use out of your shoes, even if you cannot.
Also try using a Pedi-egg product and scuff the souls vigorously.

List some stores you want to go in, and your shopping budget.,

Choose a dress which will suit whatever event your going to.,

Make sure the dresses fabric is suitable.,

Think about decoration.",How to Choose a Dress for New Year's Eve," Write down your thoughts about hemlines and necklines. Do you want a short prom style dress, or a long evening gown? It's also a good idea to think about colors which suit you. For New Years Eve, its usually better to pick ""party colors"" when buying a dress, such as gold, silver, purple, maroon, navy and black. Set some time aside for shopping. A good time to buy your dress is after Christmas, as shops are usually quiet then. It's best to avoid the first two days straight after Christmas though as stores are crowded because of the sales. December 28th or 29th are good days to go.;
, If your going to a party which will have fireworks, buy a shrug or stylish shawl to go over what you're wearing for when you go outside. If you know you'll be staying inside, then you probably won't need one. If the entire party is going to be hosted outdoors, a dress past the knee with cap sleeves may be an appropriate choice. Dress accordingly., Satin and cotton are good choices, however linen or suede may be less appropriate as they are more summer-like materials., Bows, sequins, embroidery, and beads all look pretty on dresses, however certain types of decoration suit certain dresses. Embroidery is more suited to classical evening gowns, whereas bows can look better on prom dresses."

Read the invitation closely.,
Understand “black tie preferred.” If the invitation says that black tie attire is preferred, it means that you should wear the nicest clothing you have easy access to.,
Understand “black tie optional.” Like preferred, optional suggests that the event is formal, but you have a bit more flexibility about what you choose to wear.,
Understand “black tie creative.” This suggests that the event is formal, but that you are allowed to be a little more flexible about your clothing choices.Black tie creative means that men can switch out their white tux shirts for a black shirts or wear a red tie to add flair to their outfit.,
Be aware of “black tie mandatory.” This means that you will not be allowed to enter the event unless you are dressed in appropriate black tie attire.",How to Dress for a Black Tie Event1," There are subtle difference between “black tie optional,” “black tie preferred,” and “black tie.” Knowing the time of day and the time of year for the event, as well as what kind of event it is, can help you determine how to dress best.Evening events are more formal than daytime events.
Winter events are often more formal, and dark colors are more appropriate, than summer events.;
, If you don’t have a tuxedo or a floor-length gown, a nice cocktail dressor a suit may be acceptable.


If you choose not to wear black tie to an event that is deemed black tie preferred, you should do it with confidence and accept the fact that most people will be wearing black tie attire.

, At a black tie optional event, the crowd will most likely be split in half between black tie and a very formal style of dress.


If you still can’t decide what to wear and you know other people who are attending the event, ask them what they will be wearing. This may give you a leg up on what exactly to wear, especially if you can ask the host of the event.

, Ladies can be a bit flashier in their choice of gown colors, and maybe even go as far as to wear a tiara or long gloves.

, The steps below will direct you towards dressing appropriately and ensure that you will be allowed to enter the event.

Wear an appropriate tuxedo.,
Select appropriate accent pieces.,
Rent a tuxedo.,
Wear a black bow tie.,
Complete your look with black, shined dress shoes.,
Be prepared for the weather.",How to Dress for a Black Tie Event2," A tuxedo is usually made of black wool, and includes, first, a jacket and matching pants. The jacket can be single or double-breasted, but the most traditional style is single-breasted with only one button.The pockets on the jacket should not have flaps over them.
The pants should match the color and material of the jacket, should not have cuffs, and should have a stripe on the outside that matches the lapel of the jacket.
You might be able to wear a dark blue tuxedo instead of black. White tuxedos are also considered formal, but are more common for daytime events., In addition to your tuxedo jacket and pants, you will need a white shirt and a waist covering.Traditional waist coverings call for a cummerbund or low waistcoat. However, vests are becoming more popular in less formal settings.

, If you do not own a tuxedo, you can rent one from a wedding or prom shop. Many shops offer tuxedos for reasonable rates. The shop employees will also be able to guide you towards the appropriate level of formality for the event.

, Official black tie events call for black bow ties.If the event was billed as black tie optional, preferred, or creative, you may be able to get away with another color bow tie, but traditionally you’ll still be limited to white or a solid color, like red. Alternately, you may be allowed to wear a bowtie color that matches your date’s dress.

, Your shoes should have been shined recently, and they should not appear to be dirty or scuffed. You may need to rent shoes if you do not have appropriate shoes.

, Fortunately, many black tie events take place at night and in the winter. You will likely be comfortable in your attire with no overcoat.


If you do need a coat, a dark dressy coat such as a chesterfield coat is appropriate, and a white dress scarf is traditional.In warm weather, be prepared by choosing a lighter fabric tuxedo if possible and carrying a handkerchief to discreetly remove sweat if necessary.

Select a floor length gown to wear.,
Choose a dark, elegant color for your dress.,
Carry a nice purse or clutch.,
Put on your best jewelry.,
Plan for the weather.,
Conceal your undergarments.,
Complete your black tie attire with evening shoes.,
Style your hair and makeup.",How to Dress for a Black Tie Event3," Floor length gowns are more elegant than short dresses. The neckline should be tasteful, but the sleeve length (if the dress has sleeves) is optional. Many full-length formal gowns are sleeveless.In the absence of a full floor-length dress, a very nice, dark colored or black three-quarters length dress may be acceptable.Older women should always choose a longer gown, but younger women may be able to wear a shorter gown appropriately.The most formal events call for a long ballgown with a full skirt., Black is usually preferred, with a rich texture that adds some visual interest.Deep colors like blue, maroon, a rich purple, and brown also look nice.
White or red dresses can be formal and classy, but may make you stand out.Use caution when wearing these to events like weddings, at which the bride should stand out, not one of the guests.

, Put your regular day purse aside and opt for a satin, or beaded, smaller clutch or purse for a black tie event., The more sparkle, the better. This is a time for you to shine.


Wear real jewelry (for example, real diamonds, pearls, or gold) whenever possible.
Costume jewelry should look very real and not tacky if worn.
Traditional jewelry recommendations are a sparkly bracelet and earrings or very simple, understated necklace., It can be difficult to wear evening wear in the winter months, as it is often chilly and women’s black tie attire rarely has sleeves to speak of. Your cold-weather options, however, should also be formal. Remember that you may be able to shop at a thrift store or borrow items instead of buying them new.A fur or faux fur coat or wrap is the preferred choice for black tie dress codes.
A traditional overcoat is the second best choice.
For milder climates or for time spent indoors, a shawl or wrap made from a quality material such as cashmere is preferred.
Long gloves, while made for style rather than warmth, may help ward off the cold and will give you a fancy flair.

, None of your undergarments should be visible in any way while dressed in your evening wear.Check for bra straps. Most formal dresses will require a strapless bra.
Be sure there are no panty lines. If your dress is curve-hugging or tight, you need to be sure that no one will be able to see your underwear. You may need to wear a thong or go without.
Consider wearing slimming undergarments. There are undergarments that are meant to smooth out areas of your body that may be bumpy and help give you a flattering shape. These usually do not show any lines beneath the clothing.

, Evening shoes are usually dainty or strappy, with a decent heel. Large or clunky shoes do not generally look good with formal dresses.


Evening shoes that are satin, beaded or shiny are great choices. Ideally, the texture and color of your shoes should match that of your handbag/clutch.

, You should spend extra time making your hair and makeup look nice for a black tie event.Traditional black tie formality calls for hair to be gathered in an up-do. Consider going to a salon to have a professional style your hair for you.
Events that involve dancing often have more flexibility and encourage flowing hair.Arrange for a manicure and pedicure the day of the event. Make a reservation ahead of time to ensure that they will have room for you.
Makeup should be applied well and not over-done. If you are inexperienced in makeup application, schedule a makeover at a salon or go to a makeup counter at a department store.

Close the back.",How to Make Boot Liners," The first two pieces that you’re going to cut out of your fleece fabric are for your soles, so clear some space on a hard floor to lay out your fabric. Unroll enough for your feet to stand on. If necessary, place weights at its corners and along the sides to keep it stretched out and as flat as possible.If you don’t have a hard floor available, just place a similarly hard surface on top of your carpet and work on that. Or, use a raised hard surface that you can easily place your foot on, like a workbench.;
, Place one foot on top of the fabric and keep it pressed flat there. You’re going to trace its outline on the fabric, so kneel down on one knee (or assume whatever position is comfortable for you while still giving your hand and arm enough space to work around your foot). Use a fabric pencil to draw an outline around the bottom of your foot with an extra inch (2.5 cm) between its edge and the outline.The extra inch is for your seam allowance, which gives you some extra space to sew your seam so you don’t end up with a boot liner that’s too small for your foot.

, Use fabric scissors to cut along the outline and remove your first piece from the fabric. Then repeat each step to create a second piece for your other sole. You don’t necessarily have to do these in that order, though, so feel free to create your second outline first and then cut both out at the same time if you find that easier.

, If you’re comfortable working on the floor, go ahead and continue doing so. If not, feel free to move the fabric to a worktable, since you won’t be using your own feet or legs as guides anymore. Either way, roll out the rest of your fabric if you haven’t already done so., Remove any weights that you have along one side of your fabric. Fold enough of it over to create a double layer of fabric for the leg of your boot to rest on while lying on its side. Lay your boot on top of that so that the front of the leg lines up with the fold. You only need the leg, not the foot, so keep the foot pulled down and off the fabric., Flatten the boot as much as you can while keeping its front lined up with the folded edge of fabric. Then draw an exact outline, starting at the bottom edge of the fabric, up along the back of the leg, and then up and over its top to the folded edge. Cut along your outline and repeat for your second leg.Only cut along the outline, not the fold. You want to keep this intact so that you still end up with a single piece of fabric despite the double layer.
Since you’re tracing along the outside of the boot for a liner that goes inside, you don’t need a seam allowance because there’s already extra surface area to your fabric.

, Unfold a leg piece and measure the width of its top. Now cut out two strips of fabric of equal length for your cuffs. This is the only part of your liner that people will see once you’re wearing your boot, so use a more decorative piece of fabric if you like.


Later on, the cuff will be sewn along the top of your leg piece so it can then fold over the top of your boot, so how big of a cuff you want is entirely up to you.

, To create the final pieces that you’ll need to sew your liners, you need three measurements. First, measure the length of either sole piece and mark that as your “bigger height.” Then measure the width of one of your leg pieces (keeping it folded just like it was before you cut it out) at its bottom, where your ankle will be, and mark that as your “smaller height.” Finally, measure the distance from your own ankle bone to the floor and then add a half inch (1.25 cm) for your “width.”, For the fabric piece that will cover the the top and sides of either foot, you need a double layer of fabric connected by a fold, just like you did for your leg pieces. Use your “bigger height” to determine how long your fold needs to be. Then use your “width” to determine how far the fabric needs to be folded over. Trace the outline of this rectangular shape on the top layer of fabric., First, cut out both layers of fabric along your outline. Remember to only cut the outline, not the fold. Keep the piece folded over as it was before you cut it out. Line up the folded side along whichever side your dominant hand is on. Starting from the top corner of the fold, cut out a half-parabola shape that ends at the opposite bottom corner. As you do, keep in mind that:The top of the rectangle is where your toes will be. The bottom is where your heels will be.
The half-parabola should start out by curving from the top folded corner (where your middle toes will be) and gradually turning inwards toward the opposite bottom corner.
Once you pass the point where your toes will meet your foot, the cut should then nearly straighten out on an almost direct line toward the opposite bottom corner.
You should now have three pieces: a larger piece with the fold intact, plus two smaller pieces trimmed off. These two smaller pieces can be discarded.

, First, refer to the your “smaller height” measurement. Starting from its bottom edge, measure and mark this distance along the larger piece’s fold. Then, starting from the same bottom corner, measure and mark roughly an inch (2.5 cm) along the bottom edge of your piece. Now cut a slightly curved line from that bottom mark up to the “smaller height” mark on the fold.


You should now have two pieces: one big, one small, both with a folded edge. The smaller one can be discarded.
When you unfold the larger piece, it should resemble the Starfleet insignia from Star Trek.

, Remember: you need one of these half-parabola shapes for each foot. But instead of making all those measurements again, simply place your first one on top of your fabric, trace the outline, and then cut that out. You can do this either by keeping the first piece folded over another double layer of folded fabric or spreading it out over a single layer, whichever you find easier., First, line up the toe end of one half-parabola piece with the toe of one sole piece. Pin the outer edges of the two pieces together with sewing pins. Then use your sewing machine to sew along the pinned edges with a quarter-inch seam allowance (0.64 cm). Then repeat with your other sole and half-parabola pieces for your second liner.Do not pin and sew the ends of the half-parabola together where they meet at your heel. Leave them open for right now.
When each one is finished, they should resemble a pair of booties or slippers.

, Take one of your leg pieces and line the folded edge up with the center of your half-parabola’s inner curve. Pin the two together right there. Now unfold the leg and pin the bottom of each side along the inner curve until you reach either end. Sew a seam along the ankle as before, then repeat with the other two pieces.As before, don’t pin and sew the back of the leg together just yet. Just worry about sewing the leg piece to the half-parabola for now.

, For each leg piece, take one of the fabric strips that you cut out for your cuffs and fold it in half lengthwise. Line up the two open edges with the top of your leg piece, so that the strip’s folded edge faces down toward the foot of your liner. Pin the open ends of the strip to the top of the leg piece, then sew the cuff’s two open edges to the very top of the leg., First, put on the thickest pair of socks and pants that you expect to wear when wearing your boots. Then slip your foot and leg inside your liner. Pull the open ends of the liner’s back together to determine how tight you’d like it to fit around you. Once you find a comfortable level of tightness, pin the open ends together. Then pull your feet out, close up the back, and repeat with your second to complete your project."

Bring ""Side B"" up, skipping one set of eyelets.,
Thread ""Side B"" across.,
Lace alternate eyelets in this pattern.,
Pull through and tie the ends together.",How to Lace Converse1," ""Side A,"" or the shoelace presently on the left side of the shoe, should be pulled through the left eyelet second from the bottom. Remember to keep the shoelace from curling up, especially if you are using flat laces.

;
, Pull the shoelace over the front of your shoe and into the right hole lying directly opposite the hole you pulled it through. You should see a horizontal bar across the front of your shoe. The end of this side should be tucked under the side of your Converse again.







, ""Side B,"" which currently lies on the right side of the shoe, should be pulled through the right eyelet third from the bottom. The hole second from the bottom should be occupied by ""Side A."" Remember, once again, do not curl the lace, especially if they are flat laces. Work your hands over the lace continuously until it is flat again.







, Pull the shoelace end across the front of the shoe and lace it into the left eyelet third from the bottom, directly opposite the eyelet you pulled it through. This should create another horizontal bar across the front of your shoe, and the end should remain hidden from the front.







, ""Side A"" should be laced through the eyelet pairs second, fourth, and sixth from the bottom. ""Side B"" should be laced through the eyelet pairs third, fifth, and seventh from the bottom. This should leave you with a column of horizontal bars without any diagonal underlying.







, Pull ""Side A"" through the right eyelet and ""Side B"" through the left eyelet at the top pair. Tie together with a standard shoelace bow to complete. You can also tuck the laces underneath the cushion of your shoe so you don't have laces hanging out of the top.

Pull the shoelace straight across the bottom set of eyelets.,
Thread ""Side A"" up and across.,
Thread ""Side B"" up and across.,
Cross the two sides back and forth.,
Pull the ends together at the top pair of eyelets.",How to Lace Converse2," The shoelace length depends on the number of eyelet pairs on your Converse shoes. This pattern works for shoes with both even, and non-even eyelets.For two pairs of eyelets, choose laces 28 inches (71 cm) long.
For three pairs of eyelets, choose laces 32 inches (81 cm) long.
For four pairs of eyelets, choose laces 36 inches (92 cm) long.
For five pairs of eyelets, choose laces 40 inches (102 cm) long.
For six pairs of eyelets, use laces 44 inches (113 cm) long.
For seven pairs of eyelets, use laces 48 inches (123 cm) long.
For eight pairs of eyelets, choose laces 53 inches (134 cm) in length.

, Thread the lace along the underside of the Converse, bringing both ends up through the bottom set of eyelets. There should be a straight horizontal bar connecting the two bottom eyelets. Make the length of each end as even as possible. 








This is the most traditional, common lacing style for shoes of all types. It is both simple and comfortable.

, Pull ""Side A,"" presently on the left side of the shoe, through the left bottom eyelet and into the right eyelet second from the bottom. This creates a diagonal line connecting the two eyelets. The shoelace should be pulled over the left bottom hole but pushed through the second-to-bottom hole on the right from the underside of the eyelet. Pull the lace through the right eyelet so that it comes out and over the top once more.







, Pull ""Side B,"" currently on the right side of the shoe, through the right bottom eyelet and into the left eyelet second from the bottom. Another diagonal line connecting the two eyelets should be created. Pull the shoelace over the right bottom eyelet but push it through the second-to-bottom eyelet on the left from the underside. Pull the lace end through the left eyelet so that it pokes through and drapes over the top once again.







, Continue alternating ""Side A"" and ""Side B"" back and forth, criss-crossing the two laces until you reach the top pair of eyelets. Each end should be pulled through its eyelet and laced into the eyelet on the opposite side one row up.







, Pull the two ends together as they come out and over the top eyelets of your Converse shoes. This should create another horizontal pathway, similar to the one at the bottom. Tie a normal shoelace knot when slipping the shoes on your feet. You can also tuck the laces underneath the cushion of the shoe if you don't want the laces showing.

Cross ""Side A"" diagonally upward.,
Cross ""Side B"" diagonally upward.,
Twist the shoelaces to the other side.,
Twist and cross until you reach the top.,
Pull the laces through the top and tie when ready.",How to Lace Converse3," The shoelace length depends on the number of eyelet pairs on your Converse shoes. You will need two different shoelaces in separate colors for this lacing style, but the two laces should be equal in length. You should select flat shoelaces that are fairly thin. Each eyelet will need to hold two layers of shoelace, so it is important that the shoelaces you choose are thin and flat, regardless of length.This lacing technique can be used on Converse with an odd number of eyelet pairs, but it will look most symmetrical with shoes that have an even number of pairs.
If using two pairs of eyelets, choose shoelace 28 inches (71 cm) long.
If using three pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 32 inches (81 cm) in length.
If using four pairs of eyelets, choose shoelaces 36 inches (92 cm) long.
If using five pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 40 inches (102 cm) in length.
If using six pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 44 inches (113 cm) long.
If using seven pairs of eyelets, use shoelaces 48 inches (123 cm) in length.
If using eight pairs of eyelets, choose laces 53 inches (134 cm) long.

, Arrange the two shoelaces so that they are evenly lined up and back-to-back. You should have, in appearance, a flat shoelace with double thickness and two sides. Note that this technique is fairly similar to the criss-cross lacing technique and uses the same general pattern. This is a popular lacing style for converse because it is fun, decorative, and easy to customize. It is slightly harder to tighten and tie than a single-lace method, however, so you should be aware of this fact before choosing this technique.







, Pull the double-laces through the bottom set of eyelets so that ""Color One"" shows. The other lace, ""Color Two,"" should be hidden behind the top lace. The shoelaces should be threaded into the eyelets from the bottom so that the ends come up through the eyelets. The ends should drape over the eyelet sides once this step is completed.







, Pull ""Side A"" out of the bottom left eyelet and through the second-to-bottom right eyelet. Make sure that the shoelaces are twisted so that ""Color Two"" is now on top while ""Color One"" is hidden on the bottom. A diagonal line should connect the bottom and second-to-bottom holes on opposing sides of the Converse. Pull the laces from the underside of the right second-to-bottom hole and over the top.







, Pull ""Side B"" out of the bottom right eyelet and through the second-to-bottom left eyelet. The shoelaces should be twisted to match the other half of the criss-cross. ""Color Two"" should show on the top and ""Color One"" should be hidden on the bottom. The two eyelets should be connected by a diagonal line. Pull the shoelaces through the left eyelet from the underside, letting them drape over the top of the left eyelet once you pull them through.







, Then repeat the crossing procedure. Repeat the criss-crossing pattern, but twist the shoelaces so that Color One is now on top while Color Two is now hidden on the bottom. Alternate ""Side A"" and ""Side B"" back and forth, criss-crossing the eyelets so that each end is pulled through its eyelet and into the eyelet on the opposite side one row up.







, Continue twisting and criss-crossing the shoelaces. Each ""x"" across your shoes should be composed of a single color, but each ""x"" should be the opposite color of the ""x"" beneath it and above it.







, When you pull the shoelaces through the top set of eyelets, it does not matter which side of the double-lace shows. Both sides will show when you tie your shoes. Alternatively, you can make tying the shoes easier by tucking one color shoelace into the top of your shoe and only tying the other color in the front of your shoe. Otherwise, you will tie your shoes using both laces.

Start with the eyelets closest to the toe.,
Feed the shoestring through the second eyelets.,
Repeat lacing in a criss cross fashion.,
Tie off the laces.,
Cut the extra shoestring.",How to Lace Skate Shoes1," Feed the right side of the shoelace down through the lowest right eyelet and feed the left side of the shoelace down through the left eyelet to create a straight line between the two eyelets.


Make sure the laces are the same length before moving on.;
, Take the shoestring on the left side of the shoe and cross it over to feed it down through the second eyelet on the right side of the shoe. Then, take the shoestring on the right side of the shoe and cross it over to feed it down through the second eyelet on the left side of the shoe.You should end up with a straight line between the bottom two eyelets, and an “x” between the second two eyelets.
The laces should be coming through the second eyelets towards the inside of the shoe.

, Continue to cross the shoestring end over and feeding them down into the eyelets to lace up the shoe. Stop when you get the last eyelets.


Make sure you are always feeding the shoestring down through the eyelets towards the inside of the shoe.

, When you reach the last eyelets, you need to tie off the shoestring to secure it in place. Take the shoestring on the left side of the shoe and make a knot in the string close to the eyelet on the inside of the shoe. Repeat this process with the shoestring on the right side of the shoe.

, After tying secure knots, you can cut off the excess shoestring. Leave about one half to one inch of shoestring after the knot and then cut off the rest. Cutting off the extra shoestring helps prevents the possibility of injury due to laces getting caught in your skateboard.If you don’t want to cut your laces, you can tie them in a bow inside your shoe behind the tongue instead.

Lace the last eyelet and tie.",How to Lace Skate Shoes2," By giving your eyelets numbers it will help you understand how to straight lace your shoes. Starting with the eyelets closest to the toe of the shoe and the number one, count up the eyelets assigning each pair of holes a number.

, Take one end of the shoestring and put it down into the left eyelet number one, and then take the other end of the shoestring and put it down into the right eyelet number one.You should end up with the shoestring making a straight line through both of the number one eyelets, and the ends of the laces should be on the inside of the shoe.

, Take the end of the left side of the shoestring and feed it up through the left side eyelet number two. Pull the shoestring across the shoe, and then feed it down through the right side number two eyelet.


Now you should have the left side of the shoestring down through eyelet number two on the right side of the shoe, and the right side of the shoestring down through eyelet number one on the right side of the shoe.

, Take the end of the right side of the shoestring and feed it up through the right side eyelet number three. Pull the shoestring across the shoe, and then feed it down through the left side eyelet number three.

, Take the end of the left side of the shoestring and feed it up through the right side eyelet number four. Pull the shoestring across the shoe, and then feed it down through the left side eyelet number four.

, Continue to lace the shoe in this fashion until you reach the second to last eyelet. Both sides of the shoestrings will be lacing in the same direction.


The left shoestring will lace the even numbered eyelets, and the right shoestring will lace the odd numbered eyelets.

, To lace the last eyelet, feed the shoestring that’s on the left side of the shoe up through the last eyelet on the left side. Feed the shoestring that’s on the right side of the shoe up through the last eyelet on the right side. Then tie your shoe strings together.


The laces should make straight lines between the eyelets of your shoes.

Start with some sort of ring around your toe of choice.,
Fasten an anklet around your ankle.,
Stretch out a length of twine across your foot.,
Cut the twine.,
Decorate the twine with beads.,
Tie one end of the strap to your anklet and the other to your toe ring.,
Trim any excess thread from each knot.,
Make a second ""sandal"" if you would like a matching set.",How to Make Barefoot Sandals1," This can be either a toe ring you bought at the store or a simple loop of twine. For barefoot sandals, ring placement is generally best on the second toe. However, the sandal will work with any toe on your foot. Just keep in mind that commercially-made toe rings are generally not made to fit your biggest toe., Like the toe ring, the type of ankle bracelet you choose is entirely up to you. Some possible choices of anklet are:


A store-bought anklet or bracelet.
Beads threaded onto an elastic cord. Just make sure that you can fit the stretched-out loop over your feet.
Simple lace or other decorative material that can be tied around your ankle. If you're tying your ""anklet"" directly to your ankle, be sure to pick a knot that is both secure but easy to undo at the end of the day.

, Place one end of the twine slightly past your anklet and your toe ring. Make sure the twine is fairly tight and without slack.


You may also use cloth, lace, or elastic cord instead of twine.
Do this step with your foot extended, unless your string is extra stretchy. If you measure with your foot flat on the ground, your string may be too short.

, Once you've positioned your twine how you want it without slack, cut it with a pair of scissors. While you want your sandal to be tight, make sure to leave about an extra inch on each end. You'll use this extra material to tie your sandal together.

, Sparkly beads that look like gems are popular for wedding sandals. If you're going for a hippie look, wood beads may be the best choice. For kids' anklets, plastic craft beads also work well.Try to coordinate the colors of your beads to match your toe ring and anklet. If you made your own beaded anklet, consider using the same beads for the strap.

, Make a secure double knot at each end. When tying the first end, you'll need to make sure the beads don't slide off the other side. Either ask a friend to hold the other end or use a bead stopper. A small piece of tape can act as a bead stopper as long as your beads aren't made of a heavy material like metal.

, Try to get as close to the knot as possible. Using small cuticle scissors will make this task much easier. Be very careful so as not to cut your bracelet or toe ring while you trim.


This completes your first barefoot sandal.

, You may also choose to wear just one or barefoot sandals in completely different colors. However, making an identical pair will be more likely to create the illusion of real sandals.

Gather your materials.,
Make your toe ring.,
Start off the main sandal top.,
Stitch the second row of your sandal top.,
Repeat the pattern of your second row a few more times.,
Do 100 chain stitches and tie off.,
Finish up with one more long chain.",How to Make Barefoot Sandals2," You'll need an H8/5 millimeter crochet hook and yarn. Pick a yarn that matches your hook size. Size 3 or ""light"" yarn is generally recommended for an H8 hook.However, double-check your yarn's label, which should list its recommended hook size.


You may also choose to add some beads, but these are optional.
Because this pattern is very simple, this is a great project for people new to crochet. However, you should practice your stitches before starting this project.
If you're already an advanced crocheter and would like to try something more challenging, try looking for more complicated patterns online.

, Start off by making 11 chain stitches. Join the two ends of this chain together using a slip stitch.The ring you've just made will loop around the wearer's second or third toe. If the wearer has very small or large toes, you will need to start with a shorter or longer chain. Try measuring the width of the wearer's toe before you begin to ensure a perfect fit.

, Do four more chain stitches. Next, make two double crochet stitches off of the third chain stitch from the hook. Turn your work for the next row.When making a ""turn"" in crochet, you want to make it so that the row that was previously closest to you is now furthest. Likewise, your crochet hook should now be on the opposite side from where it was before.

, Start by making two more chain stitches. Next, double crochet into every chain stitch from your first row. You should finish this row by double crocheting into those two chains stitches you made coming off of your first row at its third chain. Turn your work to start the next row. You should notice a triangle beginning to form., Make two chain stitches, double crochet into every chain of the previous row, and finish in what were the two chain stitches of the previous row. Be sure to turn at the end of each row.


How many times you make this repeat will depend on the size of the wearer's foot. The average adult woman's foot should take about three repeats after the second row. Check your work against the wearer's foot or an outline of it. The sandal top should end near the beginning of the ankle., Make 100 chain stitches, creating a long string. Finish the chain by binding off. This section will make one side of what will tie around the ankle.If you'd prefer a simpler look without complicated bows, you can make the chain shorter. Just remember that it has to be about the length it takes to wrap around the wearer's ankle.

, Attach yarn to the opposite end of the last row in your triangle. Make either another 100 chain stitches on the other side or however many you did for the first long chain. Complete your barefoot sandal with one final bind off.Wear the sandal by looping one end around one toe and tying the long chain around your ankle. One hundred chain stitches should give you a lot to work with. Try getting creative by tying a fancy bow.

If you pare it down to the absolute basics, all you need is a saw and a drill, but to do the job right you really need:

Hand saw with a fairly fine cross-cut blade.,
Materials: Wood and something for the thongs.,
Soles and ha: The soles for the typical adult geta are about 4 or 5 inches (10.2 or 12.7 cm) wide, 9 to 11 inches (22.9 to 27.9 cm) long, and 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) thick.,
Most lumber yards (and Lowes) only sell ""full"" boards, usually 8 feet (2.4 m) long.,
Thongs: I tried using nylon rope from the hardware store for the thongs, but it's not very comfortable.,
The next layer which brings the total diameter to nearly 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) is some sort of fuzzy stuff that's like the gray padding you see in some shipping envelopes -- it looks like lint.,Get about 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) for each pair.,
Miscellaneous: 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) nylon cord or rope for the small loop that holds the main thong between the toes.,
Carpenter's glue.,
Start thinking about ways to clamp the pieces in position while the glue dries.,
Another way is to put a couple large rubber bands around the pieces, tightly wrap masking tape around it, or to pile books or bricks on the joint.,
For the single piece Geta, it's going to take considerably more effort, but the result is a more authentic (and more durable) alternative to the fake geta.,
Finishing- To protect your wood from water/sweat damage, I suggest using polyurethane or another kind of wood finish to protect the wood.",How to Make a Pair of Geta (Wooden Sandals)," A tenon saw of back saw is perfect for this. Use this saw to cut out the major parts.
Coping saw or electric jig or sabre saw. Use one of these to round the corners of the sole, or if you're short on cash and patient use a wood rasp (a kind of file) or sandpaper. If you're not very skilled at sawing, you might want to get the rasp, too. It's great for cleaning up those rough coping saw edges.
A hand or electric drill. If you buy one, get an electric with a 3/8"" chuck. It probably costs less than a good hand drill and has more uses. If you go the hand route, be sure to get the right type of bit. If it's an egg-beater style drill then buy a 1/4"" drill or a 3/8"" with a 1/4"" shank. If it's a bit brace (big crank style), then buy a 3/8"" auger bit. A twist drill bit has a fairly flat end, while an auger bit has what looks like a wood screw on the end.
Sandpaper and a sanding block or electric sander. Get a good assortment of grits so that you can have a nice finish. A good grit to finish with is 220.
A chisel and a hammer (for the single-piece version);
, A good hardwood like Red Oak will last longer and should be available at your local Lowes or Home Depot. Alternatively, try a lumberyard., The ha are the same width, about 1 to 1 1⁄2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) thick and 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) high. The total wood requirements are about 2 feet (0.6 m) of 4 or 5 inch (10.2 or 12.7 cm) wide by 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) thick wood. And about a foot of wood 4 or 5 inches (10.2 or 12.7 cm) wide by 1 to 1 1⁄2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) thick., You can make geta for all your friends with the left over wood. Some places (home depot) will cut the wood to your dimensions, or will let you cut them yourself. There might be a charge for this -- an advantage of finding a place that does this is even if you do your own cutting, they will have scraps that are for sale so you may not have to buy 8 feet (2.4 m) after all. I have made the soles of geta out of plywood. It really offers no advantage except it's what I had lying around. A big disadvantage of plywood is it's usually only sold in 4 by 8 foot pieces. Once again ask about scraps. Before buying any type of wood, however, make sure it isn't pressure treated. This type of wood has been treated with potentially harmful chemicals to keep termites at bay, and is usually used for housing/outdoor projects. Pressure treated wood is usually darker in color, and, unfortunately, most wood sold at Home Depot and Lowe's has been pressure treated. Try a local lumberyard for wood that hasn't been pressure treated., The thongs in Japanese made geta are made of several layers. Innermost is some sort of natural fiber rope around 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) in diameter. Perhaps jute or hemp. Walmart does sell a 100% cotton cord which is a good thickness and is extremely comfortable., This is wrapped with brown paper, then inserted into a tube of black cloth. The cloth is very thin but has a fuzzy surface like felt. The best thing I've used so far is decorative piping that I buy at a fabric store. It's available in several diameters, very soft, and unfortunately only seems to come in white. I tried dying some black, but it shrunk and lost a lot of its softness. More experimentation is needed here such as finding a way to ""paint"" it without soaking it, or using a non-water based dye, or maybe starting with thicker piping. Perhaps a larger store may have it in other colors. I think the best diameter is 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) which is very comfortable, and can be pulled (barely) through a 1/4 hole. The kind I buy is actually marked 16/32"".,, This doesn't really have to be soft, but should be the same color as the main thong. You'll only need about a foot to make a pair of geta., This is packaged like Elmer's and other white glues, but is yellow. Titebond is a good brand. It's stronger and more suited for wood. I've also used hot glue to attach the ha. It's harder to work with because you don't really have time to fix mistakes. With a slow drying glue you can always slide the pieces into better position even after several minutes., A good option is genuine glue clamps. You can buy them at Walmart for a few dollars each. They're like a giant pair of plastic pliers with a spring that holds them closed. Mine are black plastic with red jaws and open to 4 inches (10.2 cm). If you really don't care about cost then buy some metal C-clamps. These ensure a tight bond, but don't tighten too hard, or all the glue will squeeze out and leave a dry, loose fitting joint., Around 10 pounds pressure is plenty, Cut two rectangular blocks each matching the combined dimensions above that will encompass the whole of the sandals. These will become both the soles and ha. Make a template and draw out the measurements on the blocks of wood until you have a basic idea of how you're going to cut things. You're going to have two lines that represent the inside edges of the ha, that stop at where the sole will be. Cut these edges and stop at the sole, and then slowly chisel out the rectangular space between the two ha. After that, cut the outer edges of the ha and cut the bottom edges of the sole. repeat this with the second piece, sand, and you're done. You'll most likely have to touch up the bottom of the sole between the two ha., This also brings out the Red Oak's natural color and darkens it a bit. Oil based polyurethane works the best."

In addition, the insole may not match the inside contours of fake TOMS shoes., If the insoles are flat and do not contain mounds to support the arches of your feet, the TOMS shoes are most likely fake., Counterfeit shoes are generally not as well made as the genuine article. One way to evaluate this is to look at the stitching. Do you notice any uneven stitching or threads that are coming lose? If so, the shoes are probably fakes., Ensure that the size printed on the inside of the shoe matches with the actual size of the shoe.

Locate the problem.,
Sprinkle with powder.,
Swab with WD40 or silicone spray.,
Rub with leather conditioner.",How to Fix Squeaky Shoes1," Walk back and forth with your shoes, then rock your feet forward and back, then left to right. When you find the motion that causes the squeak, look for the parts of the shoe that bend during that motion.


If possible, have a friend crouch near the floor and listen carefully while you walk.;
, Once you know what part of the shoe is squeaking, sprinkle that area with baby powder, corn starch, or baking powder. This will absorb noisy moisture, and reduce noise from two shoe parts rubbing together. Here are a few common problem areas and how to fix them:


If the inside of the shoe squeaks, lift the insoles and sprinkle powder along the inner seam.If your insoles are non-removable, rub the powder into the edge of your shoe base.
Powder the tongue of the shoe under the laces if the tongue squeaks.
If the base of the shoe squeaks, there are probably air cushions. Massage the powder into the base at the seam or air bubble., These are more effective at removing squeaks than leather conditioner, but require careful application to avoid damage. Spray one of these lubricants onto a cotton swab or cotton ball. Rub it into the outside seam of the shoe, working along the squeaky area or its entire outline.Do not use oil-based materials on suede, or the fuzzy nap could be destroyed.

, If you are using leather shoes, keep them lubricated by rubbing in a leather conditioner and buffing with a dry cloth.Be sure to purchase suede conditioner for suede shoes, not general purpose leather conditioner.

"
"
Know the return policy before trying these methods.,
Try saddle soap.,
Glue on loose heels.,
Fill damaged soles with silicone caulk.,
Take the shoes to a repair shop.",How to Fix Squeaky Shoes2," If you are trying to fix a new shoe, the squeak may be a manufacturing defect that makes you eligible for a refund or replacement. Using glue or other heavy-duty materials may void your warranty.

, Saddle soap is controversial among owners of fine leather shoes. Some claim it causes the leather to dry out, while others find it harmless. If you're willing to take this risk, apply saddle soap in small quantities to the problem area, and buff with a dry cloth. This may be particularly effective on a squeaky tongue.Never use saddle soap on suede.

, This should only be done if none of the ""easy fixes"" above work, since excess glue can easily damage or stain shoes. If the shoe heel is loose, use a small dab super glue or rubber cement to reattach it firmly, pressing together for several seconds until the adhesive begins to take hold.This will not work on urethane shoes.
Take expensive high heels to a shoe repair shop instead to avoid the risk of damage.

, Purchase a tube of silicone caulking material with a squeeze top, or a specialized silicone product for shoe repair. Stick the nozzle of the tube into an open space between the shoe and the sole, and slowly squirt it in until the void is filled. Clamp the shoe together with rubber bands, weights, or hardware clamps and let dry overnight.

, Take the shoes to a cobbler or repair shop and ask for advice, or hire someone to fix it for you. About half of squeaky shoes squeak due to a loose shank inside the shoe, or another problem that should be left to a professional."
"
Check the cause of squeaking in your wet shoes.,
Remove the insoles.,
Stuff the shoes with newspaper.,
Use a cedar shoe tree if possible.,
Leave on its side at room temperature.",How to Fix Squeaky Shoes3," Many shoes are only squeaky when wet. Sometimes, this is just the sound made by rubber soles on linoleum, hard wood, or other slick floor materials. Other shoes swell up or develop structural issues when wet that cause squeaking, and these can be treated using the other methods on this page. Either way, the drying methods in this section will teach you to dry your shoes quickly and effectively, without causing damage to the shoe.

, If you shoes have removable insoles, take them out and dry them separately to speed up the process.

, Bunch up the dry paper and fit it into the shoe. Press the first piece all the way into the toe for maximum absorbency.

, A ""shoe tree"" is a branched object inserted into the shoe instead of newspaper, meant to maintain the shoe's shape while it dries. A shoe tree made of cedar is especially effective, since the wood will wick moisture out of the shoe., Rest the shoe on its side or prop it against a wall so the sole of the shoe is exposed to the air while drying. Dry in a warm room, but not next to any heat sources."

, Your leg should be bent slightly and your shin should be in front of your ankle. Try to put your foot perpendicular to any lines on your paper. You can stand, sit on a chair or crouch down.

, You can wear the socks you are planning to wear with the shoes you would like to buy, but don't wear shoes.








, Use your marker to draw straight line touching each side of the outline.








, Use a tape measure or ruler to measure from the top to bottom. Write this number down. This number will largely determine your shoe size.








, Measure between the lines on the left and right sides and write the number down. Many shoes come in different widths, so this number will determine which version to buy.








, This is to accommodate the small space between the line made by the pencil and your actual foot.

, Men and women use different sizes, as do different countries.

Firstly, you need to make sure that they have nothing on them already, if you have polished them before, give them a quick sanding with some fine sandpaper.,
You will need some Kiwi Black shoe polish (NOT PARADE GLOSS, the paraffin will stop you from getting that mirror finish).

,
The first thing you need to do now is take a cotton wool, wet it, rub it on the nose of the shoe, then rub it in some shoe polish and rub THAT on the nose of the shoe, making sure the layer of polish is rather thin.,
Now get a fresh cotton wool, soak it in some water, and start to rub it on the nose of the shoe, moving in small circles about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) wide.,
Continue this for as long as it takes, small circles should appear and then they should disappear.,
Repeat it as many times as necessary, as it will take quite a while in the beginning, needing many layers to build up a substantial base of polish, but once you have achieved that, it only takes a minute before each and every parade/inspection to retouch it to its full glory.

",How to Give Your Parade Shoes That Mirror Finish," make sure they are clean as well.;
,, It is best to work in numerous thin layers to build up a permanent shine.

, If they are too big you will achieve nothing and if they are too small you will be there forever!!

, once there is no sign of the matt polish, you should get your soft cloth ideally a microfibre cloth used for cleaning glasses, holding the shoe tight, and buff up the nose really hard and quickly, drying it and giving it that mirror shine.

Find a bra you can use for practice.,
Check out the mechanism that keeps a bra fastened.,
Practice unhooking the bra with one hand.",How to Undo a Bra One Handed1," Volunteer to do the laundry. Make sure no one is around, and then take a look at your mom's or sister's bra. It might seem weird at first, but it can take a while to learn to unhook a bra with both hands, and this is an easy way to get some practice.


You can buy a bra cheap at a thrift store--just pretend you are shopping for your girlfriend or for a costume party.
You can order something online that is like a fabric bracelet that clasps around your wrist using the exact eyelet and hooks you would find on a bra. You can use this to practice unhooking the bracelet with your free hand.
If you're a girl then it's a little easier and you can practice with your own bra.;
, Most bras have two wide straps (or bands) that connect across the back. A series of hooks are stitched to the end of the left strap (assuming the person wearing the bra is facing you), and eyelets sewn on the right strap. (If the person has their back to you, then the hooks will be on the right and the eyelets on the left.) There may be one hook and one eyelet, or somewhere between 2 and 5 rows and columns of hooks and eyelets.Some front-fastening bras have one large hook that slides down into a loop of fabric, rather than side to side or forward and back, like with the hook and eyelet.

, You can fasten the bra around a pillow or rolled up sleeping bag--something roughly the size of a human torso. This will pull the bra strap taut so you can practice when there is tension in the strap.


You may want to start by just hooking and unhooking the bra when it is loose and there is no tension in the strap so you can get the feel for how the eyelets hook and unhook.
Practice using first one hand, then the other, to see which one feels better. It may not necessarily be your dominant hand.

Check the fit to make sure that everything feels right.,
Pay special attention to the way that the shoe is constructed.,
Make sure that you buy your child the most appropriate shoe for his age and for what your child will be using the shoe for.",How to Fit Your Kid for Shoes1," Make sure that the shoe is the appropriate length and width for your child’s foot. If a shoe squeezes a child’s foot too much, it can cause the child to have foot conditions such as blisters and calluses. Remember that your child’s foot will grow at a rapid pace and that he may need to be fitted every few months for a new size. So, if your child takes off his shoe and you notice that there are red marks on your child’s foot, it may be time to take your child in for a new fitting and buy him a new shoe.;
, You will want to make sure that the upper level of the shoe is made from a comfortable material. You will want the material to be one that is flexible and breathes well so that your child’s foot will not sweat and so that the top of the shoe does not push down on your child’s foot. Some good materials are leather and canvas. There are also some shoes that are made out of a mesh material that can help your child’s foot to breathe better. Make sure that the shoe is made of absorbent material to help absorb sweat and also make sure that the shoe has a good gripping on the bottom. You will not want to buy your child a shoe that makes him slip and slide around. Safety should always be your number one priority when purchasing shoes for your child.

, If you are buying a shoe for a baby that only crawls, you will only need to buy booties or no-slip socks that are designed to keep your child’s foot warm. If you are buying a shoe for a child who is just learning to walk, you will need to make sure that the child has a shoe that helps with the walking process and does not hinder it. You will want to make sure that the shoe is comfortable and safe. Choose a shoe that is light and will not cause your child to sweat and become uncomfortable.

Slide your hand up the back of her shirt to her bra band.,
Slip your middle and index fingers under the band and pull it away from her body.,
Place your thumb on the other side of the band.,
Slide or push your thumb over your two fingers, unhooking the hooks.",How to Undo a Bra One Handed2," Run your hand over the center of her back and feel for a slightly bulkier section of the bra made up of thicker fabric, or the gap where the hook and eyelet are connected. If the back of the bra is completely smooth, she may be wearing a front-fastening bra, or a bralet or sports bra that has to be removed over her head, like a shirt.









Now would be a good time to confirm that she wants you to proceed. When your hand is on the clasp, simply pause and ask her, ""Is this okay?"" Don't disrespect your partner by assuming she's okay with you taking off her bra.
If she says no, stop what you're doing and go back to making out.
Make sure your hand is warm before you slide it under her shirt. It could be an unpleasant shock to place a cold hand on her warm skin.

, Your two fingers should be right underneath where the band fastens, or under eyelets where they meet the hook. This should relieve some of the tension that keeps the hook securely in the eyelet.








, Pinch the fabric between your thumb and your two fingers. The section of fabric you are squeezing should be where the two sides of the band overlap. If you are only grasping one layer of fabric, nothing will happen when you try to unhook the bra.

, Make sure you are pinching the fabric tightly. It is almost the same movement as if you were snapping your fingers, only using three fingers instead of two. You may also want to think of the movement as squeezing or pinching the material between your fingers and thumb while sliding your thumb forward so the hooks release.

Move you hand up between her breasts and feel for the clasp in the center of the bra.,
Slide your middle and index finger under the clasp and lift it away from her body.,
Press your thumb against the clasp.",How to Undo a Bra One Handed3," It will be made of metal or plastic and should lay flat against her sternum. Most women wear bras that fasten in the back, so check her back before you try to unclasp the front of her bra.


Though it's probably obvious what you're doing, make sure she's okay with what you are about to do. It doesn't have to be a big deal and can even be kind of sexy. Just pause and whisper ""Is this okay?"" If she tells you yes then you can proceed.
If she says no, don't try to force anything. Just remove your hand and enjoy kissing her.

, This relieves some of the tension in the bra. If it is not an eyelet closure, there may just be two metal or plastic pieces that snap together and lock when flat against her chest. If this appears to be the case, spread your fingers so they are on either side of the clasp.

, If the bra is fastened with a hook and eyelet, then you will make the same snapping, squeezing movement as you would with a back-fastening bra. If not, you will need to push one side of the clasp up so that it unfastens from the other side. Pinch one side of the clasp between your thumb and index finger and pull up while your middle finger pulls down on the opposite side of the clasp.


The hook is not always on the same side, so if this doesn't work, try pressing your thumb against your middle finger and pulling up while your index finger pulls down.

Use a piece of paper to measure your child’s foot.,
Know that there are times of the day that are best for fitting your child’s shoes.",How to Fit Your Kid for Shoes2,"


Place the paper on a surface that is flat and line it up along the wall.
Draw a line down the piece of paper.
Place your child’s heel on the paper so that it is touching the wall and then have your child’s big toe and heel centered with the line that you drew.
Mark the paper at this point. Do this to both feet and compare the sizes.
You can take this to your shoe store and this will help your store clerk to make sure that your child gets the right fit.

, Your child’s foot will expand throughout the day, so what may fit your child in the morning, may not fit your child at night.


Try to measure your child’s foot near the end of the day when his foot is at its largest size.
Be sure to use the socks that your child will be wearing when he is walking in the shoe.
Make sure that you have a pair of lightweight socks so that your child’s foot can breathe well.
The best way to measure a child’s foot is to do so when he is standing up straight as opposed to sitting or slouching. If he is not straight, it can cause the measurement to be wrong.
It is important for parents to check to see if the child’s foot is still the same size every few months.

Wear boxers for medical benefits.,
Use boxers to increase fertility.,
Make sure you have enough support.,
Attract your significant other by wearing boxers.,
Use boxers to show your personality.,
Follow underwear etiquette.,
Pick your style of boxers.,
Wear boxers to hide your flaws.,
Choose the fabric.,
Consider color.",How to Wear Boxers," Try boxers, not briefs, if you're looking to improve testicular health. Some studies have found that men who wear boxes are healthier. Men who want to impregnate women may increase their chances by switching to boxers.


The research shows that boxers can positively affect sperm quality. The reason for this is because briefs can increase the temperature on the testicles, which leads to poorer sperm.
Even better yet, wear boxers during the day, and then wear nothing at night. One study found doing so led to lower levels of damaged DNA in sperm.;
, If you want to really increase your fertility, though, you need to remember that it takes 10 to 11 weeks for sperm to be produced. Thus, it’s not going to work if you change to boxer shorts the night before you want to get a woman pregnant. This needs to be a longer term strategy.Because the key is reducing heat around the testicles, you should also stay away from saunas and hot tubs. If you sit for long periods of time or play a lot of sports, try not to wear tight clothes.

, Make sure you take into consideration the need for support. Boxers are not going to be a great idea when you are working out.


Boxers are for those moments when support is not an issue. Consider: A date in which you take your significant other to dinner. Or wearing boxers under a suit at an event.
Some people prefer to go commando. Not only will this provide you no support at all, but it will offend some people if they can tell through your clothes somehow. Only go commando when you’re sleeping at night.

, Maybe you think that women (or men) will prefer you in briefs. After all, they’re tighter, right? This makes you think they will show a person what you’ve “got.”


Wrong. Studies have shown that women, in particular, prefer boxers. There’s something to be said for a little mystery, and briefs can seem too casual and obvious.Think about it. How good is it really going to look if you take off a nice suit to reveal tighty-whities underneath? Not great. Boxers come in different patterns and colors, so they can seem more professional.

, Boxers are great because they can highlight a certain vibe you’re trying to create.


Some men use boxers to show their creative streaks. Others choose humorous boxers that are a play on favorite TV shows. Boxers, thus, make a statement that briefs can not do.
Yet, other men choose professional patterns that show their maturity and class. Which boxers you choose tells your significant other a lot about you. Let’s be honest. You can’t get many pictures or patterns on a pair of briefs.

, Yes, your underwear can tell a person a lot about you. There is such a thing as underwear manners.


Old underwear should be tossed out. If underwear is graying, ripped, or otherwise gross, get rid of it. Some experts think you should throw away your underwear every month.Change your underwear every day and maybe even more if you work out a lot or are in an environment where you are sweating profusely.
Have fun with your underwear. Switch it up. You don’t have to wear only briefs or boxers. You can mix and match on different days. Surprise your significant other!

, You might want to try boxer briefs. This is a middle road compromise. These are basically briefs with legs.


Boxers can seem more professional than briefs, but boxer briefs emulate some of the positives of boxers.
Thus, they mirror the style of boxers while showing off your shape. Because they extend down your thigh, they will prevent chafing., Men who are aging might prefer boxers because they can hide more imperfections.


Let’s be blunt. If you’ve got a beer belly (or the start of one) or a sagging scrotum (hey, we’re all going to get old), boxers are probably the way to go. They hide more.
Think of tight briefs as the equivalent of a Speedo swimming suit. No one really wants to see a man over 40 in a Speedo. Frankly, some women don’t want to see a man of any age in a Speedo., Boxers are great because they come in different fabrics, whereas briefs might be a bit more limited in choices.


For example, you can choose silk boxers, cotton or synthetic blend. Silk will send signals of class, wealth, and professionalism.
You may want to vary the fabric depending on whether you’re going to work or an event or slumming it on the weekend.

, The great thing about boxers is that they come in different colors. Avoid white unless you want to spend more money because they won’t last as long.Remember that the sizing can be different for European versus American brands. Make sure you size the boxers right. If you wear boxers that are too big, they could bunch up and look unsightly.
Boxers come in colored waistbands especially if you’re into the look where they show a little at the top of the jeans. Be aware that this look can seem unprofessional to some people.

Choose the right size of tights.The most important step in putting on tights is to start with the correct size.,
Prepare your hands and feet.Once your tights get a tear, they are more or less useless.,
Remove packaging from your new tights.Unfold your tights carefully and take out any cardboard backing tucked inside of them.,
Stretch the tights gently lengthwise.,
Hold the tights in front of you.,
Gather one leg of your tights to the toe.,
Ease the foot of the tights over your foot, from toe to heel.Point your toe and slip your foot inside the tights.,
Pull the tights up your leg.,
Pull up the tights.Once you've partially pulled the tights up each leg, stand up and continue gently unrolling the material.,
Make necessary adjustments.,
Perfect your pattern.",How to Put on Tights," Otherwise, you're going to have trouble no matter how you try to get them on.


Tights are often sized according to weight and height. Check the packaging that comes with the tights to determine what size matches your weight and height range.
If you are uncomfortable when your tights are too tight, go ahead and move up one size. Your tights usually will fit well enough still to stay around your waist.
If you are taller than average or have longer-than-average legs, choose a size marked ""tall.""
If your measurements fall in between sizes, always choose the larger of the two.;
, Make sure you aren't wearing jewelry that could snag the material. You'll also want to buff any rough edges from your fingernails, toenails, hands and feet.

, To ensure you don't accidentally tear the tights, gently fold the cardboard in half so you can ease it out the top of your tights.

, Stretch enough to create some give in the tights before you start putting them on. Be careful not to pull too hard and risk tearing them.

, While sitting, be mindful to hold them with the front facing forward. You can check for tags inside the waist band that will signify the back.

, Starting on either the right or left side, hold the waist of the tights and gently bunch the leg, gathering the fabric until the inside of the toe is exposed.

, Put your whole foot inside and arrange the bottom of the tights' foot so that the seam at the toe runs across the tip of your toes. Make sure the foot of the tights fits nicely around your toe and heel.


Keep your thumbs inside, pointed downward and the nail-side against you to avoid senselessly snagging your tights.
You might need to stretch the opening a bit to make sure your foot slides inside without catching on the fabric. Pointing your toe will help prevent your toenail from snagging the tights.
If either the toe or heel of the tights is crooked, you'll want to make sure it's straightened or you'll have trouble with later steps.

, Gently stretch the material of the tights, and unroll it up your leg to above your knee, near your mid-thigh. Ease it on carefully and slowly so the fabric doesn't pull or rip.


If the fabric is twisted or bunched at the knees, straighten it before proceeding.
Repeat these steps to pull the tights up your other leg. Gather the waist and toe of the other leg to create an easy pathway for your foot. Point your toe and insert your foot, lining up the toe of the hose so that the seam runs across your toes. Gently pull the tights leg up over your calf and knee to your mid-thigh. Make sure the leg of your tights isn't bunched or twisted.

, Continue to pull up the tights further, until the waist band is positioned around your natural waistline. You'll have the best luck if you pull the material up on one side, then the other, before finishing with the hips and waist.


If there are areas left rumpled or baggy, or if the legs don’t seem to be long enough, roll the tights down to the knees again. Just sit down, gently stretch them out and roll them back up. Be careful not to yank them back up from the top or they will likely tear., Check for areas where the tights are bunched or places where your skin feels pinched. Your tights should feel snug, but not uncomfortable.


If you see a place where your tights are twisted, your best bet is to take them off and repeat the process more carefully.
Use the flats of your hands to adjust any wrinkles.

, If you're wearing patterned or seamed tights, you'll want to ensure that the design is placed appropriately on your legs. Try putting on a pair of rubber gloves to make small adjustments for a flawless finish instead of pinching the tights with your fingers and risking a tear.

Wash your new lingerie before wearing them, even though it may be a brand new piece.,
Soak the garments for no more than 1/2 hour in light detergent.,
Do not mix the dark coloured ones with the light ones.,
Remove any loose buckles or anything else that doesn't belong in the lingerie wash bowl.,
Wash padded areas carefully.,
Do not squash the bra or padding while washing as it will deform the shape.,
Rinse away the detergent thoroughly as most people do not pay attention to this step.,
Hang up the lingerie to dry if possible.,
Use a lingerie bag when drying your delicates in a clothes dryer.

,
Stowing them in their original shape is the best way to preserve the shape.",How to Take Care of Your Lingerie," For sanitary reasons and to rid the new garments of potential chemical residue, it is a good idea to wash new lingerie. So, be kind to your skin, just wash them before wearing.;
, Depending on where you live, the brands and types may vary, but pick the one that is easy to dissolve. Mix the detergent with water before putting in the lingerie. Make sure that they are evenly mixed or you might end up having blotches in your bra or G-strings.

, Yes, this is a basic rule but we still do this when we are lazy, lumping them together in a tub and then tears roll down when the pure white lace becomes antique rust colour.

, This helps prevent rust spots forming on delicate lingerie.

, Pay attention the areas that trap sweat. Make sure you wash them thoroughly or it might give you some nasty rashes the next time you wear it.

, Just press them gently. Put the cup of the bra in the centre of one palm and use your fist from the other hand to press against the cup, this will drain out the water without squashing the cups.

, Detergent weakens the fibers of the material and leaving them on just speeds up the erosion. In time to come, you will notice that your favourite sexy lace bra is not as snug as before. Yes, the bra has expanded, not your breasts!

, If not, clip on the straps and the middle portion of the bra, unless you want an imprint of the clothes peg on the padded portion, never snap a peg on the cups portion.

,, If you crush them or fold them, you are likely to destroy the shape of the bra. If you are not careful, not only will the bra not enhance your cleavage, you might end up looking like you have extra nipples.

Go through her underwear.,
Check her size.,
Gauge her tastes.,
Make a note of what she needs.Once you have a more solid idea of what types of lingerie she likes to wear, go through her drawer again.,
Share fantasies to learn her tastes.",How to Pick Lingerie for a Girlfriend1," When you are at her place, wait for your girlfriend to become distracted by something that will keep her busy for a few minutes (e.g. talking on the phone, paying bills, walking the dog). Then sneak into her bedroom and peek in her underwear drawer.Or, if you want to win some bonus points with her, offer to do her laundry once it has piled up. Either way, gain access to her underwear and nightwear to find out what she needs size- and style-wise.;
, Once you have access to her underwear, note down the sizes of her bras, panties, and any other lingerie she might own. With bras, be sure to note down both the number (chest-size) and the letter (cup-size).Also, make a note of the company that made each article, since sizing may vary between brands.If possible, find at least three bras and three panties that are each made by different companies. When you go shopping, provide this info to the staff so they can guide you with sizing if you want to buy lingerie made by a different company altogether., Now that you have her size written down, go through her undies again and get a sense of what she prefers. Write down which colors and fabrics she gravitates toward. Find out if she ever buys herself thongs or if she is clearly more comfortable wearing briefs and/or boyshorts. With bras, look for which style she tends to buy most often: full cups, half-cups, sheer, strapless, camisole-style, etc.While you are in her room, also check out the shades of makeup that she likes to wear as a helpful indicator of what colors she might enjoy in lingerie.

, Keep a rough tally of how many articles of each type you find. Note the condition they are in, as well. Find out what she is running low on or will need to replace soon.


Keep in mind that, while your girlfriend probably never wears a pair of panties more than once in between washes, she might wear each bra a few times before washing it. So if she has an even number of bras and panties, take that to mean that she may need a few more panties., If you want to buy her something beyond mere bras and panties, but she owns nothing else to point you in the right direction, propose a little dirty talk via phone, text, or email when you aren’t together. Tell each other stories. Note what kinds of lingerie she chooses when she describes how she is dressed. Keep a pen handy in case she mentions anything you don’t recognize by name.

"
Form a budget.,
Factor in her tastes.,
Research other styles of lingerie.,
Emphasize her best assets.,
Consider the occasion.,
Keep her personality in mind.,
Brave the brick-&-mortar stores.",How to Pick Lingerie for a Girlfriend2," Brace yourself for the high cost of lingerie, but don’t let it dissuade you. The price-tag usually reflects the quality of materials and support, so if you can’t afford the good stuff right away, be patient. Set aside money when you can. Impress your girlfriend with quality, long-lasting items that feel good to the touch, rather than waste your money on something so cheap that it quickly falls apart, irritates her skin, and/or just looks blah.For a safe, minimal guesstimate, plan to spend around $100 on a matching top-&-bottom set., Draw inspiration from what you found in her underwear drawer. Consider what she already owns and think of how you can vary her collection without straying too far from her preferences. Sort through different colors, materials, and cuts that will give her more options, while still adhering to what you know she likes. For example:Are most of her pieces solid black? Then find other pieces in black, only with some detail that spices it up, like a red or white bow, trim, or ribbing.
Does she have a wide variety of colors, but the pieces themselves are pretty plain and merely functional? Find items in similar colors, only with more intricate and/or racy designs.

, If “bras” and “panties” are the only items you can identify by name, expand your terminology if you wish to dress your lady in more than just those. Peruse websites for online retailers to learn the various categories of other lingerie. If you have a specific item in mind but can’t find a label that identifies it, print the image to bring with you to the store, rather than try to describe it in vague terms to the salesperson.Popular styles include babydolls, bustiers, chemises, corsets, garter belts, and teddies., Take her own body issues into consideration, whether or not you feel they are warranted. Be sure that, whatever you end up buying her, she will feel comfortable wearing it.Browse items that show off or highlight those areas of her body that she is most proud of. Steer clear of pieces that call attention to areas that make her feel embarrassed.


For example, if your girlfriend complains about having a big butt, nix the thong. If she feels self-conscious about her tummy, opt for a loose babydoll instead of a tight-fitting camisole.

, If this is a gift meant for a holiday like Christmas or Hanukkah, keep your picks exciting, but still well within the conservative realm. Prioritize elegance over raciness to avoid offending her in case she takes the spirit of the season very seriously. Do the same with her birthday to make sure she knows this is a gift for her and not for you. But for occasions like Valentine’s day, anniversaries, or even just the hell of it, feel free to be more daring and surprise her with something naughty., Resist the temptation to dress your girl up solely according to your own fantasies and preferences. When you come across items you like, imagine that she is shopping with you. Anticipate her reactions before you spend money on something that, had you thought about it first, you should have known would never, ever be worn by her.Does she tend to keep her inner child on full display? Stick to bright, playful colors and designs with polkadots and bows.
Is she more of a lady with a capital L? Choose a garter belt and stockings to match a fancy top-&-bottom set, or go with an elegant charmeuse.

, If you are male, shopping online may seem like an easy way to avoid feeling like a creep in the lingerie aisle, but rest assured: sales staff are well accustomed to helping husbands and boyfriends select items for their special ladies. Rely on their experience and advice to improve the odds of making your girl happy.Also, the image of a certain item might look enticing online, but not so much when it arrives in the mail.


Give the salesperson your list of sizes that you found in your girl’s underwear drawer if there are any discrepancies between brands.
Show them pictures of your girl so they have an idea of her body-type, skin-tone, preference in makeup, and overall sense of style. This way, they can give you more informed recommendations if you are uncertain of what to get.

Surprise your girlfriend with a shopping trip.If you feel too overwhelmed by all the choices out there, and/or feel uncertain of what your girlfriend thinks is too outrageous, then bring her along!,
Let her try on whatever she likes.,
Flatter her when you like a certain piece.,
Be cautious in how you express distaste.",How to Pick Lingerie for a Girlfriend3," Rely on the ultimate expert of what your girlfriend likes: your girlfriend. Make shopping together an adventurous prelude to breaking out your purchase at home.

, If your budget is an issue, stick to it when it comes time to select what you are actually going to bring home with you that day. In the meantime, though, let your girlfriend try on the whole store if she likes. Make a mental note of what she immediately gravitates toward, as well as any unexpected items that excite her. Know exactly what to buy the next time around when you go shopping on your own.

, If you feel excited by an item that she tries on but feels uncertain about, express it!Be sure to compliment her, though, rather than the item alone, as in, “You look great in that,” instead of, “That looks great.” Build her self-confidence so she feels perfectly comfortable wearing the styles you like most.

, Should your girlfriend absolutely love a piece that totally turns you off, don’t be dismissive. Give the reason why you don’t like it some thought, even if (or especially if) your knee-jerk reaction is instantly negative. Before you share the reason why, compliment the way she looks in it so her self-esteem isn’t threatened. Then let her know why you don’t find that particular item attractive, and finish with a complimentary suggestion of how another, similar piece might satisfy the both of you."

Decide how you want the top to fit.,
Decide what level of sheerness you want.,
Pick the right size.,

Gather one leg of the pantyhose to the toe.,
Point your toe and slip your foot inside.,

Learn how to stop a run from getting longer.",How to Put on Pantyhose," All pantyhose are constructed so that the top part fits like a panty, which serves the dual purpose of keeping the pantyhose from falling down and hugging your shape to create a slimmer silhouette. The amount of ""control"" in the top part of the pantyhose varies from high control to none. Choose the type of top that caters to your personal preferences, giving you both the look and comfort level you want.


Control-top pantyhose have built-in underwear that fits tightly around the midsection. If you're interested in smoothing out your curves, this might be the right option for you. However, many people find that control-top pantyhose feel uncomfortably tight, and sometimes dig in at the waist to create a cinched appearance.
Regular, standard panty-hose have a simpler construction and aren't meant to provide extra support around your midsection. If you don't want to change the look of your shape, opt for these instead of the control top pantyhose.;
, Pantyhose range from very (or ""ultra) sheer to opaque, and the different levels of sheerness result in quite different final looks. If you pick very sheer pantyhose that match your skin tone, it might not look like you're wearing pantyhose at all. Opaque pantyhose have a much more noticeable appearance.


Sheer pantyhose are a bit flimsier than thicker opaque pantyhose - something to keep in mind if you're concerned about durability.
Opaque pantyhose are a little warmer than sheer pantyhose, so they're better suited to winter wear.

, Pantyhose are usually sized according to weight and height, since they need to stretch from a person's toes to the waist. Check the packaging that comes with the pantyhose and determine what size matches your weight and height range.


If you hate the feeling of wearing too-tight pantyhose, size up! The pantyhose will likely still be tight enough to stay around your waist instead of falling down.

, Some pantyhose come with extra that are intended to make them feel more comfortable. If you've had trouble finding a pair that feels comfortable in the past, consider experimenting with different features to see if they make a difference. For example, you might try the following:


Pantyhose with a rubbery band around the waist. You might see these labeled as ""no-slip"" pantyhose.
Toeless, footless or crotchless pantyhose, depending on which areas tend to feel most constrained when you wear them.

, Patterned or seamed pantyhose can be quite pretty. For example, pantyhose with seams up the back of the legs might lend your outfit an interesting vintage look. They're a bit more difficult to put on, since it's necessary to make sure the pattern is straight on both legs, but if you use the right technique they'll look fantastic.

, To keep from snagging a hangnail or patch of rough skin on your pantyhose, prepare your hands, feet and legs to make the process easier. Here are a few things you might do to get ready:


File your fingernails and toenails.
Shave or wax your legs (especially if your hose are sheer).
Moisturize your hands, legs and feet.
Take off any rings and bracelets that may catch on the nylon material and damage the pantyhose.

, Check for the tag and position the pantyhose so that you'll be putting them on with the tag in the back. They're constructed to be put on a certain way, and putting them on backwards could make them look and feel strange.

, Starting on either the right side or left, hold the waist of the pantyhose and gently bunch the leg so that the inside of the toe is exposed. The point is to create an easy pathway for your foot, so that you can place it inside the length of the hose leg without tearing the fabric.

, You might need to stretch the opening a bit to make sure your foot can fit inside without catching on the fabric. Pointing your toe will help prevent your toenail from snagging the hose. Put your whole foot inside and arrange the bottom of the hose leg so that the seam at the toe runs across the tip of your toes.


Make sure the leg isn't twisted when you put your foot inside. If it's twisted, it will be difficult to pull the pantyhose up your leg.
You can be in either a sitting or standing position when you put on your pantyhose. If you find it difficult to balance on one foot, you might want to sit!

, Ease it on carefully and slowly, making sure the fabric doesn't pull or rip. Keep the hose leg centered and pull it up until you reach your thigh. If the fabric is twisted or bunched at the knees, straighten it before proceeding.

, Gather the waist and the toe of the other leg so that you create an easy path for your foot to fit through. Point your toe and insert it, then line up the toe of the hose so that the seam runs across your toes. Pull the hose leg up over your calf and knee until it reaches your thighs. Make sure it's not bunched or twisted.

, You should have enough fabric left to easily finish pulling your pantyhose up around your waist. If you've been sitting, stand up and pull up the pantyhose so that the elastic at the top sits around your waist.


As you finish pulling the pantyhose up, you may need to alternate legs to ensure that the fabric is evenly distributed and doesn't twist.

, Check for areas where the pantyhose are bunched, or places where your skin feels pinched. The pantyhose should feel snug, but not uncomfortable. If you see a place where they're twisted, it's worth it to take them off and repeat the process more carefully - especially if you'll be wearing them all day long!


If you're wearing patterned or seamed hose, try putting on a pair of rubber gloves to make small adjustments for a flawless finish, rather than pinching the hose with your fingers and risking a tear.

, Wearing tight clothes over a pair of pantyhose can make for an uncomfortable day. If possible, wear clothes that are easy to slip off when you need to use the restroom, and that won't make you feel too pinched and confined. If your outfit is form-fitting, you might want to consider these other options:


Knee-highs or thigh-highs which look like pantyhose, but don't have the constraining panty top.
Tights, which are similar to pantyhose but can be found in different fabrics that let your skin breathe more freely.

, Pantyhose aren't very practical in extremely humid and hot weather, because they trap moisture against your skin and become uncomfortable when you sweat. If you want to wear pantyhose in warm weather, choose ultra-sheer, non-control top hose - they'll give you the most airflow throughout the day.

, It's inevitable - you're going to get a snag now and then, no matter how careful you are. If you see the beginning of a run, trim off the pulled thread and dab a bit of clear nail polish over the spot. This should keep it from running all the way down your leg.


If your run turns into a hole, you can repair it so you can wear it again. However, small imperfections tend to show up in pantyhose, since they're made of such fine material. If you're prone to getting runs, try buying opaque hose, going bare-legged, or stocking up on several pairs so you have an extra one handy just in case.

Understand the basics of denier.,
Learn the qualities of each denier range.,
Take time to learn what suits you best.",How to Identify the Denier of Hosiery," The following facts are useful to keep in mind when selecting your hosiery:


The lower the denier, the more sheer the hosiery is.
The higher the denier, the more opaque the hosiery becomes.
Modern styles can manage to make sheer hosiery at a higher denier to provide strength and sheerness - it depends on the brand and will definitely cost more.;
, The following denier counts will help you to identify which hosiery you need for each wearing occasion:



15 denier or less - often termed ""ultrasheer"": This almost appears like not wearing hosiery at all. This denier range is ideal for hot weather and for glamorous evening translucency. The downside is that this denier tends to be fragile, so keep your fingernails clear when putting on, and be careful of snagging it while wearing. Common culprits involved in snatching these include rough chairs, brushing against foliage, and the underside of tabletops.

15 to 30 denier - often termed ""sheer"": This range is the fairly standard, classic hosiery denier. It is obvious that you're wearing hosiery but good quality hosiery will give your legs an even, complete appearance. Given that this denier is stronger, it's far less likely to snag, and it's the typical weight for office wear and is also suitable for casual and evening wear.

Don't dismiss the cheaper versions. It pays to shop around in this denier - you may be pleasantly surprised by the quality of a cheaper brand.



30-40 denier - often termed ""semi-opaque"": This range is not yet opaque and has the advantage of being stronger than sheer but still showing your skin through the texture. It's another ideal pick for office and retail assistant wear, especially for long days. Again, it can be fine for evening wear.

40 denier up - often termed ""opaque"": These are the thick members of the hosiery family (and they are referred to as ""tights""). Anything 40 denier and above won't show your skin underneath unless it's really stretched when you bend your knee. Great for cold weather, this hosiery will keep your legs warm under a skirt or trouser pants (or even shorts!). This denier tends to come in a range of colors and patterns that can be carried off well because of the hosiery's thickness.

Be careful when buying all wool tights - they can be really itchy and also cause you to overheat in constantly warm indoor environments.
Another benefit of many thicker deniers is the ability to mend them around the toe and heel areas if they are made of durable materials such as cotton, wool, or lace. This means they last and last, several years even, if looked after well.



, While it is helpful to listen to the ideas of retail assistants, friends, and others giving you advice, hosiery is a very personal experience and what works for one person may not work for you. If you try hosiery that you don't find appealing, move on to the next style or denier until you find something that works best for you. Keep in mind:


Denier needs change according to season - if you find keeping cool or warm important, keep this in mind.
Some fashion trends will see hosiery out of fashion altogether and that's fine too!
There is a lot of advice about not wearing certain colors and patterns. Some of it is good advice if you're concerned about weight issues (see ""Tips"" below) but again, test out the look for yourself. Simply because one fashion blogger or a magazine fashion editor cannot abide one style of hosiery doesn't mean it won't work for you. The only real bar might be cost, as some of the imported hosiery is astronomically priced when it comes to just testing it out!

Look for sales associates in lingerie stores and women's clothing stores. Most places that sell bras have employees who know how to measure you for the right fit.;
, If the cup of your bra is not completely filled, the straps will slip down.

, Back size is also important because if the band of your bra is too large, the shoulder straps will be farther apart and prone to slipping.

, Racerback bras close in front instead of in back, keeping the straps in place more securely.

, This bra looks like a leotard's back instead of having straps that are vertical to the bra band.

, While lacy bra straps may be elegant, shop for bras that offer sturdy, supportive straps.

, Try decorative bra straps. These straps are designed to show, give support and are comfortable.

Use leather for a comfortable and durable loincloth.,
Try using cotton or other breathable material.,
Consult traditional loincloth materials and styles for variation.,
Measure your material.,
Determine the length of your front flap.,
Begin to thread the loin cloth.,
Continue wrapping the cloth around your waist.,
Tie your loincloth around your back.,
Pull the slack through.",How to Put on a Loincloth," Leather is a common material used in most loincloths. Try using leather for a more durable and traditional loincloth. However, leather can be quite warm and is not a very breathable material. Certain leathers can be bought in bulk at various fabric or textile supply stores.


Try using deerskin leather for a comfortable and durable loincloth. You can purchase pre-cut leather loincloths at online retailers, like etsy.
You will ultimately want a piece of leather that is at least 6 feet long and one foot wide in order to get the best wrap possible.;
, Cotton is perhaps a more conventional option as it allows for both comfort and affordability. Cotton is also a flexible material that might make tying your first loincloths a bit easier than a stiffer material like leather. Find cotton that you like in bulk at a fabric supply store near you.

, There are many online resources dedicated to loincloth traditions and cultures. Consult these resources to understand which materials might be best, or most traditional, to use for making your loincloth. Many traditional loincloths are also defined by their patterns, treatment, and source., You’ll need a material that is 10 inches (25.4 cm) wide and 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7 m) long to make your loin cloth. You can ask your vendor to measure your material for you, or you can measure it yourself with a tape measure at home.

, Hold up one end in front with your non-dominant hand; the distance it falls determines the length of the front flap. You can decide on any length, some prefer it extend to the floor, others prefer is extend down to the knee.

, Use your dominant hand to thread the rest of the material, the material that is not held is your non-dominant hand, through your legs to your back. Bring it up from back to front, then from right to left around your waist., When you reach your back, double the material over and pass it under the cloth that comes between your legs. A 3-yard piece of fabric should be able to loop at least two times., Once you’ve wrapped yourself, double the slack end over and begin to pass it under the material that is already in between your legs and around your waist. You should be forming a little pouch on top of your wrapped waist, or belt., Pull the slack all the way through the material wrapped around your waist. There will be a little ""tail"" of cloth in the back, but otherwise your loincloth should feel well-wound and secure."

Tighten your bra band.,
Tighten your bra straps.,
Position your bra correctly when you dress.",How to Keep Bra Straps in Place2," Use the setting that will hug the bra closer to your body if it is the right size but you still notice the straps slipping.

, To provide the proper support, your straps should be tight enough to stay in place, but not so tight that they pull your bra band out of place.

,


Make sure your breasts sit comfortably inside the cups. Bend over to position them if necessary.
Reach to the back of your bra and pull it down below your shoulder blades, so it is even with the front of your bra. When your bra back is too high, it causes discomfort for you and makes the straps fall.

Try a bra created to address strap slippage.,
Look for fashion tape.,
Consider using a bra strap holder.,
Use a bra strap cushion to keep straps in place and make your shoulders comfortable.,
Try a decorative strap.",How to Keep Bra Straps in Place3," For example, the Olga's brand has a ""Comfort Back"" line that brings straps closer together.

, This is a clear adhesive supplement to your bra straps that will attach to your skin. You are essentially taping the bra straps in place.


Buy fashion tape in lingerie and department stores, near the bras and bra accessories. You can shop for fashion tape online, between $8 and $12.

, Products such as ""The Strapper"" and the ""Magic Clip Strap Holder"" clip the bra straps together on your upper back and keeps them in place. The clip stays hidden beneath your shirt.

Wear your stilettos with jeans.,
Wear your stilettos with a casual skirt or dress.,
Wear shorts with caution.",How to Wear Stilettos With Casual Wear1,"


Choose a jean that comes down to the top of your foot but does not drag on the ground. You should be able to show off the stiletto heel, but do not make the heel the focal point of your entire outfit.
You can select nearly any fit. Trouser jeans, straight-leg jeans, skinny jeans, boot-cut jeans, and flared jeans can all be worn with stilettos; base your decision on your body type rather than on the heel.
Medium to dark washes often look better than extremely light washes.;
,


A loose, free-flowing skirt creates a more casual appearance when paired with a stiletto than a form-fitting skirt does.
A skirt or dress should also have a bit of length. Aim for skirts that fall just past the knee or lower. Anything shorter than that will either look too flashy or too trashy.

, Even though stilettos work for casual looks, some shorts are a little too casual to wear with them.


Stick with dressy, designer shorts. These shorts are not typically worn as casual wear, but you can dress them down by pairing them with a simple fitted t-shirt or a men’s button-down shirt to create a casual look that is still chic enough to work with stilettos.
Try a fitted capri that goes down to your knee or mid-calf. While not technically a short, capri pants do offer a shorter option for hot days where long pants may prove too uncomfortable.

"
"
Pick a shorter heel.,
Wear gel inserts.,
Have a back-up plan.",How to Wear Stilettos With Casual Wear2," Three-inch heels may look impressive, but they are rather impractical for casual wear. Whether you're hanging out with friends or indulging in a day of shopping on your own, odds are, you will do a significant amount of walking in your casual attire. High stiletto heels are likely to hurt your feet, but shorter heels may not do as much damage.


Choose shoes with a thicker sole. Thick soles help absorb the impact of your steps. As a result, your feet won't ache as quickly, allowing you to enjoy your day longer.
Practice walking in your shoes before wearing them for the day. This is especially important if you are unaccustomed to wearing stilettos.
Spend a day at home walking around in your heels.
Vacuum, wash dishes, and do your laundry.
Practice keeping your balance and give yourself an idea of how sore your feet might be in a particular pair of stilettos if you wear them out.

, Specially designed gel insoles reduce the stress you place on your foot, minimizing both immediate pain and long-term damage caused by stilettos and other heels. Purchase insoles that will be completely covered by your foot and double-check the way your shoe looks with both the insole and your foot inside.

, Expect the unexpected. You may feel prepared to spend the day in your heels, but disaster could strike at any moment. Carry around sneakers or dressy, comfortable flats to switch into in case you begin experiencing too much pain or your stiletto heel snaps.

Platform shoes and boots have sort of slipped off of the radar in the fashion world.,
Who looks best in platform shoes?,
Basic black is a good color.,
Chunky platform sandals or clogs are a handy way for women who are more on the heavyset side to enhance their basic body type; again, it helps make feet/legs look proportional to the rest of the body.,
The secret to making platforms work is to keep them a bit on the understated side.",How to Wear Platform Shoes," Which is good; if you want to be unique, different, and stand out from the crowd, this is an easy way to do it.;
, Plats work well for people who are a bit on the short side. They give you a bit of extra height that's easy to walk in (compared to high heels with thin soles). Also, people who tend to be a bit on the ""chunky"" side, with shorter legs or a longish torso, will benefit from the look. Thin, slender, or tall people should avoid platforms.

, Buy quality plats; cheap vinyl and plastic plats fall apart quickly and end up looking ratty. For everyday wear, no more than a two inch platform and a four inch heel is probably the maximum for comfort. Wear flare leg pants or jeans that complement your shoes or boots.

, Keep things moderate; no extreme plats for everyday wear.

, Sure, you could try to wear some platform boots with metallic silver striping or red flame patterns, but the basic platform style is wild enough. Black or brown color, with minimal accents, patterns, buckles, etc. will work much better at creating a look that is different, but still tasteful.

"
"
Find a pair of high heels.,
If you have never worn heels before, you may wish to start with a pair of wedges (shoes with one solid platform from heel to toe) before moving to ones with narrow heels such as stilettos or pumps.,
Remove your men's shoes and socks.,
Put on some high heels.,
Try walking in them.,
Take it slow.",How to Wear High Heels (for Men)," Most high heels are usually found in shoe stores; you probably have to look in the women's section of the store to find them, or a specialty store if you have larger feet. There are stores including retail outlet stores and online (believe it or not) that cater to men who wish to wear heels.;
, These are easier to walk on since the weight of your feet is spread out more evenly and they are easier to maintain your balance, as your weight is evenly distributed between your heel and sole.


Many girls wear heels, so if a friend of yours wears heels and is around your size, you could ask her if you could try on her high heels. You can make it a joke if you're particularly embarrassed. Trying these on will give you a good sense of what feels comfortable.
Try high heel boots first; these will support your ankle. Thigh boots are best because they really feel a part of you. A platform helps too, as it protects your toe joints from undue bending as well as making you taller.
Many men find stilettos difficult because they are too timid about the height, but that is going about it the wrong way. The higher, the better for true comfort.

, It will help you fit into what are typically smaller sized shoes. Wear nylon stockings or pantyhose to make it easier to try on high heel shoes.

, Put on high heels just as you would with any shoe, slide your feet into them. Make sure the shoes fit, It can hurt your feet if the heels are too small and if the heels are too big, it could be loose and also hurt your feet.

, Walking in high heels can be hard, especially if you're a man. You could try asking a girl that wears high heels for help.


Lock your knee joints so that they are more rigid than they would be if you were wearing flat heels. After a short while, you forget you are wearing heels - but you'll look really special.

, Your heels aren't going to look too great if you're falling over yourself in them. Start off with smaller and wider heels and work your way up to the big stuff.

Get your feet sized at a shoe store.,
Try on plenty of shoes.,
Consider a lower or more comfortable style.,
Invest in quality heels.",How to Wear High Heels without Pain1," Measure the length and width of your feet at a shoe store, and ask for assistance to find the most accurate size of shoe to buy.


Make sure to measure both feet. It’s common to have slightly different sized feet. You may actually need to get two different sized shoes, or make sure to get the size of the larger foot.Note that you will be a different number size in different stores and brands, so always try several sizes. Also find your European size for brands that utilize them.;
, Try on a wide variety of heels at the shoe store, and try each one in a couple of different sizes to see which one feels best.


Don’t just stand up in the heels, but walk around the store for several minutes to see what they feel like after some time.
Look out for the backs rubbing against your heels or for your toes feeling scrunched inside as an indication that the heels are too small, or your feet popping out of the backs or sliding forward when you walk as an indication they are too large.

, Choose a thicker and more stable heel like a platform, wedge, or chunky heel to provide more support and weight distribution. Shy away from pointed-toe styles if you have wide feet or toes, opting for round or almond-shaped instead. You can also buy heeled boots or heels with ankle straps to help support your ankles.Sit on a chair with bare feet and one one leg extended out in front of you, then relax your foot and ankle. Measure the distance between the end of your big toe to an imaginary line that extends straight out from your heel. This is the ideal height of heel for you, as it most closely mimics your natural shape.More important than the style of heel is where the heel is placed. Ensure that it’s positioned squarely under the heel bone rather than at the very back of the foot. If you go for a skinnier heel, look for one that curves in slightly at the top rather than forming a straight line., Choose high-quality brands or materials for a higher likelihood of comfort. Look out for genuine leather, solid rubber soles, and other sturdy textiles that appear to have well-constructed seams and joints. You can even tug a little at parts of the shoe to test their strength.

Buy an insole for the sole of the foot.,
Get padding for problem areas.,
Use heel or strap grips to keep heels in place.",How to Wear High Heels without Pain2," Buy an insole that fits heels for increased comfort across the whole length of your sole. You might want to buy these ahead of time or at the same time as the heels to make sure the shoes still fit properly with the inserts in.

, You can buy cushioned gel or fabric inserts to fit areas like the ball of the foot and the back of the ankle to prevent rubbing, sliding, or pressure.


Any brand of moleskin is a great option for padding, as it can be cut to any size or shape, sticks directly onto the foot, and stays put on tricky areas or over already-formed blisters.Be sure that any insert you buy doesn’t have so much bulk that it makes your shoe too small to fit into.

, Find a product meant for sticking to your heel area or even to the strap of a slingback to prevent rubbing and keep your heel inside a shoe that may be slightly too large.

Practice heel-toe walking.,
Use good posture.,
Find support when you’re on stairs or uneven surfaces.,
Relieve the pressure occasionally.,
Wear socks or tights.,
Simply reduce the amount of time in heels.",How to Wear High Heels without Pain3," Try to step like you would in any other flat shoe, heel to toe. It can take some getting used to to maintain balance on a thinner heel. Take small steps and look at yourself walk in a mirror if you can.


It’s a good idea to practice walking around your house in heels to get used to their feel and the right way to walk.

, Keep your abs engaged, your shoulders back, and your head up. Note that your posture in heels will require more curves in your body, with your back slightly arched and your chest and pelvis pushed forward. Get used to walking with this new, slightly more forward center of gravity., Hold onto a railing or wall when you can to lend support and prevent catching a heel or rolling an ankle.


Wear a wider heel for outdoor surfaces, to prevent them from sticking into dirt or grass or causing you to slip or injure an ankle.

, Take a break from your heels every now and then while you’re wearing them. Try slipping off your heels while you’re sitting down, or even elevating or massaging your feet to bring circulation to them.Gently rotate your ankles and spread your toes apart under the table when you can to provide relief and prevent injury., Slip on no-show socks that will hide under your heels, or wear tights or stockings to make heels more comfortable if they tend to rub against your feet, especially after sweating a little.

, Limit the period of time you wear heels to a minimum, as best you can. Instead of wearing heels through the whole day, try wearing a flat during work and save the heels for going out at night.

Get sporty.",How to Wear Chunky Heels," When most people think of chunky heeled, platform shoes they imagine towering heights that seem impossible to walk in. However, chunky heeled shoes come in a variety of sizes, you just need to figure out what works best for you. For example, if you're looking to elongate your legs but still want to be comfortable, buy a moderate sized 2½” heel. Or, if you’re already tall and are just looking for a little pop, try sticking to only 1”-2” heels.Of course, if you want to make a statement, you can always go for 4” or more.;
, Outside of adding height, the heel of a platform shoe can work for or against the look of your legs. Pick a width that matches your shape. For example, if you have thicker, more athletic legs, a thinner heel may emphasize their size. However, if you opt for a chunkier heel, it will work with your silhouette instead of against it.

, Go for something neutral and adaptable. You want to choose a platform shoe that can go with the majority of your outfits, both casual and dressed-up. Try for a minimal design like a peep-toe or closed pump in leather or canvas., Platform boots are a great choice in winter and fall. Not only will they keep your feet warm and dry, they also pair well with cold-weather outfits. Try coupling them with your favorite skinny jeans and a cropped sweater or with some black leggings, a flannel, and a short leather jacket.

, Though platform shoes may not seem like a typical summer choice, chunky-heeled sandals are the perfect addition to your favorite summer clothing. Try pairing a strappy pair of brown sandals with a lacy white slip dress or a 50s inspired floral print.

, Depending on where you work, you are likely required to meet a professional standard. This means dressing in a polished manner. Colors like black, navy blue, nude, or brown are not only the perfect shades for a day look, but also pair well with any business attire.

Know how to walk in heels confidently.,
Have extra caution and have a straight posture.,
Use any railing or support if needed.,
Watch your step.,
Use all of the shoe.,
Be aware of your body.,
Practice going up.",How to Walk Down Stairs in High Heels," Try to practice as often as you can, even in your room, until you can walk without stumbling. This is very important when you have to cross a surface that isn't flat.;
, When you first start walking in heels you may wish to be extra careful and watch your feet, but ultimately you need to learn to keep your head high, shoulders back, and back straight to reap the full benefits.

, Particularly if you are not at your peak of confidence in heels. The way to hold the railing without looking uncoordinated is to keep your grip strong but relax the rest of your arm including your shoulder. This will give you extra support allowing you to go downstairs safely until you have enough confidence to go without.

, Though with practice, you will be able to use the stance described in step 2 going downstairs, safety is key, so to begin with cast your eyes downwards and make sure you know where each foot will be going next. Even with time, make sure to be aware of both your head-on and peripheral vision and be aware of your body.

, Get as much of the heel and front of the shoe to step onto the stairs; this may be made easier through lifting the legs higher. It is best to be able to feel the back of the heel touching the back of the step.

, If you feel yourself slipping, immediately take hold of the railing. This is why it is always better to at least be touching it so you have that support.

, There's no point going down if you can't go up but luckily this is much easier. Just step with the front of the shoe, the heel SHOULD NOT touch the stair at all but be in mid air so its like you're walking in flats.

Wet the shoes.,
Brush out stains with a mild soap.,
Repeat soapy water applications as needed.,
Air dry your shoes.",How to Clean Hemp Shoes1," Take your shoes outside and firmly hit their soles together to remove clumped and loose dirt, grass, and so on. After that, remove the laces of your shoe. Laces can be reused later or thrown away and replaced with new ones.


Dirt and grime have a tendency to build up around laces, particularly at the metal grommets. Removing the laces will allow you to clean these areas more easily.
Use a stick or screwdriver to push out dirt that is stuck in the treads of your shoes. Dirt remaining on any part of your shoe could spread to other areas while cleaning, adding to your cleaning duties.;
, Avoid spot cleaning your shoe, as this will often result in the cleaned part looking noticeably different from the rest of it. Fill a bucket with cool water. Apply water to all hemp surfaces of the shoe directly or with a clean, water saturated cloth until the hemp is completely wet.


To prevent color from transferring from your cleaning cloth to your shoes, only use undyed, white cloths., Administer a small amount of mild soap, like dish soap, to a section of the shoe directly or with a clean, damp cloth. Remove dirtiness by lightly brushing the soapy areas of the shoe with a soft bristle brush, like a shoe brush or toothbrush.Do this for the entire shoe.


Clean the shoe from front to back or back to front so you’re less likely to miss a spot. Missed spots may be obvious when your shoes dry. Remove missed spots with a second round of cleaning., Lightly rinse each shoe with water directly or by wiping them with a clean, water saturated rag after brushing. If your shoes don’t look clean quite yet, reapply water and soap. Brush the shoes in the fashion described until all dirtiness is removed.


After each application of soap, rinse the shoe thoroughly with clean water. Be sure you remove all soap. Leftover soap may cause brown spots on hemp., Avoid using high heat to speed up the drying process. Air dry your shoes for best results, but avoid doing so in direct sunlight, as this may cause the shoes to shrink. Insert balled up newspaper into the shoe. Replace the paper with dry paper every hour or so until the shoes are dry.If you need your shoes dried in a hurry, place them near a moderately warm air vent or use a hair dryer on a “Cool” or very low heat setting.Over drying hemp can cause its fibers to weaken, resulting in tears.

The directions for your shoe cleaning product may vary depending on its brand. Always follow the label directions for best results.
In most cases, specialty cleaners are applied in the same way as soapy water: completely wet the shoe, apply soap to it in sections, brush stains lightly, and rinse the hemp thoroughly when the entire shoe is clean., To improve the stain fighting power of your washing machine, pre-treat stains with a mild soap and water or a suitable specially formulated cloth shoe cleaner. Use a dampened cloth to gently blot cleaner onto stains until they are saturated., To protect your shoes from damage, you may want to put them in a laundry bag before machine washing. Set the machine to a gentle, cold cycle for dyed hemp. Add a cup (237 ml) of white vinegar to the rinse cycle to freshen the shoes and neutralize any remaining soap.


Non-dyed hemp may be machine washed on a warm cycle. However, as hemp is somewhat sensitive to heat, you should only do this occasionally or for severe dirtiness.
Machine washing can be harsh on hemp shoes. Shoes that are delicate may be damaged by this cleaning technique. Preserve your shoes by only machine washing them infrequently."

Prevent stains with fabric protectant.,
Refresh stinky insoles.,
Avoid harsh cleaners.",How to Clean Hemp Shoes3," Fabric protectant, like Scotchguard or Stainshield, will make your hemp shoes more resistant to discoloration and dirtiness. Fabric protectant is suitable for most hemp products.


Check the label on your shoes or look up their care information online to verify that protectant can be applied. Some fabric blends may react negatively to protectant.Clean your shoes completely before applying a fabric protectant. Stains may be difficult or impossible to remove after applying protectant over them.

, The insoles of your shoes are often a hotbed for bacteria that produces an unpleasant smell. Kill this bacteria by soaking insoles in 2 parts white vinegar and 1 part hot water for several hours. Allow the soles to air dry completely, then replace them in the shoes.


Bacteria living in the insoles of your shoe are sensitive to cold temperatures. Put dry insoles or shoes in a freezer bag and store them in your freezer for 1 to 2 days. When you remove the shoes, the odor should be gone.
In the event your shoes still have an unpleasant smell after using one of these techniques, allow them to dry or thaw completely and then repeat the treatment as necessary.
In some cases, you may not be able to remove an odor even after multiple treatments. Buy a fresh pair of insoles at your local shoe store and replace the stinky ones., Gentle soaps and detergent will keep your shoes from wearing out too soon. Cleaners with chlorine, like many kinds of bleach, can cause damage and discoloration. Active cleaning components, like chlorine, should be clearly indicated on the label of cleaning products.


In the event that you need a cleaner for your hemp that has bleaching power but no chlorine, use oxygen bleaches, like hydrogen peroxide."

Next, place a rigid wooden, metal, or plastic ruler perpendicular to a wall. The ruler should form a ninety degree angle with the wall. Make sure the lowest numerical part of the ruler is closest to the wall.


The end of the ruler should be completely flush with the surface of the wall. Otherwise, your measurements will be incorrect.;
, Place your foot on the ruler. Your heel should be touching the wall but not pressed against it. Next, measure your foot from your heel to your longest toe.

If at all possible, try to avoid having uncomfortable shoes for dancing.,
Look for a softer surface.,
Use Band-Aids (padded adhesive bandages) to create a buffer between the parts of your shoe that are rubbing your skin and the skin.,
Dance gently.,
Put up with the pain.,
Remove your shoes.",How to Dance in Uncomfortable Shoes," Obviously, if you know you're going out dancing, wear shoes that you already know work for you when you dance. Don't wear new shoes unless they're broken in, shoes that are too high, or shoes that feel uncomfortable when simply walking.


For dance classes: break your dance shoes in! Whether it's ballet, flamenco, tango, or jazz, your shoes need to be broken in before you take too many lessons or dance the night away with your newly learned skills.
For a formal event: If you even suspect that there might be dancing at the event you're going to, try to take along a pair of shoes that you know you can dance in. You can alternate between the more formal shoes and dance shoes as needed; use a shoe bag to keep the spare pair in.;
, When you have no alternative but to keep wearing your uncomfortable shoes for dancing, see if you can spot a surface on, or near, the dance floor that is softer. For example, the dance floor might be rimmed with carpet. If you're able to remain on the softer surface, this will remove some of the impact of a harder floor on your feet.

,


If you already have blisters, corns, warts, etc., be sure to treat them appropriately before heading off to dance. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice if you're not sure what to do.
Moleskin can stick better than Band-Aids for longer lasting ""dance relief"". Apply the sticking side to your foot.
There are also commercial products targeted at blocking friction in uncomfortable shoes; look for them at your drugstore.

, Rather than trying to dance every dance or do your usual Can-Can kicks, tone it down and dance less than you would do normally. You can still enjoy some dances, and for the other dances, engage non-dancers in conversation, or simply soak up the atmosphere of those enjoying the dancing.

, Sometimes you might believe it's worth pushing yourself past the pain because the purpose of those once-in-a-lifetime shoes is because it's your once-in-a-lifetime wedding or stage performance. For many people, however, the pain obliterates all ability to enjoy the dancing and event, so this option won't be open to everyone and depends on your pain tolerance threshold and the strength of the reason for pushing you on in those uncomfortable shoes!

, The time-honored tradition is to remove your shoes and dance without them. Provided it's the right thing to do, this can be a liberating and acceptable action. However, consider the following:


Some of your fellow dancers or onlookers might perceive it as unseemly or even unhygienic.
If others don't remove their shoes, you risk having your bare feet trodden on or even stamped upon.
If you leave your pantyhose or socks on, you risk slipping over.
There may be foot odor issues involved that could embarrass you.
Judge the suitability of doing this by observing what other people are doing and your knowledge of the people present. If you have any doubts, consider either missing a few dances, or dancing gently.
Wash feet well before going to bed.

However, since you probably can't have a closet full of sneakers, consider the clothes you have beforehand, so that you can make sure your sneakers match you clothes as much as possible. Once you have an idea of what colors you're looking for, proceed. If you plan on buying tons of new clothes in the near future, skip this step.;
, You've probably already gotten one in mind, such as Skaters. However, if you don't, Converse seem to go with just about anything. If you are open to anything, skip this step.

, If you've got a specific brand in mind (and know your size in that brand), then you would be better off going to that brands web site, since they will have a huge selection, and some (like Converse's Website) even let you design your own shoe. However, if you don't have a brand in mind, you're better off going to a store. Which store depends on what you want. Skaters? Go to your local specialty skate shop, if you have one. Running shoes? Head over to a sports shop such as Sports Authority.

, Fall in love with the first pair you see? That's great, but continue to look around. There may be a pair you like better.

, You're probably going to have to tie them. Make sure they fit well. Walk around the store, even run around it a bit. Check that there is room in the toes. If you are shopping online, skip this step.

, This works best with Skates and Converse, and not so well with Athletics.

Alternate between a ceremony shoe and a reception shoe.,
Practice walking around in your shoes.,
Bring shoe pads for back-up on your big day.",How to Find the Perfect Pair of Wedding Shoes2," Every woman’s foot is a little different. You may find a pair of shoes in your size, but that does not mean it will fit your feet correctly. No matter how perfect a shoe looks, if it does not fit your foot well, it will not work.

, You will be on your feet the majority of the day, from your first step down the aisle to the moment you make your getaway at the end of the reception. Flat shoes may feel more comfortable on your foot than heels, especially if you are unaccustomed to wearing heels for prolonged periods of time.

, While platform heels can be a little difficult to find in bridal shoes, the extra width may offer your foot the right support it needs to keep you standing steady and strong throughout the entire affair.

, If you do opt for heels, make sure you go for a heel height that you feel confident about walking in. Now is not the time to experiment with three-inch heels if the highest you have ever worn is only an inch. Stick with a height you feel familiar and comfortable with to avoid any wedding day mishaps.

, Slender heels do not work well in grass, stones, sand, soil, or other unsteady terrains. If you know your foot will never leave the pavement, however, you can still opt for a slender heel.

, If you fall in love with a perfect pair of heels but would rather dance at your reception in flats, consider getting both. Swap out your fancy shoes after the ceremony and switch into something more comfortable for the reception. Just make sure your dress can account for the difference in heel height. The last thing you want is to trip over your gown as you head out for the dance floor.

, This breaks your shoes in, allowing them the chance to adjust to your feet. Moreover, doing this also gives you a good idea about how long you can last in your shoes. Wear them around the house, but avoid taking them outside where they can get dirty. If you decide to take dancing lessons before your wedding, wear them there, as well.

, Stock up on gel pads, bandages, and other foot care necessities. Look for products designed for your toes, heels, ankles, and the balls of your feet. With any luck, you won't need them, but at least you'll have them just in case.

For example, comfortable flats can be worn at the airport, while out shopping or sightseeing, as well as going out to bars and dinner on your vacation.;
, Know what the weather will be like at your destination. Plan accordingly when choosing your travel shoes. If you're going somewhere warmer, a lighter shoe, like a light flat or even a sandal or flip-flop, should suffice. For a cooler destination, you may want to pack something like boots or thicker tennis shoes., Even if you're not going to be running marathons as part of your trip, if you're walking a lot you will want a comfortable shoe. It's a good idea to pack shoes that you can walk in, like tennis shoes or boots, if you're going to be walking a lot on your trip.If you're going to a major city, expect to walk a lot. In a place like Chicago, for example, you'll probably take public transportation most of the time and will be walking to and from train stations and bus stops. A solid walking shoe is important.

, Travel shoes should be comfortable, lightweight, and durable. Look for travel shoes that meet all three of these qualifications when selecting travel-friendly footwear.Opt for shoes that are comfortable but also easy to walk in. If you wear your every day shoes for many activities comfortably, these may make great travel shoes. This is especially true if your everyday shoes are lightweight.
If you're buying new shoes for a trip, don't be afraid to pay a little extra. Travel shoes should last a long time and extra price is worth added durability.
If you're doing a lot of outdoors activities, you should also look for shoes that are waterproof.

Opt for rubber soles.,
Wear shoes you're prepared to lose or damage.,
Select shoes that are easy to clean.,
Bring shoes that go with many outfits.",How to Choose Travel Shoes2," Rubber soles tend to have the most grip. You want shoes that will not slip easily on airport floors. Rubber soles tend to have the best grip for these surfaces.Usually, rubber sole shoes are sneakers or tennis shoes. If you dislike these types of shoes, stop by a local shoe repair place prior to your trip. You may be able to get rubber soles inserted on something like flats.

, Airports can potentially be hard on shoes. Shoes can get damaged from spills, escalators, floor runners, and can also get banged around going through the conveyer belt during a security check in. Therefore, you should keep very expensive or delicate shoes in your baggage. Wear shoes you don't mind getting damaged in the actual airport.Shoes with embellishments, like sequins, should not be worn in the airport. There is a high risk of these types of shoes getting damaged at some point and embellishments can easily fall off.

, Airports are messy. Due to the risk of your shoes becoming dirty or damaged during travel, opt for shoes you can clean easily. Ideally, you should wear shoes you can safely rub down with soap and water after your trip.If you're unsure how to clean your shoes, read the manufacturer's label that came with them. There should be instructions there. Shoes with complex cleaning instructions should not be worn to the airport.

, Shoes are heavy and you do not want to have your suitcase bogged down with too many pairs. Therefore, pick travel shoes that go with a variety of outfits. Look for neutral shades and shoes that can be worn at both casual and dressy occasions."

Bring hiking boots.,
Select decent walking shoes.,
Bring travel-friendly running shoes.,
Pack the right shoes for warmer climates.",How to Choose Travel Shoes3," If you're going on a long hiking trip, you will want a solid pair of hiking boots for your destination. You should pack these boots with your luggage so they're ready to go when you reach your destination.Only invest in heavy hiking boots if you're doing serious hiking on your trip. Due to their weight and size, heavy professional hiking boots should only be packed if necessary.
For light hiking, opt for lightweight boots that can double as walking shoes.

, Some trips require a lot of walking. Most trips to big cities, for example, require walking as you will rely more on public transportation than a car. Opt for comfortable, lightweight walking shoes that fit loosely around your feet. This will minimize the risk of blisters and sores., If you like to keep up with activities like running when you travel, pack shoes that allow for this. In your luggage, pack a lightweight pair of running shoes. If possible, pack shoes that will work for both running and walking to save space., If your destination is very warm, it's a good idea to pack sandals and flip flops. If you're choosing sandals, go for comfortable, durable varieties made out of quality materials like leather, as these will prevent soreness and blisters.If you intend to wear flip-flops walking around town, pricier shoes with leather straps are a good option. However, many people wear flip-flops as beach shoes or shower shoes. In this case, cheap plastic flip-flops can hold up for a week or so on vacation.

Add heel grips or sole pads.,
Wear specialized socks.",How to Choose Comfortable Shoes," Some shoes forgo comfort for the sake of style. Though this might be fine for occasional wear, you want to look for those features when seeking a comfortable shoe. These features include:


An Achilles notch. The groove featured at the back of the shoe where the shoe meets the Achilles tendon. This notch helps reduce the friction and rubbing near the heel, preventing blisters and other tearing of the skin at the heel.
An ankle collar. Ankle collars are the area of the shoe that wraps around the ankle (where the Achilles notch is located). Ankle collars provide support for the ankle and prevent rubbing and friction.
A midsole. The midsole is the ""floor"" of the shoe and helps absorb shock and helps control foot motion. Its important to choose a shoe that has a midsole that fits your foot.An appropriate toe box. The toe box is the portion of the shoe that houses your toes. Wearing a shoe that features a toe box too small for your feet can lead to bunions and other sores.
A roll bar. Some shoes, particularly running or hiking shoes, feature a roll bar which helps prevent excess movement in the heel area of the shoe. This can help prevent friction and accidental ""rolling"" of the ankle.;
, Flexibility is an important consideration for comfort, and are particularly important in walking and jogging shoes. Running shoes tend to be more firm, as they must support the weight and force of a running stride.


Test a shoe for flexibility by picking it up and bending the toe upward. The shoe should bend under the ball of the foot, not halfway along the arch (or elsewhere).
Twisting the shoe is also a good way to test for support. There should be some light resistance from the shoe when you twist., Heavy shoes take more effort to move around in, and are usually made of a less comfortable material. Heavier shoes also tend to be less flexible as a result, which can stifle your natural stride.


Shoes made of a lightweight material are particularly useful for hiking, or for wear in warm, dry weather. Such material allows your foot to breathe more easily in such climates., Keeping the heel wider and close to the ground offers the greatest support for your ankles and heel. This is particularly important for sandals or dress shoes. Anything over 2 inches in height raises the risk of ankle sprains.


The sharper the incline of the shoe, the greater strain you are placing on your feet., The type of cushioning in a shoe will vary depending on the type of shoe. For example, a running shoe will have more cushion on the heel, where a walking shoe will have more cushion on the ball of the foot. Make sure you are purchasing a shoe designed for the activity you intend to wear it for.Try out the shoe on a hard surface as well as a soft one. The level of comfort the cushion provides may be different when walking on a harder surface. This is a good opportunity to make sure the toe box has enough room for your toes.

, Measuring your foot size is the first step in obtaining the most comfortable shoes. Most shoe stores will have measuring devices, and the salespeople at those stores will be happy to help you get an accurate measurement.


Many people have feet that are two different sizes. In this case, wear a size that suits your larger foot.
Measure your feet every few years! Your feet change shape as the years go on.
You want roughly a half inch between your longest toe and the end of your shoe for best comfort., Most feet fall into one of three categories based on the shape of the arch. Choose shoes that accommodate the shape of your arch to achieve the most comfortable fit. If you’re unsure about the shape of your feet, take a look at your footprint. If you can see most of your foot print, you likely have low arches. If you can see very little, high arches., Neutral-arched feet are neither overly- nor under-arched. Those with neutral arches can generally wear shoes of their choosing, as there is little need to compensate for shortcomings associated with the arches. Shoes with firm midsoles and moderate rear-foot stability are strong all-around choices for comfort and longevity, as they help sustain the natural stride of the foot., Low arches cause muscle stress and joint problems for the feet and legs. As a result, find a shoe with a straight last (the overall shape of the shoe) and strong motion control to help stabilize your stride. Additionally, look for shoes with raised insoles or supports that alleviate some of the excess pressure placed on the feet where the arch typically rests., High arches can cause strain on joints and muscles, and overall foot pain (especially at the heels) as they do not absorb shock well. Look for shoes that feature cushioned arch support to alleviate some of the impact that your foot experiences during your stride., Though it sounds obvious, the shoe must contain enough room for your foot to rest comfortably. This includes the ball of the foot and toe area.


Look for shoes with “false fronts.” These shoes are much longer at the toe area, which give your toes plenty of space and keep them from becoming cramped.
The toe area should also be wide enough to fit your toes.
Make sure your foot fits in any sandal you choose. Your toes shouldn’t hang over the edge of the shoe!

, Look at the product details of any shoe you're interested in purchasing before you buy. The product details can be found on the box of the shoe, or near where the shoe is being displayed, and lists many of the details necessary for choosing the right shoe for the right foot, such as type of midsole, arch support, and more.


If you don't see the product information or need help choosing the right shoe, ask an employee at the store. They can help you choose the right shoe with the right features after you explain your needs.
The shoe manufacturer's website may also list product features that can help you make the right decision.

, If your shoe lacks enough cushion, purchase an insert and place it in your shoe. They come in a variety of thicknesses, and are made of a variety of comfortable materials.


Though soft gel inserts can feel good, they may not last long, and can disrupt the natural walking movement of your stride. Find an insert that offers comfort, but is ""hard"" enough to support your feet where they need it most.
Some shoe stores have scanners that can identify where you need support. Try standing on one to get a better idea of what to look for in an insert. You can always ask a salesperson to help operate the device., Some shoes become more comfortable and “broken in” the more they are worn. If you have a pair of dress shoes that you intend on using for long social events, spend a few evenings wearing them in advance of such events in order to break them in and make them more comfortable for those special occasions.


Shoes can also be stretched to offer some more wiggle room. Take your shoes to a local cobbler to see if your shoes can be stretched without damaging the shoe.
You may also purchase a self-stretching kit at many shoe stores., Apply a moleskin or other protective patch to your feet to protect them from chafing while you break in the shoe. Such patches can also be applied directly to the shoe in the areas that are giving you trouble.


Moleskin pads will also help stretch out tight shoes, since it adds additional bulk to your foot., For shoes that are too loose, a heel grip can help keep the shoe firm on your foot. Similarly, adding a pad for the ball of the foot can keep your foot from sliding into the toe box, keeping the shoe snug. This is particularly useful for high heels and other shoes that feature an incline., If your shoe is too loose, wearing a thicker pair of socks (or multiple socks) can help fill out the gap. A variety of socks are available tailored for comfort as well, and can substitute for some insole inserts (or pair well with them).


Sporting goods stores offer a variety of socks for different activities, with different padding depending on the activity.Orthopedic socks can be found at your local pharmacy. Tell your doctor about your needs and see if they can refer you to a specific brand that can help solve your comfort issues.

Break them in.",How to Choose Cowboy Boots," Cowboy boots come in countless styles, which is great for finding the pair that’s just right for you, but can make the search rather daunting. Begin by deciding which of the two common categories of boot style best fits your needs:Traditional Boots are designed for daily utilitarian use on places like a farm. These boots are designed to be broken in and worn every day.
Fashion Boots are the type one might usually find in high end retail stores. These boots are designed to look a certain way, but you may compromise longevity for style.;
, Cowboy boots come in a number of materials, each suited for a different purpose. Some are well suited for hard work in muddy fields, while others may not be able to get wet. It’s important that you choose a material that will suit your needs while wearing the boots.Traditional leather cowboy boots can be extremely tough and long lasting, but you can also find very soft leather that requires more maintenance.
Alligator and snake skin are both common materials to make cowboy boots out of. They aren’t necessarily any tougher than leather, but can make for a great fashion statement.
Artificial materials are often extremely resilient to moisture and offer fashions not commonly found in traditional leather boots.

, Cowboy boots come in every color of the rainbow, so having a color in mind will make shopping for your new boots much easier. Most traditional leather boots come in black or brown, but fashion boots come in many materials that allow for different colors and color schemes.Black and brown boots will allow for the most matching wardrobe options.
Bright colors are a great way to set you, and your boots, apart from the crowd.
Boot covers are available at many retailers, allowing you to cover much of your boots with a different color or design.

, For men, it may be fairly easy to match your cowboy boots to an outfit, but it can be slightly trickier for women. With so many variations in cowboy boot fashion, finding the right cowboy boots to match your wardrobe may take a little patience.Nearly all styles of cowboy boots will match well with blue or black jeans, but keep the type of jean in mind. More formal jeans may need a more formal looking cowboy boot that uses solid colors and a material that doesn't draw unnecessary attention.
Depending on the length of the your dress or shorts, you may want to choose a cowboy boot that stands lower on your leg. This can give an elongating effect to your legs and even make you seem taller.
High or low standing boots look good with skinny jeans or leggings and are wide enough around the leg to easily go over thin clothing.
Neutral colored boots are easiest to match to various clothing items, so look for black, tan, brown or beige for maximum versatility.

, While there are many styles of cowboy boots to choose from, the classic western style of boot is often what people think of when they imagine cowboy boots. These boots will usually stand about 12 inches tall on your leg and the design is simple and straightforward.There are Classic Western Style boots and Classic Western Style work boots that look similar but are manufactured differently.
Western Style Workboots have a different heel that their traditional counterparts in order to make them more comfortable to be worn while standing for 12-14 hours per day.
Shortie Boots are also Classic Western in style but only stand about 6-10 inches up the leg. These boots can also be purchased in work boot trim.

, Roper Boots are the common choice among people that work at the rodeo. They are similar in many ways to Classic Western style boots but are designed to be more practical for the type of work many people find themselves doing around cattle.Roper Boots are lighter weight and have a wider sole than most Classic Western Style boots.
Some Roper Boots have a rubber sole like sneakers to help grip while working.

, Buckaroo boots are designed for show. These boots often have decorative stitching and other aesthetic flare to draw attention to the styling and workmanship of the boot.


Buckaroo boots are not designed to be particularly durable, but rather to be a fashion statement.
These boots tend to stand 14 inches tall on your leg.

, Riding Boots are not always thought of in the same vein as cowboy boots, as they are commonly worn in English riding circles. These boots have a similar cut to the varying styles of western cowboy boot, but lack some of the ornamentation.Riding boots come from the same lineage as western cowboy boots. Early cowboy boots were based on the classic Riding Boot design.
These boots look plain compared to most cowboy boots, making them easy to identify.

, The Stockman Boot is designed to work hard and look good doing it. These boots combine many of the elements one might find in no nonsense Roper Boots with some of the flair often found on Buckaroo Boots.


Stockman Boots have rubber soles, shorter heels and a wider toe box than many Classic Western Style boots.
These boots often have detailed and colored decorative stitching.

, The socks you wear can have a significant effect on the fit of your new cowboy boots, so take that into account when trying your boots on for the first time. Make sure to wear socks similar to those you intend to wear regularly in cowboy boots.Choosing socks that reach your pant leg or even the full height of the boot can prevent skin irritation from the boot rubbing on your bare skin.
Pay attention to the thickness of your socks when determining if a boot is loose or tight.

, The ball of your foot should be situated at the widest point in the boot to make sure your boots won’t cause any undue stress in your feet.If you place the ball of your foot in the widest portion of the boot and your heel is not near the back of the boot, you will need a smaller size.
If your toes and heel make it difficult to place the ball of your foot in the widest portion of the boot, you will need a bigger size.

, It’s important to make sure you have sufficient room for your toes and that your heel doesn’t slip around as you walk. Even if you have the ball of your foot placed properly, some styles of boot may limit toe room or fit on your foot in an odd way.You should have about a thumb width of space between the end of your toe and the tip of the boot.
Your heel should not slide up and down at all in the boot as you walk, this could cause blisters and make wearing the boots painful.

, Wearing boots that are too narrow for your feet can cause pain simply by wearing them, and would certainly causes issues if you intend to work while wearing your boots.Look down while wearing the boots. They should be snug, but you should be able to see the stitching on the outsole of the boot on either side while they’re on.
If the boots are too wide, that looseness could also cause your heel to rub, creating blisters.

Women’s Cowboy Boots are typically sized in A, B and C widths, while Men’s Cowboy Boots are typically sized in B, D and EE widths.

, While cowboy boots that fit well should be comfortable right out of the box, they will grow more comfortable as you break them in by wearing them. Leather boots eventually take on the shape of your foot and can become extremely comfortable.


Wear your boots often while standing and walking to break them in quickly.
Breaking in boots can cause blisters, so be sure to take good care of your feet and wear fresh socks when wearing your cowboy boots.

Waterproof shoes for swimming are often made with mesh, rubber and other materials that allow water to flow through them. They give you stability to stand on rocks in a riverbed or walk across a swimming pool.
Waterproof golf shoes are created for extremely wet golf conditions. They have the spikes of non-waterproof golf shoes and they are made to fit you more tightly in the middle to help with stability while you swing. Waterproof versions tend to cost more because they are usually made with breathable leather uppers so your feet don't get too wet during a long game.
Waterproof walking shoes offer cushioning for the ball of the foot because of the emphasis placed there during walking.
Waterproof running shoes are very lightweight. They offer more cushioning in the heel than walking shoes do, since there is more impact on the body when you run. If you plan to do trail-running, then look for shoes with gripping soles and waterproof uppers - a mix between a hiking shoe and a running shoe.
Waterproof hiking shoes are made in a similar way as hiking boots, but they are not created for heavy backpacking and they have limited support on the ankles. Many of these hiking shoes are made with Gore-Tex material and lining that wicks sweat and moisture away from you. Gore-Tex fabric goes through a similar process as Teflon to make it waterproof. Then, they are made with mesh or leather uppers to keep water out.
Waterproof sailing shoes have an extra grip on the bottom for stability on a boat; however, the grip will not put marks on the boat. They often are treated to withstand salt water, which can eat away at normal shoes. They also allow water to flow through the shoe without having to take them off.;
, Some people in hot climates or people who do strenuous activities prefer to go without a waterproof lining to increase breath-ability and the drying time of the shoe once it gets wet. A Gore-Tex lining is apt to wick away water, but may be more expensive.

, You cannot tell by simply looking if a shoe will fit your foot shape or size.

,

Hold the shoe with 1 hand and bend the toe up with the other hand. If the shoe does not bend at the ball of the foot, then put it back because it will be uncomfortable when walking. The ball of the foot is the soft, meaty spot before your toes.






Twist the shoe. Unless you are choosing swimming shoes, there should be some resistance when you try to turn it.







,, If the shoes do not fit snugly, then put them back.

,


Walk uphill in the shoes on a slope or stairs. If your heel lifts more than a very small amount off the heel when you pick your feet up, then there will be too much movement, which will cause blisters.
Walk downhill. If your toes touch the end of the shoe, then try another size or move on to the next shoe.

, Some shoes, especially those made with leather, have a 2 year warranty.

, The upside of this is that you may get a better price on the Internet. The downside is that it may take a while to find or you might have to wait for a sale.

, Most waterproof shoes are featured at full-price before and during the summer because people are engaged in outdoor activities. If you can wait, fall or winter are great times to look for a lower price.


If you wait for a sale, the store is less likely to carry your size, because part of the stock will already have been sold.

, Be sure to sign up for a warranty or fill out a card, if the shoes or shoe store offers a warranty.

Choose comfortable shoes.,
Choose the material carefully.,
Choose water-resistant shoes.,
Avoid wearing pointed shoes.,
Choose adjustable shoes.",How to Choose Shoes if You Have Diabetes," Comfort should top the priority chart for diabetics when it comes to choosing a shoe. Check that the shoe fits well and provides enough room to your feet, allowing for expansion due to swelling and daily wear. Try to wiggle your toes while in the shoe to see whether you have any troubles doing that.
, Shoes today come in a variety of materials, some more breathable and flexible than others. It's recommended that you try to purchase a shoe that is made of suede, leather or canvas.Never ever purchase a shoe that contains even the hint of plastic or other abrasive material; this type of material for shoes reduces the breathability of your feet. That is not at desirable, especially for a patient of diabetes., Constant exposure of a diabetic foot to water can harm the foot.Purchase a waterproof shoe that provides adequate resistance to your feet from water and never allows your feet to get wet., Pointed shoes usually cramp your feet, restricting the blood supply. This reduces the breathability and flexibility of your feet. The shoe should be flat at the toes, not too narrow and definitely not pointy., The diabetic foot tends to swell at times, more than the average swelling a person can expect during the day. This prompts the need for a shoe that is adjustable and provides a high amount of comfort even when your feet have swollen. Ensure that the straps of your shoe are adjustable and provide your feet enough room to breathe.

Sports walking style shoes are often a good choice, as they will come with Velcro tabs that can be adjusted.

Understand that sizes may vary among shoe brands and styles.,
Select a shoe that conforms as nearly as possible to the shape of your foot.

,
Have your feet measured regularly.,
Have both feet measured.,
Fit at the end of the day when your feet are largest.

,
Stand during the fitting and check that there is adequate space (3/8"" to 1/2"") for your longest toe at the end of each shoe.

,
Make sure the ball of your foot fits comfortably into the widest part (ball pocket) of the shoe.

,
Ask about different widths if your feet are wider or narrower than average.

,
Ask about half sizes if you think you are in between.,
Don’t purchase shoes that feel tight, expecting them to stretch to fit.

,
Your heel should fit comfortably in the shoe with minimum amount of slippage.

,
Walk in the shoe to make sure it fits and feels right.,
Avoid tall heels, especially high, pointy ones.,
Look and feel for padding and cushioning.",How to Choose Comfortable Dress Shoes," Do not select shoes by the size marked inside the shoe. Judge the shoe by how it fits on your foot.;
,, The size of your feet change as you grow older.

, Most people have one foot larger than the other one. Fit to the largest foot.

,,,,, Not all stores carry them, but when they do, you may find that you're happier in between whole numbers.

,,, (Fashionable shoes CAN be comfortable and healthy!)

, For all their glamor and fashion, these shoes are the least comfortable of the bunch. They concentrate your weight on a smaller area than your foot was designed to walk on, increasing pressure and often creating pinch points. They can make balance difficult and sink into soft materials, like sand or turf. Go with low heels or flats as much as possible, especially if you will spend much time on your feet in these shoes.

, There doesn't seem to be as much space for it in dress shoes as in athletic shoes, but take all you can get. Any layer of foam or rubber that can cushion the impact between hard pavement and your foot will make standing and walking more comfortable.

Look at and feel the leather.,
Select shoes with a moderately shaped toe.,
Pick shoes with a heel that’s less than one inch high.,
Stick to lace up shoes for formal or business professional settings.,
Choose slip-on shoes for business casual attire.,
Choose a pair of black shoes for the best versatility.,
Select a pair of brown shoes for backup and variety.",How to Choose Men's Dress Shoes1," Dress shoes made of leather are the ideal choice. Leather will be smooth but not too smooth, and may be shiny but not enough to see your reflection. Watch out for shoes that seem too shiny and have a plastic feel to them. These are not likely to be genuine leather, so avoid them.You don’t have to choose leather shoes, but leather lasts longer and works better with with dress clothes.;
, Dress shoes range from squared toes to narrowly pointed toes, but neither is your best option. Look for a toe that strikes the balance between squared and pointed. This shape of toe will fit more outfits and look better overall.There is no exact shape that is always right. It’s more about looking for something that seems balanced between the two extremes.

, Dress shoes have varying heel heights, and there is a fine line between too high and just right. The one inch mark, or a bit lower, is what you should shoot for. Otherwise, you’ll appear to be wearing shoes with a lifted heel and it will take away from your overall look.Most dress shoes have a heel, but some may not. Flat shoes are okay in casual settings, but formal or professional wear should have a heel.

, When choosing dress shoes for work or a formal occasion, laces are a must. Typical lace up shoes include most Oxfords and Derbies. Slip on shoes may be easier, but laced shoes look much more professional.If you are wearing a suit, lace up shoes are a must. If you are wearing dress pants and a button up shirt but no suit jacket, you may not need lace up shoes.
If you are attending a black-tie affair and are wearing a tuxedo, you’ll want to wear laced shoes.

, Slip-on shoes are ideal for more relaxed settings. Wear a pair of loafers or boat shoes when you need something dressier than running shoes but a little less dressy than lace-up Oxfords.These are good for summer. Slip-ons will complete a khaki shorts and polo shirt outfit.
If you wear slacks and a buttoned shirt for work, you’ll be fine wearing loafers. Slip-on shoes are good for a casual dinner party or similar setting, as well.
Slip-ons may have tassels or a buckle. They may be smooth or have a bumpy surface like suede.

, Black tends to go with almost every color, except brown. If your wardrobe consists of suits that are mostly black, gray, or blue, black shoes will match those best. Black shoes can also work with khaki pants or even jeans.If you can only buy one pair of shoes, go with black unless your suits are only brown or tan.
For the pair of shoes you’ll wear most often, look for a smooth, somewhat shiny finish. It’s good to have a pair of suede shoes in your collection, but not as your primary pair.

, Brown shoes are still dress shoes, but they must be matched more carefully. Brown and tan suits look best with brown shoes, although there is great variety of shades. Pay attention to whether or not the brown shoes you select match the brown clothes you’ll wear them with.


Look for shoes that are a single shade of brown to make matching your clothes easier.

Get checked again as needed.",How to Choose a Proper Running Shoe Based on Your Gait," Gait analysis should involve having you run on a treadmill in a 'neutral' pair of running trainers. You should be filmed, and the device/app that the running shop use to film you should allow zooming in/slowing down. A neutral shoe is a running shoe that doesn't have any extra support in the arch of the shoe.

There are 3 different types of 'gait' that people will fall into:

Neutral- when your foot hits  the ground, your arch doesn't collapse in past a right angle to the ground.
Over-pronation- Where your arch collapses past the point of a right angle/arch drops inwards.
Supination- Where your foot stays too far on the outside of the foot during your full stride.


This is why gait analysis is so important, to find the right kind of shoe for your running style.Neutral runners make up 20% of gaits, Over-pronators make up 75% of runners, leaving 5% of runners who are supinators. In other words, the majority of runners 'arches collapse under load during their stride, and therefore need support in the shoe.;
, There are varying levels of cushioning/comfort depending on people's preference of feel and their budget.
If you over-pronate, you need a structured trainer/support trainer. These trainers have a double density material in the arch of the shoe which is a lot harder than the rest of the sole. The idea behind this is, as your arch collapses, the double density block will not allow the arch to collapse past the point of the right angle, hence converting an over-pronating gait into a neutral one. Strength of the double density block varies from brand to brand, so its worth trying a few different ones to find the correct one for you.
Supinators are very very rare, and in such cases, you will be best to go and see a podiatrist who will likely make you some orthotic inserts to put in your shoes/trainers to correct the gait to neutral.

, The reason this support is so important is it can drastically reduce risks of injury/make your run a lot more comfortable and enjoyable. If you over-pronate and don't have the correct support, it puts extra stress on your calf muscles, and your shins. This, in turn, will increase your muscles' recovery time in between runs.

If you took 12 hours to recover in between runs, it could add as much as another 6 hours to that recovery time. So you go out on your next run on an already stressed muscle. This will add even more recovery time to the stressed muscle, and so it goes on until you have an injury. Shin splints are very common as your muscles are swollen, adding pressure to your shins; it will feel like a dull ache that is not very pleasant at all.

, Although it is very rare that your gait will change, it is worth getting done each time you replace your running trainers. Mainly for peace of mind, but as you get stronger muscles, it can change ever so slightly."

Focus on support.,
Create a smooth silhouette.,
Mind your neckline.,
Consider a convertible bra.,
Add volume.,
Slip into something sexier once the gown comes off.,
Create sex appeal with lace.,
Stick with white or nude for the ceremony.,
Play with color for the wedding night.",How to Choose Bridal Lingerie1," During your ceremony, support and comfort are more important that sexiness. The last thing you need on your big day is to worry about sagging or falling out of your gown, and you probably want to avoid wires that stab into your side or lace that chafes your breasts.;
, Look for seamless bras, especially if you have a gown made of lightweight fabric. You might be able to get away with a standard bra if your gown is made of heavier material, but you must make sure that no straps or other lines show through.

, Not many gowns have a convenient neckline that works with a standard t-shirt bra. Find a bra specifically designed to work with your neckline.


Choose a strapless bra or bandeau if you have a strapless gown. A strapless bra offers minimal support, while a bandeau offers plenty of support but may flatten your chest some.
Look for a backless bra that hooks at the waist if you have a backless gown.
Try stick cups if you have a smaller chest. These cups adhere to your skin, offer basic support and coverage. They do lack the same sort of support an actual bra would provide, however, so they are not recommended for women who are heavily endowed.

, If you buy your bridal bra before your gown, look for a convertible bra with adjustable straps. Basic convertible bras may convert into strapless bras or crisscross backs, but more advanced convertibles can be turned into halters, backless, t-shaped, and more.

, A good push-up bra can enhance your bust without looking too unnatural. Bras with cotton, gel, or water-filled pads can also create extra cleavage. Make sure whatever you choose looks and feels natural.

, Ribbons, lace, and other seductive details may ruin your smooth silhouette during the ceremony. Save these details for when you and your new husband can enjoy each other privately.

, Lace can be a sultry feature to have for your wedding night. A bra with a few scallops of lace along the border creates a sweet appeal, but a full lace bra that allows your skin to show through looks more naughty than nice.

, Match the color of your bra to the color of your skin or the color of the dress. Otherwise, it may show through the fabric.

, Once you no longer need to worry about the gown or the crowd, feel free to expand your color choices. White or ivory have sweet, traditional appeal, while black looks ultra-sexy. Pastel colors can also create a demure look for your new husband to enjoy, while bolder colors can look a little more powerful.

Try on shoes in the afternoon or evening.,
Wear the type of socks you’d wear with dress shoes.,
Buy a pair of shoes that fit when you first try them on.,
Walk around in the shoes to see how they feel.,
Buy two sizes when you order online.",How to Choose Men's Dress Shoes2," Your feet swell at least a little bit throughout the day, so don’t try on shoes first thing in the morning. If you buy shoes that fit perfectly before your feet have swollen, the shoes may feel tight as the day goes on. A tight fit with slightly swollen feet will be looser with your feet at their normal size.You don’t want your feet to be sore and sweaty. Walk just long enough that your feet expand to their slightly larger size.

, You want your dress shoes to have a snug fit. If you wear thick socks when you’re buying the shoes and thin socks later, the shoes will feel loose. When you’re choosing dress shoes, wear the socks you will most often wear with those shoes.It’s better to wear slightly thicker socks than socks that are too thin. Trying the shoes on with thicker socks will make sure you leave a bit of extra room.

, Leather dress shoes will not stretch much, if at all, so you won’t be able to break them in as you wear them. If the shoes feel too tight when you put them on, they will always be too tight. Only select shoes that fit just right when you buy them.Walking around in the shoes will help your feet get used to the way they fit, but if your feet are uncomfortable when you put them on, they may remain uncomfortable.

, When you find a pair you like, put on both shoes and walk around a bit. Pace the floor to get a feel for the shoes. Make a ten foot path back and forth a couple of times. Walk as you normally would. Don’t change your stride because of the shoes.Don’t buy shoes if you can’t try them on and walk around in them. There’s no way to know how the shoes fit you if you don’t walk in them.

, If you can’t make it to a store to try shoes on, it’s helpful to buy two different sizes to make sure one of them fits. The difficulty is deciding whether to buy a size bigger than usual or a size smaller. Be sure to know your foot size as closely as possible when you order.This will obviously cost more money, so take this into consideration when ordering. Unless you are in a pinch, buying dress shoes in store makes it easier to get the right shoes.

Stay comfortable during the ceremony.,
Create a smooth silhouette.,
Consider pantyhose with built-in underwear.,
Save sexy details for your wedding night.,
Try on boy shorts or top pants.,
Consider a thong.",How to Choose Bridal Lingerie2," You won't be able to readjust creeping panties while you say your vows, so if you choose something uncomfortable, you'll have to stay uncomfortable. Since weddings and receptions can take a while, this is best avoided. Wear a panty style you know you feel comfortable in rather than choosing a different type for the sake of being sultry.

, Look for seamless styles to prevent a panty line from showing through, and avoid added details like lace or ribbons that could create little bumps beneath the fabric.

, Gowns that are especially thin or slinky may show a panty line no matter what type you choose. Some pantyhose come with built-in underwear, however, which may create the smooth line you need.

, Lace and sheer fabrics allow your skin to teasingly peek through. Try to choose panties that match your bra to keep things looking uniform and to maximize your sex appeal.

, Both options cover your rear, but boy shorts are a little tighter than tap pants. These options blend comfort with seduction, since racy details, like lace or mesh, can make these otherwise conservative options a little sultrier.

, These traditionally sexy panties offer no rear coverage, and many women may find them uncomfortable. If you do opt for this choice, look for one made of seamless microfiber, mesh, or cotton to reduce any possible discomfort.

"
"
Keep things simple with sheer pantyhose.,
Add support with a control top hose.,
Try tights to avoid holes.,
Opt for knee-highs and/or thigh-highs if you want to remove them during the reception.,
Create a sexier look with garter belts and stockings.",How to Choose Bridal Lingerie3," A standard nude pantyhose smooths out your legs for the ceremony. It may not be the sultriest of options, but it will promote a smooth silhouette.

, If you have a little extra weight in your midsection or thighs, try pantyhose with a control top to help flatten it out. Control tops have thicker material toward the top of the hose, which keeps extra flab in check.

, Tight are a bit thicker than nylon hose and may make better options for brides planning on dancing at the reception.

, It may be impossible for you to remove standard pantyhose before you attend the reception, but knee-high hose are much easier to remove. This option makes another good choice for brides who plan on dancing during the reception.

, Some brides can get away with this during the wedding if they have a full skirt, but otherwise, you can easily slip into this for the wedding night. Garters and garter belts are available in a number of racy, lacy varieties. White stockings have traditional bridal appeal, but black or brown can create a sexy contrast for your new husband to enjoy.

"
"
Keep your figure in check with slimmers or shapers.,
Add volume to your bust with a corset, bustier, or merry widow.,
Create a demure wedding night look with a teddy, babydoll, or chemise.,
Look for matching sets.",How to Choose Bridal Lingerie4," Modern day slimmers use lycra or spandex to flatten flab, keep your body smooth, and create a flattering silhouette beneath your gown.

, These garments push up your bosom while nipping in at your waist, creating a remarkably curvy figure. If you want to wear one during your ceremony, stick with a seamless bustier. For the wedding night, however, you can expand your options to molded corsets, complete with boning that shapes the torso and garters to attach stockings to.

, These undergarments cover a lot more than a simple bra, but they can look just as sexy. A teddy stops at the waist or hip, while a babydoll extends over the behind. Chemises are the longest and usually drape down to your mid-thigh. For sexier options, look for versions made from sheer or embroidered mesh. To further promote a demure look, opt for version in silk or satin.

, Most bridal lingerie is often sold in sets, and you can also buy a white bathrobe and nightgown set with white matching slippers.

"
"
If you decide that you want a real corset, not just a bodice, you will need to look at the boning.,
Next examine the fabric.,
Check out the fastenings.,
Look at the laces down the back of the corset.,
Know that style and fit of a corset can be the biggest issue especially if you are an unusual shape.",How to Choose a Corset," All good quality modern corsets are made with steel boning of some kind, which serves the purpose of holding the fabric taut and stopping it from going into folds at your waist and bunching at the back where it laces up. The boning in tops and bodices is usually just thin plastic, so don't make the mistake of imagining you will be able to wear a normal boned top as a corset.


To test if the boning is good enough, bend it quite sharply and it should spring back. If it kinks, it's a sure sign that it will dig in to your waist and be very uncomfortable.
It doesn't matter if the boning around the corset is slightly more flexible, so long as the bones at the front and back are fairly rigid.;
, Even if you're looking for more of a bodice than a corset, you'll still need a strong fabric like coutil, drill, heavyweight, or canvas. Corsets usually have a fashion fabric and a lining, so you might not be able to see the strong layer but you will be able to feel that it is quite tough.


Take the corset in both hands and tug on the fabric. It should feel very sturdy with no give whatsoever. If the fabric is thin enough to scrunch in your hand, it won't be sturdy enough.
Incidentally, if the shop assistant thinks you're damaging it, it definitely won't be strong enough to last!

, Remember that a steel busk is the usual fastening for the front of a corset, and with very few exceptions it's the only type of fastener that is strong enough.


Hooks and eyes will not last long, and likewise zips are best avoided.
A busk looks like a piece of fairly solid steel boning with loops and studs (a bit like hooks and eyes) attached. If a corset doesn't have a busk, it will need to have some other kind of solid boning down the front.

, These are usually made of flat cotton, like shoelaces. Some types of ribbon can be used, but they have to be very strong material. Eyelets should be very well attached, otherwise they can pop off easily.


Check that the laces have washers on the back, rather than just gripping into the fabric. There should also be solid boning either side of the eyelets to distribute the tension.

, Corsets are always sized by waist measurement, not dress size. The number on the label will be something like ""22"" ""24"" ""26"" etc., which is the actual measurement in inches of the waistline of the corset. You will need one about 4 inches (10.2 cm) smaller than your own waist, so you can lace in a bit and have a gap in the laces.


Corsets are designed to give a curvy figure to an average-shaped person, so if you are already quite curvy, you might need to get a ""tight lacing"" corset which has bigger hips (or even better yet, get one made-to-measure).

Don't panic.,
Keep your clothing down at all times.,
Change to more comfortable clothing if possible.,
Avoid doing sports and activities that could cause your clothing to come up.,
Avoid hitching up long skirts around your waistline.,
Wear your jacket or coat during the day.,
Be careful with positioning yourself during the day.",How to Hide the Fact That You Forgot to Wear Underwear," Most likely nothing will happen and your lack of underwear won't be noticed by anyone because your clothes are covering your behind. You'll be just fine; the main thing is to be alert to anything that might happen if there is a gust, playing sports or getting something caught on your clothing.

You could talk to someone in the school office, if you feel comfortable. They may have spare clean pairs of new underwear for just such a problem. If not, someone may come up with a solution, such as calling your parents, letting you go home to change or going to a local store to get you a pair, etc.;
, If this means you have to hold it down, then do so. Pay attention to sudden gusts of wind, getting clothing caught on things or pranksters lifting up your skirt or dress. If you've worn shorts or trousers, be careful of any pranksters wanting to pull them down. It's probably unlikely but you never know.


If you're wearing a skirt or dress and it gets gusty or windy outside, try to stay indoors. When you go outdoors, keep one hand holding your skirt or dress down.

, If you have your sport kit with you, you could put your shorts on and tell people that your mom had to sew them and you were forced to wear your gym kit. Or, just wear the sports shorts under your usual clothes as substitute underwear; it'll work for the day.

, Forget cartwheels and handstands for the day. Avoid playing sports games that could cause you to fall over, jump or somehow reveal your behind. You may need to confide in your PE teacher as to why you need to sit out., Don't make long clothes shorter when you're missing underwear.

, If it covers your backside, this will be helpful. Another good solution is to tie your jacket or hoodie sleeves around your waist and have the jacket or hoodie hang down past your behind. This will provide added cover and probably help to keep your lower clothing in place.

, Some things to consider include:

Sit carefully during the day if you're wearing a dress or skirt. Keep your legs closed whenever sitting, or carefully cross them without revealing anything.
Don't put one leg up on anything when standing if wearing a dress or skirt. Keep both legs firmly planted on the ground all day, apart from walking with care. Avoid running unless you've really no choice.

Lay the pantyhose flat on your towel.,
Roll pantyhose into your thick towel.,
Hang the pantyhose to let them air dry.,
Use a second dry towel and repeat the process.",How to Dry Pantyhose in a Hurry1," Use a dry bath towel for best results. The thicker the towel is, the more effective this method will be. If you do not have a thick towel, repeat the method using two separate towels., Roll the towel up and let your pantyhose become rolled inside. Avoid twisting or wringing the rolled towel. Apply some pressure onto the towel. The towel will absorb most of the moisture, and it should only take minutes to air dry the pantyhose afterward.

, Hang them on a clothesline or towel rack. If no other options are available, pull the shower curtain aside and use the shower rod to hang them. Be sure that they are not bunched up, since this could cause wrinkles. The drying process should take 20 to 30 minutes., If your pantyhose are still wet, and the first towel has become moist with water from the pantyhose, find a second towel. Repeat the process before hanging the pantyhose to dry."

Identify what parts of your body you are happy with.,
Establish that size is not important.,
Find a swimsuit that flatters your body.,
Look into swim cover-ups.,
Pick out accessories.",How to Feel Comfortable in a Swimsuit1," You may feel uncomfortable with your body in a swimsuit, but most everyone has a body part they love. Perhaps you have great hair, a pretty smile, or toned legs. Admiring positive aspects of your physical appearance will help you find the confidence to put on a swimsuit. Discern what parts of your body people compliment. Also recognize what parts of your body you try to accentuate on a daily basis.
Everyone has positive physical traits. You just have to recognize them.;
, The ideal body is often portrayed as a thin man or woman in a small swimsuit, but remember that there is no true ideal body. Choosing a swimsuit in a size that seems less than ideal can be intimidating, when in fact, the ideal size is the one that fits you best. Remember that the only size that matters is the one that you feel healthy and happy in., Choose a style of swimsuit based off of your favorite features. A swimsuit that is made for your body type and accentuates your features will be easier to feel comfortable in.If you like your collar bone, wear a bathing suit that has crossing bands in the front. This type of bathing suit will emphasize your manubrium (upper part of the sternum).
If your legs are what you feel most confident about, choose a high cut bathing suit.
Try a “modestkini” that covers up most of your body if you feel most confident wearing modest clothing.
Alternatively, pick a bathing suit that makes you feel more confident about an insecure area. If you are insecure about a small bust, choose a swimsuit top with ruffles or a triangle top to create the illusion of curves. If you are insecure about your thighs, try a bathing suit with a skirt.

, If the thought of wearing nothing but a swimsuit makes you nervous, consider a swim cover-up that accentuates the part of your body that you are insecure about. Cover-ups are a quick and fashionable way to ease into wearing your swimsuit around other people.High-waist shorts are a good cover-up if you are insecure about your lower back and hip area.
A sarong wrap is a cute cover-up for your legs and thighs.
A sundress or terry cloth robe are great cover-ups, too.

, Chances are that no one is looking at the parts of your body that you perceive as flaws, but accessories can take the attention away from your swimsuit. Accessories are fun to wear and a great confidence boost. Choose fun sunglasses, cute wedges, or a floppy sunhat, and match it with your swimsuit.Practice moderation when you choose accessories. Too many accessories at once can be distracting.
Choose the right accessories for the occasion. It’s okay to wear wedges to a pool party, but they aren’t great to wear at the beach.

Find a heating vent.,
Hang the pantyhose.,
Use a hairdryer.",How to Dry Pantyhose in a Hurry2," If you have a heating vent in your home or available to you, you can use this to your advantage. Set it to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). This vent will act as a dryer for your wet pantyhose., Hang the pantyhose over a piece of furniture approximately one foot (30.48 cm) from the vent, so that the hot air will hit it and dry your pantyhose. Leaving them hanging for long periods of time can cause stretching, so only try this if the towel method fails or is unavailable to you., In a pinch, you can use a hairdryer on either the “low,” “warm,” or “cool” heat setting to dry the pantyhose. Most hotel rooms come equipped with a hair dryer, which is usually stored in the bathroom. Hang the pantyhose on a towel rack before beginning to dry them."

Get into your car.,
Open the car window.,
Accelerate your speed.,
Drive to a discrete location.",How to Dry Pantyhose in a Hurry3," In a real emergency, and in good weather, you can dry your pantyhose from the window of a moving car.

, Carefully, hold the pantyhose out of your window so that the legs of them are hanging out. Be sure to maintain a tight grip on them so that you do not lose them while the car is in motion. Be sure to do this in a private place, such as a parking lot, where no other cars are passing by., Do not exceed the posted speed limit, but drive quickly so that the wind dries your pantyhose. Hopefully, the sun will be out and can help in this drying process as well.

, Unroll the window, pull on your hosiery while in the car, and check that all is in order. Then, you should be ready to make your grand entrance.

Counter negative thoughts.,
Refrain from pointing out your flaws.,
Ignore media messages.,
Practice wearing your swimsuit.,
Surround yourself with the right people.,
Meditate on the positive.",How to Feel Comfortable in a Swimsuit2," Remember to be grateful for your body. Instead of worrying over body parts that don’t appear quite the way you would like them to, be grateful that you are in the position to go the beach, pool, or lake. Focusing on what your body does for you prevents negative thoughts from setting in.Alternatively, if you are focusing on one body part that you are insecure about, counteract it with thinking of a body part that you are confident about. For example, if you are insecure about your legs, remind yourself that you have great arms.

, It is sometimes tempting to point out your flaws to other people. Repeatedly pointing out your flaws will lead you to believing in what you say over time.


Pointing out your flaws around others will make them uncomfortable and possibly make them think that you will look for flaws in them, too., Remember that you are more than your body. Societal pressure and media has placed an importance on an ideal body type, but it is important to remember that you are not your body. A healthy body is important, but in the end, it is “just” a body. What matters is how you act, what you are passionate about, and how you treat others. People will focus on how you portray yourself far more than they will focus on a swimsuit., Spend time in your swimsuit or in clothing that you would not normally wear. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but doing this will help you build the courage to wear a swimsuit without negative thoughts.Start by wearing your swimsuit around your home. Spend time walking around or going about your daily activities as usual.
Next, invite a few people over for a beach-themed party. Specify on the invite that your should wear their swimsuits or beach attire.
Once you are feeling more comfortable in your swimsuit, visit a local pool. Perhaps visit during a slow hour or day when it isn’t too crowded.
Go out to the beach, lake, or pool without considering how many people might be there once you’ve started to feel comfortable in your swimsuit.

, Spending time with people that are overly critical of themselves will eventually rub off on you. Especially avoid people that act negatively towards you. Surrounding yourself with positive people will be beneficial to you., Spend five to ten minutes thinking body-positive thoughts before you head out in your swimsuit. Clear your mind of judgment and insecurities. Beginning your time in your swimsuit with the right mindset prevents discomfort that stems from harmful thoughts.Repeat to yourself mantras such as “may I be happy.”

"
"
Don’t compare yourself to others.,
Remember why you are wearing your swimsuit.,
Understand that you are your most critical judge.,
Deflect negative attention.,
Refocus your thoughts.,
Practice confidence and positivity.",How to Feel Comfortable in a Swimsuit3," A quick way to ruin comfort and confidence is to compare yourself with others. Try to remember that every body is unique, and everyone else wearing a swimsuit is probably experiencing insecurity, too. Celebrate the differences instead of admiring one, specific type of body., You are probably wearing a swimsuit to go to a pool, beach, or lake. Don’t let discomfort ruin your experience. Remember that you are there first and foremost to enjoy yourself and the company of others., Nobody is as critical of your body as you are. Almost everyone exaggerates their physical flaws. You may be the only one who notices what you perceive as an imperfection., There is most likely no reason for anyone to say anything hurtful you. If someone does say something negative about you, do your best to not let it get to you.Return their negativity with a compliment. If someone says that you don’t look good in the swimsuit you’re wearing, respond by complimenting his or her, accessories, item of clothing, or hair.
Let them know that what they said is hurtful and change the subject. Tell the person that insulted you that you don’t appreciate the inappropriate behavior, and move on by commenting on the occasion or your surroundings.
Ignore the comment and continue talking to your friends. Act as if you didn’t hear what was said and talk to your friends about a subject that is unrelated to the negative comment.

, Staying comfortable might be going well at first, but insecurities may start coming to mind as time passes in your swimsuit. If that happens, take a few minutes to return to your meditation. Recall what you like about yourself, why you’re there, and that you should be happy.

, Be confident despite your anxieties. Nothing is sexier than being confident with yourself if you make peace with your body. It’s easier said than done, but it is possible with perseverance.

Decide where to shop.,
Know her size.,
Choose a style.,
Take her body type into account.,
Choose a color.",How to Buy Lingerie As a Gift," Shopping in retail stores can be difficult and uncomfortable at times. You can get the look and feel of the garment you are selecting for your sweetheart but you may be the nervous type and wind up selecting the wrong item. Sometimes salespeople will approach you and tempt you into buying something that may be inappropriate for your relationship. Online lingerie stores are the best, easiest and safest place to shop. Your purchase there is discreet and confidential and can be returned. Just be sure the store has a return policy that is acceptable to you.;
, First, be sure the site you purchase from has sizing charts so that you can match that to her. You will need to do some investigation to figure out her correct size. Also, remember that all manufacturers sizing runs differently so be sure to email them if you are not sure. A good seller of intimates will quickly respond to questions and if they don’t then don’t expect them to ship promptly. When picking a size choose something on the smaller side rather than larger. It is better for your purchase to be too tight on her rather too loose. This could change the mood of the occasion very quickly !! Check out her underwear drawer and examine the labels.

When considering the style, think about your relationship and how intimate you are and how long you have been together. You can then choose something that is casual and on the safe side such as lace, satin or silk. Or, select something more risky such as leather, Lycra, PVC or vinyl. Be careful, PVC is great for the right occasion but only fits well on true sized people. This is also true for leather so be cautious when choosing this type of material. These types of outfits sometimes are better discussed in advance before purchasing. You want your lady to feel comfortable with your purchase so it is important that is pleases both of you.

, Choose garter belts for the taller woman or corset types of outfits. Garters belts will make her legs go on forever! Also, a body stocking may be a fun choice (make sure it has an open crotch for convenience). For the larger woman a baby-doll may be a good choice. Baby-doll are fitted around the bra area so go by bra size.

, These choices are simple. Most women can wear red, white or black but try to match her hair color. Blondes look good in pastels and great in black. Brunettes need rich blues and reds. Redheads look good in green, blue and earthy tones. Skin tone is also an important factor. For darker skin, go for a lighter color lingerie. Pale skin tones look better in darker colors.

Measure your waist and hips.,
Double check your measurements to consult sizing information.,
Look for firm elastic.,
Avoid underwear that’s too tight.,
Check for bunching, rolling, or sagging.",How to Choose Comfortable Underwear1," You’ll be able to find the proper size for your underwear across brands if you know your waist and hip measurements. Use a tape measure to measure your natural waist and the fullest part of your hips so you can choose the most comfortable size for your body.You can find your natural waist by bending sideways. A crease will form at your waist to help you identify it.
Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground when you measure your hips.;
, It’s a good idea to measure both your waist and hips twice to make sure that you get the same measurement both times. Once you have your waist and hip measurements, you can consult the sizing information for any underwear you’re considering to ensure a proper fit., No one wants to to be pulling at their underwear all day to keep it from slipping or falling down. Choose underwear that has firm elastic in the waistband so you know it will stay in place.While firm elastic at the waist is helpful in underwear, avoid styles with elasticized leg holes. They have a tendency to bunch up, which can be uncomfortable.

, Underwear that’s too tight doesn’t just lead to unflattering bulges and lumps beneath your clothing; it can also cause skin chafing and irritation from the friction. In general, any underwear that’s tight enough to leave marks on your skin is too tight.Underwear that’s too tight also doesn’t breathe as well, so it can lead to health issues and leave you a little sweaty.

, Before leaving the house for the day, it’s important to make sure that your undies are lying smoothly against your body. Any pair that bunches, rolls, or sags under your clothing is going to be uncomfortable because you’ll be tugging at them to keep them from pinching your skin or falling down."

Choose thicker hosiery.,
Look for reinforced toes.,
Buy one size up.,
Wash tights and stockings by hand.,
Put new tights in the freezer.,
Pull tights on carefully.,
Keep fingernails and skin smooth.,
Wait to put on jewelry.,
Be mindful of what you sit on or lean up against.,
Apply clear nail polish.,
Spray on a small amount of hairspray.,
Use Wite-Out.,
Trim excess fibers.,
Cut up tights that are beyond repair.",How to Avoid Hosiery Runs," Choose thicker, opaque tights over thin and sheer ones, as these will be sturdier and less likely to catch and run.


Look out for tights that list a denier count on the label, which is a measurement for the thickness of tights. Choose a higher denier count for a sturdier wear.Choose a thicker knit or ""sweater tights"" in colder months for a very durable pair that it closer in thickness to leggings.;
, Find tights that have a reinforced toe area around the seam to prevent toes from causing runs or holes, especially when they rub up against the inside of your shoes.


Try slipping on thin no-show socks over or under tights to lend extra reinforcement to the toe and heel areas. During the winter you can wear thicker and taller socks under boots for even greater protection.Also make sure the shoes you wear with tights fit well and don’t rub too much. Purchase inserts made from smooth gel to help your shoes fit better and not rub against tights.

, When you’re buying tights, opt for a pair in a size up from what you normally wear if possible. This will prevent extra stretch or pulling which could make tights more susceptible to runs.


Look for “Tall” sizes for a longer fit, whether you actually have long legs or you just want some more allowance to prevent runs.

, Launder your hosiery separately from other garments, ideally by hand or in a lingerie bag if you put them in the washing machine. Keep garments with clasps, zippers, or other metal fastenings well away from tights in the wash.


Use a mesh lingerie bag with a very fine weave, as tights can actually work their way out of holes in a looser-weave bag in the wash.Avoid high heat in the dryer, excessive washing, or harsh detergents and fabric softeners, as these could all wear out the fibers of tights quicker over time. Use mild detergents meant for delicates, set your washer to the delicates setting, and hang or lay the tights flat to dry., Follow this unusual trick of leaving your tights in a plastic bag in the freezer until you wear them. The cold may contribute to strengthening the fibers, leading to fewer runs.


Run new tights under water, wring out the excess, then seal them in a plastic bag before putting them in the freezer. Take them out before you want to wear them to let them thaw gradually before pulling them on.You need only do this before the first wear of new tights, but if you think it may help them last longer, you can continue to store tights in the freezer until you want to wear them.

, Gather all of the material of one leg of your tights between the thumb and forefinger of each hand, all the way to the toe. Then slip your foot inside and pull the tights up the rest of your leg, releasing the gathered fabric in one gentle motion rather than pulling and yanking it in stages.


Ensure that when you pull on a skirt or dress that no zippers or other fastenings catch on the material of your tights.

, Examine your fingernails and toenails before pulling on tights. If you have any that are too long with jagged or sharp edges, cut or file them down to a smooth curve. Moisturize your legs and feet to prevent cracked or peeling skin from catching on tights.


Focus on your heels when you moisturize, as they can commonly develop more cracks and rough callouses. You may even want to exfoliate with a pumice stone or scrub if you have very rough skin on your feet.
You can also moisturize your hands right before putting tights on to keep rough surfaces and hangnails from catching as you’re pulling and manipulating the tights with your fingers., Put on rings, bracelets, or watches only after you’re done pulling on and adjusting hosiery, as these can easily catch on the material.


Remember to remove your jewelry again before taking off the tights at the end of the day or night.Toe rings can also easily catch on tights when slipping your foot into them. Remove toe rings if you plan to wear tights. They won’t show in closed shoes anyway.

, While wearing your tights out, avoid surfaces or other objects with rough, sharp, or uneven textures, as they can catch on your tights if you come in contact with them.


For example, a concrete or wood bench or step could harm your tights when you sit down on it. Try to pull clothing over tights, place something between your tights and the surface, or choose a different seat altogether.
Hardware and sharp embellishments on your own shoes can also ruin your tights while you’re walking or crossing your legs, so opt for smooth footwear before you go out., Remove hosiery that already has a small run or snag as soon as possible. Place your hand into the leg of the tights where the run is and paint a dot of clear nail polish on the edges of the tear. Allow the tights to dry completely before wearing.


It’s important that you have your hand or another object like a piece of cardboard or paper in between the two layers of the tights, as you do not want the nail polish to stick the two sides together as it dries.
You can use colors other than clear for the nail polish, but it should match the color of the tights or not show a visible difference.
Have a washcloth and nail polish remover on hand for any accidents, and avoid getting nail polish on your skin at all costs.

, Apply hairspray to the beginning of a run to keep it from spreading any wider. Spray on the thinnest layer possible, as you don’t want your tights to get sticky or gunky.


You can also use hairspray as a preventative treatment. Spray a very thin coat across the entire surface of your tights to help strengthen the fibers against snags and runs.Note that unlike nail polish, hairspray will wash away, so keep water away from your tights while you’re wearing them and reapply hairspray as needed after a wash cycle., Brush Wite-Out onto the beginnings of a small run in your tights. Apply to the edges of the run just like you would with the nail polish method.Use this treatment only if your run is in an unnoticeable area or if your tights are white, otherwise the Wite-Out can stand out too much.
Note that Wite-Out also washes out, so it will need to be reapplied after exposure to water.

, If any fibers in your tights are loose or sticking out, trim them very carefully by pinching the fabric around the loose thread and then cutting it away at the base. This will prevent loose fibers from getting caught and snagged in the future.Note that cutting at threads could cause unraveling and weakening of nearby fibers. Apply a dab of clear nail polish to the area before or after cutting.

, Buy tights in multi-packs of the same weight and color. If you get irreparable runs in the right leg of one pair and the left leg of another, simply cut off the ruined leg on each and wear the two pairs together to look like one single, run-free pair.This tip allows you to conserve and get more use out of the same pair of tights so you don’t have to buy new ones as often.
Don’t cut into the upper portion of the tights that goes around your hips and waist. In other words, don’t convert your tights into thigh-highs while you’re cutting; keep the waist so that each leg stays up.

Look for cotton underwear.,
Go with synthetic fabric for a slimmer fit.,
Save silk underwear for special occasions.",How to Choose Comfortable Underwear2," Cotton is king when it comes to comfortable underwear because it is breathable. That means moisture won’t be trapped in the fabric so your undies won’t get as sweaty and you won’t have to worry as much about bacterial and yeast infections.Because of the possibility of yeast infections, cotton underwear is a particularly good option for women.
Cotton underwear is also less likely to cause chafing or rashes.

, While cotton underwear’s breathability makes it more comfortable, it doesn’t always look smooth under clothing. For a slimmer, fit, opt for undies made from a stretchy, synthetic material, such nylon, Lycra, or spandex. Make sure that the crotch is lined with cotton, though, to ensure that you’re comfortable., Silk underwear definitely has a luxurious, sexy feel, but it doesn’t breathe as well as cotton. That means there’s a greater chance of moisture being trapped in your underwear, which can lead to infections. Only wear silk underwear on special occasions for the most comfortable feel."

Go with boxers for breathability.,
Opt for briefs if you have larger thighs.,
Pick boxer briefs if you have a large backside.,
Select boxer trunks for a slim build.",How to Choose Comfortable Underwear3," If you tend to sweat a lot or are prone to rashes or chafing, boxers allow for better airflow. For the best fit under clothing, choose a pair that has shorter, slimmer legs and a stretch-band waist.Boxers aren’t the best choice if you wear a lot of slim-fitting pants, such as suit trousers or skinny jeans.
Boxers offer little support, so be sure that’s not important to you before choosing them.

, If you have thicker thighs, underwear styles with legs, such as boxer or boxer briefs, tend to ride up during wear. That can cause rolls that show through your clothing. Instead, choose briefs to keep the extra material away from your legs., A cross between briefs and boxers, boxer briefs offer a slim fit and more support than boxers. They are especially comfortable for a larger backside because the stretch allows them to provide more coverage than briefs do so you won’t be tugging at your underwear all day.Boxer briefs are also a comfortable option if you are tall because their higher waistband doesn’t slip down beneath the waistline of your pants when you bend over.

, Boxer trunks, or hipsters, are a shorter version of boxer briefs, which usually sit at the mid- to upper-thigh. They are a comfortable option if you have a slim build because there isn’t much bunching under your clothing.If you have thicker thighs, boxer trunks aren’t usually a good option because they can ride up as you move.

Choose bikini briefs for everyday.,
Opt for high-waisted briefs if you have a large belly.,
Wear a thong if you prefer slimmer fitting clothing.,
Grab boy short underwear if you have a larger backside.",How to Choose Comfortable Underwear4," With their lower waistline and moderate coverage, a bikini brief is usually the classic option when it comes to women’s underwear styles. They will be a comfortable option for most body types, so it’s a good everyday style of underwear., If you carry most of your weight at your stomach, underwear with a lower waistband can be uncomfortable because it may bunch and roll. Choose a high-waisted brief style, which will cover your belly so you don’t have to keep pulling your undies up all day.High-waisted briefs can also be a comfortable option if you are curvy or have an hourglass figure.

, There’s nothing more annoying than tugging at your underwear to keep it from bunching under skinny jeans and other tighter fitting bottoms. A thong can be the most comfortable option because it has a barely there feel in the back that won’t add any bulk under your clothing.Thongs can be uncomfortable for some people, so test a pair out at home before committing to wearing them out for the day.

, For a pear shape body, where most of your weight is carried in your lower body, boy shorts provide plenty of coverage for a large butt. Opt for a seamless pair, and you won’t have to worry about them showing up under clothing.While they’re especially comfortable if you have a large backside, boy shorts work on nearly every body type.

Finished.

",How to Make Duct Tape Flip Flops," If you are using shoes, consider using a pair of flip flops or sandals. Their soles have a different shape compared to other shoes; this way, you can be certain that they will fit the toe area right.;
, If you'd like a thicker pair of flip flops, stack two pieces of cardboard together.Trace and cut the shapes out first, then glue them together. If you'd like a softer pair of flip flops, cut another foot shape out of a sheet of craft foam (the flexible kind) and glue it to the top of the cardboard. This will cushion your foot a little., They need to be a little wider than the sole so that you can wrap it around to the underside. If you are making a thicker flip flop (with two pieces of cardboard or foam), be sure to account for the thickness as well.

, Make sure that you have an even amount of tape hanging over the edges of the sole. This includes the heel and toe area. Do not fold these edges over just yet, however; there is one extra step you need to do. Overlap the pieces of tape by a little; this way, you can be sure that there are no gaps.

, Make sure that you cut all the way too the cardboard, but be careful not to actually snip the cardboard.For an even better fit, cut V-shaped notches at the arch, where the sole curves inward. Cut straight slits in the toe and heel area, where the sole curves outward., The little strips of tape will overlap, thanks to the slits you cut earlier. This will give you a cleaner edge and reduce bulk., If you have not already, repeat this entire section for the other foot as well. Remember to trace your opposite foot or shoe this time, or else you will end up with two left (or right) flip flops!

, This will be enough to make one set of straps for one flip flop. You will need to do this entire section twice.


To make your flip flop look more interesting, consider using a contrasting color or pattern for the straps.

, Set a strip down in front of you, sticky side up. Fold the bottom long edge up to the halfway point and smooth out any air bubbles. Then, fold the top edge down and smooth it out. Repeat this step for the other strip of duct tape., This will be for the toe strap. It can be the same color as the straps, or a contrasting one., Make sure that the bottom edge of the tape is aligned with the bottom edge of the straps. Try to wrap the tape so that the straps roll up a bit into a tight, tube shape. This will make the toe strap rounded and more comfortable to wear.It might be a good idea to cut a second 4-inch (10.16 centimeters) long strip of tape, and wrap it around the straps, just above the first one. This will ensure that you have plenty of material to work with., Try to get the mark as close to the joint as possible. This is where the toe strap will go.Don't worry about making holes for the side straps. You will be wrapping them around the outer edges of the flip flop and taping them to the underside.

, You can do this with an Xacto knife on top of a cutting mat, or with a pair of scissors. If you are a child, it might be a good idea to ask an adult to help you with this step.


If you made a rolled/rounded toe strap, consider running a pencil or pen through the hole. This will make the hole more rounded and give you a better fit.

, Put the flip flop on before you tape the strap; this way, you can fit the strap to your foot. Tug the end of the strap down until the fit is comfortable, then fold the stub down and secure it against the underside of the sole with a piece of duct tape.

, Put the flip flop back on, and wiggle it down onto your foot until the toe strap fits comfortably. Wrap the straps over the top of your foot, towards the arch, until they are conform to your foot. Tuck the ends of the straps under the sole, and hold them in place., Holding the straps in place, take the flip flop off and turn it over. The straps should be crossed over on the bottom of the sole in an X shape. Place a strip of tape across the X and cut off any excess strap., Trim the tape so that follows the edge of the flip flop. For a sturdier flip flop, you might want to do two layers.

Artificial flowers are available from craft stores, florists, gift stores, online, etc.

, Usually the middle point where both straps meet is the ideal position, as it's the broadest part of the straps and shows off the front of your feet nicely. Larger flowers are best placed here, but you could also consider adding a row of smaller flowers down the straps for a pumped up floral look.

, If the flowers have stems that are flexible, these might be amenable to wrapping around the straps but test to see it's comfortable first.


It's a good idea to test the glue strength before adding too many flowers. If they don't adhere well, then you'll need to choose another glue.

Plastic boning is the cheapest and most common type of boning found in modern corsets. If you're after a pretty top or something to impress in the bedroom, then go for this option. It's cheaper than other types and you will have plenty of designs and styles to choose from. Plastic boning cannot be used for waist training and should not be laced tightly, as this can cause the plastic to bend and dig in. If you choose an overbust corset and have large breasts, you should avoid plastic boning as it will be uncomfortable and will not provide enough support.



 


Steel boning comes in two different types, spiral steel and flat steel. Spiral steel is more flexible than flat steel, and they are often both used in the same corset. This type of boning provides a lot more support than plastic boning and is usually much more comfortable. While corsets with steel boning are usually a lot more expensive, if you are planning on wearing your corset regularly or for long periods of time, the benefits of buying a corset with this type of boning are well worth the additional cost. Not only will it be much more comfortable, but it will last much longer and is far less likely to lose its shape. A steel boned corset can be used for waist training if the overall construction of the corset is strong enough.






Double boned corsets (the boning should be steel) are normally used for waist training. They have twice as much boning as a normal corset and so can offer far more support and so can be laced tighter. If you want to significantly change the shape of your body, these will give the best results.





;
, An overbust corset covers the breasts, while an underbust corset stops just below them. Underbust corsets are far easier to buy off the rack than overbust corsets as they go by the waist measurement only, rather than waist and bust. If you are planning on wearing your corset underneath your clothing an underbust corset is far less obvious than an overbust corset.

, If you want a corset with plastic boning, you'll be able to buy a corset from a wide range of shops (they are sometimes sold as normal tops, but usually you will need to look in underwear shops), but steel boned corsets are harder to come by and you may find the only way to get what you want is to order it online. If you are planning on using your corset for waist training, you will get the best results by having your corset custom made.

,


If you are buying your corset off the rack you will need to know your waist measurement and, if you are buying an overbust corset, the measurement around your bust.
If you are ordering a custom corset online they will tell you what measurements they need. This will probably include the measurements around your bust, just below your bust, your waist and your hips. They will also need to know the vertical distance between each of these measurements in order to give you the best fit possible.
If you are buying a custom made corset from a shop, they should fit you for the corset there, and you won't need to take any of your own measurements.

, There are a lot of options here and this will have a huge impact on the final look of your corset, so pick carefully. Some fabrics to consider are:


Satin (or satin polyester). This produces a very shiny corset and is especially common for corsets sold as underwear.
Taffeta. This is usually less shiny than satin, and so doesn't look quite so much like underwear if you plan to wear your corset as a top. This is a good option if you want a plain corset but want to avoid looking like you forgot to get dressed.
Brocade. These beautiful woven fabrics make a corset look elaborate without the need for additional embellishments.
Lace. While you won't find any corsets made out of lace alone, a satin corset covered in lace can look very effective. Lace is also very commonly used to add embellishments to a corset.

, While most corsets will lace up at the back, there are a number of different options for the front of the corset:


A steel busk. This usually has five or six large clips on that secure the corset and create a straight line down the front of the corset. This is the most common way to fasten a steel boned corset.
A zip. Zips are often used on reversible corsets (corsets that are designed to be worn inside out to give two different designs) but may not be strong enough if you are planning on using your corset for waist training.
Wire hook and eye closure. These take forever to fasten up each individual clasp and while they are much more discrete than the clips on a steel busk, they are not even close when it comes to strength. Great for fashion corsets that won't be laced tightly, but otherwise they should be avoided.
Laced up. You can choose to have a corset that laces at the front and back. While this can look pretty, you run the risk of looking like you're just dressing up.

, If you are having your corset custom made, find out what your options are and ask to see pictures (or examples, if you are in the shop) of each style/fabric.

, Steel boned corsets are usually designed to reduce your waist by 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm), but some waist training corsets are designed to reduce it further, to around 6–7 inches (15.2–17.8 cm) smaller than the natural size of your waist. If you aren't sure how the sizes work for a particular company or what size you should go for, ask. It is also of utmost importance to read the product manual and other instructions to know the exact corset size that will fit your waist perfectly.

, There are a few things you will need to consider when you try on your corset to make sure that it is suitable.


Check that your corset fits. If you can tighten it up all the way comfortably, you may want to consider getting a slightly smaller corset so it can be laced tightly.
Check that the cut of your corset is flattering. There's no point buying an expensive corset if it makes you feel unattractive.
Make sure that your corset is reasonably comfortable. While they usually take a bit of time to get used to, a corset shouldn't be particularly uncomfortable to wear unless you are lacing it very tightly.
Check that the quality is as high as it should be. While you shouldn't hold unrealistically high expectations of cheap, plastic boned corsets, the more expensive corsets should be fairly solid. Waist training corsets should have multiple layers of fabric to make them as strong as possible. Check the stitching, fabric (it shouldn't form ridges when the corset is tightened) and grommets to make sure your corset is of good quality and will last.

, You can't normally chuck a corset in the washing machine with everything else. Most corsets need to be dry cleaned or hand washed, and they should be cleaned only rarely. Where possible, wear something between the corset and your skin to reduce the frequency of washes. Make sure you will be able to clean your corset before you buy it.

If you want to stretch another part of the heel, then try to arrange the bag such that the water will expand at the desired point.Be aware that this technique works best on leather/suede shoes. It also usually works on fake leather. However, false leather tends to shrink back to its original size rather quickly, so you'll have to repeat this a couple of times for the full effect.

, Place the heels in the freezer, bags of water and all. Leave them to cool overnight. If you need to stretch the heels more quickly, then make sure to wait at least until the water has completely frozen within the bags., Once the water has frozen overnight, remove the shoes from the freezer. Leave the ice packs to thaw for 20-25 minutes: until the ice melts to water. Remove the bags from the shoes.

, Wipe off any water that the melting ice bags have left on your heels. Then, try to wear the heels. Check whether they've stretched enough. If the shoes still don't fit, then feel free to freeze again or try another method.

Always buy shoes that are of high quality.,
What height do you want the heels to be?",How to Shop for High Heel Shoes," Don't rush in buying the shoes. Yes, i know that they are so beautiful you can't help yourself. But are they comfortable? Try them on in the shoe store. Wear them for about 10 minutes at a NORMAL pace, not too slow(as we usually do in a store). After 10 minutes you will understand if the shoes are comfortable or not.;
, Between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. is the perfect time to try the shoes on.

, Most shoes that cost less are of very bad quality, and they can not only ruin your look, but also your feet, and overall your mood. Also, buy only leather shoes with soft leather interior, to prevent skin swelling and sore feet.

, If the heel is between 3 and 5 inches, you can easily wear the heels without a platform. But if the heel is above 5 inches (12.7 cm), you MUST choose your heels with a platform. The reason to this is to prevent backache, sore feet and lack of balance, and the most important, the impossibility to walk.

Rub the flip flops vigorously to remove any grime or mud. If it's hard to remove: put on some gloves, and use a thin towel or napkin to help you get the mud off., If the flip flops are scratched or dented, you can mask the blemishes with shoeshine. If you find a product that is made for the material of your flip flops, you should be able to hide most of the damage. Try different shine products in order to see which you like best.


If you don't want to buy shoeshine, try learning to spit shine shoes.

, Find an old toothbrush, or a buy a very cheap new brush. Wet the toothbrush, then grind the bristles into a bar of soap. Then, start scrubbing away at your shoes. Make sure to get into all of the cracks!The toothbrush tactic works best on fuzzy flip flops. The bristles can work between the fuzz in a way that other cleaning products cannot.

, First, soak an old towel or dishrag in hot water. Use a bit of soap, if you like, although this is not necessary. Wipe the dirtiest spots with the towel, and remove as much as you can.

You may like to mix and match colors. For example, the tri-colors of blue, red and white can be ideal for a national day theme in various countries, etc.
Other fluffy style fabric or ribbon can be used in place of tulle.

, Each strip should be the same length. The length should allow enough space for tying in place and being fluffed out to stand up. Too short and it can't be tied properly, too long and it'll just flop over.

, Start from the center and tie them back as far as you want to have them.


Keep each strip snugly fitting next to the one already tied in place, all the way around.

Put on a lot of socks.,
Wedge your feet into the heels.,
Blow-dry your feet.,
Remove your socks.",How to Stretch High Heels2," Two pairs of thick socks should do the trick. Use more sock layers if you want to stretch your heels even wider. The goal is to make your feet thick enough to stretch the shoes, but not so thick that they will not fit.

, This might be difficult – but try to get them all the way in. Don't hurt your feet or crush your toes!If you simply cannot fit your feet into the shoes, then remove a layer of socks and try again.

, Now, heat the stuffed-up heels with the hot air from a blowdryer. Focus on the areas that most need a stretch. Wiggle your toes and flex your arches. Keep it up for 2-3 minutes until the leather is hot – but not uncomfortably so.Leave your sock-clad feet in the heels until the leather cools. This way, the leather will cool around your slightly-larger-than-usual feet, and it will settle into a stretched position.
Be careful with the heat. Don't let the leather grow dangerously hot. If the heat begins to scorch your skin, then take the heels off and try again later.

, Once the leather has cooled, try wearing the heels without the layers of thick socks. If they fit comfortably, then your work is done. If the shoes still need some stretching, then repeat the procedure until you're satisfied.


If you want to break in the shoes a bit more: try bending them back and forth to loosen the leather. Then, blast with heat again for 2-3 minutes to wear in the material."

Search online for a reputable cobbler in your city, and then pay him/her a visit., A simple stretching job should be relatively cheap – likely in the range of $15-30, depending on the cobbler, the region, and the degree of stretching that you need done. However, this route is almost certainly more time-consuming and more expensive than stretching your heels at home. Remember that in most cases, you are paying for quality and convenience."

Pick up your feet while walking.,
Take care of your flip flops and they'll last longer.,
Keep flip flops out of any dog's sight.,
Avoid stretching out the flip flop thong.,
Distribute your weight evenly.",How to Avoid Wearing Out Flip Flops," Try not to slide your feet so that the flip flop rubs against the ground. The more it rubs, the faster the sole will diminish and the greater the chances of slipping. Usually the heel part of the flip flop rubs out the greatest because of where the pressure is when walking.;
, Don't bend them unless you're walking. Dry them with a paper towel (or a reusable rag to avoid unnecessary landfill waste) if they're wet. Clean any dirt or sand that gets trapped on the soles; anything that gets trapped there, such as small rocks, will cause ""wear and tear"" with every step.

, When a dog wants to play, he will grab the first thing that looks interesting, and it may be your footwear. Dogs may chew on, scratch, dunk, or hide your flip flop. In the process, it may stretch out the ""thong"", the ""Y"" shaped material that divides your toes (see below)., It may be fun to do while you're sitting down, but stretching it too much will increase the chance of having it become too loose (and uncomfortable to walk with) or the bottom peg of the flip flop may loosen and pull out from the sole., Most people tend to put most of their weight towards the sole of the flip flop which causes a major wear-in. Try to put just as much on the ""balls"" of your feet as you do on the sole of your feet."
"
Use a washing machine.,
Spray the flip flops.",How to Clean Flip Flops2," This is a quick solution, although it may use more water than other methods. Put the flip flops into the washing machine on a cold cycle, with a bit of soap and a quick program. If possible, choose a no-spin cycle. Be aware that too much detergent might damage the shoes., Use a water hose, a shower jet, or a powerful faucet to shoot water at the shoes. Try to knock dirt loose with water pressure. Keep going until you get most of the dirt off – and try scrubbing afterward to complete the effect."

Let the flops air-dry.",How to Clean Flip Flops3," This first step should wash away the heaviest grime from extremely dirty flops. If a standard faucet doesn't do the trick, try using a powerful jet-stream or blocking off the tip of a hose with your thumb.

, First, fill a bucket with warm, soapy water. Dunk the flip flops in the water. Consider weighting them so that they are completely submerged. Leave the flops to soak for at least two hours.Use concentrated dish soap, if you have it. If your flip flops are white and incredibly dirty, you can add bleach – but be careful not to get it on your skin.

, After a few hours, remove the flops from the bucket. Rub the dirty surfaces vigorously with a toothbrush or a sponge. If the grime runs especially deep, try using steel wool or another highly abrasive surface – but be careful not to wear down the surface of the flops!

, This step should wash away the soap, the suds, and any other cleaning agents that you used. Rinse away any grime that you dislodged with your scrubbing.

, If the flip-flops won't get clean, be persistent. Keep rinsing and scrubbing until they are.

, Avoid running them through a drying machine, and don't expose the material to excessive heat. Put the flip flops out in the direct sun, and they should dry within a matter of hours.

Of course, when there is a call for you to run in high heels, you probably won't be running on a completely flat surface free of objects as you would inside.,
To run down steps or into a gutter, it is far easier to run on your toes.,
To navigate around an object, simply change direction slightly by pivoting on your heel and continue running.

To stop running, do not suddenly put both feet down as this causes damage to your shoe.",How to Run in High Heels,";
, Stand up straight and place your hands about 6 centimeter (2.4 in) away from your sides. Point your palms to the floor and flex your fingers horizontal to the floor.

, Follow quickly with your toe. Then do this with your other foot and continue. Ensure that you keep your posture when you run, and incorporate a few hip swings into your run to make it less strenuous and to give you more 'bounce'.

, no heel-toe. You may find this slightly easier to do, but make sure that you don't do it too often or it can be painful and is bad for your shoes.

Practice.",How to Look Good Walking in Heels1," If you’re new to wearing heels, you probably don’t want to go for a six-inch stiletto pump right off the bat. For one thing, you want to build your balance up to shoes that are trickier to wear; for another, you’ll be more mentally comfortable if you feel like your new shoes aren’t a wild diversion from your normal style.Short heels (from 2-3 inches) are much simpler to walk in than tall ones.
Chunky heels are easier to balance in than thin ones.
The general structure of the shoe matters, too: the more fabric or leather covers your foot, the better it will stay attached to it. Go for boots or mary-janes over strappy sandals for an easier time.;
, If you’re grimacing in pain, it won’t matter how hot your shoes are--you just won’t look as good. Heels don’t feel the same as flats, but you can still find a pair that fits your feet perfectly. Don’t wear shoes that pinch your feet or dig into your ankles if you want to look your best.


Instead of buying shoes online, try them on in stores so you can see how comfortable they are., To look your best wearing heels, wear them at the right time and place. Rules of dress aren’t as pronounced as they used to be, so don’t worry too much about ettiquette--just make sure your heels won’t get in the way of whatever you’re planning to do, and you’ll probably be fine.


Some good places to show off dressy heels like pumps include: cocktail parties, weddings and business formal settings.Brunch, daytime parties, and more relaxed workplaces are good places for casual heels, like wedges or lace-up boots. In some of these settings, you can also use more formal heels to set off a simple outfit.Use your judgement to figure out when it’s a bad time for heels. In general, any setting that requires running or mud--or both--is not the best place to wear your fancy shoes.

, Again, there is no fashion police, and no one is going to arrest you if you wear combat boots in the summer. Still, your excellent shoes can add a lot of flair to your outfit, so match them intentionally.


In the summer, wedge sandals can handle shifting sands, and look nice with a sundress.
Close-toed stiletto pumps work well with a pencil skirt or rolled-up relaxed-fit jeans.
Chunky platforms are excellent with skater dresses. As a bonus, they’re comfortable for going out and dancing up a storm.

, Sometimes you find an excellent pair of heels that are deeply on sale, and you must have them, even if they're half a size too small. While it's ideal to buy shoes that fit perfectly--they are comfier and easier to move in--there are ways to adapt an almost-right shoe to your foot.


If a shoe is slightly too small, stretch it. A cobbler can do this for you, or you can try it yourself by donning some thick socks, sliding the shoes on top, and heating them with a hairdryer for several minutes.Insoles and insets can make shoes more cushy and supportive.
If your shoes are chafing you, fix them with moleskin. Buy a pack of the adhesive material at the drugstore, and trim pieces to fit the spots on your shoe that are rubbing you raw.(Don't worry: it's made from cotton, not real moles.)

, Don't save your new shoes until a big event. Once you've brought them home, you should take steps to make sure they're properly molded to your feet. Wear them around the house or to the grocery store to break them in a bit and get your body used to the feeling."

Always keep your heels stuffed.Naturally your heels with shrink when they’re not being worn.,
Keep silica gel packets in your shoes when they’re not being worn.Have you noticed after purchasing a pair of new shoes those little white packets containing tiny clear balls inside your shoe box?",How to Break in High Heel Shoes1," The first step to breaking in a new pair of high heel shoes is simply to wear them often. The more often you wear your heels, the more of an opportunity your heels have to stretch and conform to your feet.


To avoid the awkwardness and potential danger of wearing new high heel shoes while out and about, start by wearing your shoes at home. You can wear them while watching television or folding laundry. You can wear them while cooking dinner.
You can also take your heels with you to work. If have an office job, wear your shoes at your desk for a couple of hours.
Once you feel comfortable wearing and walking short distances in your heels, take them out. Wear them on a short trip to the grocery store or to your local bank.;
, Although this is considered a fashion faux pas, wearing socks with your new heels will help to break them in. You don’t have to wear them while you’re out and about, unless, of course, you actually like the look of it. You can wear them while you’re hanging out at home, or while you’re sitting at your desk at work.


In order for your socks to stretch your shoes properly, they can’t be too thin (they won’t work) and they can’t be too thick (they’ll stretch your shoes too much and cause your feet to slip out when you are wearing your heels skin-to-shoe). A regular, everyday sock will do just fine.
Do this for a few days and you'll notice that you are blister-free and your shoes are broken in, having molded to the shape of your foot.

, You can work out the stiffness of your new heels by bending and twisting them. Apply slight pressure as you bend the shoes upwards and downwards and twist them side to side. Don’t do either method too hard or too quickly. You don’t want to force the shoe into a position that it shouldn’t be making. Doing so could damage the shoe or weaken it in places that should remain sturdy.

, Carefully warm your heels using a blow dryer or a small heater for about a minute or two. Watch how your heels react to the heat because certain materials don't do so well under heat for long periods of time. You can bend and twist your heels while they’re still warm. Or you can wait until they’ve cooled and put them on with a pair of socks to stretch them.

, Since you don’t want all of your breaking in efforts be in vain, keep them stuffed when you’re not wearing them. You can stuff your shoes with the shoe paper and rod that come with the shoes when you buy them. You can keep them filled with shoe trees, which are inserts molded into the shape of the inside of your high heel shoes. Or you can simply stuff them with rags.

, Those packets contain silica gel which absorb moisture and keep your shoes from shrinking. Hold on to those packets instead of throwing them away and stick them in your shoes when you’re not wearing them. You can ask a shoe store associate for extras, if necessary.

Break in your heels.,
Wear your heels outdoors.,
Practice standing in heels.",How to Walk in High Heels1," Walking in the highest heels isn't like the walking you learned to do when you were a child, so you have to do a few things that might feel counterintuitive: Take small, slow steps, making sure not to bend your knees any more than you normally would. You'll notice that high heels tend to shorten your stride a bit. The taller the heel, the shorter the stride ends up being. Don't try to fight this by taking bigger steps—stick with small, dainty steps which will make your walk look more natural and help you to feel more comfortable.;
, The aim is to walk as normally as possible in your high heels. When walking in flats, you don't walk on the balls of your feet or put your whole foot down at once, do you? So don't do either of these things in heels. Put your heel to the ground first, followed smoothly by your toes. Then, once your weight is on the balls of your feet, shift your weight forward as if you're walking on your tip toes, and push forward for the next step.








, Walking well in heels is very dependent on maintaining good posture. If you're slouching and shuffling as you walk, it kind of defeats the purpose of wearing high heels in the first place—the aim is to look comfortable and confident! To get the perfect posture:


Imagine there is a piece of invisible string holding your head upright—your head should be in line with your spine and your chin should be parallel with the floor. Avoid looking down when walking in high heels!Put your shoulders back and down and keep your arms relaxed at your sides. Swing your arms slightly as you walk for balance.Keep your abdominal muscles engaged, sucking your belly button towards your spine. This will help your stand up straighter while also making your look thinner.Bend your knees slightly, they should never be locked when walking in heels. Keep your legs close together as you walk and point your toes directly ahead., Catwalk models will often cross one foot slightly in front of the other to give their hips more sway. A lot of women wear high heels to look sexy, so adding a little shimmy to your walk is a good thing. The best way to achieve a sway while walking in high heels is to pretend that you're walking down an imaginary straight line, or tight rope.









One foot should come down directly in front of the other, with your toes pointing straight ahead. This walk will take a little extra practice to master, but the results will be worth it.Have a look at some videos of catwalk models to see how the professionals do it, then try to emulate what you see. Be aware that catwalk models tend to over-exaggerate their walk, so you may want to tone it down a little for real life!

, Wear your heels for a day around the house before you wear them out. This will not only allow you to get used to wearing them, but it will also create scuffs on the bottom so that they're less slippery. Make sure you practice doing all the things you would normally do while walking, such as: walking, stopping, pivoting, and turning around.

, If you fail to break in your heels before your first time wearing them, you'll be destined for blisters. Breaking in your heels is important as it removes stiffness from the shoes and helps mold them to the shape of your feet. Just wearing your shoes around at home should be enough to break them in, but you can also try:









Exposing your heels to different surfaces: You will likely need to walk on tiled floors, carpets and slippery, wooden floors at some point in your high heel wearing, so try to master them all.
Dancing: If you're planning on wearing your heels to a nightclub or a party where you know you're going to want to boogie down, then dance to the beat of your own drummer in the privacy of your home until you're comfortable shaking things up in your heels.
Walking down the stairs. This is one skill you'll definitely want to master, as stairs are the site of most high-heeled mishaps. Place your entire foot on each step as you come down the steps, but only place the ball of your foot on each step as you go up. Hold onto that railing gracefully, just in case.

, Walking in heels indoors is very different to walking in them outdoors. Without the soft cushioning of carpet, or the flat, even indoor surface of linoleum or wood, walking in heels can be ten times more difficult.









Even minor surface flaws in tarmac or cracks in the pavement will present difficulties, so try walking up and down outside your house a few times, taking great care to avoid uneven surfaces.
A good place to practice after you've gotten the hang of it in your house is to wear your heels to the supermarket. Use your cart for balance!, Not only do you need to learn how to walk in heels, but you should also be aware of how to stand in heels. It may sound simple, but many women just don't know what to do with their feet when posing for pictures or standing around chatting at an event. This is where having comfortable shoes becomes very important, as you don't want to spend your evening shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot.









To stand correctly in heels, stand with the heel of one foot touching the middle of the other foot, while cocked at an angle from it.
Put your weight on the toe of the foot in back, and as soon as that foot gets tired, switch feet so that your weight is on the other foot.

Stand up straight.,
Look at your feet.,
Lean back a bit.,
Tighten your abs.",How to Look Good Walking in Heels2," Good posture is the key to looking good at all times, no matter what you’re wearing. It makes you look confident and tall, and helps your clothes fit better. It’s especially important if you’re trying to look good in heels, as you should be hyper-aware of how your body is balanced when you are getting used to a new movement.


Lift your chin and bring it forward a bit. Don’t stick it in the air--just imagine it resting on a shelf that runs parallel to the floor.Relax your shoulders instead of pulling them up to your ears, or artificially thrusting them back. Let your arms hang loose so they have a natural swing to them.Don’t lock your knees. Some people think locking your knees will make you pass out. It probably won't, but it can cause you pain and make you look unnatural., Some people turn their toes in a bit, while others splay them out a bit. Focus on doing neither! Your toes should be facing straight ahead and your feet parallel and close together.

, If you trip, you’ll naturally fall forward. Try to counteract that by leaning your upper body back a bit beyond its normal position. This may feel a little unnatural at first, but the presence of the heels will balance you out so you look like you’re standing up straight., Any time you need to balance, engaging your core will help you center yourself and feel secure. This is especially true in heels! Not only will it keep you from falling, but it will also improve your posture (and make you look a bit slimmer, if you’re into that)."

This will keep you from stomping., You’re already leaning back a bit, but when you take your first steps in your heels, imagine yourself being led by the hips, not by the shoulders. This will also help to further enhance your posture. No need to pull your shoulders back too much--this is a subtle movement., When you walk, imagine that you’re walking on a tightrope or a straight line. Place the heel of each foot directly in front the toes of the other. If you keep your feet apart when you're walking, you end up with a bit of a waddle. If you cross your feet over too much, you might look a little tipsy.To add to the straight-line visual, focus on your goal and simply walk toward it. This may keep you more naturally focused than you would be staring at your feet.

, Long loping strides are not going to look graceful. For most, a higher heel means a shorter step. Experiment until you find a step length that comes naturally to you, and then practice until it becomes part of your muscle memory.Some find it helpful to watch videos of models walking for inspiration.

, Heels are known for being attractive not just because they make you taller--they also encourage your hips to move more than they might in flats. Don’t fight the swing! If you’re trying to figure out how to replicate a high-heel swagger, try subtly moving your hips in a figure-8 pattern., Take your time. Your heels are great, and with some confidence and practice, you’re sure to look great in them. However, they’re just not built for running, so try to walk with a measured step if you can.This will make you look more purposeful, too.

, Practice! Wear your heels around the house to get them used to your shape, but also to get you used to theirs. Check yourself out in the mirror, or ask a swaggery friend for feedback. Be aware of how you are walking until your heel-wearing gait becomes natural to you--which it will.

Stick a peeled potato in your shoes.This may seem unusual and a little icky, but it can help stretch out your heels quickly.,
Rough up the bottoms of your heels.It’s important that your shoes have a decent amount of traction on the bottom.,
Wet the insides of your high heel shoes to stretch them.Water can speed up the breaking in process by helping to mold the inside material of your shoes to your feet.,
Freeze a bag of water inside your shoes.Water expands when it freezes, making it a perfect method you can use to break in your high heels.,
Cover the parts of your feet that are being pinched by your heels with moleskin, soak your feet in water, and then wear your heels for a few hours.Moleskin is basically a more comfortable bandage that comes in sheets that you can cut into any size.,
Use shoe stretching supplies.If breaking in your heels is a battle you constantly find yourself fighting, you may want to invest in shoe stretching spray and a heel stretcher.,
Use a shoe stretching machine.If trying to break in your high heel shoes doesn’t seem to be working.",How to Break in High Heel Shoes2," You’ll need to select two potatoes large enough puff up your shoes once inserted.


Peel the potatoes before inserting. Doing so will allow the moisture from the potatoes’ juices to soften the material inside your shoes, which will make it easier to stretch.
Leave the potatoes in your shoes overnight or for at least eight hours in order for the shoes to remain enlarged once the potatoes are removed. Make sure to wipe clean out your shoes afterwards to get rid of the potato residue.

, Walking in high heels will be a lot easier and safer if you’re not sliding around all over the place. New heels tend to have smoother bottoms that become rougher once scuffed. Speed up the process by roughing up the bottom of your heels using a piece of sandpaper. Rub the bottom of your heels for a minute or two, or until the bottoms feel noticeably rougher.

, Take a damp cloth and rub the insides of your high heels. Put them on while they’re still moist and wear them for an hour or more. You can also dampen a pair of socks and wear them with your high heels for the same amount of time.

, You’ll need a one-quart sized freezer bag. If you have smaller freezer bags available that’s okay to use as well.


Fill the freezer bag half way with water. Squeeze the air out of the bag and close it up. Toss the bag lightly in your hands to make sure it’s closed all the way and that there are no leaks in the bag.
Gently stuff the bag inside the shoe until it fills all of the empty space down to the toe. You may need more than one bag of water depending on the size of your shoe. Be sure to tuck the bag in places where the shoes feel too tight on your feet.
Put the shoes into the freezer, and keep them there until the water freezes completely. Once the water is frozen, you can remove the bags and try on your shoes, which should now be stretched. Repeat the process if they still feel too tight.

, One side is sticky and one side is soft. It protects the areas of your feet that hurt when wearing your heels, which is typically where blisters might form. Dampening the moleskin and then wearing your shoes will help the insides of your shoes to mold more quickly to the shape of your foot.


Cut pieces of moleskin large enough to cover the areas of your feet that hurt when wearing your new high heel shoes. Adhere the moleskin to your skin, like you would a bandage.
Then to get maximum comfort, soak your feet in warm water for a few minutes while wearing the moleskin. The moleskin will expand. The extra padding will give your feet additional protection. And because the moleskin is damp, it will help to soften the material inside your shoes, making it more pliable and able to conform to the shape of your feet.

, You simply spray the insides of your shoes, and then insert the heel stretcher in your shoes overnight. You should be good to go in the morning.

, Or if you simply don’t have the time try various DIY methods, stop by a shoe repair shop for a quick fix. Shoe repair shops have machines specifically built to stretch your shoes. The machine applies the same techniques as common home remedies –pressure and heat –to stretch your shoe quickly.

Use cushions and insoles.,
Give your feet a break.,
Wear strappy, platformed shoes.,
Don't wear high heels too often.",How to Walk in High Heels2," Add cushioning wherever there's a lot of pressure and/or friction. There are cushions made in various shapes and from different materials that you can stick on the inside of your shoe for more comfortable walking, thus preventing bunions and blisters. If your shoes are slightly too big and you find them slipping off your heel, get some insoles which can make the shoes smaller by half a size, while also adding comfort value. Use these these innovative items generously - there's really no need for discomfort!

, When wearing high heels, the best advice you can take to prevent pain is just to sit down whenever possible! This will give your feet a break and will stop any pain or discomfort from building, keeping your feet fresh.









Remember to cross your legs, sitting up straight and stretching out your legs from the waist down. This is also a great opportunity to show off your fabulous shoes!Try not to take your heels off, if at all possible, your feet will swell up and you'll find the shoes harder and more painful to put on again.

, Shoes with straps that fasten securely around your foot and ankle are more comfortable to wear as they prevent your foot from slipping around too much inside the shoe, reducing friction and pain. Platform shoes give you all the benefits of extra height, without the discomfort of feeling like you're standing on your tip toes. Your foot is more parallel to the ground in a platform shoe - making them a great option for nights on the dance floor!

, High heels look fabulous, but they will have more of an effect and give you extra ""oomph!"" when you save them for special occasions. If you wear them too often, blisters, and bunions are more likely to form and you will also put pressure on your lower back. Your feet (and the rest of your body) need some time to recover.









If you need to wear heels everyday for work, at least try wearing different shoes, with varying heights. This prevent too much pressure or friction from concentrating on one particular spot and keep your feet feeling fresh."

Shop wisely.,
Start small and work your way up.,
Get the right size.",How to Walk in High Heels3," Not all high heels are created equal and the ability to walk well in high heels relies heavily on choosing the right ones. Always go shoe shopping at the end of the day, when your feet are slightly swollen from walking and at their biggest. Pick shoes that are suited to the shape of your foot—making sure the shoe is wider than your bare foot. Always try both shoes on in the store and take a walk around—if you don't find them comfortable immediately, then you probably never will.

, It's probably not a good idea to choose a pair of 4 inch (10.2 cm) stilettos if you're not used to walking in heels—it's better to work your way up, increasing the height as you get used to how they feel. There are many different types of heels to choose from, varying in height, thickness, and shape. Training your feet by starting out with small heels will allow your ankles to develop the strength they need to walk safely and gracefully in high heels.


Begin with a shoe that has a low heel of about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm). Try to go for wider heels (rather than skinny spikes) as these will provide more balance. Closed in shoes can also be easier to walk in than strappy sandals as they provide plenty of support over your foot and around the heel and ankle.
High heeled wedges are the easiest high shoes to walk in, as the heel is fully attached to the sole of the shoe, giving you increased balance and comfort. These are a great option if you want the height of a high heel, but don't feel ready for a stiletto. They are best worn in spring and summer - to wear to work, on holidays or to a summer wedding!
Wear the mother of all heels. Stiletto heels are also referred to as ""spike heels"" and include anything with a heel above 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm). These are the final step in your high heel training—once you've mastered walking in these, you'll be ready to take on the world!

, Choosing the right size shoe is absolutely essential when buying high heels. Be aware that different brands of shoes may be sized quite differently, so you might be a 7 in one brand, but an 8 in another. As a result, you should always, always try your shoes on before buying.


When in doubt, always go for shoes that are slightly too big rather than slightly too small. You can always make big shoes smaller by adding insoles and cushions, but your can't make small shoes bigger. Shoes that are too small will be terribly uncomfortable and you'll probably regret buying them.
Remember to have your feet sized regularly, as your shoe size can change over time, especially as you get older. Your feet tend to get longer and wider as your arches begin to fall."

Shop at the end of the day.,
Wear them around the store.,
Assess how your toes feel.,
Select a heel height.,
Practice walking at home before taking your heels out.",How to Choose High Heels1," At the end of the day, your feet are more swollen from a full day of activity. Shopping at the end of the day will help you get a better idea of how your heel will truly fit.You would hate to try your heels on in the morning and then have them be too tight when you wear them in the afternoon.;
, Walk around in your heels before you buy them. If you feel like the heels are tight or uncomfortable in any way, you may want to choose another pair. Your feet should feel supported and balanced when you have on your heels.Any pain you feel in the store will only get worse the longer you wear the heels. For example, if the back of the shoe is rubbing your heel in the store, you will probably develop a blister if you wear the heels in real life.
Try to walk on different surfaces in the store as well. Your heels will different on carpet than walking on a harder surface.

, Find shoes that have enough space for your toes. Cramped toes and shoes that are not wide enough will definitely cause pain. If you consistently wear heels without enough toe space, you will increase your chances of developing hammer toes, corns, bunions, and arthritis.Round toes and almond toes provide much more room than the classic pointy toes.
Pointy toes with even a slightly rounded almond shape provide more room than the classic wedge-shaped pointy toes.
A deeper toe box provides much more room overall than a shallower one.Pointy toes with deep toe boxes will pinch less than round toes with extremely shallow toe-boxes.

, The ideal heel height is between one and three inches. Walking in heels over three incheschanges how you walk and puts more stress on your lower back, knees, and ankle.However, choose a heel height that you are comfortable with. Luckily, there are many different heel heights to choose from.


Kitten heels are between 1.5 to 2 inches. These heels are good for all day wear.
The 3 inch heel is considered a classic heel height and is acceptable to wear to work.
A 4 inch heel is appropriate for after work and weekend activities.
A 5 or 6 inch heel is less comfortable and more difficult to walk in. You may want to save these for when you will not do a lot of walking and only plan to wear them for a few hours.

, You can return your shoes as long as you do not wear them outside. Wear your heels around your house as much as you can. Wear them when you cook dinner, wash dishes, or do laundry. It is best to wear them for a couple of hours. Shoes that seem comfortable at first may not be after a few minutes, or even an hour or two. You'll notice that heels cause your steps to be shorter; this is normal.The higher the heel, the shorter your steps will be. Don't try to stride like you would in sneakers.
When you walk, make sure you keep your heels vertical; do not let them roll to the side. This will lead to the heel slipping and cause you to fall.

Select a decent pair of stiletto heels to purchase.,
Proceed with caution as you begin practicing your walk.,
Begin by standing in the stilettos.,
Start practicing walking in the heels.,
Change surfaces.,
Take a walk outdoors.,
Attend the party in your stilettos and enjoy yourself.",How to Walk in Stilettos," Avoid buying cheap stilettos because they tend to break easily, plus they just don't look as nice. Additionally, cheap stilettos can be incredibly uncomfortable, which is the last thing you want if you're going to be walking around all day. As you're trying on stilettos, there are a few key things you'll want to check to minimize the pain:


Check the fit of the toe. The shoe should not feel tight or pinched in any area as you walk. If your toe feels crammed into the end, it'll feel much worse after several hours of that pressure.






Check the width of the heel. It should not be too narrow; if it is, add a heel liner. The stiletto itself should be reinforced, but keep in mind that a plastic heel tip can be replaced with rubber for a softer walk.






Check the centering of the heel and the placement of the arch. Ideally, the shoe's heel should be centered under your own heel and your foot arch should be completely supported by the shoe sole. If there's a gap where the arch is, the shoe does not fit properly and will cause you pain.






Buy your proper size. This should go without saying, but sometimes a moment of weakness can cause you to think that buying a half size smaller than what you normally wear won't matter---just remember that it will!





;
, The higher the heel, the less stable you will feel, the greater the chance of a fall. When learning to walk in stiletto heels, take it slowly to begin with and practice in short bursts, allowing yourself rests between tries.

If you're not already familiar with walking in high heels, it is suggested that you try shorter heels before progressing to stilettos, increasing by half an inch (1.27cm) after mastering each height.






Consider stretching before wearing stilettos. This gives your legs a chance to limber up and be warm before the stiletto stretches the muscles in your foot.







, Let yourself to get used to how it feels to have the stilettos on your feet. Since the feeling is likely to be new and a bit strange, only stand for a few minutes at the start, gradually increasing the time you stand in them, up to an hour. If that seems like a long time practicing, pick out your favorite book or get something else to do to keep yourself entertained.

You can sit down occasionally, since you presumably won't be standing for the entire time you're at your event, but try to stand as much as possible to get used to the feeling of the stilettos.






It is recommended that you stand in front of a mirror so that you can assess your posture and adjust it as needed. You will probably notice mannerisms your body is trying to adopt to cope with the height and sway created by the heels. These little tics will only escalate the longer you stand in a single position, so try to readjust yourself every few minutes.






The surface of the floor should be non-slippery to prevent falling, but not too shaggy or your heels could get stuck.







, Initially, stay in the same area where you have been practicing standing. Walk to and from the mirror to see what you look like. Adjust yourself accordingly, and keep the following things in mind.

Step with your heel first, ball of the foot second, toes last. Follow a heel-ball-toe, heel-ball-toe rhythm, while distributing most of your weight on the ball of your foot, and toes, not over the heel. The higher the heel, the more your center of balance is shifted, so that your backside and chest are pushed out.






Stand straight, even if it leaves you feeling unbalanced. High heels tend to give a sensation of being unbalanced, causing the wearer to lean forward to compensate. You won't fall backwards when standing straight because the heel is anchoring you, so straighten up with confidence!






Place one foot out in front of the other. Always lead with the foot you're most comfortable with, the one that feels naturally inclined to step forward first. Take short, careful steps rather than long strides. Keep your legs close together as you walk and avoid bending over or hanging your head.







, Once you're comfortable walking wherever you started off, try walking on a variety of floors (tiles, thick carpet, etc.) to see how it feels and to learn how to cope with changing surfaces underfoot.


Stay off impressionable surfaces like cork, as the heel will leave indentations that are permanent. You can also challenge yourself a little more by carrying things such as a bag, a cup of tea, a book, etc. Move about the house and simply get used to how it feels as you go, correcting your posture every now and then.

, Get adjusted to the feel of concrete, gravel, and other outdoor surfaces. You'll find that you sink into some surfaces, such as grass, so either avoid them or learn to glide over them quickly using the ball of your feet only (which can be hard work, so general avoidance of soft surfaces is advised).


Outdoor surfaces to beware of include cobblestones, steel grates, grass, soil, holes, and boardwalks.
Stairs require learning of their own. Always land on each step in a sideways or sidestepping motion when descending, with all of the foot landing on each step at once (heel, ball, and toe). When ascending, only use the sole/flat area of the shoe to climb up the stairs.

, Your hard work to get to this point has paid off, and now it's time to party!


One neat trick that can come in handy for the novice stiletto wearer is to take along a spare pair of shoes in case the stilettos really begin to hurt you. Quietly change the shoes unobserved toward the end of the occasion so that you can either dance, or go home in complete comfort.
Having a little shoe bag for containing the shoes discreetly is a wise option.

Select and prepare your shoes.,
Create shoelace holes using the grommet.,
Add the eyelet to the shoe.,
Add your laces and lace up.",How to Lace up High Heels," Before you design your lace up shoes, make sure they still fit by trying them on.


Inspect the shoes for damage or repair needs. If the heel is unsteady or they need repair, tend to fixing them before embarking upon the project. You want heels you will enjoy (and be proud of) wearing.
Clean/buff/shine shoes. If they simply need a quick shine, pull out your shoe shine kit and buff them back to new. Make sure you use shoe polish that is compatible with the color and material (for example, you don’t want to use burgundy polish on brown leather shoes).
Consider where you can use the grommet to create the lace holes. Create a pattern using pen marks. You may want to use a ruler to space the holes evenly.;
, Test drive this tool before punching holes in your shoes to ensure you know how to properly use it and it is a well functioning tool.


Measure and plot where you will punch the holes. Before you punch holes, use a pen and mark where you will place each hole. Consider using a small ruler to ensure you have an even amount of space between holes and that the holes match up on each side.
Grasp the tool firmly to ensure you punch through the leather or material. Get a firm grasp on the grommet and punch through the shoe material.
Remove any hanging pieces using small scissors. In the event you end up with a hanging piece use small manicure scissors to remove the material. Don’t pull or tug or else you’ll compromise the hole size.

, Fortify and protect the hole you just punched by adding an eyelet to each hole.


Add the eyelet inside the hole, using an eyelet tool and a pair of pliers. Place the eyelet piece inside the tool and position the eyelet to fit around the hole. Squeeze eyelet piece firmly with pliers for a more finished, professional fit.
Repeat on both sides of the shoe so you have an evenly matched pair of holes with eyelets.

, Grab your laces and create your lace up high heels!


Consider using matching the shoe material to the laces. For a more subdued, classy look select shoe laces not only the same color but made from the same material.
Lace up different ways--from zig - zag to straight across. Learn different ways you can wear your lace up high heels by lacing them in a variety of ways.
Try an outlandish shoelace to make a fun fashion statement. If you are going for something fun and funky, use bold colored or even neon laces to add a pop of color.

Buy leather or suede shoes.,
Check the cushioning.,
Consider a platform style heel.,
Choose styles that improve stability.,
Alternate your shoe choices.,
Examine the arch of the shoe.",How to Choose High Heels2," Shoes made from leather and suede are more pliable and will mold to the shape of your foot. Because these materials are more flexible, you will reduce your chances of chafing. While synthetic shoes are more affordable, investing in quality shoes will pay off.Leather and suede shoes will also last longer than shoes made from synthetic materials.
Look on the inside of the heel to determine what the shoe is made of. Shoes that say ""man-made upper"" or ""man-made material"" are made from synthetic materials. ""Shoes that say ""leather upper"" or ""suede upper"" are best.

, When you wear heels, more pressure is placed on the ball of your foot. Adequate cushioning in this area will make your heels feel much better. Check this area of the shoe before you buy them.If the shoe does not have very much built in cushioning, purchase insoles to wear in your shoes. Insoles can be full size, three quarter size, half size, or only ball-of- the-foot cushions.If you do wear insoles, be sure you still have enough room for your toes.

, Styles with a slight platform under the toe area tend to be more comfortable as they minimize the angle and pressure on the ball of the foot. Platforms, even thin ones, also maintain stability by keeping the soles flat.If you are wearing a higher heel, a platform can offset some the effects of wearing a high heel.
Platforms can be visible or hidden. If you like the comfort but not the look of a platform, go for a shoe that has a hidden platform.

, The more stable and secure your shoe feels, the more comfortable you will feel. In addition to the height of your heel and toe space, there are other design features that make heels more comfortable. Check your heels for the following:Wear a chunkier heel. The wider the heel, the more stability you will have.
Shoes that have wooden or hard plastic soles are more rigid and will be more difficult to walk in. Look for shoes with leather and rubber soles.
Slingbacks, heels with ankle straps, peep toes, and boots are easier to walk in than mules or super strappy sandals. The more your foot moves around, the more difficult it will be to walk.

, Do not wear heels every day of the week. If you wear heels on Monday, wear some flats on Tuesday. Try to minimize the amount of time that you wear your high heels, especially if you are doing lots of walking or standing. If you have to walk a good distance, change into some tennis shoes and then put your heels on when you reach your destination.



Stretch your calves and your feet when you take your heels off for the day.
Taking these steps will ensure that you can wear heels without damaging your feet and ankles.

, Correctly designed arches that are well balanced and match the natural shape of the feet make the difference between pain and all-day comfort.Improperly designed shoe arches rise in a straight ramp from just behind the balls of the feet to the backs of the heels. These do not support the arches of the feet and cause the feet to slide forward in the shoes. In this scenario, the majority of your weight is on the ball of your foot and your toes.


If you feel like you are walking on your tip toes, the arch of the shoe may be too high.
Better shoe arches rise in a curve to support the arches of the feet, and level off a bit so that the heels of the feet are not resting on so steep an incline.
The very best shoe arches rise high to provide total arch support for the feet, and then drop down into shallow cup-like depressions that hold and support the heels of the feet. This profile shifts body weight from the balls of the feet back to the heels where it belongs, and helps prevent the feet from sliding forward.

Choose heels that flatter your legs.,
Start with a basic color.,
Pair chunky heels with a more casual outfit.,
Get a pair of sandals.",How to Choose High Heels3," If you have large ankles, avoid wearing heels that have an ankle strap. An ankle strap will make your ankles look larger. Go for a sling back or pump instead. On the other hand, an ankle strap will help if you have thin ankles.Pointy-toe shoes, nude heels, and open toe heels will make your legs look longer and leaner.T-strap shoes will make your legs look shorter. Avoid these if you are trying to look long and lean.
Narrow heels and stilettos look best on people with a more slender build, and with fashions that are lean and slimming.
People with heavier builds should look at platforms or thicker heels to keep things looking balanced and proportional.

, If you do not have a lot of heels, invest in a pair of black and/or nude heels. A classic pump can be worn on any occasion and will never go out of a style. A nude shoe can be worn with most outfits. These two styles are timeless, and you can wear them for a long time..


The color of nude you choose will be different based on your skin tone.
The heels you select for an outfit will depend on the occasion and your personal style.

, Chunky heels are comfortable, but are also less dressy than thinner heels. If you wear a chunky heel, balance the rest of your outfit by wearing another chunky item. For example, if you have on a dainty dress, add a jacket.


Chunky heels also look nice with boyfriend jeans.Adding a chunky heel can also help you dress down an outfit if you need to. If you wanted to wear a dress to a casual dinner, add a chunky heel to make it less formal.

, A high heeled sandal is a versatile shoe that can be worn with casual and dressy outfits. Your shoe should not compete with your outfit. If you wear an outfit with a lot of prints or colors, choose a simple sandal with thin straps.If you are wearing a casual outfit, throwing on a pair of sandals will instantly dress up your look.
Depending on where you work, a strappy sandal may not be appropriate for work. For example, A sandal may be fine for the fashion or arts industry, but may not be fine in a corporate law office.

You should also be aware of any foot problems or conditions you have, such as flat feet.
If you want to be very precise with your foot size, buy a Brannock foot measurer online. This is the tool that stores use in order to measure the length and width of your foot. Buying this device will help ensure you are buying the correct size.;
, Are you looking for comfort, style, or a mix of both? These are important considerations to make before you decide on any shoe to buy. Determining the type of shoe will also help you narrow in on proper search terms.


Shopping for style is slightly harder online since you can't see how they actually look on you.Buying shoes for comfort is generally easier to do online.

, For example, if you are looking for high heels, search ""high heels"" in the search field of whatever service you are using.


You may also wish to add the size in your search term, but many websites will allow you to select a size.

Amazon may be the most helpful in finding these reviews, even if you do not intend to buy the shoes from Amazon.
If you have any foot condition, be sure to look for reviews mentioning problems the shoe may have with the condition.
Determine the correct size for the shoe. Sizing is not uniform across all companies, so you will need to figure out which size is right for the particular company. Many online stores will have a chart, but reading customer reviews will also help with this task.

, Certain online stores will have sales or offer the shoes at lower prices. Spend some time scouring through different search results before making your final purchase decision.


There are also websites which help you with this process. Look up ""compare shoe prices"" in your favorite search engine to find these websites.

, If you have flat feet, for instance, ask the company how the shoe can support your condition.


Be wary of any company which refuses to respond to questions or is dismissive of you. When buying shoes online, you want a company which will be responsive to concerns.

, Be sure whatever service you are using is safe and secure before entering credit card information. You can also use services like PayPal if you are unsure about the website.


Be sure the service accepts returns. There is a high chance that the shoe will not fit exactly right once it actually comes. No matter how much thought goes into the purchase, you will never know until you try it on.

Once at a shoe store, you can ask a sales associate to assist you in proper foot measurement so that you can find shoes that fit you correctly.Wearing shoes that are even just a half size off can make for a very painful outing. Your poor tootsies will be in pain and your leg muscles will be very sore.Make sure your toenails are trimmed so that they do not scratch your toes once your shoes are on.;
, Many fashion shoes come in a standard medium width, but you may have feet that require a wider or more narrow fit. When you find a pair of shoes you love, see if they come in different widths.


A shoemaker can usually stretch the shoes to widen the toe box, enhancing the comfort of the shoe.
If you have narrow feet, buy foot inserts that help your foot grip the shoe and fill up any extra space on the sides.

, Remember, not all shoes follow the same sizing standards. Two different pairs of shoes in the same size can fit you very differently. Shoes can run big or run small, so it is important that you always try them on in the store before you buy them. Also, the shape of the shoe can play a major factor in how they fit your feet.If the shoes pinch you even a little when you are trying them on, do not buy them. It will only get worse.

, If you are purchasing shoes in a store, try on the shoes and walk around in them for two minutes. This will be enough time for you to feel if they are causing you any discomfort. If they fail the two minute test, you should probably find a pair of heels that is more comfortable.

, It feels great to find inexpensive merchandise, but shoes are not an item you want to skimp on. Do your research before purchasing shoes, especially high heels, and make sure they are a trusted brand. Your feet are the foundation of your body and it is important that they receive great care and stay healthy.

, Blisters can develop on your feet from your toes sliding forward, too-tight shoes, or sweaty feet that cause too much friction in your shoe. To help soothe your blisters, cover them with moleskin bandages. These types of bandages are softer and will allow your skin to more easily breathe. Your blisters will surely prevent you from walking normally if you leave them untreated., Shoe inserts will help your foot fit more securely in your shoe, allowing you to wear them longer. There are foam and gel inserts available to use. The foam inserts can be cut to your foot size, while gel inserts are transparent and provide discreet comfort. They help keep your foot in place and can support your foot's natural arches, keeping your feet comfortable., You should wear specific types of heels depending on whether you will be inside or outside. If you plan to spend time outside in the grass, or walking long distances on surfaces you are not familiar with, choose shoes that have a wider ""contact point"" on the bottom so you don't trip. If you are going to be inside, make sure there is friction, or texture, on the bottoms of your shoes so you do not slip.


High heels that have spiked heels can easily pierce soft ground. If you wear them outside you will be sinking into dirt all day.
Preferably, you want the heel to have a wide ""contact point,"" the point at which the bottom of the heel touches the ground, for outside use. The wider the contact point, the less likely you are to fall sideways and twist your ankle, fall, or both.

, If you are wearing your shoes to work, or for more than four hours a day, find a places to take them off for a few moments. This will allow you a chance to stretch out your foot muscles and prevent your feet from injury.Flex your feet and rotate your ankles when you slip your shoes off for a few minutes. You can do this under your desk at work or even in the bathroom., When you wear heels, your body has to take a different approach to walking because of the new angle at which it places your legs and feet. Try following a simple approach to help you more easily walk in high heels. First, take a step forward, starting with your heel, and rock all the way forward to the tip of the toe. Repeat these two words with every step as a reminder, ""heel - toe; heel - toe; heel - toe..."", and before you know it, you will feel sturdy, stable, confident, and comfortable walking in heels.Eventually, you will develop muscle memory to walk comfortably and easily in heels.
After you can walk at a good pace, watch yourself in a mirror to smooth out your new strut. Your stride should be natural, and your body should remain perpendicular to the floor.
If you catch yourself wobbling unsteadily, slow it down again until you feel good.

, You should walk as if you are being pulled up by a string. As you walk, use your hips to shift and lift your legs to the center with each step you take. Condition your body to deal with the changes in posture, which will engage different muscles than when you are walking barefoot or in flats. Your feet, ankles, knees, and back will thank you!Keep your back straight, don't slouch.
Don't block your arms when walking, swing them normally.
Take small steps and walk in a straight line.

, You wouldn't go from couch potato to marathon runner in one day. Similarly, you can't go from ballet flats to four-inch stilettos in one day. If you are planning to wear heels for a special occasion, begin by wearing them for increasing intervals of time every day prior to your event. First, wear them for thirty minutes, then an hour the next day, and then two hours. This will help prepare you for extended time in your heels.

, Start slow by walking back and forth on a non-slippery surface. Then, try to walk up and down stairs. Make sure you can bend over to pick things up. Try wearing a pair while vacuuming, getting ready in the morning or before bed, and running small and routine errands.

, Some people feel silly putting on a pair of heels... don't! Envision yourself becoming a fashion hero when you put them on, and people will envy your confidence. You probably look great wearing them, so don't let uncertainty trip you up.


Trust your shoes. If you are afraid, you will block and contact your body, so you won't be able to walk normally. If you are confident, you will forget you are wearing them and walk normally.

Decide if you are purchasing custom orthotics or over-the-counter orthotics.",How to Buy Shoe Orthotics1," Depending on your orthotic requirements and budget, you have options either way. In general, if you have severe feet issues, you will need more customized orthotics.

Custom orthotics are more on the expensive side, but provide better support for you as they are made to fit your feet. These may require a fitting with a trained professional for best results.
Orthotics are also available at most pharmacies, online, and some are available at better athletic shoe stores as well. These generally offer mild-to-moderate support, and for common foot issues such as plantar fasciitis. While these are often a good and thrifty solution, you also do not get the guidance to pick out the best one nor necessarily the one that suits your needs the best.
Be careful not to buy insoles which only absorb odors; these are not orthotic insoles.
For best results, each pair of shoe should have its own set of insoles. Over-the-counter insoles are often much more affordable if you do not need very particular insoles. When you buy a new pair of shoes, get a pair of insoles as well.

Don't forget to test out the shoes before buying.,
Don't forget to ask for deals.,
Don't wait too long before buying your next pair.",How to Buy Running Shoes," When shopping for a new pair of running shoes, it's best to go to a smaller, specialty running store rather than a large department store. In general, the staff at specialty running stores will be more knowledgeable and have more time to spend with each individual customer.A good salesperson will ask you many questions about your running style and patterns in order to determine the right style of shoe for you. They will ask you how many miles you run in a week, if you're a road runner or a trail runner, and if you are currently training for a race or marathon.
The salesperson may also conduct several tests to determine how you run. They may watch you run on a treadmill to see whether you overpronate (roll your foot inwards) or supinate (roll your foot outwards) when your foot hits the ground.They may also conduct an arch test to see whether you have normal, high or fallen arches.
These factors will help to determine what type of running shoe is best for you.;
, When you go shopping for a new pair of running shoes, it's important to bring any shoes, socks or inserts that you currently use with you -- these will help the sales assistant to identify your needs and also help you to choose a shoe that fits correctly.


The sales assistant may examine the wear patterns on your old shoes to confirm your running style. For example, if the wear patterns are mainly concentrated on the inside edge of the shoe, this indicates that you tend to overpronate as you run. Overpronators usually require stability or motion control shoes.
It's important to wear your regular socks and inserts when trying on new shoes, otherwise you risk buying a pair of shoes that seem to fit in the store, but feel too smart once you start running in them.
You should also wear your regular running clothes when you go shopping for running shoes, so you'll feel comfortable running on a treadmill or doing a lap around the store when the time comes to test them out. Don't go shopping for running shoes when you're wearing a suit or when wearing sandals or flip-flops with no socks.

, Many people make the mistake of shopping for running shoes early in the morning, but this doesn't take the fact that your feet swell throughout the day into account.


As a result of this swelling, a shoe that fits in the morning may not feel so comfortable come evening time. Plan your shopping trip for some time after 4pm, as your feet won't swell much more after this time.
This is important as your feet also swell while you run, so you need to buy shoes that are comfortable when your feet are at their biggest., Another common mistake people make is to assume that they know their foot size. However, the length and width of a person's foot tends to change over time (due to things like pregnancy and falling arches). Therefore, you should get your foot measured each time you buy a new pair of shoes.


In general, your running shoes should be between a half and a full size bigger than your street shoes. This gives your feet more space to move around as you run.
In addition, it's important to remember that sizing can be different across different brands, due to their design and the materials used. So even if you're a size 7 in Nike shoes, you may be a 7.5 in Reeboks.
Running in shoes that are too small can lead to things like blisters and blackened toenails, which is no fun. So don't worry too much about getting a shoe in ""your"" size, just buy a shoe that fits!, There's no hard and fast rule when it comes to how much you should spend on a pair of running shoes, but in general you should expect to pay somewhere between $70 and $120.


Running shoes are an investment -- the right pair will help you to run comfortably while avoiding injuries and accidents. Buying a good pair of running shoes now may save you money on doctor's bills or physical therapy appointments down the line.
Don't be tempted to buy a cheap pair of running shoes just because you found them in the bargain basement. Equally, you shouldn't overspend on the latest pair of brand name shoes that claim to have the latest in running technology. It's unlikely that either of these options will be the perfect shoe for you. , Making sure your toes have enough room is one of the most important things to look for in a new pair of running shoes.


Your toes should be able to move freely from side to side within the shoe's forefoot. When standing normally, your little toe should not be sitting on the edge of the insole.
There should be about one thumbs-width of space between your longest toe and the top of the shoe. Have a sales assistant or friend measure this while you are standing up straight.
Make sure the top of the shoe doesn't fit too tightly across your toes - you should be able to wiggle your toes up and down, as if playing the piano!

, If the heel of your running shoe is too tight or too loose, it can cause irritation while running.


The perfect running shoe will fit snugly around your heel, but won't be too tight. When your shoes are laced to the final eyelet (but not tied) you should be able to slip your foot out of the shoe without too much difficulty.
A little bit of movement around the heel is acceptable, but if you have any doubts you should trust your gut. Remember that any slight issues you have while trying shoes on in the store will be amplified once you go for your first run.

, The shoe's upper should feel secure around your instep, but it should not feel in any way uncomfortable or tight.


If you feel any kind of pressure or tightness around your instep, the shoe is probably too small and you should try a bigger size.
However, if the pressure or pain is concentrated in the area beneath the laces, you may want to try lacing the shoe a different way before moving on to the next shoe., The flex point of the shoe is the point at which it bends while running. For optimal comfort, the flex point of the shoe should match the bending point of your foot.


You can check the flex point of the shoe by holding it by the heel and pressing the toe of the shoe onto the ground. The point where the shoe bends and creases (if it bends at all) is the flex point.
This step is important, because if the flex point of the shoe doesn't align with your foot it can cause problems like arch pain or plantar fasciitis (heel pain). , Knowing your arch type and contour will come in handy when determining what shape and support level you require in a running shoe.


People with flat arches will require a shoe with more stability and support. However, you shouldn't overdo it on the support either -- it should feel as natural possible. If your arch starts to cramp while testing out the shoe, chances are it has too much support.People with high arches may need a curved shoe, which matches the natural contour of their foot.

, You shouldn't buy a pair of shoes just because they're brightly colored, flashy-looking or feel light as a feather.


Shoe manufacturers use these features to manipulate consumers into making an impulse purchase, without really considering if the shoe is the right choice for their needs.
In the long run, you are much better off buying a plain looking shoe that fits like a glove and provides your with the support you need, rather than a fashionable, pretty-looking shoe that hurts your feet after the first week of running.

, You should also avoid buying into the notion that a shoe with ""special features"" will help you to run longer, faster or better.


A lot of shoes will advertise features like shock-absorbing cushioning or claim to help you lose weight or even cure an injury. However, experts say that there is no significant difference between these shoes and most basic, no-frills running shoes.
Even those minimalist shoes designed to mimic barefoot running which have become so popular in recent years have not been scientifically proven to reduce a runner's risk of injury., On average, it takes a shopper 10 to 15 seconds to pick out a new pair of running shoes.However, it is highly recommended that you test out your new shoes for at least a few minutes before you make a decision.


Try on both shoes and spend a few minutes walking around and trying out different movements. If possible, run on the store's treadmill or do a lap around the store to see how they feel while you are actually running (that's what you're buying them for, after all).You should also avoid limiting yourself when it comes to the number of pairs you try on. A good sales assistant will be able to pick out a selection of running shoes that fit your needs, so take the time to try each of them on and choose the ones you like best

, Many specialty running stores offer deals and discounts to local running or track clubs, so don't forget to ask before you pay!


These offers could include something like a 10% discount or a special reduced price when you buy more than one pair of shoes at a time (which is common for dedicated runners).
Some stores may require you become a member before you can qualify for a discount, which require a small membership fee. However, if you were happy with the service and found a pair of shoes that you love, this can definitely be worth it., Keep in mind that even good running shoes are only designed to last for 400 to 500 miles (640 to 800 km).As a result, your shoes will need to be replaced approximately every six months (for the average runner). It doesn't matter if they still look good, if the support has been worn out you're at a much higher risk of getting injured.
Make a note of the date each time you buy a new pair of running shoes, this will help you to keep track of when you're due for a new pair.

Go to your medical professional and get an evaluation on your needs.,Pay for your custom orthotics and wait for them to be delivered.,
Put them properly in your shoe.",How to Buy Shoe Orthotics2," This could be a chiropractor, physical therapist, medical doctor, or a number of other professionals. There are many factors that cause foot issues, and without knowing what the problem is, you are unlikely to compensate for it.

Depending on the professional, the testing will vary. Some will simply have you stand on a sensing pad to see where you need the support while others may have a sensing pad that you walk across (this type is better). Many will watch you walk, and some may have other tests.;
,, If you have longer orthotics, put the longer part (fabric-y part) under the actual harder orthotic part and stick it in you shoe. Once you get the heal part in place, release the fabric-y part towards the toe end."
"
Decide if ready made orthotics are a better option for you.,
Do your research.,
Ask a chiropractor what type of store-bought orthotics he/she would recommend for your foot type (whether you have a high arch, low arch, etc.).,
Go to different stores or their websites and compare prices for the same type of orthotics.,
Purchase the orthotic of your choice that best fits your feet.",How to Buy Shoe Orthotics3," Ready-made orthotics are pre-made with a certain arch type and support system., Remember you do not want gel-like orthotics. Many people make the mistake of purchasing gel insoles thinking that that will help their foot pain; this is typically not true. It could actually make your feet worse and hurt more later.,

Remember, if they recommend a gel or air cushion one, don't take their advice.
Brands such as Doctor Scholl's are gel or cushion based and are not recommended.

,

Some sports stores may have better ready-made orthotics but may cost more.

, Some stores may allow you to try them out for a certain number of days. If they are hurting your feet after a few days you should try a different kind. A day or two of discomfort as the feet adjust to a new pair of insoles is often normal, but much more indicates a mismatch. The wrong insoles can hurt your feet more than no orthotics at all!"
"
Decide when and where you will wear your shoes.,
Decide based on style.",How to Buy Toning Shoes1," Toning shoes' soles are designed differently for runners, walkers and everyday users. The 3 most common designs are rocker bottom soles, curved soles and collapsible heel soles.


If you walk often, choose collapsible heel toning shoes. They provide the feeling of walking in sand, which can help to strengthen your legs as you go about your daily errands.
If you want to improve your posture while you walk, choose ridged rocker bottom soles. They have a thick sole that allows you to rock back on your heel. They may also provide relief if you suffer from heel pain.
If you want to walk and jog, choose semi-rigid rocker bottom shoes or curved sole toning shoes. There is some flexibility in the soles, so they have some speed versatility. Do not do any kind of cross-training in these shoes, because they don't offer enough lateral stability.
If you want to walk, jog, run and cross-train, choose flexible rocker bottom shoes. These are the best choice if you want to wear them at the gym. They will allow you extra stability so you can do lateral movement without injuring yourself.;
, Many of today's toning shoes have very thick soles, and may not fit your current style. You can find smaller toning shoes, leather shoes and even Mary Jane styles, if you plan to wear them to work rather than the gym.

Learn about your style of skating.,
Know what styles are available.,
Learn about cushioning.,
Educate yourself on durability of different skate shoes.,
Know your brands.,
Decide if you really need skate shoes.,
Think about your skateboarding style.,
Don’t be afraid to buy something more expensive.",How to Buy Good Skate Shoes," There are number of different types of board tricks. Which ones you perform will determine what kinds of shoes you will need to look for. One of the most common types of board tricks is the ollie, which is a jump performed by tapping the tail of a skateboard on the ground. These can be modified to add a spin before the jump (kickflip), or by tapping the nose of the board on the ground instead of the tail.
Aerials are performed when all four wheels of the skateboard are off of the ground. Landing an aerial requires a lot of support on the sole of the foot and heel.
Another type of board trick is the grind. These are done by scraping one or both axles of the skateboard on a curb, railing, or other surface. These require a flexible shoe that allows you to have greater control over the board.
Slides are another form of skateboarding trick. A noseslide is performed by sliding the underside of the nose of the board against a ledge. A tailslide is the opposite; these are performed when the underside of the tail of the skateboard slides against a lip. A railslide is when the underside of the board slides against a railing.;
, There are different kinds of skate shoes, but these have different functions and looks. There are two main kinds of skate shoe: one geared towards heavy defense against the impact of aerials (cupsoles) and another for greater control of board tricks like grinds (vulcanized).
Vulcanized shoes are slimmer and more similar to casual shoes. They are thinner, lightweight, and flexible. Vulcanized shoes offer more maneuverability and board feel for tricks like grinds or slides. These shoes aren’t as cushioned as other skate shoes, so you might consider another style with heaver soles if your heels bruise.
Cupsoles are another type of skate shoe with more cushioning and a thicker sole, designed for skaters who jump from higher distances or who like to perform aerials.

, Different skate shoes have varied types of cushioning, which can affect how your shoes protect your feet. Most skate shoes have a midsole which is made from lightweight EVA foam that can help with impact when your foot or board hits the concrete.
Midsoles made from PU foam may last longer, if you want a more durable product.
Some skate shoes have dual heel cushioning. Vulcanized shoes often have this extra layer of cushioning at the heel to make up for their thin soles.
Many skate shoes have a heel collar for added stability around the heel and to prevent a shoe from slipping off during skateboarding.

, You will want shoes with the following features: Lace guards will help to prevent all the skateboarding you do from chewing up your laces. Some skate shoes have these, which tuck lace loops between the tongue and outer lip of the shoe.
Added upper layers of material will prevent wear and tear from constant contact with grips from skateboarding. Some shoes have added triple stitching for added durability.
The outer sole is the critical contact point between the skater and the board. Look for a shoe with a flat outsole for grip, made out of gum rubber. Gum rubber grips better and lasts longer than other types of rubber that shoes are made out of.

, Reputable companies have been making durable and safe skate shoes for decades. ]


Emerica, Fallen, Dekline, Circa, Duffs, and Etines are very well known.
If you want the best shoes with the best grip, wear, and flex then you want to get Vans, Adio, Globe, DC, Nike, Lakai, and DVS.
Osiris brand are very stylish but aren’t as durable for skating.

, If you aren't going to skate too much, then you don't really need them unless you're just in it for style.


Skate shoes resemble casual style sneakers, but are more expensive.
Chances are, you will find a pair of casual sneakers that look similar to skate shoes and be able to spend less money.
Consider that skate shoes may be more durable in the long run, but casual shoes might be more comfortable if you aren’t actually skating.

, Your skating style might be better for one type of shoe vs. another. If you do more board tricks like ollies, grinds and slides, then you will need a more flexible shoe with a thinner sole, like vulcanized shoes.
If you want to do jumps such as aerials you will need something with a thicker sole and heel protection for impact, such as shoes with cupsoles.
Make sure your shoe is durable enough for your style of skating. If you are doing minor board tricks, you might not need as strong a shoe as someone doing more elaborate tricks.

, If you skate often, an expensive well-made shoe will last much longer than a cheaper alternative.The right skate shoes can save you from a foot injury if you land wrong while skating.
Try the shoes on for comfort. If your feet don't feel supported or if the shoes rub your feet too much, try a different size or a different brand.
If you aren’t skating often, you might be able to go with a cheaper shoe, especially if you aren’t doing aerials or complicated board tricks.

Read the instructions carefully after purchasing.",How to Buy Toning Shoes2," Toning shoes can vary in price between about $60 and $300. Much engineering goes into developing toning models, so they are not an inexpensive shoe.

, Look for the specific heel type you have chosen in the shoe description. Once you become familiar with the toning shoe terms like ""balance pod,"" it will be easier to identify them as terms often associated with flexible rocker heels or collapsible heels once you start looking in stores.

, If you already walk or jog often, and you have found a shoe company you like, look for their model of toning shoe first, since the overall fit is likely to be better.

, Department stores, shoe stores and athletic stores now carry a large array of the most popular toning shoes, so try on a number of models before deciding on the shoe you want. You can also order from online shoes stores, like Endless.com, that offer free return shipping and exchanges.

, These are often the best indication of any discomfort associated with wearing them and how long they will last. You want to make sure you get a good product before paying the money.

, Most shoe companies do not let you return shoes if you have worn them outside. Since toning shoes garner larger prices, they may come with a warranty to return the shoes within a short length of time if they are not comfortable.

Before you jump right in, you should be certain that you can afford to start amassing a footwear collection. Develop a budget that will allow you to set aside a certain amount of money every month or couple of months to spend on new shoes. If need be, find a second job and use the extra income to support your hobby.Name brand sneakers often run for as much as a few hundred dollars per pair.
If you’re serious about the lifestyle, consider getting a job at a sneaker store. Not only will you be surrounded by the thing you love most, you’ll also be earning extra money and be eligible for employee discounts.;
, Snatch up as many eye-catching pairs of sneakers as you can. Be on the lookout constantly for new brands, styles and colorways. Buy the latest models when they premier to stay current and show people that you have style. Buying and showing off new shoes is what being a sneakerhead is all about, so the more pairs you buy, the more impressive your stockpile will be.Shopping malls usually have at least one or two stores that carry the latest fashions in athletic and streetwear.
Look for deals online through websites like Zappos and 6pm, where you can buy shoes for discounted rates and save on shipping.

, Every sneakerhead's collection is going to contain a few staples. Browse thrift shops and other discount clothing retailers to track down timeless models like Jordans, Reebok Classics or Air Force 1s for unbeatable prices. Since these vintage sneakers are older, they're more likely to turn up in places that most sneakerheads wouldn't think to go looking.See if your area has any consignment stores that deal specifically with footwear.The sneakers you find in these places may not be brand new, but after a thorough restoration job no one will be likely to tell the difference.

, After they’ve been collecting for a while, most sneakerheads develop a preference for a particular brand or type of shoe. Certain designers and models are fashionable among shoe collectors, but there are no “best” brands. If you like it and it looks good on you, buy it. No two sneakerheads’ closets are identical. Once you start to refine your tastes, your collection will start to take on its own unique personality.Your collection might be made up mostly of hi-top basketball shoes, for instance, or you might gravitate toward lower profile designs like skate shoes.
There is a lot of territorial competition between fans of Nike, Adidas, Reebok, etc., but it’s all in good fun. Any model could have a potential place in your collection.

, There’s no point in buying a bunch of shoes if you’re just going to keep them in the closet. Be sure to take your new kicks out for a spin every so often to give them a little play. Match up the day’s outfit with a killer pair of sneakers and let the people around you see what style is all about. You might never wear the same pair two days in a row!Share choice selections for your friends and followers on Instagram to admire.Sporting flashy footwear will always get people talking.

, Once your hottest sneakers are past their prime, put them up for sale to recoup money for new pairs. Take them to a consignment shop, if you're just looking to get rid of them, or post a notice online through a site like Ebay or Craigslist. If they're still in good condition, try selling them directly to another sneakerhead, who will have a better idea of what they're worth.Getting as much as you can out of your old shoes can make it easier for you to afford new ones.
The better care you take of your sneakers, the easier it will be to fetch a decent price for them later on. Before attempting to sell shoes you no longer want, make sure you clean them, pack them up with all included accessories and, if possible, return them to their original box.

, Clean your shoes after wearing them to prevent them from showing signs of dirt and wear. Combine a small amount of water with a mild liquid detergent or shoe cleaning solution and lightly scrub away dingy and discolored areas. Wet a washcloth and wipe away any dirt and debris clinging to the shoes’ outsoles. By taking good care of your sneakers and keeping them clean, you can ensure that they stay fresh and vibrant for as long as possible.Look for specially-designed brushes online or in shoe stores that can be used to clean and polish delicate materials like suede.Treat dirt and other stains immediately to keep them from setting in.

, The more you wear a particular pair of shoes, the faster that pair will wear out. Try not to lace up the same pair of shoes every day. Select a different pair every couple of days to minimize stress, foot contact and exposure to the elements. When you’re not wearing a pair, give it a gentle wipe down and store it somewhere cool and dry.Store your sneakers in their original boxes, or stash them somewhere that’s climate-controlled and away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Too much sunlight can cause colors to fade, while especially hot or cold temperatures can degrade the materials that the shoes are made from.Choose your footwear carefully for a given day. It might not be a good idea to wear a pair of leather or suede sneakers if the forecast is calling for rain, and black hi-tops will be less comfortable on hotter days than low cut, breathable shoes of a lighter shade.

, Give each pair of shoes a function, and only use that pair for its intended purpose. For instance, you might have a pair that you only work out in, another pair for that you use exclusively for hiking or slip on when you’re going to get dirty, etc. That way, you won’t be using every pair as all-purpose footwear, and you’ll be able to keep them in pristine condition.


Consider buying two pairs of your favorite shoes—one to wear around and another to put on display.
Pick out an older pair to serve as “throwaway” shoes that you don’t mind getting dirty or beating up., Set aside a little closet space to organize your shoes, or buy a shelf or rack so that you can exhibit them out in the open. Many shoe aficionados are proud of the collections they’ve put together and like to keep a few of their best pairs where they can be seen. If you’re going to own them, you might as well put them on display proudly.Look for inexpensive storage racks and shelves that you can convert and use to highlight some of your favorite acquisitions.

, Pay attention to brand marketing to learn about new models that are in production and when they’ll be available for purchase. Keep an ear to the ground when searching for your next purchase in stores or online. Big releases tend to get a lot of hype before they drop, and if you want to be on the front line of the sneaker game, you should make sure you’re in a position to hear about them.The big brands often run features on anticipated new models on their websites which include detailed photos, specs and release dates.
In some cases, you may have to act fast to get a coveted spot on a waiting list if a new release is expected to sell out quickly.

, Know where the shoe stores are in your area and pay them regular visits to track down deals on your most desired gear. You can also frequent lifestyle shops like Zumiez, Journeys and Vans for new stock and competitive pricing. The people that work in these stores are often sneakerheads themselves, and they’ll be able to tell you anything you want to know about contemporary styles.Befriending store employees and being a loyal customer may land you exclusive benefits, such as special discounts and opportunities to buy models hot off the assembly line before their official release dates., Become friends with other people who have a passion for shoes. You can converse about the ins and outs of your favorite brands, share your excitement about new designs in the works and even buy, sell or trade from your collections. Other sneakerheads will be able to bring their own unique style preferences and expertise to the discussion.

Choose a basketball shoe for ankle support and bulky cushioning to prevent injury on the court.
Pick a tennis shoe for the ability to move side to side quickly without rolling your ankle.
Consider a track and field shoe if your exercise includes running on a track or performing field events such as long jump.
Purchase a cross-country or trail shoe if you plan on walking or running through more rugged terrain than concrete or pavement.
Select a walking shoe for low-intensity exercise. These shoes can usually be worn for everyday activities to promote good posture and provide good support.
Decide on a running shoe if your primary exercise focus is running, either on a treadmill or outdoors.
Opt for other specialty exercise shoes, such as lacrosse, wrestling, hiking, cleats or water shoes as needed.;
,


Place a piece of cardboard on the floor and dip your foot in water.
Walk on the cardboard and study the shape your foot made. Decide if you have high arches, flat feet or neutral feet.
If you have high arches, your footprint will show a thin connection between your heel and toes. High-arched feet require flexible shoes with extra cushioning in the mid-sole.
If you have flat feet, your footprint will show a complete connection between your heel and toes. Flat feet require extra support in shoes.

Test multiple shoes. Some brands run more narrow or wider than others. Finding the right brand might mean finding the perfect fit.

Prevent friction and blisters by applying an anti-friction stick to your feet.,
Consider using an antiperspirant stick to reduce sweating.,
Keep your foot in place and prevent chafing and bruising with an insole.,
Ease pain in the ball of your foot with some ball-of-foot cushions.,
Use some silicone gel dots or adhesive foam tape to ease excessive pressure in smaller areas.,
Use silicone heel cups or arch-supporting insoles to sooth aching heels.,
Prevent scrunched toes in high heels by asking a shoe cobbler to trim the heel down for you.",How to Fix Painful Shoes1," Purchase some moleskin from a shoe store (or the shoe repair section of a drug store) and take out one sheet. Place the sheet behind the offending strap or heel and trace it with a pencil. Cut the shape out using a pair of scissors and peel off the backing. Stick the moleskin onto the strap or heel.This will also work on other areas that cause chafing. If the area is inside your shoe, cut out a small circle or oval that is slightly larger than the area getting chafed. Peel off the backing and stick the moleskin to the offending area.
You can also stick the moleskin directly onto your foot, and peel it off at the end of the day.;
, You can purchase one at a drugstore. Apply the balm directly onto your skin, where the chafing and blistering is likely to occur.









You probably do not want to apply this to existing blisters. Instead, consider buying some blister treatments instead. They look like oval band-aids and go over the blister. They help cushion the blister and keep it clean so that it does not get infected.

, The sweat and moisture created by chafing can cause or worsen blisters. An antiperspirant reduces the moisture, which may reduce blistering.








, When your foot slips around from side to side, blisters can form along the front and back of your foot, where the material rubs against your skin. If you find your foot moving around inside a wedge heel or similar style, place a gel or padded insole inside the shoe to reduce movement.

, If the ball of your foot is aching at the end of the day, your shoe may be too hard; this is especially common in high heels. Purchase a set of ball-of-foot cushions and stick them in the front of your shoes, right where the ball of your foot sits. They are usually shaped like ovals or eggs.









If you have a pair of heeled sandals that have a strap between the toes, consider getting a heart-shaped cushion. The rounded parts of the heart will fit to either side of the toe strap., Both can be purchased in a shoe store or a drug store. The silicone gel dots are clear and easily disguised, but the foam tape can be cut to just the right shape and size., If your heels ache, it may be because the back/heel area of your shoe is too hard. It could also be because your shoes do not give your feet enough arch support. Try putting in a silicone heel cup or an arch support insole. Both can be trimmed down to the right size, and have adhesive on the back so that they don't slip around.Arch supporting insoles are usually labeled as such; if you are having troubles finding some, look for something that is thicker in the middle of the insole—right where the arch of your foot would go.
Placing an insole in a tight shoe may make your feet feel overcrowded and uncomfortable. If this happens, try a thinner insole

, Sometimes, the angle between the heel and the ball-of-foot is too great, causing your feet to slide forward and squish your toes against the front of the shoe. Reducing the heel height might fix this. Do not attempt to do this on your own; seek out a shoe cobbler to do it for you. Most high heels can be trimmed down up to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) by a shoe cobbler."

Know how the wrong size can hurt and how to fix it.,
Try putting in an insole if your shoe is too large.,
Use a heel grip if your shoe is too big and your foot slides forward too much.,
Fill out large toe boxes with some lambs' wool.,
Stretch out your shoes with a shoe tree.,
Stretch out your shoes using a shoe stretcher.,
Ask a cobbler to stretch out your shoe for you.,
Use ice to stretch out shoes that are too snug in the toe area.",How to Fix Painful Shoes2," Shoes that are too large can hurt just as much as shoes that are too small. Large shoes won't offer you enough support and cause your foot to move around too much, leading to chafing and scrunched toes. Shoes that are too small will leave your feet feeling cramped and aching at the end of the day. Fortunately, it is possible to stretch shoes out a little bit; it is also possible to fill shoes in to make them smaller.


Keep in mind that some materials are easier to stretch than others.

, They will provide extra cushioning inside your shoe and prevent your foot from wriggling around too much.

, A heel grip is an oval-shaped cushion with adhesive on one side. It can be made from gel or foam covered with moleskin. Simply peel the backing off the heel grip, and stick it to the inside of your shoe, right where the heel is. It will add extra cushioning to the back of the shoe, which will prevent your heel from getting chafed and keep your foot in place.








, If your new loafers or work shoes are too large and your toes keep sliding forward and getting scrunched, try filling out the toe area with some lambswool. This breathable, airy material will be more comfortable and less-likely to wad up, like tissue.You can also try using some cotton balls.

, A shoe tree can either maintain the shape of your shoe or stretch it out, depending on the length or width of the tree. Insert the shoe tree into your shoe in between wearings. This technique works best for leather and suede, but will not work on rubber or plastic.

, Spray your shoe with some shoe stretching spray, then tuck the stretcher into you shoe. All shoe stretchers are going to be a little bit different, but most will have a handle and a knob. The knob will adjust the length and the handle will adjust the width. Keep turning the handle and knob until the shoe material is snug, then leave the stretcher in the shoe for six to eight hours. Once the time is up, turn the handle and knob the other way (to make the shoe stretcher smaller) and pull the stretcher out of your shoe. This is a great option for too-large loafers and work shoes.


There are different types of shoe stretchers available, including ones for high heels. A two-way stretcher might be the most useful, as it can stretch both the width and the length of your shoe.
Some shoe stretches have attachments for ailments like bunions. Insert these attachments before using the shoe stretcher.
Shoe stretchers can only break in shoes and loosen them so that they do not feel so snug or tight; they cannot make your shoe whole size bigger.
Shoe stretchers work best on natural materials, such as leather and suede. They may work on certain types of fabric, but will not be very effective on synthetics and plastics.

, Doing so will give your toes more room to move, which may reduce squeezing and soreness throughout the foot. Stretching only works with shoes made of leather and suede, however. If you have an expensive pair of dress shoes that you don't want to ruin by stretching yourself, this is a good alternative.

, You can do this by filling two Ziploc bags partway with water and sealing them tightly so that there is no air left inside the bags and the water doesn't slosh out. Plop each bag into the toe of each shoe and stick both shoes into the freezer. Leave the shoes there until the ice freezes, then take them out. Pull the bags out of the shoe, then slip the shoes on. The shoes will conform to your foot shape as they warm back up.This helps stretch shoes out to some extent because water expands as it freezes.
This will only work on natural materials, such as leather, suede, and fabric. It may not have much effect on plastics and pleather.
Keep in mind that if your leather or suede shoes become damp, you may see some staining. Consider wrapping your shoe with a towel to protect it.

Buy some specialized socks.,
Prevent painful flip-flops by cushioning the thong part.,
Know how to treat painfully-smelly shoes.,
Consider taping your third and fourth toe together using skin-colored medical tape.,
Break in stiff shoes by wearing them for short periods.,
Use a hairdryer to stretch and break in stiff shoes.",How to Fix Painful Shoes3," Sometimes, wearing the right type of sock with your shoe is all that you need to fix painful shoes. These types of socks offer support to your feet, wick away moisture, and help prevent chafing and blisters. Here are some types of specialized socks that you might be able to find, and what they can do for you:Athletic socks are tighter in the arch area. This helps offer arch support, and makes them ideal for athletic and running shoes.
Moisture wicking socks will help remove sweat from around your feet. This will help keep your feet dry and prevent blisters.
Running socks have extra padding on the underside, This will help absorb the impact your foot makes when you run.
Toe socks are like gloves, but for your feet instead. They cover each toe separately, and may help prevent blisters between toes.
Consider the material. Some materials, such as cotton, soak up sweat too easily, which can lead to blisters. Acrylic, polyester, and polypropylene help remove sweat, leaving your feet dry.

, Flip-flops can be comfortable and easy to wear. When the thong starts to dig in between your toes, however, they can become painful. Here are some tricks you can try to make flip-flops less painful:


Use silicon flip-flop inserts. They are shaped like ball-of-foot cushions, except that they have a little cylinder that sticks up near the front. Place the insert in the front of your flip-flop, then slip the thong part into the cylinder. The cylinder will help prevent the thong from digging in between your toes.
Wrap the thong area with some adhesive moleskin. The will be especially effective on plastic or rubber flip-flops. It will help cushion your foot and soften any sharp edges.
Wrap some fabric around the thong. You can even continue wrapping the fabric around the straps for a colorful, personal touch. Secure both ends of the fabric to the shoe with a drop of shoe glue.

, You can use micro-suede insoles to absorb odor-causing sweat, or you can stick some tea bags into the shoes while you are not wearing them. The tea bags will absorb the odor. Discard the tea bags the next day.

, This helps lessen pain in the ball of your foot. The reason this works is because there is a nerve between those two toes. That nerve splits when you wear heels and put pressure on it. Taping those toes together pulls some of the strain away., If your new shoes are painful because they are stiff, you can help soften them up by wearing them around your home. Be sure to take breaks often and take the shoes off when they become too painful. Over time, the shoes may loosen up and become more comfortable to wear.

, Turn a hairdryer on to the lowest setting and point the nozzle into the shoe. Warm the shoe up from the inside for a few minutes, then turn the hairdryer off. Put on two pairs of socks and slip the shoe on. As the shoe cools back down, it will conform to the shape of your foot. This method is best used for shoes made from natural materials; it is not recommended for plastics and other synthetic materials as it may damage them."

Take your new Top-Siders out of the box, try them on and decide if they are definitely the right fit and/or style for you.,
Find a watertight container large enough to fit your shoes.,
Fill the container with cold water, about two thirds full.

,
Add sea salt.,
Stir the water well to dissolve the salt, then place your Top-Siders in the solution.,
Leave for 24 hours.

,

Walk around, play golf, do lunges, practice dance moves.",How to Break in a Pair of Sperry Top Siders Quickly," Be absolutely sure, because after you apply the aging processes, no retailer will take them back.;
, They should sit flat inside the container without protruding above the rim. A large Tupperware or similar box is ideal, or you can use a roasting tin or plastic tray. You are going to fill it with water, so make sure it doesn't have any holes in it.

,, The quantity of salt you will need depends largely upon the size of your container and the volume of water therein. Roughly speaking, for each liter of water, you will need 35g (approximately 1 tablespoon) of sea salt. This will give you a salinity of 3.5%, which approximates the average salinity of ocean water. Do not worry about being too precise. If in doubt, add more salt rather than less, and taste it. It should be repulsive, like a mouthful of New England brine. Not tasty at all.

, If they float, use a weight to keep them submerged. You can turn the shoes upside down, too, which ensures the whole of the leather upper is submerged.

,, Wear them around for a while until they begin to dry; this will not take as long as you might imagine, and the leather becomes quite comfortable and warm. You may not even realise you have wet shoes on.

, Your shoes will begin to conform to your feet, and the shiny new gloss will be considerably subdued. The leather will take on a tasty patina, as if you have been sailing for two weeks.

Pick shoes that do not provide ankle support, since they may be better for everyday use.,
Pick a pair of shoes that does not narrow too much in the middle of the outsole.,
Pick a style with material that breathes or a design with perforations that will not trap moisture.

,
Bend the front of the shoe upwards.,
Grab the shoe at the front and back and try to twist it (by rotating your hands in opposite directions).,
Press against the counter (the back spine of the shoe) and squeeze the sides of the counter, which support the heel, to check that they are strong and not easily deformed.

,
Ask for a measurement of your foot size.,
Check the stitching for quality, especially along the baseline, inside and out.,
Give the shoes a test drive.,
Cautiously walk on a linoleum or vinyl surface outside the store to make sure the shoes don't squeak or slip.",How to Buy a Good Pair of Shoes," Wearing basketball shoes or high-tops regularly could weaken the ankles.;
, The bottom of running shoes looks like a footprint, which does not provide stability.

,, Only the front third should bend up. The rear two-thirds of the shoe should be strong and difficult to bend.

, The shoe should not be easily distorted or deformed.

,, To check, remove the insole and compare it against your foot. The insole should be longer by about the width of your thumbnail. If one foot is slightly bigger than the other, accommodate the larger foot.

, (Demo pairs are typically of low quality.)

, Reject the design if your foot rolls outward or either heel lifts out. Although some materials like leather will stretch over time, too much tightness can cause discomfort over long durations.

, Squeakiness depends on the texture and material of the outsole and is a result of friction with laminate flooring. In contrast, insufficient friction is dangerous. A good pair of shoes can deliver both safety and quiet."

Rock tall boots year-round.",How to Wear Tall Boots," These boots, because they are dramatically tall, will be a focal point of an outfit. They will bring attention to your sexy lady legs. Tall boots are most dramatic paired with a short skirt or with slim-fit pants. You can use them in other ways, such as under a long skirt, but the effect is not as dramatic.
If you want to tone down the sexiness of the boots a little simply overlap the skirt of your dress with your boots about one inch (or three centimeters). Be sure to stick with plainer colors and embellishments. A sophisticated pair of tall, tan leather boots is less in-your-face sexual than a bright red, shiny pair of night clubbing boots.;
, Pair your thigh-highs with opaque tights, leggings, or nylons. These often slenderize and shape legs, and in colder weather help your legs feel warmer.


Pair brightly colored or interestingly printed leggings with black or brown boots, because attention will be drawn down to your legs, your leggings, and your boots.
Wear a less intense pair of leggings or tights with a more exciting pair of tall boots (boots that hit your calf, or your knee are both great for this).

, Tuck your jean leg into your boot to show off the full height of the boot. Skinny jeans hug your legs. As a result, they work with your boots to make your legs look long and slender.


Avoid tucking in loose or flared jean cuts, such as ""boot flare"" or wide pant legs. These may bunch up if tucked into your boots.
You can wear tall boots in wide or ""boot flair"" pants, however, you will be showing only the lower part of the tall boots.

, You can either pick a more subdued mini-skirt, in brown or black or grey, or you can go all out with a neon blaze of color. You can successfully give the illusion of showing a lot of leg without actually being scantily clad.

Be careful of how strong your overall impression is giving. A very short skirt with tall boots may not be appropriate for a professional office, even if you are not actually showing anything inappropriate. You may be better off with a more conservative just-above-the-knee length.






Wearing opaque with your mini-skirt and boots adds a touch of class to your cute outfit and will also keep you warmer if it's fall or winter.
Going without leggings or tights creates a more daring look, and shows off your legs. This is a great look for going out at night, or in warm weather.

, If you want your boots to be the focal point of your outfit for a night out at the dance club, choose tall boots in exciting colors, textures, embellishment, and otherwise draw the eye.

You will need to decide what is fabulously over-the-top and what is just ridiculous. This will be different for each woman. One woman will love her crimson stiletto-heeled boots with lots of metallic chains. Another woman may find it quite silly.






If you can walk in them (and make sure you practice before going to the club) try out some high stiletto heels with your knee-highs. They are basically guaranteed to draw the eye, especially if you pair them with a little dress, or skirt.
Metallic studs, chains, cut-outs in the material of the boot are all interesting additions to a pair of boots.
You might also try out exciting colors. While these are a little more difficult to pull off in the day, they're great for a night at the club. Crimson, bright purple, even yellow are all interesting colors that draw the eye.

, Tall boots can be a refreshing change from flats or high heels. Be sure they are sophisticated and modest for your office, and leave the shiny, loud ones for the weekend.


Pair with fall-ready textures like tweeds, wool, and cashmere, like a knee-length tweed skirt and a cashmere sweater. These all make for subtly stylish work or school attire.
You could also pair your knee-highs with a pencil skirts and tailored shirt. Toss on a cardigan for the cooler months.

, The over-the-knee boot can be great for showing off your legs, but be sure that your boots do not overwhelm the outfit. If in doubt, go with a longer skirt and use tights or leggings.


For a sophisticated, conservative look, try various shades of brown or black in natural-looking leather. Keep bright colors, patterns and finishes for more casual moments.
Wear a long skirt, to shin or ankle. This covers up the boot, only showing part of it, while giving you the warmth and protection of the over-the-knee boot. But it does give you another way to wear your boots.

, There are two different types of riding boots: Cowboy boots, and the English style riding boots. Both types can help foster a great casual look for your outfit.


Both best with sleek lines (like skinny jeans or leggings Cowboy boots can be a very regional fashion trend. For example, it may be common in Texas, USA, but seen as acceptable but perhaps rather quirky in Quebec.
For a subtly Western look pair cowboy boots with sleek trousers or skinny jeans (distressed jeans are particularly good) and a blouse.
You can also do leggings and sweater/sweater dress for a good fall fashion.
Riding boots, especially cowboy boots, can go a long way towards toning down a really feminine dress. They can help balance out a really frilly or flowery dress, an especially good look for spring.

, Jeans are often a good choice to wear with boots, because they can be dressed up, or dressed down, depending on the boot. You can show-case the boot (as described above with skinny jeans) or you can downplay it (wearing boot cut jeans that cover the boot).A great casual look for fall or winter is a pair of distressed skinny jeans with slouchy black suede boots and a chunky cable-knit sweater.
A nice looking blouse paired with sleek suede or leather boots and dark narrow jeans is a dressier look (and good for a first date!).
The only boot that does not usually work with jeans is the thigh-high. Thigh-high boots tend to go best with short skirts or leggings.

, Some boot styles are meant to have some slouch, but for most tall boots, you want to avoid pairs that gape around the top. Your boots should fit snugly yet comfortably. There should be enough room to tuck in skinny jeans or leggings, but not enough for your leg to slide back and forth inside the boot.

, This is especially true for women who consider their legs to be one of their problem areas. If you have thicker thighs, avoid boots that reach up to your mid-thigh. The horizontal line across the top will only make your leg look wider. Instead, opt for knee-high boots or boots that rise just above the knee.

, Tall women can get away with heeled and flat boots of all sizes. Shorter women may wish to stick with heeled boots, especially those that have a skinny heel, since these help to elongate the leg.Shorter women should also stick with snug boots that closely hug the leg. Looser boots may make a leg look stouter.
If you are shorter, remember that proportions matter. Pair a tall pair of boots with tucked in jeans and a short jacket. If you go for a long jacket, like a trench coat, you're going to be completely swallowed up.

, It can be a little difficult to pick the right colors, because boots come in so many different shades! However, there are some things you can consider to help you figure out which colors work best with your hair color and with your choices of outfits. Grey is good because of how flexible it is and cognac brown not only looks more expensive but goes with most outfits.


Consider what boots might be the most versatile for you, in terms of color. Black, of course, is always good, although you want to be careful with it. Black thigh-highs can be pretty intense and so aren't the best choices for work.
One of the ways to pick the color for your boots is to match it to a shade of color on your head. Fashion advisers say that this make it so the eye travels the full length of your body, drawing attention back up from your boots to your hair again. So for example, if you have golden-blond hair you might choose boots with a golden sheen. If you have black hair, you would go for black boots.You can also pick colors that match with your outfits. If you have a tendency to wear a lot of earth-toned outfits you would be better suited to wear brown or earth-toned boots (like olive green).

, Tall boots tend to be relegated to fall and winter fashion. However, you can wear these fashions all year long. A cowboy boot is perfect with the right summer dress, for instance. Or your black Gothic boots perfect even in the middle of summer.


Tall boots in the summer and spring are best saved for a night out on the town. They give a little bit of class and style and can draw the eye, because most people will be wearing sandals or heels.
A fun spring look is a pair of tall boots (like knee-high black boots) with a light, floaty spring dress. The two opposing fashion choices balance one another out.

It might even be easier for them to figure out how to balance out those first wobbly steps when they are barefoot.
Sometimes it’s dangerous (or disgusting) for your baby to go barefoot. Never let your baby walk barefoot in parks, on pavement, or on rocky ground where their feet might get scratched or cut.;

Shoes that fit just fine in the morning may be too tight in the evening., The last thing you want is for your adorable little shoe shopper to be tired and crabby. Your baby will need to walk around while trying on new footwear, so try to plan around naps and meals. A hungry, grumpy baby is not going to be interested in trying on shoes (and you don’t want to try to put shoes on feet that are kicking mad!)

, Velcro can make getting your baby’s shoes on and off a breeze, and you won’t have to worry about constantly retying loose laces. Keep in mind that Velcro is pretty easy to figure out, though. Once your baby figures out how to work the Velcro, you might be in for some trouble! Babies love to take their shoes off when they probably shouldn’t!, If you decide to go with lace-up shoes instead, make sure that you get some with laces that are long enough to double knot. Otherwise, you’ll be spending a lot of time tying and retying. Lace-up shoes are harder for babies to take off, so you may save some time that you might have spent looking for lost shoes.

, If you decide against Velcro and lace-up shoes, you may want to try a slip-on shoe. While slip-ons definitely save time during the on and off process, they do have some drawbacks. Slip-on shoes are harder to fit correctly when you change the thickness of your baby’s socks. They also may be easy for your baby to remove and you may end up with a lost shoe.

, Baby shoes should be soft. They should also have very bendable, flexible soles so that your baby can use those cute little feet properly to gain balance. Since babies learn by touching and feeling things, your baby will need to be able to feel the ground through the shoes. Robeez and Pedipeds are good brands for a first shoe for babies and they fit even the chubbiest of baby feet., It’s hard enough to learn to walk without sliding around all over the place! Your baby will need good traction. Make sure that the shoes you choose for your baby are non-skid, but not too thick that they can’t bend their feet properly. Soles with rubber grip are a good idea, especially if your baby will be walking on slippery floors.

, Baby feet sweat more than you would think! You would be unpleasantly surprised at how yucky those sweet baby feet can smell after being stuck inside of sweaty shoes all day! Make sure the material you choose is breathable so your baby's foot won't get hot and uncomfortable (and stinky).Look for shoes made from soft leather, canvas, or another breathable material. Soft leather or cloth is best.
Avoid shoes made from stiff leather. Shoes that are too stiff can hinder the development of your baby’s feet.
If you choose high-tops or boots, make sure that they are still flexible around the ankles. You don’t want the shoes to restrict movement.
Avoid synthetic materials. While they may be light, they aren’t breathable.

, It’s important for your baby to try on the shoes you choose. Put the shoe on your baby’s foot and assess the situation. If the shoes are too small, your baby’s feet will be cramped, but shoes that are too big can cause tripping and you don’t want that. Learning to walk is hard enough already!Your baby’s toes should be close to the end of the shoes but they shouldn’t be crowded at the end.
When your baby stands up, there should be a tiny bit of room between your baby’s heel and the heel of the shoe.
There should be a thumbs-width between your baby’s big toe and the front of the shoe.

, If the shoe you choose is made from a softer fabric, put the shoe on your child’s foot and then try to pinch some of the material between your fingers. If you are unable to gather any material, the shoes are probably too tight. The shoe should have a little bit of wiggle room, but not too much.

, Baby shoes should never need to be “broken in.” Let your baby walk around in the shoes for a while when you are still in the store. Tripping or limping indicate discomfort. Does your baby move normally, or do the shoes seem to hinder movement? When you take the shoes off, look for any red spots or irritated areas on your baby’s feet. If you find any, you may want to try another pair.

, All babies grow at different rates, but their feet often grow really fast! Some babies may have growth spurts that will require new shoes sooner than you would think. Check your baby’s shoes often to make sure their toes aren’t squished and that there’s ample room for their little feet to grow."

Identify the boot shaft.,
Measure from the arch to the top of the shaft.,
Know a few common measurements.,
Also consider heel height.",How to Measure Boot Shaft1," The shaft of a boot refers to the portion of the boot that rises above your foot and over your calf.


When you only see a measurement for “boot shaft,” it is safe to assume that the measurement refers to the height of the shaft and not the circumference.;
, Place one end of a tape measure at the middle of the boot arch, directly above the boot sole. Extend the tape measure vertically along the outside of the boot until you reach the very top of the shaft. This length is your boot shaft height.Note that in the United States, boot shaft sizes are described in inches even when the shaft extends beyond a foot in height.
When a manufacturer lists the shaft height of a boot, the heel height is not usually included in that measurement. There is still some risk that some shops will include heel height as part of the shaft height, though, which can throw this measurement off completely. When buying a pair of boots you cannot measure yourself, try to verify whether or not heel height is left out of the shaft measurement.

, If you are not able to measure the boot, you can estimate how tall a boot shaft might be simply by noting the style of boot.


For a size 8.5 women's boot:Ankle boot shafts range between 3 and 8 inches (7.6 and 20.3 cm).
Mid-calf boot shafts range between 8.25 and 13.25 inches (21 and 33.7 cm).
Knee-high boot shafts can be 13.5 inches (34.3 cm) or taller.


Boot shaft estimations can vary depending on the size of the boot. A size smaller than 8.5 will have a slightly shorter shaft, while a larger size will have a slightly larger shaft. The change in shaft size is usually about equal to the change in foot length when you compare your size against an 8.5 sized boot.

, Typically, heel height is not included as part of the boot shaft height. Since this separate measurement does play a part in the overall height of the boot, though, it can still be worth knowing.


Measure the heel height by extending a tape measure from the bottom of the heel to the point at which it meets the sole of the boot. Place the tape measure against the center side of the heel as you measure.
Common heel heights based on heel type are:

Flat heels, with an average height between 0 and 0.75 inches (0 and 1.9 cm).
Low heels, with an average height between 1 and 1.75 inches (2.5 and 4.4 cm).
Mid heels, with an average height between 2 and 2.75 inches (5 and 7 cm).
High heels, with an average height at 3 inches (7.6 cm) or above.



"
"
Identify the widest part of the boot shaft.,
Measure around this part of the boot shaft.",How to Measure Boot Shaft2," Examine the boot and determine where the widest part of the shaft lies. More often than not, the widest part will be at the opening of the boot, but this is not always the case.


Note that boot shaft circumference is sometimes referred to as “circumference” or “calf circumference.”

, Place the end of a tape measure at a point along the widest part of the shaft. Wrap the rest of the tape measure around the shaft until it meets the starting end. Read the tape measure at the point of intersection to determine the shaft circumference.


Make sure that the tape measure is parallel to the ground the entire way around the shaft of the boot. If the tape measure is not even or straight, the measurement can get significantly thrown off.
As with shaft height, shaft circumference is often measured in inches when discussing boot sizes in the United States.

"
"
Sit with your foot flat.,
Measure up the back of your leg.,
Measure around your calf.,
Estimate an ideal boot shaft height.",How to Measure Boot Shaft3," Sit down comfortably with at least one foot flat against the floor. Your knee should be bent down at a 90 degree angle, making your leg perpendicular to the floor.You should also relax the muscles in your leg as you prepare to measure it.
This leg is the leg you will need to measure. The vast majority of people can get away with only measuring one leg, but if one of your legs is slightly shorter than the others, you may want to consider measuring each leg separately.
Your leg is straightest in this position which is why you need to keep it this way for both your calf height and circumference measurements.

, Place the end of a soft tape measure at the bottom of your heel. Extend the tape measure upwards, over the back of your leg, until it hits a point just below your kneecap.


You can then take this calf height measurement and compare it to the shaft height measurement of the boots you are looking at. Find the measured height of the boot on the tape measure as you have it pressed against your calf. This spot is the point at which the boot shaft will most likely land on your leg.

, Locate the widest part of your calf and place the end of a flexible tape measure there. Wrap the tape measure all the way around your calf until it intersects with this starting point, then take the measurement at this point of intersection.


If you want to be really precise, figure out where the top of the shaft will land on your calf using the shaft height measurement and measure the circumference of your calf at that point.
Compare your calf measurement to the shaft circumference of the boot. If the boot shaft circumference is smaller than the circumference of your calf, the boot will not fit well. If it is an exact match, the boot will fit but may feel a little too tight or snug. If the shaft is too much larger—usually 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or more—the boot may end up feeling too loose.
A boot shaft circumference can, however, be 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) smaller than your calf circumference if the material has enough elasticity to stretch over your calf.An ideal situation would be for your boot shaft circumference to be 0.25 to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) wider than your calf circumference.

, Beyond the basics of fit, your ideal boot shaft height is merely a matter of personal taste and preference. There are a few things worth keeping in mind when considering how high you would like a boot shaft to be, though.


If the shaft of a certain boot will end right at the crease of your knee, that boot is likely to pinch and rub your skin as you sit, making it uncomfortable.
If you have notably wide calves, the best options will usually be ankle boots and similarly short boots. The shaft of these boots will stop just above your ankle and below the widest part of your calf, creating a more relaxed fit.Your height can also determine an ideal boot shaft height. As a general rule, shorter legs look better with shorter shafts and longer legs look better with taller shafts. If you are petite, a shaft height taller than 14 inches (35.6 cm) may overwhelm your figure. If you are tall, a shaft height shorter than 15 inches (38.1 cm) may throw off the visual balance of your legs."

Try to fall with care.,
Find the broken piece or pieces.,
Take off both your shoes.,
Ask your host for help.,
Dash out and purchase a new pair.,
Deal with the embarrassment.,
Get a taxi home.,
Take a temporarily repaired heel to a professional shoe fixer for a decent fix.,
Carry a pair of folding ballet flats.",How to Cope when Your Shoe Heel Breaks," The moment you feel your heel snapping from underneath you, quickly reach out to try to grab hold of a sturdy piece of furniture, or railing, or a strong person if possible.


Most times it happens so quickly, you won't have much time to react, just fall!
Forget about trying to be graceful, just be safety conscious. The moment you realize you're falling, avoid anything that might hurt you as you fall. Try to relax rather than stiffen.
Be careful if you're grabbing someone; they might end up tumbling over with you!
If you feel a heel wobble at any time, check your shoe! You may just save yourself the pain of toppling over.
See How to Fall Safely for more tips.;
, If you can, retrieve the snapped heel or pieces of heel, in order to try to fix your shoe. It's advisable to always keep a tube of suitable, instant-drying, strong glue in your handbag if you're a regular wearer of high heeled shoes, just for such unexpected mishaps.


Sit down and examine the shoe. In some cases, it may be possible to simply reinsert the heel back into the holes or slots it has eased its way out from. Check the alignment of nails and any other pieces and reinsert as best you can. Ask for help from someone stronger if you can't manage it alone. Don't push too hard though, as this may snap the heel or pieces of it.
If you have instant dry glue on hand, try to mend it temporarily. Wipe off any dirt or dust, and carefully edge the heel back into place and glue back into place. Since glue takes time to strengthen (even instant glue), you'll need to be able to rest the shoe somewhere to dry for a short time, at least. Sit back and enjoy a drink or a chat with someone. When you wear a temporarily glued shoe again, try to keep the weight on the ball of your feet by leaning your foot forward, rather than leaning back on the heel. Take care if dancing though, as this will place a lot of pressure on the shoe.
If you can't mend the shoe, proceed to the next steps.

, If it is practical, safe and hygienic to do so, the easiest way to remedy the situation in the short term is to go barefoot. This will immediately even up your stance and restore your balance, as well as enabling you to move freely again.


Avoid removing shoes where there are hazards present such as broken glass, excessive heat or cold, unclean floors or pavements, potential for needle objects to be around (such as syringes in a toilet at a nightclub), or any other hazards. Don't forget the realities of other people treading or dancing onto your feet either!
Keep your socks on if you're worried about dirt or germs and doing so won't create a slipping hazard.

, Your host may be able to help you with an adhesive to reattach the heel temporarily, or even to provide you with a temporary pair of shoes. This will depend on where you are when the heel snaps, but don't be too shy to ask for help.

, Obviously, this option isn't open to you if you're deeply embedded in a posh dinner party or dancing away at 4am in the morning, but sometimes it might be possible for you to get away and purchase a ""this'll-do-for-now"" pair. Choose something cheap and basic, especially if you're in a hurry and likely to toss them away at the charity store afterward, and rush back to the event.


Late night stores might be open in the vicinity of where you are. Ask your host for advice.
Even a pair of cheap sneakers or sandshoes can often be purchased from all night supermarkets or drugstores; these can be good enough to get you home soundly!
Better still, find a ""repair-while-you-wait"" shoe repairer. You can have a laugh about what happened, catch up on a bit of news and return with your heel intact.

, A big part of the shock of a snapped heel comes with the feelings of embarrassment that you've taken a tumble and might have ended up in a pose that wasn't that flattering. Laugh it off – laughing at the situation is the absolute best way to deal with it and set everyone else's minds at ease. This shows everyone that you're not harmed and that you're happy to make light of it. Remember that if you really need to cheer yourself up, you can buy yourself a new pair!


Keep in mind that you falling to the ground is a concerning moment for your friends and an awkward and uncomfortable moment for everyone else. For a split second, nobody knows what is happening; for all they know, you could be having a heart attack or an aneurysm. Reassure people before laughing it off, to ease everyone's tension.
It isn't a pleasant experience but it shouldn't spoil the rest of the event if you're out partying, dancing, dining, etc. Continue enjoying yourself; after all, it's happened, you can't go back but you can move on and have a great time!
If you swap to wearing a spare shoe and it doesn't match your outfit – it doesn't matter. What matters is that you're comfortable and safe.

, If you were planning to walk home or catch public transportation, treat this as an emergency situation that requires you to go home in a safe way. A taxi can be called by your host, and you'll only need to hobble to and from the front doors and taxi.


See if someone you know can give you a lift home if you can't afford to take a taxi, or don't like catching one.

,


If the shoes are not worth the cost, buy a shoe repair kit for an at-home fix-it job.
If the shoes are worth it (expensive, sentimental value, etc.), the shoe repairer is the best option for long-term strength and reliability.

, This new product comes in a little drawstring bag, is compact and is now sold at drugstores and grocery stores. These can also come in handy if your shoes cause your feet to hurt and you want to keep dancing!

Try different sizing combinations until you find exactly what you love and feel most confident in. , There are many options for bikini tops available. Finding the right one depends on your style and body type. The most basic bikini top is the triangle top. This top is adjustable but does not offer a lot of support. The half cup, balconette, and plunge shaped tops are similar to bras and offer more support.

The extra support will make you feel more confident at the beach or pool. For even more support, you can get a top with underwire, including underwire straps. , If your bust is small, get a bikini top with ties that you can adjust. Having the ability to adjust your suit will help you get your bikini tight and close to your chest so it does not fall off. If you want a strapless top, choose one that has boning on the sides and removable padding to keep it from sliding off. , The Euro or normal bikini bottom is low on the hips and is the most common bikini choice. The Brazilian bikini bottom has half coverage on the back. Choose a thong bottom if you want no coverage on the back. You can opt for board shorts or skirted bottoms instead of traditional swimsuit bottoms for more coverage.
Get high waited bottoms if you do not want to show your belly button. Strings on the sides of the bottoms make your hips appear smaller., You can choose the color of your bikini based on your skin tone if you would like. Emeralds and pastels look good on light skin. Medium skin tones look best in bright colors and metallic. Dark skin tones look great with bold blues and reds. These are only suggestions.

Be aware that white bikinis can be see-through when they get wet.
Bright colors can make your skin look more tanned. , Bring a close and trusted friend or family member, like your mom or sister, to shop with you and to wait outside the dressing room for you. They can help you choose what looks best on you and get you a different size while you are changing. Having support can be great if the bikini shopping starts to get you down and you need encouragement. , You can take your bra off when trying on a swimsuit but make sure you keep your underwear on to avoid spreading and contracting any diseases. Wear a thin pair of underwear to the store to give you a better idea of what the bathing suit looks like without the underwear. , When you put the swimsuit top on, make sure any strings are tied tightly. Adjust the swimsuit so it is comfortable but won’t come off. Arrange your breasts by gently placing them toward the center of your torso. Check in the mirror to see if the top is too high on your back or sides and adjust the straps. The top should not puncher you but also should not be able to slip off. Try jumping up and down in the dressing room to see if the top stays in place.

, Put the bottoms on over your underwear. You want the bottoms to be a little snug because they expand about a half inch when they get wet. Slip two fingers between the bottoms and your skin. If two fingers don’t fit, the swimsuit is too tight. Extra room between your fingers and the suit means that it is too large. Your swimsuit will get even larger when it gets wet, so it is important the bottoms are not too big. , You will be able to see what the bikini looks like from all sides if you take pictures from a variety of angles and lighting. Take the photos yourself or have your friend take the photos for you. This will help you remember what the other bikinis you liked looked like on you when you are trying on different bikinis and going to different stores. , The size of swimsuits varies greatly from store to store.

, You will need to protect your hands from the chemicals and dye, so put on your gloves before you start mixing anything. Leave the gloves on throughout the entire dyeing process and then remove them after you have set out the bikini to dry.









You may also want to wear an apron or an old t-shirt to avoid damaging any of your good clothes.

, Prepare a solution of warm water and soda ash by mixing 1 cup of soda ash immerse your bikini in the solution.Let the bikini soak in the soda ash solution for about an hour.








The soda ash will prepare the bikini fabric for the dye, which will result in bright, bold colors.
If you prefer more of a pastel look, then you can skip the soda ash.
Wring out the bikini after it is done soaking., Tie dyeing can be messy and the dye may leave permanent stains on hard and soft surfaces, such as countertops, tables, and carpets. To protect the surfaces in your area, lay out a large trash bag, some layered newspaper, or a tarp.








Make sure that you have covered a large enough area to work on.

, Take the tie dye bottles provided with the kits and








It is important to shake the bottles well or else you may end up with inconsistent dye colors or even some black speckles on your tie dye items.

, If you want to create any custom colors to use on your bikini, then you can mix them in the empty spray bottles.For example, if you want to make a pinkish purple color, then you might add a little pink to some purple dye in one of these bottles.









Make sure that you mix the custom colors well.

, To create the tie dye pattern, you will need to section off fabric and secure the sections with rubber bands. You can section off the bikini fabric in as many areas as you like to create the pattern that you want.








Twist each section of material tightly before you secure it with a rubber band.
Make sure that you secure the rubber bands tightly as well.

, Use your dye and/or spray bottles to squirt the dye onto your secured segments. Apply the dye in the desired pattern.For example, you might use pink on one section, then green on the next section, and then yellow on the next section.









Make sure that you squeeze enough dye onto the sections to saturate the fabric through to the twisted layers. Otherwise, you may end up with undyed white spots on your bikini.Don’t forget to wear gloves on both of your hands to avoid staining your hands while you dye the bikini.

, When you have finished dyeing your bikini, remove the rubber bands. Then, lay your bikini outside in a dry, sunny place and allow it to dry for about four hours. This will help the dye set in.








Make sure that you lay the bikini out somewhere that will not be damaged if any dye leaks onto it. To be safe, you may want to leave the plastic garbage bag under it.

, After the bikini has dried, put it into a dryer without any other clothes. Run the dryer on high for about 20 minutes. This will help the dye set in even more. After the 20 minutes are up, your tie dye bikini is ready to wear!








You may want to wash the bikini before you wear it to remove any excess dye. Otherwise, the dye may run when you wear the bikini for the first time., Twisting the fabric starting in the center is one of the most classic ways to tie dye. Grab the fabric in the center (either of a bra cup or your bikini bottom) and then twist it tightly. Then, bundle the fabric with rubber bands so that they criss-cross each other.









The rubber bands and fabric segments should resemble pieces of a pie. Your end result will be a spiral design that starts in the center of your bikini bra cups and bottoms., You can create a wavy striped pattern on your bikini by folding your bikini before you dye it. Fold the material in narrow pleats and then place rubber bands about an inch or two apart to secure the folds in place. Use the rubber bands as your guide to apply the dye.








You can use as many colors and rubber bands as you want to create your unique fan fold design.

, You can also draw a heart over you tie dye after it is done drying. After you finish tie dyeing in your desired colors and the colors have set, take a bleach pen or a darker color dye and draw a heart somewhere on your bikini bottoms or bra top.








Try drawing a heart near your hip or on one corner of one of your bra cups.
You can also draw stars, initials, and other symbols on your bikini.

, You want to have a natural glow but you don't want to have cheese puff legs. If you choose to tan outside, put on SPF 25 sunscreen and take advantage of the outdoors, and do some exercise while tanning.

, Ten a day should be enough, but if you really need some toning, try ten crunches every 3 hours, if you can handle it! Don't do them directly after eating.

, Masks that include bananas, honey, yogurt, and/or avocado work well. Don't use anything that you might be allergic to. Wash your face correctly, and never apply too much makeup at a time. Exfoliate with sugar and cinnamon every night before bed to invigorate your skin, remove dead cells, and also, calm it down to improve circulation.

, Crest 3D White toothpaste is recommended for whitening teeth and removing harmful bacteria. Buy towels, a sexy bathing suit, vibrant beach bag, matching flip flops, glossy sunglasses, appropriate sunscreen, and anything else that you might need for the party. It's better to have it all on hand.

, RSVP. Call the host and let them know that you'll be there so that they can start preparing for your gorgeous presence.

, Start using lotion everyday. Jergens and Aveeno are the best. Vaseline/Petroleum Jelly is another intense moisturizer that can be used on elbows and knees, or any other particularly dry areas. They use natural ingredients and really revitalize your skin so that it glows and shimmers!

, Start eating healthy meals. Fruits and vegetables should start becoming a huge part of your meals, and you should also start doing more crunches, and maybe some dancing or other cardio. About 20 crunches every 3 hours, and two hours of light-medium cardio a day should do the trick! Also, try to drink as much water as you can, as it makes your hair and skin look healthier and gives it that natural glow. It also makes your hair grow longer faster.

, Get your nails done! You can do them at a salon if you can afford it, or at home if you're good at it. Pick colors that provide a good contrast to your skin color, and match your bathing suit and flip flops!

, This is the second most important day. You need to remove all unwanted hair, either by waxing, or shaving with a good lotion. Deep condition your hair with Suave, Tresemme or Biolage. Exfoliate with cinnamon, sugar and lemon juice. Wash thoroughly, and then go to bed about 10 hours before you have to be awake.

, Choose only healthy foods, such as a fruit smoothie for breakfast, and perhaps a healthy sandwich and orange juice for lunch. Don't apply too much makeup. You want to aim for that natural look.

, Put on your bathing suit, and then moisturize your skin. Apply some beach-like and preppy makeup, and then put on a cute little cover-up. If you're not into cover-ups try.


Short-shorts, a summer halter, and low wedge flip-flops.
A micro-mini (cotton or terry cloth), graphic tank top, flip flops.
A terry cloth mini dress, and flip flops!

, Pull it up into a messy bun, accessorize with a thin headband. Leave it down and natural, pull it back in a thick band, just find some style to make it look beach-like and natural! Remember, you're most likely going to go swimming so don't spend too much time on the details.

, When you get there, find your friends and enjoy your efforts!!

Adjust the cups.,
Adjust the straps.,
Take a walk around the room to check for slipping and discomfort.,
Consider removing hair around your bikini line.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Use a rich moisturizer.,
Don't forget your sunscreen.,
Take along a coverup.",How to Put on a Bikini," Bikinis are meant to bare a lot of skin, so go ahead and get undressed. Remove your bra and underwear, too. Don't attempt to wear your bikini over underwear, since it will be nearly impossible to keep your underwear from peeking out when you're active at the beach or pool.;
, Bikini bottoms usually provide the same amount of coverage as bikini-style underwear. The top edge of the bikini bottoms should sit along your hips, crossing over each hip bone below your belly button. In the back, they should hug your bottom tightly. Depending on the style you're wearing, they'll provide either full or partial cheek coverage.Your bikini bottoms should not sag or droop. If they feel loose, you need a smaller size.
They also shouldn't cut into your skin and cause bulging. If they do, try a size up.

, Put on the top as you would put on a bra, fastening the band around your chest first. It might help to put the top on backward so you can fasten the band in the front, then slide it around to position it correctly with the cups in the front.


If it's a string bikini, first tie a tight knot, then tie the ends in a bow. Tie it so that the bikini will stay in place, but not so tight that it cuts off your circulation.
If the band of your bikini top is loose enough to easily slip your hand through, either tie it tighter or go down a size. If it's so tight that you feel uncomfortable, go up a size.

, Rest your breasts right in the center of each cup, to keep them securely in place there. Make sure the fabric of the cups completely covers your breasts; if they feel tight, or your breasts and bulging out from the sides, you might want to go up a size. If they feel loose, try a size lower or choose a padded top. Here are the different types of bikini tops, and how to fasten them properly:


Triangle top: This style provides the least amount of support and coverage, and it works best for smaller breasts. Make sure your breasts are positioned in the centers of the triangles. If your top has sliding triangles, slide them over your breasts to make sure the fabric covers your breasts entirely.
Halter top: This style provides a more support, making it a good choice for bigger breasts. Position your breasts in the center of each cup, and stretch the cups around your breasts for maximum coverage.
Bandeau top: This style is strapless, so make sure you choose the right size so that your top won't slide up or down. Adjust the top so that your breasts fit into the center of the cups. It should hug your chest quite firmly; if it sags or droops, you may need to go down a size or choose a different style top.
Underwire top: This style is similar to a bra, and fits much the same way. Position the underwires so that they sit right beneath your breasts, then lower your breasts into the cups.

, It's important to adjust the straps so that they keep your bikini top secure and provide support for your breasts. You want the straps to be tight enough to hold your bikini top in place, but not so tight that they dig into your shoulders. Your bikini top should feel as comfortable as a bra.Adjust bra-style bikini straps just as you would regular bra straps. Use the plastic slides on the straps to loosen or tighten them.
If the straps are strings you need to tie, it might take a few tries before you're able to tie the knots just right. They should be tight enough to provide support for your breasts, but not so tight they cut into your shoulders. Tie the ends of the strings into bows.
Some bikini tops are styled as halters, with two strings that are tied right at the nape of your neck. Again, make sure you tie the strings tight enough to support your breasts without being uncomfortable.
If you find that you aren't able to adjust the straps in a way that allows your breasts to be well-supported without causing pain in your shoulders or neck, you may need a different style top. Try a traditional bra-style top with an underwire for maximum support.

, Try skipping and jumping, too. You're going to be having fun in the sun, and you don't want to have to worry about your breasts coming loose or your bikini bottoms slipping down. Make adjustments where necessary so you can wear your bikini confidently all day long.

, It might help you feel more confident to know that no hairs will poke out from your bikini bottoms as you're laying out in the sun or swimming in your bikini. Trimming and shaving is a popular way to do it, since it's inexpensive and not painful. You can also consider waxing the area if you plan ahead.


To figure out what hair to remove, put on your bikini bottoms and check out the hair that pokes out around the edges. You want to remove enough hair so that your bottoms adequately cover everything that's left.
Some people also like to remove leg and armpit hair to feel bikini ready.

, Since wearing a bikini involves showing off your skin, you might want to baby it a little a day or two before it's time to hit the beach or pool. In the bath or shower, use a loofah or exfoliating scrub to exfoliate your arms, legs and everything in between. This will get rid of dry skin and give you a healthy glow.


Use gentle circular motions to exfoliate your skin, rather than scrubbing too hard.
Don't forget your back and other hard to reach areas. Use a scrub brush to get to the places you can't easily reach.

, After exfoliating, apply your favorite moisturizing lotion to protect your skin from drying out. Your skin will be soft and gleaming when it's time to put on your bikini. As an alternative to moisturizer, try coconut or olive oil to soften your skin., Wearing a bikini means using a lot of sunscreen, since most of your body will be exposed to the sun's rays. Apply sunscreen with SPF 16 or higher five to ten minutes before going out into the sun, and reapply as necessary throughout the day. Wearing plenty of sunscreen will prevent you from ending up with a painful burn and provide protection against sun spots and skin cancer.Try waterproof sunscreen if you're going to be swimming. You'll still need to reapply it more than once throughout the day.
If you're trying to get a tan, you should still wear sunscreen. Sunscreen prevents you from getting burned, but it doesn't completely stop the sun from affecting your skin. It's much better to get a gradual tan than to get burned first.

, You may not feel like being exposed to the sun and other elements the entire time you're at the beach or pool. Bring along a cute coverup you can throw over your bikini whenever you want. As a bonus, it will protect your skin from the sun, so you won't have to worry about slathering your entire body in sunscreen when you wear it.

This will be the length measurement used for your top.Use a cloth tape measure and measure from armpit to armpit, directly over your breasts. Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground.
The amount you subtract from this measurement should only vary based on how tight you want the top to be. For a tighter top, subtract 4 inches (10 cm). For a more comfortable fit, subtract 2 inches (5 cm).;
, Use a ruler the draw a rectangle on your material with a length that matches your previously calculated length dimension. Draw a 5 to 7 inch (12.7 to 18 cm) perpendicular line on each end of this length dimension, then complete the rectangle by drawing in the fourth side.


The width of your rectangle will need to vary depending on the size of your chest and how much coverage you want. If you have a larger bust size, more width will give you better coverage.

, Use sharp scissors to cut out the rectangle previously measured. Make sure that your cuts are as straight and clean as possible.


This piece will be used for the outer portion of your top.

, Lightly sketch the same dimensions used for your main rectangle onto your lining material. Then, sketch out a dip in the center, and draw diagonal lines from each corner connecting to this dip. Cut the shape out when done.


Measure out the exact center of your rectangle's length. The dip should be placed there.
Draw a vertical line in the center roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Make the line shorter for a more dramatic dip or longer for a less obvious one.
Draw diagonal lines from the top corners to the top of your middle line and diagonal lines from the bottom corners to the bottom of your middle line.

, Sketch out two rectangles from your main material, each measuring 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and matching the length of your fabric. Cut out as cleanly as possible.


Taper the ends, if desired, or leave the ends in a blunt square cut.

, Draw a two marks near the middle length of each strap. The marks should be spaced apart by the amount of space making up the width of your main piece.


Note that these marks indicate the positions at which you will sew the straps to the top.

, Mark the exact center of your rectangular front piece from the back. Hand sew a gathering stitch along this center line.


Thread your needle and knot the end.
Sew a long straight stitch down the line, bringing the knot flush against the fabric.
From the unknotted end, push the fabric back on the thread, moving it toward the knot, so that the fabric gathers. Continue gathering the thread until the center of your top matches the center of your lining in width.
Tie the second end off to secure the gather in place.
Note that you may also want to sew over your gathers using a standard stitch several times to reinforce the design.

, Use pre-made pads or cups and sew them onto the wrong side of the lining. Pin the pads onto your lining from the wrong side, with any curved portion face-up. Sew the pads to the lining using a 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) zig-zag stitch.


Position the cups so that the are centered on either side of the lining. They should not extend into the center of the lining or overlap with one another.
Make sure that the cups or pads you use fit your chest.

, Match together the lining to the main piece of your top, with the right sides facing together. When the sides appear even, pin, then sew in place with a machine straight stitch or a hand sewn backstitch.


At this point, you only need to sew along the top and bottom edges. Do not sew the sides.

, Pull the top through one of the openings left on either side so that the right sides of your lining and main piece both face out.

, Fold the right sides together lengthwise so that both strips of material are inside out. Pin in place.

, Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew a zig-zag stitch down the side of each strap. Do not sew the ends, and leave a gap in between the marks you made on each strap.


Turn right side out when done.

, Wedge the sides of your top into the gaps left in your straps. Pin the pieces together, then sew them in place.


To make the straps look as neat as possible, sew the back of the strap down first. Once the straps are secure, fold the top of the strap down and make a neat top stitch over the front.

, Tie the tops of your straps together behind your neck and the bottoms together behind your upper back. This completes this half of your bikini.

, Pin in place, then trace the outline.


If your old bottoms do not open up at the sides, you may need to snip them open with a pair of scissors.
If you do not have an old pair of bottoms, you could use an old pair of panties that you don't mind sacrificing. Make sure that they fit well and that they cover as much skin as you want your bikini bottoms to cover.

, Place the open bikini bottom on your lining fabric and trace around the outline there, as well.

, Lightly sketch out a seam allowance around the outline you created on your outer fabric. This seam allowance should be 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch (0.635 cm to 1.27 cm) wide.


Do not repeat this step with the lining. The outer piece of fabric should be a little bigger than your swimsuit lining.

, Use sharp sewing scissors to cut out both pieces from the outer fabric and lining. Make your cuts as clean and even as possible.

, Pin in place, then machine sew a straight stitch down the center of your open bottoms.


The center here refers to the portion of material that will eventually lie between your legs and become the bottom of your bikini.
Make sure that the seam allowance is the same around all sides when you pin the pieces together.

, Fold the seam allowance of the outer fabric over the lining piece around all edges. Pin it in place.

, Use a zig-zag stitch or straight stitch to sew both long sides together. Leave the shorter sides, which will eventually go around your waist, open.


Stretch the fabric and lining as much as possible when sewing the pieces together, especially if using the straight stitch.
Turn the material right-side-out when done.

, Fold the bottoms in half crosswise, bringing the waist portions together. Stitch up both sides with a zig-zag stitch, using a 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) seam allowance on either side.


When you sew the sides together, make sure that the bottoms are lining-side-out.

, Fold the top down so that the seam allowance of the outer material completely covers the lining. Pin in place, then sew with a zig-zag stitch or straight stitch.


Again, keep the material and lining as stretched as possible, especially when using a straight stitch.
If you want a shorter waist, you can make the hem larger than the seam allowance calls for.
Flip the bottoms when you finish sewing so that the outer fabric faces out again.

, You should be able to slip them on over your legs. With the completion of this step, your new bikini bottoms—and your bikini overall—are now finished.

Create curves for a narrow body.,
Find a suit with proper coverage.",How to Look Good in a Bikini2," Bikinis come in many different colors, patterns, styles, and cuts that all serve to flatter the body differently. If you're not comfortable with a certain fit, don't be afraid to ask a sales associate to help you find the right size and style for your body type. Try not to concentrate on the tag size, as sizes differ from brand to brand and style to style. Keep in mind, mixing and matching bikini tops and bottoms can help you find the best look., Every woman is made differently, and this means you have to figure out what your body needs from a suit to look its best. Finding a bikini top that is supportive, and will be flattering, is key to looking great in a bikini. Here are some tips to follow:


If you are small on top, try tops that have padding or an underwire to accentuate what you do have. You should also look for adjustable straps around the back and shoulders so that you can tighten the top appropriately. Ruffle tops, tri-tops, or bandeau tops are also recommended for you.If you are bigger on top and need extra support, be sure to look for tops that have underwire and wide should straps. These will fit more comfortably than thinner spaghetti straps. Halter tops may be flattering on you as they highlight cleavage. Stay away from strapless bandeau tops and tri-tops.If you have wider shoulders, try to balance out your look by playing up the bottom and keeping the top subtle. Wear bright colors, fun prints, and embellishments on your bikini bottom, and look for a top that has wider shoulder straps., Fortunately, bikini bottoms come in many different cuts and styles that can flatter your unique body type. Whether you want to lengthen your legs or add dimension, there is a style for you. Here are some tips to follow:


If you have shorter legs or a shorter torso, find a suit that will elongate you. Try a suit that is cut high on the thigh, which is meant to make legs appear longer. This look works on curvy hips and straight hips. Vertical stripes can also help to visually lengthen the body.If you have a longer body with even longer legs, try suits that have embellishments at the hips and bust. Swimsuits that come with jewels, ruffles, ties, and bows help add dimension to fill you out. Find patterns that have horizontal lines instead of vertical, and look for bright colors., If you lack curves on the top or bottom, find a suit that creates some. High-waisted bottoms, bikinis with ruffles and bows, and strapless suits are a great look for you. Try wearing a solid color on the bottom with a fun printed or embellished top to create the illusion of an hourglass figure. Stay away from wearing the same solid-color on the top and bottom and don't wear vertical lines., If you are big on the bottom, try a mini-skirt bikini bottom for great coverage. If you want to wear ruffles or bows, save that for the bikini top. Look for bottoms that are smooth and will not add volume to your bottom half. Also, stay away from loud prints and bright colors."

Moisturize your skin.,
Apply a spray tan.,
Wear a bikini cover-up.,
Accessorize with a hat.,
Create the look of a slimmer waist.",How to Look Good in a Bikini3," Lotion can help revitalize and moisturize dry patches to make your skin look vibrant. Apply a body lotion from your shoulders down to your toes before you put your bikini on. Make sure you rub the lotion all the way into your skin using gentle, circular motions.

, This is a great way to make you look thinner, and cover up any bruises or blemishes. Simply head to your nearest drug store to pick up a spray tan product. To apply, exfoliate your skin with a wash cloth, and then rub or spray on the tanner. Be sure to follow the directions on the package for proper application.If you do not want to give yourself a spray tan, try going to a professional. Most tanning salons offer spray tan services. Keep in mind, they can be expensive.

, A great way to feel more confident, and add style to your bikini look is to wear a cover-up. These come in a variety of styles, such as a cotton jersey halter, a fringe wrap skirt, or a lace kimono. They are the perfect thing to wear when you are not swimming, but just hanging out near the water because they allow you coverage without having to get completely dressed.

, Sun hats are a great way to protect your skin and look super chic. Try looking for a straw hat to match your bikini vibe. Regardless of what some may think, everyone can pull of a sun hat, especially when it is being worn with a bikini., One way to slim down your waist is to lift the breasts by either wearing a bikini top that has supportive underwire, or by using waterproof medical tape. To use the medical tape, start with the tape under the arm, and bring it inward, pulling the tape so that it lifts your breasts and pushes up your cleavage. You will want to use about three pieces of tape on each side for a secure hold."
"
Give yourself a compliment before you head out.,
Stand up straight.,
Remember that people are focused on themselves.",How to Look Good in a Bikini4," It is best to be in a positive mental state before you leave your house in your bikini so when you arrive to your destination, you are ready to have fun. Hiding in a corner, walking around slouched over, or deciding that you can't reveal yourself in your bikini after all will only keep you from having the great time you deserve. Before you leave the house, look in a mirror, and try saying the following:""I look great in my bikini, and I am going to have fun today!""
""I am a very attractive woman and I deserve to feel good about myself.""

, Having proper posture creates flattering lines that will help you look more confident. Simply pull your shoulders back and bring your head up, to look leaner and taller. Imagine your navel being pulled up into your spine to help you pull in your abdomen. Try to remind yourself throughout the day to keep correcting your posture if you find yourself starting to slouch.Even when you are sitting down, you should be practicing proper posture by sitting with a straight back, your shoulders pulled-back, and your chin up.

, If you are among others in a swimsuit, chances are they are way more concerned about their body than they are yours. Most women have concerns about their bodies and appearance just like you do, and they are also probably looking for ways to look and feel their best in a bikini. If you can let go of your insecurities, and just have a good time, your positive vibes may rub off on those around you to create a more positive atmosphere.


When you arrive to your event or gathering, focus on everything except your bikini. Think about the friends you are there to meet and laugh with, the relaxation you want to achieve, or the new memories you are going to create. Concerns about the way you look in a bikini should be at the bottom of your list of things to think about.

Find your body type.,
Get rid of any unwanted hair.,
Find the right shop for you.,
Choose colors and fabrics that highlights, hides, and slims your least liked parts.,
Try to get a swimsuit that not only has the right color and fabric, but the right cut or type of swimsuit.,
Buy the right swimsuit for the right job.,
Have fun in or by the water!

",How to Look Great in a Swimsuit," A way to do this would be to visit www.calculator.net (Weight loss, very bottom, Body Type Calculator.), if you're able to measure your bust, waist, and hip sizes. If not:


The following are the four most common female body shapes:
Apple (triangle downward) Apple-shaped women have broader shoulders and bust, and narrower hips.
Banana, or straight (rectangular) Banana-shaped women's waist measurement is less than 9 inches (22.9 cm) smaller than the hip or bust measurement.
Pear, Spoon, or Bell (triangle upward) Pear-shaped women's hip measurements are greater than their bust measurements.
Hourglass Shape (triangles opposing, facing in) Here, the hip and bust are almost of equal size, with a narrow waist.
A study of more than 6,000 women conducted at North Carolina State University in 2005 revealed that 46% of women were banana-shaped; just over 20% were pear-shaped; just under 14% were apple-shaped; and only 8% were hourglass-shaped. The hourglass is normally accepted as the ""ideal"" female shape in Western countries.;
, This step is optional, but if somebody else if helping you and giving you their opinions, or if you're going swimming afterwards, you should shave.

,


Try to avoid shopping online, even if it's the cutest thing ever, unless if you KNOW it will fit you.
It's better for you to go to Kohl's or Walmart, as those places have sales often, low prices, and swimwear or poolside glamour and swimming.
For surfboarding, lifeguard suits, or anything else like that, you should go to a swimwear shop or sporting shop (that sells swimwear,) as Walmart and Kohl's wouldn't be a great place for that.
If you need a swimsuit with padding in the chest area, Walmart has many swimsuits for great prices. They have push up padding, to regular padding, to light padding, to heavy padding (Which I personally do not recommend, as in my eyes, It looks like a big bra, but don't be afraid to try it!).

,


To highlight a feature you like, use a bright color or pattern.
To hide something you don't like, use a solid color.
If you have pale skin, use black or deep jewel tones, such as dark purple, navy, and maroon.
If you have dark skin, bright colors can actually be more flattering and help hide what you don't like.
To add volume (such as to the bust or hips), choose a piece with ruffles in that area.
To hide volume (such as on the waist), use shirred or ruched fabric.
Don't be afraid to buy separates that don't match perfectly! Say you want to highlight your bust but draw attention away from your hips. You might buy a bikini top in a bright solid or pattern, and a bottom that's a dark black, blue or brown (depending on the top).

,


A one-piece will hide your waist. Choose one with shirred panels over the stomach, or in a dark, solid color.
A 1940s-style, bathing-beauty bottom that's high-waisted can also help hide a waist. Again, go with a dark color or shirring.
A tankini will highlight your waist, because it draws the eye to the section of skin that's showing. If you love your waist but not so much your hips or bust, choose this.
Boy shorts make your hips look wider, regardless of color. If you have a large bust and want the hips to match for a classic hourglass shape, choose boy shorts. However, be aware that this style can feel uncomfortable for some women, so be certain of fit before you purchase anything.
High-cut bikini bottoms make legs look longer. If you're short, or you're long in the torso, this is a good selection.
Halter tops draw attention to the bust, as do triangle tops.
Tie-front bikini tops draw the eye to the bust, as well as pulling the breasts closer to one another, effectively making them look larger. If you have small breasts and want them to look larger, this might be a good fit.
Bandeau tops will make the bust seem wider. If you're a pear shape and you want to imitate an hourglass shape, choose a bandeau top with ruffles or another busy detail.
For a large bust, look for a straight across cut at the top of your swimsuit with wide set straps to minimize your bust. Try a bikini top with an underwear and a thick chest band for extra support. A thick chest band will prevent jiggling so that the bra stays where it should be and you can't fall out.

, It's pointless buying a string bikini if you plan on swimming laps or surfing; it'll be floating off in no time, embarrassing you no end.


Bikinis are fairly limited in terms of active workouts in a pool or the sea, but a more solid tankini would hang in there no problems. Sports swimsuits often have added features to help with support, streamlining and comfort, so check them out if you're planning on doing more than keeping cool by the pool.
Most lifeguard work requires a one piece swimsuit in a plain color, perhaps the color of your lifesaving crew. You might also need to add shorts or a wet suit to complete the uniform.
One piece swimsuits can be very sexy, especially when you choose nice colors and a flattering fit for your body.

Indulge in accessories.,
Try out different swimsuit coverups.",How to Feel Confident in a Bathing Suit1," This means try on lots and lots of swimsuits until you find the bathing suit that’s exactly the right match for your body - no matter what it might be. It should be the right size for you - no cutting straps or pinching elastic. But it’s also about finding a suit that fits your personality.Pick out the cuts and colors that make you feel most confident, and don’t worry about what’s the current trend or fashion.
Mix and match with tankini suits, bikini tops and surfer bottoms, or any other combination that makes you feel happy about yourself.
If you've got larger breasts, you may want to find a suit with underwire support. These suits are generally sized by cup size, like your bra.
Sales clerks in lingerie departments and upper-end sales departments can often help you determine the best size swimsuit for you.;
, You can often find a wider selection of suits online than in your local stores, and online stores usually allow you to return clothing that doesn't fit as long as you've not worn it. Good retailers often encourage you to call and chat, or instant message with any questions.#*Start by taking your measurements, and then carefully compare them to the measurements shown in the online sizing.


It's a good idea to order two sizes of each suit you're ordering, so that you can select the one that fits you best.
Ordering online allows you to try on the suit in ordinary lighting, the way you'll actually be seen in it. Try them on when you're in a good mood, feeling confident, and in the privacy of your own home.
Move around in your suit before you buy it. After all, you want it to stay in place when you're actually wearing it.

, If you're purchasing a bathing suit for lounging about the side of a pool, you might choose a string bikini or bandeau top that shows off your cleavage. But if you're planning on swimming laps at the gym, or wearing your bathing suit to dive in the surf with your friends, you might need something a little more secure.


Remember that swimsuits will expand in the water, so you might want to pick a suit that's a little tighter than you'd like if you're planning to get it wet.

, Maybe you have great collarbones, or you’re really proud of your muscular arms. Whatever you love about your body, you can find a bathing suit that’s made to flatter it.Vintage swimwear, for instance, often shows off a lot of cleavage while being cut low on the hip.
If you’re proud of your legs, try a suit with high-cut thighs. Racer-back bathing suits will show off your strong arms.

, Wearing scarfs, sunglasses, broad-brimmed sun hats, colorful earrings or a new pair of wedge heels will help you bring your most glamorous self to the beach. If you’re feeling less than confident in your swimsuit, accessories might be what you need to feel great about yourself again.You’ll want to be realistic when accessorizing with your swimsuit.

Don’t forget the lipstick! Not only does lipstick help you feel more confident, it usually protects your lips against UVA rays.

, You can have fun accessorizing with swimsuit cover-ups that will allow you to feel more confident in your bathing suit. You can find cover-ups that really bring out the parts of your body you might feel proud of, while hiding the parts you’re not quite comfortable with.If you don’t like showing your hips and thighs, for example, try wearing a colorful sarong wrap around your waist.
Sundresses or caftans that slip on over bikinis will flatter almost every body, and prevent you from getting sunburned as well.

Learn to love your own body.,
Smile.,
Don’t spend time with complainers.,
Use mindfulness to increase self-esteem.,
Practice vulnerability.,
Notice how you look at others.",How to Feel Confident in a Bathing Suit2," Focusing on what you need to improve before you’ll allow yourself to feel confident is a losing game. Once you realize that your body is perfect, just the way it is, you’ll feel a lot better about putting on any kind of bathing suit.It will help to remember that you’re probably the only one focussing on your perceived flaws. Other people are more aware of whether or not you’re having fun, or appear to be down in the dumps.
If you find yourself thinking negative thoughts, force your attention onto something positive. For example, follow the negative thought, “I hate how large my thighs are,” with the positive twist, “but my collarbones are gorgeous.”

, The simple act of smiling communicates self-confidence and friendliness. When you smile, people are more likely to smile back at you. You’ll likely return the smile, and feel more confident.When you’re smiling, your voice will sound friendlier and more pleasant to listen to.Smiling releases endorphins, which bring about good feelings and greater confidence.
Laughing is good for your body as well. It stretches your muscles, and helps your release tension.

, If your friends are always complaining about their own bodies, chances are you’ll be tempted to join in with them. This won’t do your confidence any favors. Instead, make an effort to hang out with friends who are proud of who they are. Confidence is contagious!Remember, the more you complain about your own perceived flaws, the more you’re likely to start to believe they’re real.
If your friends start criticizing their bodies, disengage. Change the subject, laugh it off, and don’t allow yourself to start the cycle of complaining.

, Set the timer for 5-10 minutes, and take that time to meditate on self-compassionate loving thoughts. Deciding to refrain from negative self-judgment is a discipline that needs to be actively practiced and honed over time.An example of a positive meditation that you can focus on might be: “I am loved,” or simply the word “love”.
Concentrate on the feeling of your breath. If you start to notice self-judgments entering your consciousness, let them go.

, Try wearing clothing that draws attention, such as animal prints, bright colors, or revealing necklines. If you pay attention to how you feel when you wear these “forbidden” clothes, you’ll build courage slowly over time.Wearing clothing that feels revealing to you, like short skirts or low-cut tops, is a way to get used to feeling brave about your clothing choices.
It may seem hard at first, but gradually you’ll come to realize that you deserve to be noticed and to be seen.

, If you find yourself being hyper-critical of others, chances are you’re being too hard on yourself as well. Instead, try focusing on what you admire about others in their swimsuits. Practice turning your negativity in a new, positive, direction.Try to avoid using this as an opportunity for comparison with yourself. Your goal is to improve your overall kindness, so that you’re more likely to be kind to yourself.
This is a way to realize that no 2 bodies are exactly the same: everyone’s body is differently beautiful. This includes your own!

Avoid crash diets.,
Don't skip meals.,
Include moderate exercise daily.,
Eat healthily.,
Stand up straight.",How to Feel Confident in a Bathing Suit3," Crash diets usually involve severely restricting your caloric intake for a period of time, with the goal of losing a lot of weight quickly. Sometimes the 500 or 1000 calories-per-day are supplemented with juice ""cleanses,"" diet pills, or diuretics. While the diet might seem to be working at first, most of this weight loss is due to water loss. Meanwhile, your body's metabolism is actually slowing down, burning fewer calories.You won't be able to get a healthy nutritional balance for most crash diets.
Crash diets also have a negative consequence on your mental health. Not getting enough calories is likely to make you irritable, tired, and lethargic.
You're unlikely to feel more confident when you're not getting the daily nutrition you need.

, Skipping meals increases the amount of fat stored around the midsection, or belly fat. Eating smaller meals throughout the day, rather than skipping meals, is more likely to result in weight loss, according to clinical research.Skipping one meals leads to being hungrier for later meals, and can result in eating more calories later in the day. This can set off a cycle of overeating, followed by fasting, that can lead to a host of health concerns.
Going for extended periods of time without eating will send your body into survival mode: your body will turn to muscle mass for fuel in order to preserve its fat supplies. Clearly, this is the opposite of what you'd like as you prepare for bathing suit season!

, If you're trying to lose weight to gain confidence in your swimsuit, remember that both diet and exercise have a part to play. Each week, aim for at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) of vigorous activity, or a combination of the two.


For teens, the amount of exercise recommended is about an hour per day.
Choose exercise routines that you can sustain over time, which means doing activities that you like., finding the mix that works best for your body will lead to feelings of confidence, whether it's biking, jogging, swimming, biking, dance classes, or a combination.
Include muscle-strengthening activities on at least 2 days per week. Muscle-strengthening activities include weight lifting, resistance training, sit-ups and push-ups, and many yoga classes.

, A healthy diet includes plenty of vegetables and fruits, a good amount whole grains. Make sure to include lean meats and other proteins, such as fish, beans, eggs and nuts. Avoid trans fats and saturated fats, but include small portions of healthy fats from vegetable oils, made from olive, sunflower, peanut, canola, and others.Avoid drinking sugary drinks, including sodas, energy drinks, sweetened coffee drinks. Limit juice to one serving a day.
Alcoholic beverages, including wine, beer, and liquor, are high in sugar content as well. Limit your drinks to one per day if you're trying to lose weight.

, Acting confident on the outside will often result in the feelings of confidence inside. In addition, when you sit or stand straight, you’ll improve your blood flow to the brain. You’ll receive more oxygen, which will result in sharper attention and you’ll feel more energetic.Check and see how you are holding your hands. Hands held with palms facing outward are a sign of insecurity.
Poor posture, or slouching, presents an impression of poor self-confidence and insecurity. It also makes your muscles work harder, since they’re being held in an unnatural position, and can result in health difficulties over time.

If you are a woman that has a good looking breasts, then maybe a small micro top or a standard top that is sheer will fit the bill.

, Once you have determined which parts of your body are acceptable to present to the world, making the choice of which type of suit to wear should be much easier.

Wear at home.,
Find indoor locations where it's still sizzling.,
Go for a trip!",How to Find Locations to Wear Bikini when Summer Time Is Over," One of the most natural locations to sport sexy swimwear is around your own home. You can adjust the temperature yourself to whatever is comfortable when you and your friends lounge around wearing sexy beachwear. Who says you have to necessarily be in water to walk around in swimwear engaging in great conversations and light foreplay? Plus, what better way to keep the romance alive in your relationship than treating your mate to a private showing of you wearing a hot bikini. It's private and there's no telling the kinds of creative activities you can dream up when romping around on the sofa or bed for that matter.;
, When it's time for others to be jealous and adore you in your sexy bikini, there are plenty of spots to hit when the weather turns cool and crisp. If you want to remain local, check out an indoor spa. Indoor spas are a dime a dozen in any small or large town. They're clean, safe and filled with plenty of people who love being in warm climate all year round. Just like you, they want to display their latest swimwear fashion along with their slim bodies. You can make new friends who have much in common with you plus feel secure knowing you're not the only one who enjoys being on cloud nine twelve months out of the year. The best thing about indoor spas is that you can be in the North Pole and walk around in them like you're in Mexico.

, If you're looking for out of the way locations during these cooling months, consider a cruise. Most of the ports they depart from are tropical all year round so you can enjoy time on the boat and the island sights. This time of the year, they're practically giving tickets away so you don't need to plan to far ahead. A spontaneous trip is always an extravagant self treat. The cruise lines pride themselves on having the most upstanding indoor spas and swimming facilities. You can lay around all day long in your alluring and tempting bikini not even knowing or caring what the real temperature outside is. Even better is since most ports are warm weathered, taking a walk out on deck in your skimpy swimwear isn't a problem either. More importantly, since cruises are about a week long, you'll need to have at least a new bikini to wear for every day to show off your fantastic work of art. For more adventure, of course, you can always book a flight to Hawaii or any town in South America where it's mostly hot all year round. But the moral of the story is no matter what the weather is outdoors, you can still achieve grandiose status wearing a tiny bikini basically anywhere and anytime you want."

Instructions.,
Stain Removers.,
Don't mix different stain removal products together.,
Water Temperature.,
Detergents.,
Alcohol Stains: Launder with detergent in hottest water safest for the fabric.,
Chocolate Stains: Treat the stain with a pre-wash spray or product containing enzymes.,
Coffee & Tea Stains: Saturate the stain with a pre-treatment stain remover.,
Blood Stains: Flush cold water through the stain and scrape off crusted material.,
Rinse with cool water.

,
Lipstick or Juice Stains (AKA: Dye Stains): Sponge area with dry-cleaning solvent.,
Drying.",How to Care for Your Micro Bikini," Read and carefully follow any fabric care instructions that come with or are listed on your bikini wear. You don't want to ruin it and use something that's going to make the color fade or stain even more. Determine if you are going to hand wash or machine wash your bikini wear. Take in consideration the fabric, texture and ornaments, if any, that may be affected. Of course, hand washing delicates is the safest way of handling such items, although if you are confident that your fabric can withstand a washing machine, then going that way may be plausible.;
, Treat stains as soon as possible. Newer stains are easier to remove than older ones. Always test stain removers on an inside seam or hidden part of the garment for color fast issues. Never put chemical dry-cleaning solvents into the washer.

, Some mixtures such as ammonia and bleach can discolor your swimwear. Always launder the washable items after using a stain remover to eliminate the residue of the product. Have patience, some stains take longer time to remove and multiple applications. Along with stain removers are pre-stain removers and they come in either liquid, stick or spray formula. Pay close attention to the type of fabric and read the instructions on the individual product for finding out which will work best for you.

, Always use the safest water temperature for your fabric unless you have tested it and it bleeds. In that case, either use lukewarm water or cold water. Make sure the water is clean and sometimes you can add a pre-soaking agent to the water that you are going to hand wash your fabric in to aid cleaning. Refer to the Party Stains List below to select the proper water temperature with regard to a specific stain you would like to remove.

, There are all purpose detergents that come in either liquid or powder form. Some are heavy-duty and some are fabric sensitive and/or hypoallergenic. It's up to you to determine which is better fitted for you and your fabric. Again, pay attention to the fabric and ornaments on it. You want a detergent that will liquefy quickly enough so your bikini doesn't have to sit a long time in the solution. Here are some tips on removing specific stains when choosing your detergent and water temperature.

, Do not use soap (bar, flake or detergents containing natural soap) since soap can make the stain permanent. Soak stains for 30 minutes in 1 teaspoonful of presoak product. If all the sugars are not removed, a brown stain will appear when the fabric is heated in the dryer or is ironed, as the sugar has caramelized.

, After pre-treating, then rub with a heavy-duty liquid detergent and launder. If the stain remains, then re-launder with bleach that is safe for the fabric.

, Rub it with a heavy-duty liquid detergent then launder in hottest water safe for the fabric.

, Soak for about 15 minutes in a mixture of lukewarm water, 1/2 teaspoon liquid hand washing detergent and 1 tablespoon ammonia. Rub gently to loosen the stain and then launder. If the stain is not completely removed, wet the stain with hydrogen peroxide and a few drops of ammonia and leave on for no longer than 15 minutes.

,, Rub with heavy-duty liquid detergent then launder. If needed, use an all-fabric bleach.

, If you're the old fashioned type, then nothing works better than hanging something out to dry in the natural breeze. Although if you have no time for that, then using a cool to warm temperature when drying out your special fabric will be sufficient enough to keep it looking nice and new. Be wary of any kind of trinkets or beads that could easily be caught and torn from your swimwear.

Avoid chlorine.,
Steer clear of rough surfaces.,
Avoid getting excess lotions and oils on your swimwear.,
Rinse your swimwear in cold water after each wear.,
Hand wash your swimwear.,
Treat stains directly with spot cleaner.,
Gently squeeze out the water.,
Lay the swimsuit out to dry.,
Store the swimsuit at room temperature.,
Avoid plastic bags and similar restrictive spaces.,
Rotate suits.",How to Care for Swimwear," Chlorine is a caustic element in bleach that kills germs but can cause colours to fade in certain fabrics and damages threads. Although pool water has less chlorine than laundry bleach, it will still wear away at the integrity of your suit.


If you have a home pool, brush up on proper management. The Centers for Disease Control recommend a concentration of at least 1 ppm in pools and 3 ppm in hot tubs at a 7.2 - 7.8 pH with constant cleaning. Not only does this keep your swimwear healthy, but it keeps you healthy as well.In someone else’s pool, you may ask the host or hotel staff questions about upkeep, such as chlorine level measurements. Different factors affect the level, and improper treatment can mean more wear and tear on your swimwear.
Search for alternatives. Your neighborhood may have non-chlorinated pools, or you can choose to treat your own pool with an alternative such as saline. On vacation, choose the ocean or other water sources.;
, As with any clothing, rough or jagged edges snag and abrade. Be aware of where you sit, lean, or lay, as it is easy to forget that these surfaces are rubbing up against the fabric, harming the once smooth and luxurious texture you purchased.


In order to prevent slipping, pool decks are rough. Even if they don’t feel like it, they can wear away your swimwear. Use a towel to prevent contact.Sand and dirt are also abrasive. Use a towel, then rinse your swimwear immediately after use., Sunscreen, tanning oils, and cosmetics are harmful to delicate material. Exposure causes discoloration and damage. These products are at odds with the synthetic material in swimsuits and leave stains that grow over time and break down the fabric.Mineral-based lotions and oil formulations are said to be particularly adept at causing yellowing and gradual stains.Treat stains as you would body oil by rinsing immediately, then cleaning with either vinegar or detergent mixed in a bath of cold water for 30 minutes.
If possible, put on lotion or sunscreen before you put your swimsuit on. Wait a few minutes for it to dry.

, Even in a pinch, a rinse is better than nothing. It serves to wash away harmful chemicals such as chlorine, oils, and even bacteria before it can embed deeper into the fabric. You can even take it into a cold shower.Before this, avoid wrapping the swimsuit in a towel. The towel holds in the moisture and chemicals. A towel wet with pool water will contribute chlorine and other substances that wear out swimwear.

, Electric machines are easy, but even a gentle cycle uses heat and tumbling. This will wear out the material, causing a loss of integrity, shape, padding, and delicate embellishments.After rinsing immediately after usage, throw the used swimwear into a sink full of cold water for at least five minutes with a neutral detergent. Leaving it in too long will allow the water to work its way into the fibers, damaging the fit, so don’t get distracted.Use a mild soap for delicate fabrics. Regular detergent is too harsh and contributes to deterioration and fading. Avoid bleach and moisturizers.Men’s trunks are the exception in that they contain less spandex. This makes them better able to withstand the trauma of a machine wash cycle. You may still choose to wash them more gently by hand, though., Alternatively, use baking soda for two hours before washing or with vinegar by soaking the swimwear in one part white vinegar to three parts water for 30 minutes. This can also be used before wear to prevent color bleeding., Like washing, machine drying is too rough for fragile swimwear and will ruin the shape. Instead, roll up the swimsuit to coax out most of the water.Be gentle and don’t wring it out. It may be tempting, but the twisting motion is still damaging.

, Do this in a shaded and well-ventilated area. This prevents water from pooling and stretching fibers. It also reduces wrinkles and creases.Never leave the swimsuit exposed to direct sunlight. The heat will cause the same color damage you tried to avoid earlier. Cool air from an open window or a blow dryer, if in a hurry, are safer options., After it has dried out in the open, store the swimsuit in a temperature-controlled room away from disruptions such as a leaking pipe, a heater, or an open garage door. This will ensure that heat and cold do not expand and contract the material and that sunlight doesn’t cause fading., If there is any moisture in the swimwear or in the area, it can get in, damage the material, and cause mildew.


When storing dry swimwear that will be used soon, place it flat on a shelf or in a dry container such as a plastic storage bin. Choose the location with the fewest temperature fluctuations, heat exposure, and pet or child threat, such as under the bed.For longer storage, swimwear can be placed in a garment bag. This can be vacuum-sealed for added protection.

, Keep one or two extras on hand so that you can give the one you wore previously a 24-hour break. This allows the fabric to settle back into place, preserving elasticity.Keep an extra on hand for hot tubs. The high heat and chlorine level will do extra damage, so a cheap spare will come in handy.

Find a bathing suit that you actually like.,
Visit some swimwear stores.,
Select swimsuits you like the look of.,
Try a tankini.,
Try swim shorts with a short fitted t-shirt.,
Try a one piece bathing suit.,
Get advice if you think you need it.,
Pick the bathing suit or swimwear combination you like best and know you'll feel good in and be able to remain active wearing.",How to Adjust to Wearing a Bathing Suit (for Tomboys)," You might find it easiest to look online first. Check out Pinterest and other image aggregator sites to see what is available (search for terms such as bathing suit, swimsuit, togs, etc.). Look at swimwear stores online too. This will give you a good idea of what's out there to start with.


Are there special terms for the style you like? If so, learn them so that you can be informed when you go shopping for real.;
, Look for stores near you that have a good selection. Ask friends or even people in your online social circles for suggestions of where to look.


Go by yourself. Having someone with you can be distracting and even embarrassing.

, Try them on to see what size you are and what looks good and feels comfortable. Stretch around in front of the mirror to see if the suit moves in ways that you want it to; no good having it slip up and end up too revealing when you are active. And even if you don't find anything you like, that's good too, as it's telling you which styles to avoid from now on.


Keep all of your underwear on when trying on bathing suits.

, If you love the freedom of movement while being adequately covered up, the easiest bathing suit to get used to is the tankini. There are lots of variations - simple black tanks, halter necks with embellishments and such. Don't be afraid of trying on different things that may or may not look great on you - there's no one there to judge you!

, This combination isn't quite a swimsuit but gives you a lot of comfort. You can also purchase a pair of board shorts if you want your legs to be covered more.


You can even wear gym shorts with a wifebeater (singlet top). Don't forget to wear something under white tops, as they often become see-through when wet.
Another option is wearing a bikini top with football/board shorts.
To look more tomboyish, wear waterproof/board shorts over a bathing suit. Make sure to wear something under because if you are doing watersports or diving they could come off. Make sure they fit.

, If you haven't tried one before, you may find this a comfortable option. Give it a go, even if it looks girly––you can always choose darker colors and no prints once you've determined the right shape.


A baggy shirt or top can always be slipped over a one-piece. Or, add shorts and just let the one-piece top show.

, After you've determined a few of your favorite bathing suits, you might like to come back with a close friend or family member you trust, and ask for their opinion. The main thing, however, is that you like it and feel good in it.

, Done. Now you're all set to buy.

Determine how you intend to use the swimsuit.,
Decide what sort of style you want to adopt.,
Factor your budget into your decision-making process.",How to Choose the Right Swimsuit (Guys)1," If you are buying a suit for racing competitively, you’ll need a different suit than you would if you’re just swimming for fun. The more leg movement (i.e., actual swimming) you intend to do, the less fabric you should have on your swimsuit., If you want to really impress, think carefully about your build and research what sort of swimsuit looks best on someone with your body type. Different body types will look better with different colors, suit lengths, and patterns.If you are buying a men’s swimsuit for a pool party with coworkers but still want to look professional, choose something in a dark color – either striped or in a solid color – that ends in the middle of the thigh.
If you are not worried about looking cool, just buy any color or pattern you want.

, Different swimsuits are priced differently. You can pick up a basic suit for about $20, a mid-range suit for around $50 to $100, and a deluxe swimsuit for $300 or more. More expensive suits, generally, will be more durable.If you're buying your first swimsuit, you should get something on the budget end. This will give you a better sense of your needs and what you like in a suit.
If you intend to do serious swimming, then your suit will get a lot of wear. You might want to spend a little extra to get a nicer swimsuit.

Pick slim board shorts or trunks if you’re short and thin.,
Wear whatever you wish if you are tall and buff.",How to Choose the Right Swimsuit (Guys)2," If you are taller than 6’ (182 cm) and slender, select board shorts. The inseam should not be longer than 8’’ (20 cm). Board shorts that are too long will make you look youthful and sloppy.Tall, thin people should avoid investing in briefs.
Avoid vertical stripes if you’re tall and thin. Vertical stripes will accentuate your height and slender frame. Choose horizontal stripes or some other pattern altogether.

, If you are overweight and tall, board shorts (preferably in a longer, darker color) will be your best bet.You might also be able to get away with tie-waist trunks that end just above the knee.Choose a dark color. Black, for instance, is slimming. Dark green or blue could work, too.
Avoid prints and elastic waists.

, If you are short but have a chiseled build, you should go for a swimsuit with a shorter inseam to make you look taller. Avoid swimsuits with an inseam of more than 6’’ (15 cm)., A short, slim swimsuit will prevent your legs from being swallowed by the fabric. Select a pattern with dark horizontal stripes to add a sense of dimension to your body.Avoid bold patterns if you’re short and thin. Use microprints or stripes that don’t sharply contrast instead.

, If you are 6’ (182 cm) or taller and have a firm, muscular body, everything will look good on you. Choose any pattern, color, and style of swimsuit you like."

Choose trunks.,
Buy some board shorts.,
Select racers or briefs.,
Pick jammers.,
Opt for a drag suit.,
Choose a square leg.",How to Choose the Right Swimsuit (Guys)3," In North America, trunks are the most common type of swimsuit. The length can vary widely – some end halfway between the hips and knee, other end just above the knee. They look like regular shorts but are made of quick-drying materials (usually polyester or nylon)., Board shorts are basically long trunks. They tend to reach the knee or even extend just beyond it, and are a common beachside swimsuit style. If you just want to hang out on the beach or go for a casual swim, board shorts are an acceptable choice. They are also favored by surfers and beach sportsmen who don't do a lot of swimming. They feature long, wide legs and look best on tall, thin men., This is the most common type of men’s lap swimming suit. If you intend to do some serious competitive swimming, this is the best option. They provide minimal coverage to decrease drag and offer a full range of motion.This type of lap swimming suit is often referred to as a Speedo, but Speedo is just the brand name most commonly associated with this style.

, Jammers are basically long briefs. They resemble bike shorts and usually end at the middle of the thigh, about one to five inches (3 to 13 cm) above the knee. They provide more coverage than a racer or brief style. They’re best worn during practice or when racing.Jammers are perfect for beginning swimmers because they're especially easy to swim in.
If your jammers are too tight, they might restrict movement when treading water or performing the breaststroke. While you should try any swimsuit on before you buy it, this is especially true in the case of jammers.

, Drag suits are mesh briefs. As their name suggests, they create drag as you move. Drag suits are good for training and can be worn alone or over briefs. They should not be worn during races, however., A square leg suit is a bit longer than briefs, but is considered more fashionable. They can be worn during swimming practice or during races.Square leg swimsuits are also favored by beach volleyball players.

Choose a suit made of Lycra or spandex.,
Pick a suit of polyester.,
Select a suit made with a polyester blend.,
Obtain a nylon swimsuit.,
Buy a suit made with UV-protective material if you’ll be swimming outside.",How to Choose the Right Swimsuit (Guys)4," Spandex or Lycra suits stretch more than other fabrics. These are best for serious swimming competitions. Unfortunately, spandex and Lycra suits also tend to fade and loosen quickly compared to those of other materials., Polyester swimsuits are known to be long-lasting and chlorine resistant.They are considered a reasonable alternative to spandex or Lycra suits. They are also quick-drying, easy to launder, comfortable and soft, and breathable., Polyester blends combine polyester and some other material in a hybrid material. The most common – polyester PBT – is similar to Lycra. Polyester blends are often lightweight, fast-drying, durable, chlorine resistant, and have a handsome matte finish., Nylon is lightweight and popular for offering a smooth fit. They are also easy to launder, soft and abrasion-resistant, and have a low moisture absorbency. Nylon swimsuits have a few significant disadvantages. They are not chlorine resistant, nor are they as durable as polyester suits.

, A men’s swimsuit with a high UV rating will protect you from harmful ultraviolet light that can damage the skin and eyes. If you plan on doing most of your swimming outdoors, a check the tags for a UV or UPF rating of 50 or above."

Think about whether you want to wear a one-piece or two-piece swimsuit.,
Consider color/pattern.,
If you're going with a one-piece:


Try to find a suit with material cut out from the sides.,
If you're going with a two-piece:


Emphasize your upper half with a patterned bathing suit top.,
Stand up straight and strut your stuff.",How to Choose a Torso Elongating Bathing Suit," If you're concerned about your stomach (looking pale, flabby, etc.), you should probably go with a one-piece. If you're more focused on your chest or hips, though, go with a bikini. Don't be afraid to get a little bit out of your comfort zone--you might be pleasantly surprised!;
, Darker shades are subtle and simple, but certain designs can be very figure-flattering. Vertical stripes, for instance, have a lengthening and slimming effect, and ruffles hide your less favorable features while keeping you looking feminine.


White bathing suits work best against tan skin, and aren't the best idea if you're trying to look thinner. If you've been working out religiously and you're totally self-assured, then go for it, but otherwise you might want to hold off on the paper-white bikini

Vertical stripes are good, horizontal stripes are not (particularly against your stomach).

, This might not be easy if you're apple-shaped and carry more weight in your stomach and back than in your legs, but with just a little less fabric covering you up you can create the illusion that you are as thin as your swimsuit.
Seaming/ruching on the sides is another excellent tool for elongating your torso. It's a less bold approach than getting a suit with whole swatches cut out from the sides, so depending on exactly how you feel about your middle, you could go with either option.
Halter straps draw attention to your neck and shoulders, cutting you some slack in the torso area; pairing a halter top with daring sides is the perfect combination for any short-torsoed lady.
Avoid a high cut on the legs. This will make your legs look longer and your torso even shorter, which you don't want. A good guideline is the halfway point between your bellybutton and point where your legs meet your torso--if the cut goes any higher than this halfway point, you'll look a little ridiculous.

, Make it as wild and revealing as you want, even if you're relatively flat-chested (padded cups or ruffles can disguise that).
Put on a pair of solid-colored, inconspicuous bikini bottoms. Black and navy blue work with almost everything, and you can always throw on a pair of board shorts if you don't feel like revealing your legs in their entirety. Try to find bottoms that ride low, but still fit you well enough that you won't lose them to an ocean wave.
If you can, get a bathing suit with ribbons or ties on the side that trail down. Similar to seaming on a one-piece, this will make your torso look longer and distract from the parts of your body that you don't like.

, Nothing can make you look taller or more confident than readjusting your posture and acting like a supermodel, even if you don't think you look like one. Let go of your inhibitions and just enjoy your swimming or sunbathing; you can think about the length of your torso sometime later.

Remind yourself while shopping for a swimsuit that you deserve something of quality that you feel good in; don't settle for less.;
, For example, the 50s style one-piece swimsuits were made to accentuate and celebrate curves and are very flattering. They have lower hip rises, higher waists and provide plenty of upper body support.


Look online for seamstresses who specialize in making swimsuits based on earlier era styles. This has become a specialty niche that allows for the seamstress to enjoy their art and lets you get hold of a great, unique piece that is tailored to you and your precise measurements.

, Not all plus-size bodies are alike—your figure may be an apple, pear, hourglass, etc. Figure out which part of your body you want to accent most.


Try wearing brighter colors on areas you want to emphasize, and darker colors on areas you want to de-emphasize.

, Strut your stuff and show off your favorite parts of your body. If you want to show off your chest more, wear a lower cut swimsuit with a longer hip side. If you want to cover your chest, find a high-necked swimsuit.


Avoid wearing a high-necked swimsuit. This style can look (and may even feel) rather confining and is not particularly flattering. Instead, try something with a sheerer fabric and cut above a normal neckline.

, Which colors look good on you, and which ones make you look sickly? Figure out whether you are a winter, summer, spring, or autumn. Choose colors that complement your skin tone and make you look healthy.

, Ruched side panels can enhance your silhouette, and ruched fabric and wraps in general can be flattering and more adjustable in size.

, You want to be able to swim, walk, and play comfortably in your swimsuit, without constantly pausing to adjust. In the dressing room, stretch and try lightly jogging in place. Will you feel comfortable?


Check to make sure that the straps are comfortable and the bottom doesn't ride up.

, Bold, bright patterns look flattering and festive. Choose a print with shapes and colors that make you feel happy. If you're a little pattern-shy, try swimsuits with solid panels on the sides.

, If you aren't sure about a swimsuit on the rack, try it on, just in case it looks awesome on you. You may be surprised at what you can pull off!

, You may be a size 16 in one brand and a size 18 in another. This is okay. Be willing to go a size up or a size down from your general size, in case one particular swimsuit is cut differently.

, New styles such as fatkinis and more bikinis geared towards plus-size women are hitting the market. They include flattering high-waisted bottoms and plenty of support for your chest. Your body is beautiful and you are not required to cover it up.


You can also buy the top and bottom of your bikini in different sizes if needed.

, What are your favorite colors, silhouettes, and patterns? What sort of swimsuit makes you smile and look forward to wearing it? Search for swimsuits with details you like, so that when you go out to swim, you feel confident and beautiful.

Consider changing up the design of your swimsuit top.,
Accentuate your bust with embellishments and designer details.,
Always opt for padded swimsuits.",How to Accentuate Your Bust With Swimsuit Tops," If you usually wear halter tops, it’s time to switch it up, as halters can often flatten you out. Try switching to a triangle top or a twist bandeau. A triangle top is one of the skimpiest swimsuit tops there are, and they help create the illusion of beautiful cleavage. On the other hand, twist bandeau tops and bandeaus that dip in the middle create curvature up top, creating shape, volume and the illusion of a fuller bust.;
, Add volume to your bustline by choosing swimsuit tops with ruffles (either allover or with delicate tiered layers) or fringe. Add texture with swimsuit tops that have intricate beading, sequins, or beautiful embroidered detail. Finally, go for swimsuit tops with prints and patterns, such as horizontal stripes, paisleys, geometric prints and floral motifs; unlike solid swimsuit tops, tops with busy prints, especially when paired with a dark solid-colored bottom, help accentuate and draw attention toward your top half.

, Swimsuit tops with lightly padded cups will always help add a bit of volume to your bust, making them perfect for women with smaller cup sizes. Some padded swimsuit styles feature removable padding, while others feature specially designed booster padding to help lift you up. For even more shape, try swimsuit tops with molded cups. Molded cups are similar to padding in that they add volume; however, they’re a bit firmer so they help add some much-needed shape to your bustline.

Measure your hips at the widest point, waist at the smallest point, and bust at the fullest point for the best reference, since swimsuit sizing and styling depend on these ratios. Here are suggested interpretations of your body shape:


Pear shape: If your hips are significantly wider than both your waist and bust, you're probably a pear.
Apple shape: If your waist is significantly wider than your hips, and equal to or nearly as wide as your bust, you might be an apple.
Hourglass shape: If your bust and hips are about the same width, but your waist is significantly smaller, you're a classic hourglass.
Straight (also known as ruler or banana shape): If you're thin all around, with no significant difference between your hips, waist and bust, you're a straight shape.
;
, Before heading out to buy a swimsuit, take care of any necessary hair removal. Remove any hair you don't want to be showing while you're trying on your swimsuit, especially if you're going to be modeling for someone else to judge. And do not forget to wear underwear! Every store with swimwear requests that its patrons try on their bikinis and swim shorts with undergarments still on, and besides, do you really want to take the hygiene risk of going bare?
, There are boutiques that specialize in swimsuits (everything from sporty wear to poolside glamor) so do your research to find one that will work for you. Additionally, if you're not too particular about your swimwear, many clothing brands have their own swimsuit ranges available in department stores. Online shopping is another possibility but is probably best reserved for swimsuit duplicates when you already know what kind of swimwear fits you and you just need a few extras or a renewal of the same brand.
, The secret to a good swimsuit is drawing the eye to the most flattering parts of your figure; this will help you to feel more comfortable as well as looking your best. Here are some basic tips to follow:


To highlight a feature you like, use a bright color or pattern.
To hide something you don't like, use a solid color.
If you have pale skin, use black or deep jewel tones, such as dark purple, navy, and maroon.
If you have dark skin, bright colors can actually be more flattering and help hide what you don't like.

To add volume (such as to the bust or hips), choose a piece with ruffles in that area.
To hide volume (such as on the waist), use shirred or ruched fabric.
Don't be afraid to buy separates that don't match perfectly! Say you want to highlight your bust but draw attention away from your hips. You might buy a bikini top in a bright solid or pattern, and a bottom that's a dark black, blue or brown (depending on the top).


, Here's a quick rundown of what you might want to favor/avoid:


A one-piece will hide your waist. Choose one with shirred panels over the stomach, or in a dark, solid color.
A 1940s-style, bathing-beauty bottom that's high-waisted can also help hide a waist. Again, go with a dark color or shirring.
A tankini will highlight your waist, because it draws the eye to the section of skin that's showing. If you love your waist but not so much your hips or bust, choose this.
Boyshorts make your hips look wider, regardless of color. If you have a large bust and want the hips to match for a classic hourglass shape, choose boyshorts. However, be aware that this style can feel uncomfortable for some women, so be certain of fit before you purchase anything.

High-cut bikini bottoms make legs look longer. If you're short, or you're long in the torso, this is a good selection.
Halter tops draw attention to the bust, as do triangle tops.
Tie-front bikini tops draw the eye to the bust, as well as pulling the breasts closer to one another, effectively making them look larger. If you have small breasts and want them to look larger, this might be a good fit.
Bandeau tops will make the bust seem wider. If you're a pear shape and you want to imitate an hourglass shape, choose a bandeau top with ruffles or another busy detail.
For a large bust, look for a straight across cut at the top of your swimsuit with wide set straps to minimize your bust. Try a bikini top with an underwire and a thick chest band for extra support. A thick chest band will prevent jiggling so that the bra stays where it should be and you can't fall out.


, It's pointless buying a string bikini if you plan on swimming laps or surfing; it'll be floating off in no time, embarrassing you no end. Bikinis are fairly limited in terms of active workouts in a pool or the sea, but a more solid tankini would hang in there no problems. Sports swimsuits often have added features to help with support, streamlining and comfort, so check them out if you're planning on doing more than keeping cool by the pool.


Most lifeguard work requires a one piece swimsuit in a plain color, perhaps the color of your lifesaving crew. You might also need to add shorts or a wetsuit to complete the uniform.
One piece swimsuits can be very sexy, especially when you choose nice colors and a flattering fit for your body.


, If you've tried shopping on your own and just can't find anything that works, request some assistance. Go to a store that carries styles you generally like, and ask a salesperson for his or her take on your situation. Be upfront about what you like and what you want to hide, and don't be afraid of the feedback you get--just respond in accordance and you'll probably end up with something you like.

, If they reach your earlobes or anywhere below that, it is a good fit. (This is only for racing suits or practice suits.)"

Use a sharp razor.,
Choose soap or shaving cream.,
Decide how much hair to remove.,
Trim the hair to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).,
Take a nice hot shower or bath.,
Lather up the area with shaving cream or body wash.,

Try on your bikini bottoms to see if you missed a spot.,

Prevent razor burn.,
Keep the area moisturized.,
Avoid tight clothing for a few hours.",How to Shave Your Bikini Line," Bikini-area hair tends to be a little coarser than other body hair, so it might be difficult to take it off with the type of razor that comes 10 to a pack. Instead, pick out a high-quality razor designed for use on sensitive skin. Use a razor with new, sharp blades, since using a dull razor can cause chafing and ingrown hairs.A men's razor is better to shave your bikini area. They are usually sturdier and have more than one blade, unlike women's razors. They remove hair easily while taking good care of sensitive skin. (You can usually distinguish the two types by color. Men's razors are usually white. Women's razors are usually pink or pastel-colored.)
Avoid using a razor that has just one blade, unless it is a very sharp safety razor. Razors with just one blade have a tough time removing hair in the bikini area. Look for one with three or four blades so you will get a closer cut.
A brand-new razor that has never been used before will be sharper than a used one. If you have to use a lower quality disposable razor, using a brand new one every time you shave the bikini line will yield best results. You can always use the used razor for armpits and legs.;
, The type of cream or soap you use does not really matter, as long as you use something. Pick your preference: body wash, shaving cream, or even hair conditioner all work equally well.


Soaps and creams that contain fragrances can sometimes be irritating to sensitive skin. Test the product on another, less sensitive part of your body before you use it in your bikini area.

, Take a look at yourself in the mirror and determine where you want the cutoff to be. The bikini line is a little different on every woman, but in most cases you will remove any hair that would be exposed if you were wearing bikini bottoms. That includes hair on your upper thighs, around the groin and below the belly button.


For a simple shaving guideline, bring a pair of your underwear into the shower. Wear them while shaving. Anything peeking up below the seams should be removed. (Note: this will work best if your underwear has similar lines to your swimsuit bottom.)
If you want to take off even more hair, see How to Shave Your Pubic Hair.
You might also consider How to Give Yourself a Brazilian Wax if you want to go totally bare.

, If your hair is too long when you shave it, it will get tangled in the razor and could become a big mess. Prep your hair by using a pair of hair scissors to trim it back to about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or shorter. This will make it so much easier to get a close shave.


Gently pull the hair up and away from your body with one hand, then use the scissors to carefully trim it off with the other.
Be very careful not to poke or cut yourself. Trim your hair in a well-lit area before you get in the shower.

, This will soften your skin and hair, making it easier to shave it all away. Save shaving for the end of your shower or bath, after you've already shampooed your hair and done everything else you need to do.If you are not shaving in the shower, you should still prep the area by moistening it with a hot washcloth. Skipping this step could result in razor burn and a lot of discomfort.
If you have time, exfoliate the skin in the area as well. This prevents the occurrence of ingrown hairs after shaving.

, It is essential to make sure the hair and the skin underneath it are well-lubricated before you start shaving. Otherwise, razor burn will definitely be an issue. There's really no such thing as using too much lubricant, so go ahead and lather up the entire area. Keep the bottle nearby in case you need more.As you shave, keep applying more cream or body wash to make the process go more smoothly.
You may want to rinse it away every once in a while to see how much progress you have made, then reapply to keep shaving.

, Experts say that shaving in the same direction of hair growth results in less skin irritation. Use one hand to hold the skin in the area completely tight, since this helps the razor do its job effectively. With the other hand, start shaving away the hair, applying just a little pressure for a nice close shave. Keep going until you've shaved the entire area you planned to clear.Some people start shaving under the belly button, others start with the groin area. It is completely up to you; do whatever makes the job easier for you.
Some people find it more difficult to get a close shave when they shave in the direction as hair growth instead of going against the grain. If you're finding it hard to take the hair off, try going at the hair sideways. As a last resort go against the grain. There are other measures you can take to prevent skin irritation.
Do not over-shave. There is no need to go over the same spot after you have taken off the hair. If the area is hair-free, let it be so you do not risk irritating the skin.

, (If you're satisfied you got everything, don't worry about this step, but if this is your first time shaving your bikini area you might want to double check to see if you like the results). Put on your bikini bottoms and check yourself out, then get back in the shower and shave any parts you might have missed.

, Use a washcloth or a gentle body scrub to get rid of the dead skin that is now exposed. This simple step will go a long way toward preventing ingrown hairs and other irritating side effects of shaving, so don't skip it!

, For people with sensitive skin, a few extra precautions may be in order.


Many people find using some witch hazel or other skin toner helps reduce or eliminate any razor burn. Use a cotton ball or clean washcloth to dab some witch hazel or another gentle toner over the area you shaved. It will reduce inflammation and keep the area feeling fresh and cool.(Note that this will sting or burn if you have cut yourself--be careful!)
Blow-dry. Drying your bikini area thoroughly can avoid or reduce follicle irritation. Dry the area thoroughly with a hairdryer set on medium or low. If there is only a hot setting be sure to be careful to keep it a distance away from your crotch--you do not need or want to blast yourself with hot air there! If you do not have a hair dryer, (or perhaps, explain to others why you are blow-drying your crotch!) a concentration on towel-drying the bikini-bottom area will help.

, If the skin gets dry or flaky, it will feel uncomfortable and irritated. You will also increase the risk of getting unsightly bumps or ingrown hairs. Apply a moisturizer all over the area you shaved, and keep the area moisturized for at least a few days after shaving. The following soothing, natural moisturizers are great for this purpose:


Aloe vera gel
Coconut oil
Argan oil
Jojoba oil

, This can cause the skin to get irritated and inflamed, so it is best to wear your loosest underwear and a loose skirt or baggy shorts until the area feels less sensitive.

Choose a store that has bathing suits for sale.,
Select suits that cover the midsection.,
Locate one area of your body which you are proud to show off as your ""asset"" feature.,
Use patterns to your advantage.,
Use color to your advantage.,
Buy a bathing suit that specializes in concealing your tummy.",How to Choose a Tummy Minimizing Bathing Suit," Department stores usually have a large selection of swimsuits or you could visit a store that specializes in swimwear. In speciality stores that concentrate on bathing suits, you'll probably find a greater variety and the retailers will be fairly knowledgeable about the size and fit of swimsuits.

In a good quality store, staff can give recommendations, so if you are stuck on what to get, this can be a big help.
Do not despair if one store does not offer a good fit for you. Swimsuit designers may fit one body type perfectly, while another simply is not comfortable, unflattering, or otherwise not quite right.



 

;
, One-piece bathing suits are usually the best option when it comes to minimizing your stomach shape, as these will conceal your tummy beneath fabric. Also, the elasticity of the swimsuit will tend to pull in the stomach areas. Another option are two-piece swimsuits that have drapery that cover the midsection--this is often a good choice for women who have a longer torso.

, This is important because this area serves as the ""eye catcher"" to be focused upon, using it as the focal point instead of the tummy. It is easy to get so caught up in minimizing your stomach area, that you completely forget to show off your great legs. For example, if everybody's eyes are looking at your legs, they won't notice your tummy if you wear a colorful, flashy leg wrap. Or, if you show off your chest by wearing ruffles around the top of the swimsuit, that's where people will look!

, Although there is nothing wrong with a well-made solid suit, patterns can make a big difference in where the eye is drawn. Wear lines that go straight down from the top of your body to the bottom. These give the illusion that your torso is longer. On the other hand, horizontal lines or large blocked lines will make you appear heavier.

There are the odd exceptions, however. Sometimes what ""shouldn't"" work does, and what should work does not. Always try on the suit.
Small patterns tend to work better than larger ones.







, Wear dark-colored swimsuits rather than light. These darker colored swimsuits will give the illusion of smallness and can cover up blemishes more easily. Dark colored swimsuits will help to conceal any extra tummy that you don't want to be shown. This does not necessarily mean black, just not white or pastel-colored suits.

, Some swimsuits are designed specifically to conceal tummies. Look on the tag of the swimsuit to figure out if it is a tummy concealer or not, or simply ask the retailer for help in finding suitable swimsuits. These bathing suits use different shapes, patterns, etc. to create the illusion of a small waist and a small tummy.

Determine your body shape.,
Choose a top.,
Choose a bottom.,
Coordinate your top and bottom.,
Keep it tasteful and age-appropriate.,
Wear your bikini with confidence.",How to Choose a Bikini," Your body type will determine what you choose to highlight or downplay with your bikini. Here are the most common types:


Athletic — Your bust and hips are both fairly small, and you're skinny overall. You can emphasize your small frame, or try to make your bust and hips appear bigger.
Apple — You tend to put your weight in your bust and belly, but your legs and hips are smaller. To imitate an hourglass, choose a bottom that makes your hips look bigger and a top that makes your bust look smaller.
Pear — Your weight collects around your hips and butt, but your waist and shoulders are smaller. To imitate an hourglass, choose a top that makes your hips look smaller and your bust look bigger.
Hourglass — Your bust and hips are both wide, but your waist is narrow.;
, The cut, color and fabric of your bikini top can all make a big difference in how it looks on you. Use these cheats to pick yours:


To make a small bust look bigger: Shun black, and instead opt for white or bright colors. You can also use ruffles to add the appearance of volume. Bandeau and halter bikini tops look best on small-breasted women. You can also find padded tops.
To make a large bust look smaller: Wear black or other dark colors, or busy patterns. Avoid any top that does not provide enough support for your breasts — choose a bikini top with an underwire, if possible, and avoid bandeaus like the plague. Steer clear of stripes or large patterns.
To emphasize your bust: Triangle tops, aka the classic string bikini look, will easily direct traffic to your assets. You can also emphasize cleavage with a halter bikini, or perkiness with a bandeau.
To support a large bust: Choose a top with wide straps, underwire support, and sufficient coverage.

, Not only will the bottom you select determine how your derriere looks, it can also emphasize your legs or direct attention away from them. Here's what you need to know:


To make your butt look bigger: Choose a white or light-colored bottom. For extra emphasis, wear a ruffled string bottom or boyshorts.
To make your butt look smaller: Wear black or dark colors, and avoid stripes or busy patterns. Opt for a high-cut or tie-together bottom. Even though you might be tempted to cover up with boyshorts, don't — they'll only make you look wider.
To emphasize your butt: Wear — what else? — a string bottom. You can also choose one with a lot of details, such as rings, ruffles or patterns.
To make your legs look longer: Choose a high-cut bottom that rounds up to your hipbones.
To make your legs look shorter: Wear boyshorts, which will cut a sharp horizontal line at the top of your thighs.

, So you've decided what you want, but how do you put it together? Here are some tips for buying separates:


Wear a color that's a shade or two lighter on the part you want to emphasize. For instance, if you want to draw attention to your bust, you might wear a light blue top with a darker blue bottom.
Coordinate your colors. Try going monochromatic (wearing two shades of the same color), pairing a bright color with white or black, wearing two jewel-toned colors (such as dark purple and dark blue), or pairing neutrals (such as white and black).
Don't be afraid to get mismatched sizes. If you have a small bust but wide hips, swap out that top for a size small and get a size medium or large for the bottom — your two pieces don't need to be the same size, they just need to fit. If you're unsure about mixing and matching sizes, ask a salesperson for help.

, Few things cause more second-hand embarrassment than seeing someone else in a bikini they shouldn't be wearing. Follow these basic guidelines to avoid disaster:


Avoid a string top if you're larger than a C cup. If you're falling out the sides of a string top, it's too small — find something with more side support, like a halter.
Leave thongs to the celebrities. On the whole, they're not flattering and show more than most people want to see.
Skirted bottoms are for old ladies. Unless it's a pinup-style cut with more of a ruffle than a skirt, skip it.
Make use of a cover-up when you are walking to and from the beach or pool. Cover-ups are flattering and can help you to feel comfortable when not in the water. Look for cover-ups that are easy to remove and replace.

, The best bikini in the world will look unflattering if you keep your shoulders hunched and your posture sloppy. Show off what you've got! Stand up straight, keep your shoulders back, and hold your chin up. Add a smile and a confident attitude, and you'll be stunning in that bikini.

Keep your outfit fairly simple.",How to Wear Cowboy Boots," If worn well, cowboy boots can be a fashion statement for both men and women. Why not embrace them? Cowboy boots have a long and storied past: think cowhands, ranchers, John Wayne, and Clint Eastwood. They can be manly for men, stylish for ladies, and a great addition to a wardrobe.The height, tapered toes, and decorations make cowboy boots distinctive. They will be a focal point for your outfit.
Cowboy boots' tapered toes are a fun contrast to the usual dress shoes. The added height provided by the heels will also create the illusion of being taller.Plain cowboy boots are a rarity. Most stand out with a variety of colors, leathers, and finishes, and many have added tooling or stitching.;
, There are several basic kinds of cowboy boots out there, each with its own look. From the classic model to Ropers and Buckaroos, there is a style out there for everyone. Learn more about these and pick one that suits you and your personality.The classic boot usually has a shaft about 12 inches high and a Cuban-style heel, meaning that it is angled inward. In the old days, this fit right into your stirrup.
Ropers are designed for rodeos and have a lower shaft. The toe is also more rounded and the heel more like that of a typical work boot.
The Stockman is a lot like the classic look. However, it has a shorter and wider heel.
Western work boots tend to look more like the Roper, but with a larger (and sometimes steel) toe. Many will also have rubber soles for better traction.
Buckaroos may be the most flashy of all. They are tall – over 14 inches – and often have detailed tooling or decoration on the shaft. They are made to protect the legs, and to be seen.

, In addition to your shoe size, the boots need to be the right width. Women’s cowboy boots are typically sized in A, B and C widths, while men's cowboy boots are typically sized in B, D and EE widths., The key to wearing cowboy boots well is to have confidence. In most areas, cowboy boots are uncommon and maybe even a bit gauche. People will look. You have to wear them like you mean it and carry yourself with flair.Mind your body language when you walk: backbone up and chest held high. Your posture and demeanor will show if you’re self-conscious.

, While you should be confident, be careful not to take things too far in the direction of campiness. The cowboy boot, used poorly, can look slightly ridiculous – think the Village People or Marty McFly in Back to the Future III. Use your better judgement; the key is subtlety.Try not to incorporate more than one “Western” themed item into your outfit at once, for example, unless you’re actually working on the range. If you’re wearing cowboy boots, avoid spurs, cowboy hats, ponchos, and bolo ties.
Boots with garish colors, too much decoration, or exotic skins like shark, skate, or snake will also draw extra attention.

, Some styles like Buckaroo boots are elaborately embellished, and you may want to wear it so that the decorations are seen. But for guys, the best style is to wear jeans over the boots, unless, that is, you’re actually doing work on horseback.Favor boot-cut jeans that are dark and close-fitting. You’ll want your pants to accentuate the boots as best they can. Avoid normal, work-style jeans.
The front of the boots will still be visible – there won’t be any question that you’re still sporting footwear with Western flair.

, Medium and dark wash jeans are usually the most versatile jeans to wear with cowboy boots. However, black, beige, or brown jeans can also work well as long as they match the boots in color.Light blue washes have a tendency to look a little outdated. Avoid acid washes, as well.
The same goes for some of the brighter colors now in fashion, i.e. yellow, white, green, or pink.

, Aim for a more put together look by switching your jeans for chinos or twill pants. That said, beware mixing boots with the overly formal. Unless you are in Texas or Oklahoma, you might get strange looks for combining cowboy boots with business wear.Brown, black, or black cherry colored pants can work well.


Well polished boots go particularly well with trousers.
You might even be able to pull off khakis in a traditional brown, tan, or cognac color.
If you opt for trousers over jeans, be sure that there is enough room in the pant legs and avoid unsightly bulges.
In some areas, it is acceptable to wear a so-called “Western tuxedo” for formal events. This features a cowboy hat and boots with a normal black-tie tux. Just be sure your boots are black and highly polished., When wearing cowboy boots, your pants should come down to the foot of the boot or a little longer. They should not be long enough to drag on the floor, however, or too short.


Keep in mind that most cowboy boots have a taller heel than regular shoes, as much as one or even two inches. As such, your usual jeans may not be long enough.
Look for jeans that “stack.” This refers to the soft fold that forms in the jean when it extends past the foot of the boot.
The stack is a stylistic preference, but it will give you a slightly rugged appearance and is preferred by many men.

, Cowhide boots are classic, and the most classic hues are brown and black. You can also find women’s cowboy boots in other colors like white and red. Leather boots can look casual or classy, depending on their condition and what you pair them with. You could also wear suede boots, which are a little more elegant but harder to maintain.Pay attention to the style and shape of the boots. A calf-length cowboy boot with a pointed toe is a classic style. But nowadays you can find ladies’ cowboy boots in shorter lengths or with rounded or square toes.
Be aware of that there are other materials than just cowhide, like quilled ostrich, caiman, crocodile, and snake skin.

, Skinny jeans hug your leg and have little, if any, extra material. As a result, trying to stuff your boots under them will only make your legs look bulky and frumpy. Wear your cowboy boots over the jeans for best results.This look works especially well when the skinny jean and country boot are balanced out by a chic city jacket or blazer.

, This is another way to show your boots to the world. If you have a long shirt, sweater, skirt, or dress, you can wear leggings or tights under your boots to keep your legs covered during chillier weather.Try wearing your boots with leggings and a tunic dress or cardigan, as well.
You can also match them with bright tights and a dress or tunic for a unique look.

, The height of the classic cowboy boot mimics that of a normal pair of heels, and the front looks like the front of a casual yet chic closed-toe heel. Try this look out by wearing the jeans over the boot.When wearing jeans or other pants over your cowboy boots, it’s best to go with a boot-cut or flared style.
You should also opt for longer jeans that will cover almost all of the boot to the toe. The heel will add one or two inches to your inseam., Loose-flowing, airy dresses can create an interesting contrast with the structured, rugged look of a cowboy boot. Pick a dress that stops at or slightly above the knee to show off more of the boots.


You can also try your boots with a classic dress. A little black dress paired with black or sheer tights and black cowboy boots can look surprisingly sleek and stylish.
Wearing your boots with a dress in a simple, structured cut is a good way to give an otherwise elegant piece a playful twist.

, Regardless of its cut, pattern, and color, keep your clothing relatively plain. Cowboy boots are a statement piece, especially when worn in a way that allows the full boot to be seen. Wearing the boots with a garish print will only cause your outfit to look busy and loud.Don’t feel the need to banish embellishment entirely. For instance, brown boots can go well with patterned dresses.
At the same time, the most important thing is to let the boots be the focus of your outfit.
Don’t wear your boots everyday. Save them for special occasions for maximum impact.

Consider benefits and disadvantages of resoling your footwear.,
Use a name brand shoe for resoling; they are durable and well made.,
Do simple resoling.,
Choose a shoemaker.,
For comfort, resole the footwear with a medium density material.,
For more comfort, add an 1/8 or a 1/4 of an inch to the new sole.,
Be concerned about ankle stability.,
Have the shoemaker put on a small piece, 1/4"" thick, of very high density rubber at the most rear part of the heel for durability.

,
Change the heel, if necessary.,
Consider spot patching.,
Keep notes for future reference when having custom shoe work done.",How to Resole Your Footwear,"


It is economical, a resole job should be about half the cost of a new footwear.
Your shoes do not have to be broken in, it will be comfortable. Shoes that have already been worn have conformed to upper part of your feet. The under sole can be customized to: a softer density sole, heel height change etc.
Comfort can be costly too. A softer density undersole will wear out faster - a negative. A positive is you will be happier when your feet do not hurt.
The main disadvantages of resoling a shoe is the thought, that is required, in deciding how to do a resole and the time it takes to decide and take notes.;
, Good quality and well maintained shoes can last many years. Leather cracks if it is not treated with shoe polish.

, The majority of shoes can be resoled. Certain jobs like resoling athletic shoes, like basketball shoes, cannot be done because most shoemakers will not have experience with lateral reinforcement of shoes and not have the materials for repair on athletic shoes.

, Since the price will not vary much for resoling, choose the shoemaker with the most skills. A shoemaker who has the ability to make shoes from scratch is an excellent choice. Also, note the amount of materials and machines in the shop.


To resole the shoe, like when it was bought, is very simple for the shoemaker to do and follow directions. The shoe repair person has a lot of clients and will not remember, like you can, the details of the past repairs for you. Your directions must be in detail and exact (quantified).

, A soft density material is the most comfortable but wears out fast. At the other end, a hard density material is very durable but very uncomfortable. Compromise between cost and comfort.

, This will add greatly to comfort. From heel to toes make the undersole 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) thicker at the very least.

, A very thick sole, more than an 1"", is very comfortable yet there is a greater chance of ankle injuries. A shoe that is high protects the ankle. A thick sole does not flex, making walking unnatural. Adding a 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) will not decrease the flex of the shoe and will not increase the possibility of ankle injury - unless the sole is already very thick.

,, With a lower heel, the foot does not slide to the front and get jammed there. A lower heel may also alleviate back pain. A higher heel instead of a heel cup will reduce or eliminate heel pain. Proper walking technique, without excessive dorsiflexion, even with a low heel, can reduce or eliminate heel pain of this type (where heel elevation reduces pain).

, If just a small part of a shoe is worn such as the very front or heel, the shoemaker can patch that area. Polishing the shoe and the sole covers the patch marks. Patch jobs costs less than resoling.

, Organize your notes and keep it in a file chronologically. Draw an outline of both shoes and note the wear patterns. Record the directions given to the shoe repair person. Finally, make other pertinent notes.

Consider wearing tights or leggings.,
Tug on a pair of rugged combat boots.,
Finish off with accessories and make-up.",How to Wear Combat Boots1," For this look, the softer and more feminine the top looks, the better. Avoid bold patterns and prints.

A free-flowing top works a bit better than a structured top, but a structured top with plenty of feminine flair can still work.;
, If you do have a more structured top, you can soften it up by shrugging on a dainty cardigan sweater. Other feminine over-shirts, like lace blazers, can also work well, but you should stay away from solid structured blazers if you are trying to accomplish this look., For free-flowing tops, a black, gray, or brown pencil skirt keeps the outfit looking balanced while hugging your curves in all the right places. If you have a more structured top, however, you might want to consider a frillier skirt. An A-line skirt with ruffles or pleats could work wonders, for example. Maximize your womanly charms by choosing a skirt that lands at or slightly above the knee.

, If the weather is still a little chilly, you can keep your legs warm by throwing on a pair of leggings beneath your skirt and tucked into the boots. Black or dark brown leggings will help your leg to look skinny and petite, maximizing the contrast you are trying to accomplish by wearing large, chunky combat boots. Tights that have a slight sparkle or lace pattern can also be worn as long as the rest of your outfit is fairly plain.

, Choose boots in black or brown, depending on which color best matches the colors of your clothing. The boots can be in good condition, but in order to really take advantage of the contrast, it might help if the boots look a little worn.

, Doll yourself up using your standard dressy make-up routine. If you do not have one, consider adding a little eyeshadow or lipstick to your face for an extra pop of feminine flair. Keep your accessories light but girly. Think of dangling pearl earrings or a sparkly gold tennis bracelet.

Wear a pair of skinny jeans.,
Throw on a simple t-shirt or blouse.,
Top things off with casual outerwear, if any at all.,
Opt for combat boots in good condition.,
Stick with simple accessories and make-up.",How to Wear Combat Boots2," Medium to dark washes tend to look best with the dark hue of combat boots. You could also wear black skinny jeans to create a slightly dressier look while elongating your leg, but for casual daytime wear, standard blue will work better. Skinny jeans work best so that you can tuck the jeans into your boots. Jeans with wider legs tend to bunch up, and this look works best if you can wear the boots on the outside of your jeans.

, A fitted t-shirt or tank top creates a very casual look that is suitable for an ordinary day around the town. If you want to go for something a little more special, you could opt for a fitted blouse or button-down shirt. A plain color works well, but a bold pattern in a vibrant color can also make a fashionable statement.

, You do not need to wear anything over your top, but if you do decide to, opt for something a little more casual instead of something dressy. A cardigan, for instance, is too formal for this look, but a poncho or casual capelet will work just fine.Hooded sweatshirts, on the other hand, might be a little too casual.

, While worn combat boots are certainly casual, they might actually be a little too casual for this already simple outfit. The purpose here is not to create contrast, but to go for a cohesive look that is simply a little sturdier than one you might create with heels or sneakers. Worn boots will only make your attire look sloppy.

, If you decide to wear make-up, keep it light and daytime appropriate. As far as accessories go, look for solid colors, clean lines, and simple shapes. Consider a solid bangle bracelet, a simple satchel-style over-the-shoulder purse, or large post earrings.

Wear a fitted black shirt.,
Throw a plaid shirt over your shoulders.,
Put on a pair of acid-wash cut-offs.Nothing says grunge quite like acid wash jeans.,
Slip on a pair of tights beneath your jeans.,
Wear a pair of combat boots in fairly decent condition.,
Keep any make-up and accessories to a minimum.",How to Wear Combat Boots3," The idea is to give a nod to the grunge style of the early 1990s, which is where combat boots first had a chance to shine, without getting too carried away. While fitted shirts were not necessarily the ""in"" thing during the grunge era, black is timeless and had its fair share of the spotlight. A simple black, fitted t-shirt makes a nice neutral base for the rest of your outfit.

, Shapeless, button-down plaid was a definite part of the grunge look. To give your tribute to grunge an update, choose a shirt that nips in slightly at the natural waist and leave it partially or fully unbuttoned to reveal the black shirt underneath. You can stick to the classic red-and-black color scheme, or you can go for something a little more modern like teal-and-black or blue-and-black.

, Wearing cut-offs with frayed edges enhances the look, but if this is a little too bold or a little too early '90s for you, you can trade the cut-offs for distressed jeans with rips in the knee.

, The tights are only optional, but they do add a modern, stylish twist to otherwise outdated clothing. Go with black tights to make your look a little sleeker and to match the fitted black shirt serving as the base of your outfit. It is best to go with full-length tights to contrast the shortness of your cut-offs or to make sure that they can be seen through the rips in your jeans.

, You can pull off worn, rugged boots with this outfit to push it closer to '90s grunge, but if you want to keep your ensemble looking purposeful and stylish by today's standards, a pair of polished black combat boots will work better.

, Any cosmetics you wear should be used to even out your complexion, but do not go overboard with how girly or feminine you make your face look. One or two large, chunky accessories can be a chic touch, but anything too frilly, colorful, or dainty will look out of place. Consider a studded shoulder bag, black ""hipster"" glasses, or plaid-print button earrings.

After you lace the first pair of eyelets, criss-cross each lace to the opposite side by threading underneath each eyelet.

, To put on your boots easily and not mess up all your hard work lacing them, loosen the laces from the top. Only loosen the top few laces at first. Check to see if your foot will fit and if it doesn’t, loosen up one or two more at the top.

, One of the most common fashion slip-ups is a pair of socks peeking up from a set of styling sneakers. Go sockless if you can, as this will keep your look streamlined and on trend. If you can’t fathom sporting your sneakers without socks, try a pair of “invisible” socks that fit neatly below your shoe line.If skipping socks isn’t your thing, you can try adding a pair of statement socks instead.

, You’ll stretch the ways you can wear your sneakers outside the gym if you stick to classic looks and patterns or solid colors. Canvas slides in a classic leopard print or sneakers in a solid color with a retro vibe will go a lot further than kicks with crazy colors or patterns., When you head out to snag a new pair of sneakers, keep your closet in mind.

Use a file folder or another kind of stiff paper to make the soles.,
Cut these out.,
Take the fabric you will use for the soles.,
Place the sole so that the part that the straighter part lines up with the fold.,Place the sole inside of the outline,
Take your sewing needle and thread.,
Sew all the way around.,
Choose the fabric you want to use for the top part.,
Make the band or half moon big enough that you can fold the ends over to the bottom of the sole.,
If you used non-slip fabric or are confident no one will slip in the slippers, you can skip this step.,
Make any touch-ups you feel are necessary.",How to Make Simple Non Slip Slippers from Scratch," You could even use cardboard, if you prefer. If you can, fold it in half, this way you have less work to do.

Make a close outline of your foot (if its for someone else, ask them to stand on the paper, or make a guess using your foot as a guide).
Widen this outline and round it out slightly. You should now have an oval a little bigger than the foot.


 

;
, If you folded it, you can flip one of them over, so you have one left sole and one right. If you didn't fold it, trace the first sole and flip it., You don't have to have non-slip fabric, but it will save you some work. However, not all non-slip material is that comfortable.

Make sure you have enough fabric to cover both sides of the sole, for both slippers. If you can, fold it over.






, Trace it. Put the sole aside, and cut out the outline. You will have some trimming to do, depending on the size and shape of your sole. Cut it out slightly bigger than the sole, because it's not fun pushing the needle through cardboard.

,, Now, getting started can be complicated, so start at the heel, but not right where the fold ends (note: try to work on a hard, flat surface, especially if you are a beginner) so you don't get stuck to something.

You can also pin your sole and fabric together to keep it in place, whatever works for you.











, When you get to where the fold starts, make a knot. Tie and cut it off, and then go to where you started and sew the opening, between where you started and the fold ends, closed. Try not to stab your finger with the needle., You can make a strip and make it like a strap, or, if you prefer cozy toes, you can make a half moon shape to sew on to the toe end.
, This way, when you sew it on, it will fit better and not decrease foot room in your slipper. You will want to flip it over so that the bottom is facing you. It will be far easier, and more accurate, when you sew the band or moon on.
You will notice there are spots of hot glue on the bottom. That will be explained in step ten, Otherwise take your hot glue gun (be careful not to let it touch you) and put spots or stripes, or words- whatever you want, as long as it covers enough of the bottom to prevent slipping., You might need to reinforce some of your stitches, or maybe you want to add a pom pom? It's up to you! these are YOUR slippers, so get creative!"

Replace compression socks every 3-6 months.,
Wash compression socks regularly.",How to Wear Compression Socks," Compression socks come in 4 main compression levels. Each level is measured in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. Socks rated at a higher mmHg will have a higher compression level.Mild compression socks are rated 8-15 mmHg.
For moderate compression, try a sock rated 15-20 mmHg.
Firm compression socks have a rating of 20-30 mmHg.
For extra firm compression, opt for a sock with a rating of 30-40 mmHg.;
, The first measurement you will need to take is the circumference of your ankle. Take a tape measure and place it around the narrowest part of your ankle. The tape measure should be positioned just above your anklebone. Record the measurement., The second measurement you will need is the circumference of your calf. Take a tape measure and place it around the widest part of your calf. Take note of the measurement., The final measurement you will take is the length of your calf, from the bend in your knee to the bottom of your heel. Sit on a chair and position your leg in a 90-degree angle. Measure the distance from the bend of your knee to the floor. Record the measurement., If your doctor prescribed thigh high compression socks, you will need to measure the widest part of your thigh. You will also need to measure your leg length by measuring the distance between the floor and the bottom of your buttocks., Once you have completed all three measurements, you can use them to decide what size compression sock is right for you. Compare the measurements to the sizing chart listed on the manufacturer’s website or on the compression sock package. Size up if you are between sizes., A change in body weight may signal it’s time for a different size of compression sock. If you lose or gain weight, make sure you measure yourself again and purchase new socks if necessary., Reach into the compression sock with one hand and grab the toe of the sock. Then use your hands to turn the upper half of the compression sock inside out., Once you have the compression sock turned inside out, gently place your foot in the toe of the sock. Then slide the stocking up over your heel. Make sure the top of the stocking remains inside out., Once your heel is securely inside the sock, gently slide the sock up your leg. Do this as slowly and gently as possible to prevent tearing holes in the stocking or stretching it out., Pulling on the top of a compression sock may cause the sock to rip. Never attempt to put on compression socks by pulling them on by the top of the sock. This can also cause unwanted stretching of the fabric.

, If you have trouble sliding the compression sock up or down your leg, try wearing a pair of rubber gloves. The gloves can help create some resistance, which will make putting compression socks on or taking them off a bit easier., When it’s time to take off your compression sock, fold it down gently until it reaches the top of the ankle. Then insert your finger or thumb inside the back of the stocking on your heel. Use your finger or thumb to pop the stocking off your heel and then slide the rest of the stocking off your foot., Your legs are less swollen when you wake up, which means the compression socks will be easier to put on. Try putting the socks on as soon as you wake, even before you get out of bed., To get the most from your compression socks, you will want to wear them for the entire day. Wearing the compression socks all day long will help improve circulation, keeping blood flowing steadily while you are awake., Unless your doctor has instructed you otherwise, you should take the compression socks off before you go to bed each night. Do not sleep in compression socks unless your doctor instructs you to do so. You should also remove compression socks before bathing., When you buy a new pair of compression socks, make sure you hand wash the socks before putting them on. This will make the fabric more flexible, which means the socks will be easier to put on. Try hand washing them in cool water with a mild laundry detergent., Since you will be wearing compression socks most of the time, they will wear out over several months. To make sure your compression socks are still doing their job, replace them every 3-6 months with a new pair.Replace socks that are stretched out or have holes in them, regardless of how old they are.

, If possible you should wash compression socks after each use. Hand wash the socks in cool water and use a mild laundry detergent. Allow them to air dry.

To use, swirl the Polish Rag in the polish, then apply the Rag to the shoe and swirl the polish in small circular motions.,
Add Polish.,
Apply the Brush.,
Buff the shoes with the Buffing Rag.",How to Use Shoe Shining Tool," The Rag is an ordinary piece of clothing or hand towel that is made of cotton, with the rag also being thick and smooth. With the rag being thick and smooth, it is easier to clean and does not become stiff to where it is uncomfortable to use.;
, The Polish is the wax or cream that is applied to the shoe. To use, refer to the Polish Rag on how its used. When applied to the shoe, the shoe becomes dull, but then is buffed off and makes the shoe shiny and water resistant.The Polish can come in a variety of colors, most being black but the Polish can also be blue. The Polish comes inside of a round tin for wax, and inside of a tube or little glass jar for cream. The wax will make a better shine, but seals the shoe to where it can't breath, and shortens the life span of the shoe. The cream will make a duller shine, but will be absorbed by the shoe and will not decrease the lifespan of the shoe.

, The Brush is a wooden block containing nylon or horsehair bristles that can be scrubbed against the shoe to brush off any dust, boot polish, or dirt. To use, scrub the shoe with little pressure and quick brushing motions. The nylon bristles are usually stiffer and can scrub off debris easier than horsehair brushes, but scratch the leather easier. Horsehair is softer and won't scratch the leather and will also buff the shoes a bit, too.

, The Buffing Rag is used to buff the shoes quickly to that glossy shine. To use, hold each end of the Rag, apply the middle of the Rag to the toe with moderate pressure, and then scrub the toe left to right very quickly. Then ball up the Rag, and then scrub the shoe with moderate pressure. The Buffing Rag is a 4 to 6 inch (10.2 to 15.2 cm) wide rag that is about 1 and a half foot long. It is made of cotton or nylon.


Optional 1, Polish Brush. The Polish Brush is used to apply the polish to the shoe, similar to the Polish Rag. The Polish Brush is used the same like the Polish Rag also. The Polish Brush, however, can prevent large build ups of polish and can get in crevices that the rag cannot. The Polish Brush can scratch the shoe however.






Optional 2, Water Sprayer. The Water Sprayer can add a small amount of water to a certain surface to add with polishing. Use by pointing the nozzle of the sprayer at the desired location and pull the trigger to spray water.






Optional 3, Shoe Shining Box. The Box can help out with containing all of your equipment for shoe shining in a small area. The Box can also have a foot rest on top to aid with the buffing of the shoe. The box can be maid with a wide choice of materials, with wood being the most common.






Optional 4, Heating Device. This Heating Device is anything that can heat the shoe polish to where it melts. This melting of the polish can aid with making the black mirror of the military honor guard's shoe's, but can also clump the polish up, making the shoe look bad. The objects used for heating can be a hair dryer to a stick lighter. Use by applying the heat directly to the shoe polish until it starts to melt then apply the melted polish to the shoe.

Get your foot measured at a shoe store.,
Measure your foot yourself.,
Put the heels on your feet.,
Stand up in the heels.,
Inspect the heel area.,
Inspect the toe area.,
Inspect the sides of your feet.,
Walk around the heels.",How to Know if You're Wearing the Right Size High Heels," Most, if not all, shoe stores will have the necessary tools to properly measure your foot. Some stores have a carpeted scale on which you can place your foot to find your shoe size. There are also devices that can fit around your foot and adjust to your foot dimensions in order to determine your shoe size. If you can’t find these tools around the store where you are shopping, simply ask a store employee if they could help you measure the size of your foot.Getting the proper measurements of your foot will allow you to pick out shoes that fit your foot best. An accurate shoe fitting can improve comfort, security, and appearance.;
, Use a pencil, and trace the outline of both of your feet on two separate sheets of paper. Be sure to trace as close to your foot as possible.After you have traced all around both of your feet, use a ruler to measure front the top most part of your foot (at your toes), to the bottom of your heel. Then, measure across the width of your foot from the furthermost edges. Your traced foot should now have a giant cross in the middle of it.


Lined notebook paper may work best for tracing your feet since it has straight lines to take measurements from. However, any sheet of paper will do.

, Slide your feet into the heels and secure them with any straps or buckles that need to be closed. This will be the first indication if the heel fits. Your feet should fit snugly into the heels..


If you struggle significantly to fit your feet into the heels, the heels are probably too small. In this case, you most likely need to go up a half or whole size.
If your feet slide into the heels too easily, and there is a lot of room between the insides of the heels and your feet, the heels are probably too big. In this case, you most likely need to go down a half or whole size.

, Once the heels are secured on your feet, stand up straight and notice how your feet feel. Do your feel pinching anywhere? Is any part of your foot (heel, toes, side) hanging off or outside of the shoe? Are there any areas of the shoe that aren’t making contact with your foot that should (like the heel)? If you feel any immediate discomfort or exceptional looseness before even walking in the heels, you can assume that you need to make adjustments in the shoe sizing.


Try inspecting how the shoes look with the help of a mirror. A mirror can give you an added perspective.

, While standing, the heel of the shoe should rest on your skin. If there is any room between the skin of your heel and the heel of the shoe, it should be no more than about ¾ cm to 1 cm. That is because while wearing heels, your feet are likely to expand and swell. If there is about 1 cm (or a tad less) of room between your heel and the shoe, you give yourself room for your foot to inevitably and comfortably swell.


If the heel of the shoe is cutting into, squeezing, or scraping the skin of your heel, the shoe is probably too small. Wearing heels that are too small can give you cuts and blisters on your heels.
If your foot is sliding or lifting out of the back of the shoe, or there is more than 1 cm of room between your heel and the heel of the shoe, the shoe is probably too big. Wearing heels that are too big makes for too much movement in the shoe. This movement creates friction between your skin and the heel that can also give blisters.

, While standing, your toes should be positioned at the front tip of the shoe. This will vary since there are closed toe boxes, peep toe boxes, and open toe boxes. However, regardless of the style of toe box, your toes should feel comfortable in the shoe. Are your toes pushed together tightly, with little to no wriggle room? If you can see your toes, do they look red or purple? Does the upper, top part of your foot bulge outward from the shoe? Your toes should fit securely in the front of the toe box, but have a little bit of spacing to wriggle around.


If the heels clearly feel too tight and uncomfortable in the toe area, they are probably too small.
If your toes are hanging off the front edge of the shoe, or have too much wiggle space (as in you can move your toes around significantly), the heels are most likely too big.

, While standing, the sides of your feet should remain within the parameters of the heel. This means that the sides of your feet should touch the inside edges of the heel comfortably. Your feet should not bulge out from the sides of the heel, and there should not be excessive space between the edges of your feet and the insides of your heel. Excessive space on the edges of the heel means you can comfortably fit a finger or two in between your foot and the heel of the shoe.


If your foot bulges out from the heel in any way, or exceeds any of it’s natural parameters, the shoe is most likely too small.
If there is excessive space between the sides of your feet and the inside edges of the heel, the heel is probably too big.

, You can’t fully know how the heels fit until you practice walking around in them.Make sure both of the heels are adjusted to the same tightness, and walk up and down the aisles of the store. Consider walking around to be a live test run of how you will actually feel wearing the heels. Remember to inspect the key fitting areas of the heels (heel, toes, sides) as you walk around.


Most often, uncomfortable rubbing or noticeable spacing becomes evident while walking around with the heels on. That is why walking in the heels before you buy them is so important.

Remove white marks from your boots.",How to Clean Rubber Boots," If your boots aren’t especially dirty, you can usually clean them easily with a damp cloth. To prevent dirtiness from building up on your boots and causing longer cleaning times, do this after each time you use your boots.To increase the dirt fighting potential of your damp cloth, mix 1 tsp (5 ml) of dish soap with a ¼ gallon (1 L) of water. Douse your rag in this, and wipe down the boots.
Wipe your boots from the top to the bottom. This way, you’re less likely to cause dirt and grime to drip onto already cleaned parts of the boots.;
, Take your boots to a suitable area in your yard and spray them thoroughly with water from a hose. It may take some time before the dirtiness loosens and comes off. After most of the dirtiness has been removed, wipe away any that remains with a damp cloth.








If you do not have a suitable place in your yard to do this, or if you do not have a yard, wash your boots in your bathtub or shower instead.
For mud that just doesn’t want to come off, combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of baking soda with ½ cup (237 ml) of warm water. Rub this onto the stubborn mud, wait 15 to 30 minutes, then rinse the solution and the mud free., Use caution when using a brush on your boots. Stiff bristle brushes, especially, can do damage to the boots or cause them to discolor. Use a soft bristle scrub brush to prevent damage. Avoid using a brush on the upper parts of the brush.









Use moderate to light pressure when scrubbing. Failing to do so can cause premature wear on the rubber.
Use an old toothbrush to get into the small grooves on the soles of your boots., Over time, your rubber boots may have become scuffed, creating unsightly discoloration. Apply some oil, like olive oil, to a soft cloth. Rub the cloth on the scuff marks in a circular fashion to erase these.









If the rag-oil technique didn’t work on your scuff marks, try a normal gum eraser, like the kind you use for pencils. Apply this gently to scuff marks to make them disappear., Air drying is the best way to dry rubber boots. Wipe away the moisture from cleaning them as best you can with a clean, dry rag. Then insert wads of newspaper into each boot. Wait a few hours, then remove the wet newspaper from the boots. If the boots are still wet, repeat this process.


Newspaper will not only absorb moisture in your boots, it will also help them keep their shape., If you need your boots for another excursion shortly after you’ve cleaned them, wipe away the water as best you can with a dry rag. Then aim a hair dryer set to “low” at the inside of each boot until they are dry., Combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of dishwashing liquid with about a ¼ of a gallon (1 L) of hot water in a bucket. Agitate this with your hand or a stirring utensil to distribute the soap throughout the water. 







, Douse a clean rag in your cleaning solution. Use this to thoroughly wipe the inside of each boot. Do this several times, rinsing your rag regularly in the solution throughout the process. After that, use a wet, clean rag to wipe away the soap.







, Take a spray bottle and fill it half with white vinegar and half with water. Liberally spray this solution on the inside of the boot. The acid in the vinegar should kill the bacteria and organisms causing the bad odor.







, You can protect the outer surface of your boots and add shine to them with an automotive tire protectant. These can be found at most general retailers, in the automotive section of big box stores, and at automotive stores.









Apply tire protectant to your boots every six months to achieve the best results., Direct sunlight will cause the rubber of your boots to break down. When you’re not wearing your boots, store them in a paper bag to shield them from the light.


If you plan on drying your boots outside, do so in a place that doesn’t receive direct sunlight., In humid or hot weather, your boots may develop white marks or a similar film, which is often called “blooming.” This is caused by compounds in the rubber rising to the surface. This is completely natural and will not harm your boots. Remove this by using:









A rag with a few drops of olive oil to wipe down your boots. Use a circular motion while wiping, and the marks should disappear.
Specially designed rubber boot shining products or a boot buffer. These can be found at most general retailers and shoe stores."

Prepare some soapy water.,
Wipe your shoes down with a damp cloth.,
Dry them off.",How to Clean Rainbow Sandals1," You will want to use lukewarm water, as warm or hot water may damage the leather soles of your Rainbow sandals. Add a drop or two of dish soap and stir to combine., Dip a corner of a clean rag into the soapy water, and squeeze it a bit to get rid of excess water. Gently dampen and wipe off dirty areas with small circular motions.If there are any particularly dirty areas that are too much for the wet cloth to handle, a soft bristled brush like an old toothbrush can come in handy.Take care only to rub hard enough to dislodge dirt, without damaging the leather.

, Using a clean paper towel, wipe off any dampness on your sandals. Make sure to do a thorough job, as soap residue can damage the leather.It’s a good idea to let them air dry in the sun before you wear them again, just to be sure they have totally dried off.

Leave them out in the sun.,
Use rubbing alcohol.,
Spritz them with vodka.,
Apply baking soda.",How to Clean Rainbow Sandals2," Before you move on to more involved methods, try taking a hiatus from wearing your Rainbow sandals, and just leave them to dry in the sun for a few days. If they are just beginning to smell, the ultraviolet rays and fresh air may be all they need.Even if it doesn’t totally solve the problem, it’s a good idea to make sure your sandals are totally dry before you try cleaning them.

, Highly concentrated alcohol can help eliminate unwanted odors. Wet a couple paper towels with rubbing alcohol (they should be damp, but not soaking wet), and drape them over the parts of your sandals that come into contact with your feet. Let them sit for a couple hours, or until the paper towels dry out., Like rubbing alcohol, this can help neutralize bad smells. Put a little bit of vodka in a spray bottle, and mist your sandals with it. Let them air dry in the sun for several hours., This substance is highly effective at absorbing all sorts of unwanted odors. Put your Rainbow sandals in a 1 gallon (3.8 L) ziplock bag, and pour in a half cup of baking soda. Seal the bag and shake it vigorously, coating the sandals thoroughly. Leave them in there for a couple days before you remove them.It may take a little effort, but you should be able to get all the baking soda off your shoes by banging them together and wiping them off with a clean rag.

Wash your feet thoroughly.,
Dry your feet off well.,
Spray on some foot antiperspirant.,
Give your feet some sun.",How to Clean Rainbow Sandals3," Having clean feet will go a long way to ensuring that your Rainbow sandals stay clean and odor-free. Keep a bar of deodorizing soap in the shower, and use a washcloth to vigorously scrub your feet. Not only will this remove dirt and grime that can stain your sandals, but it will also slough off the dead skin cells that contribute to smelly shoes., When you get out of the shower, don’t stop drying yourself off when you get to your ankles. Do a thorough job of toweling off your feet, including between your toes, to discourage any fungi from setting up shop.If you have trouble with foot fungus, you may want to consider using a daily foot powder.

, This is a good idea if you have particularly sweaty feet. While foot powders absorb sweat, antiperspirants actually stop your feet from sweating to begin with. If you find yourself constantly sweating into your sandals, spraying some on in the morning could go a long way to keeping them cleaner., Odor-causing fungus thrives in damp, dark areas, like the soles of your shoes. Try to spend some time every day barefoot, ideally outdoors, with your feet up and the sun shining on them. Just make sure you give your feet a good rinsing and drying off if they get dirty.

, Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle. Pad the washer with plenty of old towels.


Use warm water and a mild detergent to get them clean. If they are already wet, it may be the perfect time to clean them.

,, It doesn’t need to be very full.

, Pair your shoes side by side with the toes up. Set the soles of the shoes against the inside of the dryer door.

, Then, carefully and firmly shut the door. Your laces should extend out of the dryer when the door is closed.Hanging the shoes on the door will keep them from knocking around in the basin. If they are left to tumble, they may ruin the dryer or the shoe’s soles.

Keep dance shoes dry.,
Limit how often your children wear their shoes.,
Invest in high quality shoes.,
Use heel protectors.,
Brush the soles of dance shoes.,
Clean your shoes properly.,
Let dance shoes air dry.",How to Care for Kid's Dancewear1," Shoes have a tendency to fray, especially satin shoes. To prevent shoes from fraying, avoid getting your shoes wet. Make sure your kids do not walk around in their shoes while it's raining. Avoid leaving your shoes anywhere they may accidentally get wet, such as near the front door., Only allow your kids to wear their dance shoes during practice. Preventing stains in general, not just wet shoes, can cut back on fraying as it reduces the frequency you need to clean the shoes., While higher quality satins may be pricier, they are less prone to fraying than other brands and will therefore need replacing less often. When selecting footwear for your kids, go for pricier shoes made from higher quality materials.


It can help to ask a dance coach or another parent for recommendations for high quality shoes.

, Heel protectors are placed on the tip of a shoe's heel. They protect heels from damage such as scuffing. You can buy them online and in most stores that sell dance equipment. Heel protectors are highly recommended, as they can protect dance shoes from a lot of damage.Some competitions actually require heel protectors to protect the floor from scuffing during dancing.

, Invest in a quality shoe brush. You can buy one online or in stores that sell dance supplies. Brushing the shoes on a regular basis will help remove dirt and debris and prevent the material on the soles from wearing down. This prevents shoes from sliding around on the floor while your kids are dancing.The precise frequency of brushing depends on how often shoes are used. Shoes that are used frequently will need to be brushed more often.

, Dance shoes should be cleaned promptly if they get dirt or debris stuck to them. Melamine foam, or a similar substance, can be used to blot stains out of dance shoes. Always look for a cleaner specifically designed to clean your shoe's material. For example, use a stain cleaner on satin shoes.Always do a spot test of any new cleaner on a small portion of the shoe first. Dab on the cleaner and check later to see if it's caused any damage or discoloration. If it has not, the cleaner is safe to use on the whole shoe., Dance shoes should never be placed in a dryer for washing. This can cause them to wear out easily and damage delicate fabrics like satin. If you wash dance shoes, always allow them to air dry."

Allow the deglazer to dry.,
Mix the dye.,
Apply the dye.,
Use an intermediate color if necessary.,
Allow the boots to dry.,
Apply polish.,
Brush off excess polish.",How to Dye Leather Boots," Mix one ounce of leather bleach and one pint of water. Apply this mixture to your boots using a stiff brush. Scrub vigorously to remove any dirt that is on your boots.If you do not have any leather bleach, use a leather cleaner to remove any dirt.


Take the time to thoroughly clean your boots. The more dirt you remove, the better the final outcome will be.
Use circular motions as you scrub your boots.;
, Once your boots are clean, you must remove the protective coating. Your boots were likely treated with some type of protective finish when they were initially dyed. A deglazer will remove this coating so the dye can be absorbed. To get the best results, you need to remove all of this before you apply the dye. Use a wet cloth or sponge to rub the deglazer all over your boots.The finish and some of the color will come off when you apply the deglazer.
You may want to do this outside because the fumes can be very strong.
Use a white cloth or rag because you do not want the color from the rag to bleed onto your boots.Use a toothbrush to get the areas between the sole and upper.

, Wait for the deglazer to evaporate. This usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes.Once your boots have dried, run a damp rag over your boots to make sure you that you have removed all the protective finish. If you still see some shiny areas on your boots, you need to deglaze them again.Removing the protective finish is critical to a successful dye job. The dye will not penetrate your boots if the protective finish is still there.
If you have to apply the deglazer multiple times, you may want to let your shoes dry overnight.

, Put on some rubber or latex gloves to protect your hands. Turn the bottle of dye upside down and shake it. Also stir the mixture to loosen any of the pigment that has settled to the bottom of the bottle.Pour the dye into a disposable container.


Always read the instructions that come with the dye.
If you are creating an intermediate color, go ahead and mix the dyes at this time. The basic rules of color mixing apply to leather dyes as well. For example, yellow and blue can be mixed to make green.You can dilute the dye with water to adjust the color. Play around with the water-to-dye ratio and test the color on swatches before you apply the dye to your boots.

, Use a sponge brush, paint brush, or cloth to apply the dye to your boots. Apply a thin coat of the dye using long,even strokes in the same direction (e.g. vertical or horizontal).Allow the dye to dry for 30 minutes, and then apply a second coat.Some dyes will come with an application brush. However, use whatever tool is most comfortable for you.
If you are not satisfied with the color after the second coat, you can apply a third coat. Always allow the coat to dry for 30 minutes each time.
If you apply your first coat using horizontal brushes, apply the second coat using vertical brushes. This will ensure an even application of the dye.
Consider using a small paintbrush for fine details and hard to reach areas, such as the spot where the sole and the heel meet the leather.
Test a small area before you apply the dye to your entire boot.

, Dyes work best if you are going from a lighter to a darker color. If you are making a drastic color change, use an intermediate color to achieve better results. The first color you use will neutralize the original color on your boots. Then follow up that color with your desired final color.If you are going from white to black, dye the shoes green or blue first and finish with black.

, Can you see the entire silhouette of your foot, or is it more of an outline, with just heels and toes showing?

, There will be a noticeable curve inward, but not by more than 3/4 of an inch at its greatest part. If this is the kind of silhouette your foot makes, then you have normal feet. Otherwise...

, Your footprint will look like a foot-shaped blob. There will be almost no inward curve from your big toe to your heel; there may even be an outward curve. This means that you've got flat feet. If your footprint looks like neither, then...

, Your toe and heel show, but there is little in between. If this is the case, you probably have a high arch foot.

,

Normal Feet - Stability shoes offer a good blend of cushioning, medial support (to limit excessive inward rolling of the foot, which can cause injury) and durability. To provide stability, they have features that provide a firmer density under the inner edge of your foot. They are usually built on a semi-curved last.
Flat Feet - Motion control shoes are the most rigid, control-oriented running shoes. They're designed to slow down or limit extreme inward rolling of the foot and ankle, which can cause injury. These are heavier but very durable.
High Arched Feet - Cushioned shoes generally have the softest mid-soles and the least added stability. They’re usually built semi-curved or curved to encourage foot motion, which is helpful for runners who have rigid, immobile feet.

Allow the insoles to air dry.",How to Clean Shoe Insoles1," Lift the insoles from the footbed and slide them out the opening. Brush off any loose dirt, dust, lint or other debris so that you can focus your attention on the more soiled spots. Place recently worn insoles somewhere nearby to air out before you begin cleaning.









If your shoes don’t have removable insoles, you’ll have to carefully clean inside the shoe by hand. An unused toothbrush can come in handy in these situations.
Put machine washable shoes through a gentle cycle while you work on the insoles.;
, Fill the sink or a separate bucket and squeeze in a few drops of a mild liquid dish detergent that will blend easily in water. Stir the soap and water together to form a solution.








Hot water will work better than cold for loosening stuck-on dirt and stains.
In most cases, a gentle scrub with soap and water will be enough to eliminate unpleasant smells from lightly-worn insoles., A nylon dish brush or similar tool will work well for this purpose. Wet the bristles and shake off the excess solution. You only want to use a small amount of soapy water at a time to prevent the insoles from getting too wet.








The key to successfully cleaning most shoe insoles is not to oversaturate them with water. Too much moisture can damage insoles made from leather, foam and composite materials.You can also use a soft dish sponge regular cotton washcloth to do your scrubbing.

, Work the soap solution into the surface of the insoles using tight, circular scrubbing motions. Concentrate on the areas around the heel and toes where stenches and stains are most noticeable. Once you’re finished with the top of the insoles, flip them over and go over the bottoms as well.








Rewet the brush with fresh soap solution as needed.
After scrubbing the insoles, clear away visible soap residue with a clean cloth or sponge., Now the the insoles have been cleaned, you’ll want to make sure they’ve had a chance to dry completely before wearing them again. This will prevent odor-causing bacteria from returning, as they’re drawn to warm, moist places. Once they’ve dried sufficiently, slide them back into your shoes and put them through their paces.You can speed up the drying process by leaving the insoles in a well-ventilated area or propping them up near an air conditioner or space heater.
If the weather is good, place the insoles out in the sun to dry. Not only will this air them out faster, the UV radiation from sunlight will actually help kill any lingering germs that the soap solution may have missed."

Mix together alcohol and water in a small spray bottle.,
Spray the insoles with the alcohol mixture.,
Set the insoles aside to dry.",How to Clean Shoe Insoles2," Pour in an equal amount of each liquid and shake thoroughly to make sure they’re properly distributed.








Regular isopropyl alcohol has powerful antibacterial properties, making it perfect for cleaning delicate clothing items.
If you don’t happen to have any rubbing alcohol on hand, a slightly higher concentration of distilled white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide will also do the trick. Be warned, however—vinegar can leave behind its own odor that may take a few wears to fade., Place the insoles on a flat, waterproof surface. Give each one a generous misting on both sides. Use as much alcohol as you need. It dries quickly, so there’s no need to worry about getting the insoles too wet.








As an alternative to a spray bottle, you can soak the corner of a clean cloth in alcohol and rub it into the insoles by hand.
This method can be used to clean the rest of the shoe, as well.

, Relocate them outside or somewhere else where they can receive plenty of airflow. The alcohol will soon evaporate and take the water with it, leaving your insoles clean, disinfected and smelling fresh again.Don't wear the shoes again until they've had time to dry. Doing so will just introduce new germs and moisture.

Fill a large container with baking soda.,
Place the insoles inside the container.,
Let the insoles sit overnight.,
Remove and replace the insoles.",How to Clean Shoe Insoles3," Shake a few ounces of the baking soda into a Tupperware container or quart-sized Ziploc bag.









Make sure that the container you choose has a lid or some other means of closing and sealing.
Baking soda is often touted for its ability to absorb and trap stubborn smells so that they can be dealt with without the need for deep-cleaning., Slip the insoles into the baking soda so that they’re completely submerged. It may help to position them upside down so that the entire upper surface will stay in constant contact with the powder. The more surface area the baking soda covers, the better it will work.








The insoles should be mostly dry before you apply the baking soda.
If you’re unable to find a suitable container, set the insoles out and sprinkle the baking soda directly over the top., Seal the container and find an out of the way place to store it. By the time you wake up the following morning, the baking soda should have locked in the strongest odors.For best results, the baking soda should be allowed to do its thing for at least 6-8 hours.
Baking soda is one of the simplest solutions for persistent odors, as it doesn’t require any scrubbing, wiping or washing., Open the container and dispose of the baking soda. Shake the remaining powder off of the insoles and let them sit out in the open for a few minutes before putting them back in your shoes. Afterwards, you should no longer be able to notice any unwanted smells.








Baking soda treatments can be used as often as you need to keep your insoles from stinking up your shoes.

Prohibit dirty shoes from touching the wrestling mat.,
Use the proper kind of disinfectant in the proper manner.,
Focus on the soles of the shoes.,
Give wrestlers a convenient place to wipe their shoe bottoms.",How to Clean Wrestling Shoes1," For as long as there have been wrestlers, they have had to deal with various communicable skin conditions like ringworm and impetigo, as well as other viral, fungal, and bacterial illnesses. Unfortunately, contaminated shoe bottoms are one of the major culprits for spreading germs and disease.Whether you’re a wrestler, coach, official, or parent, make it the rule that wrestling shoes must be disinfected properly before a wrestler can set foot on the mat.;
, To disinfect wrestling shoes, use a low level disinfectant spray or cleaner with virucidal, fungicidal, and bactericidal properties. Lysol Brand IC is a popular choice, but brand names are less important than the ingredients and disinfecting properties.Follow the product instructions precisely for mixing and using the solution, and regarding how much and how long it takes to properly disinfect a surface.

, While you can wipe down the entire pair of shoes, the main problem area tends to be the soles on the bottom. Wrestling shoes that are regularly washed and properly maintained don’t necessarily need to be disinfected from top to bottom every time. But treat the soles of even the cleanest, newest shoes as contaminated until they have been properly disinfected on the spot., While spraying or wiping down the shoes at the mat’s edge and then putting them on will work, it’s not always the most convenient option. Instead, place towels that have been saturated in the disinfecting solution at the edge of the mat, and have each wrestler thoroughly clean their shoe soles on this makeshift doormat.You can also purchase doormat-type products made to clean the bottoms of wrestling shoes and apply disinfectant.

Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for cleaning the shoes.,
Set the washer to cold water, and try a gentle wash and spin.,
Air dry the shoes.,
Get more aggressive with beat-up or really stinky shoes.",How to Clean Wrestling Shoes2," Shoemakers often recommend that you not put basketball or tennis shoes in a washing machine (or especially a clothes dryer), although most shoes will probably survive the process just fine. Because of their ruggedness and quick-dry construction, though, you’ll usually find a recommendation that wrestling shoes can be put in the wash.Check the tag on the shoes, or call or visit the website of the shoe company.

, Unless otherwise recommended by the shoemaker, start with the least aggressive wash settings. Add a few old towels to limit the shoes’ banging against the wash drum, or put them in a pillowcase. Add a normal or perhaps slightly lesser amount of detergent.Take out any removable insoles and shoestrings before starting the wash. You can wash them along with the shoes.

, If you have the time, it’s easier on the shoes to skip the clothes dryer. Place some newspaper inside the shoes and stick them in an airy, sunny spot if possible.Remember, most wrestling shoes are made to dry quickly, so they may be completely dry within several hours, if not certainly overnight.

, If your shoes are well-worn, filthy, and nearing the end of their useful lives, you don’t have much to lose by adjusting the washing machine to the warm or hot water settings. Set it to a regular wash cycle, but keep it on a low spin setting. Use towels or a pillowcase to reduce clanging and possible impact damage.If you’re in a rush or aren’t overly worried about the minor risk to your shoes, go ahead and put them in the dryer as well. But don’t get too daring — put the dryer on its low heat setting. And throw the old towels from the wash in as well.

Wipe the shoes with warm water and dish soap.,
Try toothpaste for stubborn stains or scuffs.,
Clean shoelaces and any inserts separately.,
Deodorize the shoes often.",How to Clean Wrestling Shoes3," Lightly moisten the shoes’ exteriors with a clean cloth dipped in plain, warm water. Add a few drops of dish soap to the water and swish it around. Dip another clean cloth, or a soft-bristled brush (like a shoe brush or toothbrush) into the solution and wipe the shoe down. Wipe away soap residue with a final clean cloth dampened with just water.Most wrestling aficionados recommend using your shoes only on the mat, so they probably won’t have caked-on dirt on them. If they do, though, wipe that away with a clean, dry brush or cloth before proceeding.

, Add a small dab of plain, white toothpaste to either your first two fingers, a clean cloth, or a soft brush that has been dipped in the dish soap solution. Scrub the stain or scuff in a circular motion. Wipe away the toothpaste with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat as needed.


A toothpaste scrub can be particularly helpful for scuffs on the rubberized areas on the soles or toes of the shoes.
Instead of toothpaste, you can also make a paste with baking soda and water. Use a few spoonfuls of baking soda, and stir in small amounts of water until you achieve a toothpaste consistency., Whether you’re washing your wrestling shoes by machine, by hand, or both, it’s most effective to remove the laces and any inserts. You can use the same hand soap cleaning solution, or just machine wash them.Cleaning insoles or inserts with the baking soda paste may help with odor control as well.
Make sure the laces and inserts are fully dry before re-inserting them.
It’s best to replace worn or frayed laces — you don’t want them to snap in the middle of a match!

, Wrestling shoes can get very stinky very quickly, especially after a few sweaty practices or meets. Regular washing will help, but you should also regularly deodorize the insides as well. Commercial shoe deodorizers are a solid option, but you can also try some DIY solutions.


Try, for instance, sprinkling baking soda into the shoes overnight. This works best if the shoes are already completely dry.Or, try placing a dryer sheet into each shoe overnight."

Read the instructions.,
Wash and clean your shoe soles.,
Create paper cutouts of the areas you don’t wish to re-ice.,
Apply the re-icing agent to the sole of the shoe.,
Apply the paper cutouts.,
Wrap the sole with plastic wrap.,
Place your shoe in the sun with its sole facing up.,
Monitor your sole’s temperature.,
Clean the sole off.,
Take the wrapping paper from the shoebox.,
Store your shoes with silica packets.,
Keep your shoes in a cool, dark place.",How to Re‐Ice Shoe Soles," Before you begin using a cleaning agent on the shoes whose soles you wish to re-ice, ensure that the compound is compatible with your shoe. The instructions on the product’s use label should indicate which shoes or shoe materials it can be used with.If you do not see your shoes’ brand or shoe material listed on the cleaning agent’s label, reach out to the customer service department of the shoe company that manufactured your shoes and/or the manufacturer of the product you intend to use to re-ice your soles. Ask them if the product is acceptable for the shoes you wish to re-ice.;
, Use a damp, soapy cloth, to wipe the sole down. Be sure to work the cloth into the cracks and crevices of the sole. This will prepare your soles to receive the cleaning agent.If your sole is particularly grimy, you could utilize a specialized shoe cleaning product and a stiff bristled brush to clean your shoe sole. Follow up by using a sponge with a dish scrubber to wipe away any remaining grime., Your shoe sole probably includes some areas that do not need to be re-iced. These areas include the rubber traction pads and the carbon fiber portion of the shoe (often located near the inside of the heel). These cutouts will reduce the surface temperature of the sole when it is exposed to sunlight later.To make the cutouts for these areas, place a piece of paper over the shoe’s sole. Trace around the area that you do not wish to re-ice.
Cut around the area that you traced.

, Most of the time, you can simply squirt a bit of the re-icing agent out and onto the yellowed sole. Using a paintbrush, spread the re-icing agent across the area of the sole that requires re-icing. Ensure the product is distributed evenly in a coat of medium thickness across the area of the sole you wish to re-ice.Alternately, you could pour a bit of the re-icing agent into a small bowl or, better yet, a disposable container like a Styrofoam takeout container or clean yogurt container. Then, dip the paintbrush in the re-icing agent and apply it to the sole as needed.
As much as possible, avoid getting the re-icing agent on other parts of the shoe., Once you’re done applying the re-icing agent to the shoe, apply the paper cutouts you made earlier. Roll a piece of tape up so that it is sticky on all sides. Stick this tape to the paper you cut out and press it into the corresponding area.These paper cutouts will help the bottom of your shoe maintain a low temperature as you re-ice the sole.

, The best way to do this is to wrap all or most of the shoe in plastic wrap. Tuck excess cling wrap into the hole where your foot enters the shoe. Wrapping your shoe in plastic wrap will prevent the re-icing agent from evaporating when exposed to sunlight. It will also prevent the re-icing agent from dripping down the sides of the shoe too much., The best way to do this is to place a water bottle in a position perpendicular to the upside-down shoe so that the bottle supports the toe of the shoe. Alternately, if you are not re-icing both shoes at once, you could place the shoe’s counterpart in the position opposite it. In this way, the toes of the shoe you are re-icing will sit atop the toes of the other shoe in the pair.If you’re in an area with little sunlight or if the weather is foul and you cannot leave your shoes outside, you can place the shoes beneath a UVB light.

, The best time to place your shoes outside is typically early in the morning before the temperature rises too high. If your shoe sole’s temperature rises to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) or more, bring your shoe inside. Use an infrared temperature gauge to identify the temperature of the shoe sole.There is no schedule according to which you must conform when re-icing your soles. If the temperature remains within the acceptable range, you can leave your shoe out in the sun as long as you’d like.
The acceptable temperature range is below 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius). Should your shoe exceed the acceptable temperature range, bring it inside. The longer you leave the shoe out, the more iciness will be recovered.
You must use an infrared temperature gauge to monitor the temperature of the shoe sole. Directions for use vary according to the infrared temperature gauge you use. Generally, you will need to turn the infrared temperature gauge on, then aim it at the shoe and check the gauge’s digital readout. Consult manufacturer directions for more information.

, Remove and discard the cling wrap, then remove and discard the paper cutouts. Turn your sink faucet on, allowing just a trickle of warm water to come out. Move an old toothbrush through the water stream, then use it to scrub away the re-icing agent. Try not to get the upper or mid-sole wet.Hold the shoe at a slight tilt so that the water drips off the shoe rather than running down the sides.
Be sure to work the brush around all the cracks and crevices of the tread.

, The wrapping paper that shoes are packaged with is slightly acidic. Over time, it will cause your icy soles to yellow. If you keep your shoes in your shoebox, remove this packaging paper., Silica gel packets are commonly packaged with shoes and other products in order to control humidity and absorb moisture. They can also prevent your icy soles from yellowing. Instead of keeping your shoes by the door, place your icy-soled shoes in a shoebox with a few small silica gel packets (or one large silica gel packet).Do not put more than four small packs or one large packet in a single shoe box.

, If shoes are put through dramatic temperature changes (hot summers, cold winters), the material they are made from will become stressed and could turn yellow or start to crack. After removing the paper from the shoebox they came in, store your shoes in the box and store them in your closet or in your basement – wherever you believe the climate in your home will be most stable."

Wipe down the area with a soft cloth and warm water.,
Buff the area with a colorless shoe polish.,
Pick up some acrylic paint that matches the color of your shoes.,
Buy a bottle of Modge Podge and or Shoe Goo at a craft store.,
Apply a small bit of your paint to the scratched area.,
Gather all your repairing materials.,
Use a nail clipper to clip off any material that is sticking out or hanging off the shoe.,
Paint carefully over the sections that need to be repaired.,

Clean up any other areas of your shoes or boots.,
Spray and protect your shoes with waterproof spray.",How to Repair a Scrape on Faux Leather Shoes," Then dab the area with a little distilled white vinegar. Treat a small part of the affected area with the vinegar.


Take a small dab of distilled white vinegar on a paper towel and apply it to an area around the scratch.
The vinegar may cause the area to slightly swell. The faux leather will cover some of the scratches. The vinegar will also remove any stains like salt, cleaning the area. ;
, After you clean your shoes and apply the vinegar, wait until the area has dried. Then buff it out with a clear shoe polish.



Apply the polish in a circular motion to spread it evenly over the area. Use medium pressure to evenly distribute the polish without harming the shoe.
The clear shoe polish will not affect any of your shoe’s color. The buffing will help blend the affected and unaffected areas together.

, Take your shoe or boot to a home improvement or craft store and match the color of paint to your shoe color. You can buy paint in a variety of finishes. Try to match the sheen of your shoe as best you can with flat, eggshell, or glossy paint. Acrylic paint works best for painting your scratches and scrapes.

, Again, try to match the sheen of your shoe as closely as possible by getting matte, satin, or glossy Modge Podge.


Modge Podge is an all-in-one sort of glue, sealer, and finish. You can use it on a variety of crafting projects. But it also works well for treating faux leather shoes. Shoe Goo is a similar product that has a variety of shoe-related purposes. Shoe Goo can be used to glue, seal, and finish as well. Shoe Goo is essentially rubber in a tube. Once it is applied and dried, it becomes a strong, flexible rubbery material. It will dry clear as well. Depending on the damage you are trying to repair, you may find one to be better than the other. Or, you may want to use both.

, You should dab just a bit of paint once the polish has dried to a more hidden area to test how the paint looks on your shoe.


Dabbing a small bit of paint to test-treat the area will allow you to make sure that the paint color blends well with the color of your shoes. If it does, you’re ready to continue.

, You will now need your Modge Podge and or Shoe Goo, paint, paint brushes, small container for paint, paper towels, shoe polish, shoe spray, and a nail clipper or fine-grain sandpaper. You will want to use a small paintbrush so you only paint the scratches and not the larger area around the scratches.
You can use a nail clipper or fine-grain sandpaper to remove any loose material around your scratches. Nail clippers will allow you to be more precise. Sandpaper may be better for larger areas that are closer to the sole of your shoes or boots. , Your faux leather shoes or boots may have small flakes around your scratches. You want to remove these loose bits so you can cover up the scratch and not just press the broken flecks down. The area should be a smooth as possible.


Again, nail clippers or even tweezers will allow you to remove any material in a specific area. However, if you have a larger area that needs to be repaired, the sandpaper will be more effective at smoothing these larger areas out.

, With your shoes wiped down again and free of any excess material, it’s time to paint the scratches.


Using your small paintbrush, dip the tip into your container holding your paint. You don’t need a lot. Less is better so you don’t cause the paint to transfer unevenly.
Paint the scratches with smooth strokes. Let it sit for a minute or so. Wipe your brush on your paper towel to remove clumped paint.

, Repeat the process adding another coat using a little bit of paint at a time.


Keep applying new coats until you have painted the scratches to your liking.
Make sure to only use a small amount of paint with each coat. If the paint globs together you will end up with bubbles of paint on your shoes. Making the affected areas look uneven.

, After the paint is fully dry, use a very light coat of Modge Podge or Shoe Goo and paint over the general area to seal it.


It’s best to use a different paint brush when applying the Modge Podge or Shoe Goo. If you are only using one brush, make sure to rinse it well and wipe off any paint with a paper towel before using it.
After you’ve applied the Modge Podge or Shoe goo, wipe the brush on a piece of paper to get all the excess off. Then use the brush to carefully feather the edges of your painted area so that you don’t have any visible lines.
Shoe Goo is typically clear while Modge Podge paints on white. Don’t worry if the treatment has a color to it when painting on. Once it dries it will dry clear.

, Once everything is dry, give your shoes or boots a good polish with the correct color polish to match your shoe.


Polishing your shoes will help to fully blend all the areas of the shoe. Polish will smooth out any areas around your scratches that still stand out. As well as give your shoes a fresh look.
Depending on the severity of your scratches, you may want to apply polish after your paint but before you seal the areas. Polishing the scratched area and then sealing will make the polish under your sealant more permanent.

, Once you’ve treated the scratches, clean up any other areas that may still be dirty or need some work. If you have to wipe down most of your shoes, do so before polishing the entire shoe. Clean the rest of your shoes using the same method as before, with a clean cloth, water, and a little bit of white vinegar if you have salt or dirt you are trying to remove.


Admire your awesome work by completely cleaning your shoes so that your pair looks as good as new.
Let everything dry completely before wearing your shoes. If you wear your shoes or boots before letting everything set and dry you could cause cracks and scratches to reopen.

, Go the extra step and give your shoes or boots one more element of protection.


Use a waterproof spray and or shoe lube wax to protect your shoes from salt stains, water, and dirt.
This extra protective step will help to keep the treated areas from showing again. It will also prevent new areas from becoming as damaged.
If you spray your shoes, do so in a ventilated area.
Make sure that whatever spray or lube you are using is suitable for your faux leather shoes.

Rub a pencil-eraser over the scuff.",How to Remove Dark Scuffs From Shoes1," Before you do any kind of cleaning, you’ll have to make sure that the product you use is safe for the shoe’s material. Leather, suede, canvas or synthetic fabrics will all require different treatment, especially when you’re using harsher cleaners. You’ll be able to tell easily between soft suede, leather and canvas, but if you’re not sure, look at the shoe box, search online for similar shoes or ask an attendant at a shoe store what the shoe is made of., To clean scuffs off of leather, patent leather, synthetic leather or rubber shoes, use toothpaste. Using a toothbrush and a dab of toothpaste, scrub the scuff marks. Apply a little water to help the toothpaste foam up, then continue scrubbing off the scuffs with circular movements. Rinse or wipe the toothpaste off, then dry the shoe., For real/synthetic/patent leather or rubber shoes, use a cotton ball and nail-polish remover. Make sure the nail-polish remover is non-acetone, as varieties with acetone can damage your shoes. Pour the polish remover into a small cup, then dip a cotton ball into it. Once the cotton ball is a bit damp, begin rubbing the remover over the scuff marks, rubbing until they’re gone. , For canvas or other fabric shoes, use baking soda. Grab a toothbrush and two bowls. Pour a little baking soda into one bowl and some water into the other. Dip the toothbrush into the water and then into the baking soda, then scrub the scuffs. If it doesn’t lather enough, re-wet the brush and pour some baking soda directly onto the scuff, then scrub. Rinse or wipe away the baking soda when you’re finished., For canvas or other fabric shoes, use a bit of dish detergent. Using a wet toothbrush or rag, scrub a pea-sized drop of dish detergent across the scuffs. Keep scrubbing until you remove the scuffs, then rinse and wipe away any excess suds., This method can work for any shoe, but can be especially handy for suede. Suede shoes can be very difficult to clean, but a pencil eraser will help get rid of dry scuffs. Gently rub a pencil eraser over the scuff, making sure not to damage the fabric.

Use the spit-shine method.,
Try fire shining.",How to Polish Shoes," Shoe polishes are available in wax, cream and liquid forms. Waxes and creams are heavier and will feed the leather and protect the shoes from water damage. Liquid polishes are good for a quick and easy shine. Shoe polishes are available in a variety of colors -- you can buy specific shades to match the shoes you wish to polish, or you can buy a neutral polish which will work on a variety of shoe colors.






;
, You have a couple of options when it comes to applying your polish. Most people just use an old cotton t-shirt or other soft rag, however it is also possible to get specific polishing brushes with stiff, short bristles. These brushes are included in most shoe polishing kits, which you may choose to invest in. You will also need an old toothbrush or some q-tips to works the polish into hard-to-reach areas.








, A good horsehair shoe shining brush is the one essential tool you need to properly polish your shoes. It has longer, softer bristles than the polishing brush described above. It is used to brush excess polish from the shoes and to really work the remaining polish into the leather.








, If you want to add a shiny finish to your polished shoes, you will need to get your hands on a chamois, which is a type of soft leather cloth. Alternatively, you can use any soft, lint-free cloth, such as an old cotton t-shirt.








, Polishing shoes is a messy job, so protect your floor and furniture by laying down some old newspaper on your work area. You could also use brown paper bags.







, Before you begin polishing, it is important that you first clean your shoes to remove any built up dirt, salt or dust. Otherwise the dirt could get trapped beneath the polish or scratch the surface of the shoes. Brush the shoe vigorously with your horsehair brush to remove any debris.








Alternatively, use a dampened cloth to wipe all around the surface of the shoe. Just leave the shoes to dry completely before moving on to the next step.
At this point, you may also want to remove the laces from your shoes. This will give you easier access to the tongue of the shoe and will prevent any polish from getting on the laces.

, Dip the old t-shirt or polishing brush into your chosen polish and work it into the surface of the shoe, using small circular motions. Apply a medium pressure and make sure to coat the surface evenly, paying special attention to the toe and heel which get the most wear.









The easiest way to use an old t-shirt is to wrap the material tightly around your index and middle fingers and use them to work the polish into the shoes.
Use a toothbrush or q-tip to work the polish into the hard-to-reach places, such as the edge of the upper and the cracks in the tongue.
You may also want to apply polish to the sole of each shoe, in the space between the toe and heel which doesn't touch the ground.

, Once you have applied polish to the first shoe, set it aside on the newspaper and begin working on the second shoe. Each shoe will require about 15 to 20 minutes drying time.









If you feel like your shoes require another layer of polish, apply this second layer using the same technique as above.
Remember to use the minimum amount of polish necessary to cover the shoe. It is better to build-up multiple light layers than apply a single thick layer.

, Once any additional layers of polish have dried, grab your horsehair brush and remove the excess polish using short, quick strokes. Don't be afraid to put some elbow grease into it -- the heat generated from the vigorous brush strokes helps the polish to sink into the leather.









Most of the movement involved in these strokes should come from your wrist. Keep the rest of your arm stationary while your wrist quickly flicks the brush back and forth.
Make sure to evenly brush the surface of both shoes. When you are done, the shoes should have an even finish with a slight shine. If super shiny shoes are not your thing, you can stop here.

, The easiest way to add shine to your shoes is to use a soft cloth -- such as a chamois or an old cotton t-shirt -- to buff the shoes. Place one hand on either end of the cloth and work it across the shoe in a brisk side-to side motion.









Some people like to breath on the shoe (as if fogging a mirror) before buffing to increase shine.
If you like, you can place the first shoe on a shoe butler (or on your foot) to make this process easier.

, Spit shining is a method used in the military to achieve a hard shine. After you have applied the first layer of polish, spray a little water onto the shoes and work it into the surface of the shoe. Then dip the cloth in warm water and use it to apply a second layer of polish.








Keep repeating this process until you achieve the desired level of shine. Just make sure that you let each layer of polish dry fully before applying the next.
Spit shining can be done using a soft cloth or a number of cotton balls.

, Fire shining is a fun, if slightly dangerous, method of shining shoes. It involves lighting the shoe polish on fire for a couple of seconds, until it becomes melted and gooey. This melted polish is then applied to the shoes using the same technique as spit shining.









Once you have applied several layers of the melted polish, you can take the fire play once step further by using your lighter to evenly heat the polish on the surface of the shoe, until it melts and achieves a wet look.
Do not let the flame actually touch the shoe and move the lighter constantly, as if spray painting. Once the polish has evenly melted, allow it to dry.
Apply one final layer of polish, then buff the shoes with a soft cloth to achieve a high-glass shine."

It may take a couple of minutes to achieve noticeable scuff marks. Move on to other parts of the boot and then repeat on the second boot., Scouring pads are made out of steel and wool and are typically used to clean tough surfaces, which makes them great for making scuff marks.

Moisten the towel with the vinegar, and blot the stain without applying a lot of pressure to the area, to avoid spreading the mess. Repeat as necessary with clean sections of the towel until the stain is loosened and removed from the surface of the suede., Water can change the texture and even the color of the suede. If the boots are stained so deeply that talcum powder or cornmeal does not soak up the stain before it sets, take the boots to a professional cleaner.

, Apply the turpentine to an old sponge or rag, and rub it on the inside of the shoe. Make sure you are holding the shoe with one hand as you apply pressure to the inside of the stain. The paint will begin to come off onto the dry towel you placed on the outside of the shoe.









Make sure to be wearing a pair of rubber gloves when handling turpentine.
Continue to replace the dry cloth outside the shoe as it gets wet from the turpentine. The paint will also begin to transfer to the cloth.
Repeat until the stain has disappeared. Continue to apply turpentine to the sponge, and apply pressure to the area until the turpentine starts to take effect.

, Apply the detergent to a dry paper towel or old rag. Rub the outside of the shoe with the dry cloth on the affected area. This will help remove any leftover paint that remains set in the fabric.








, Use a bucket or laundry sink. Fill with hot water and submerge the shoes completely. Soak them for at least six hours.


Rub the stain with your thumbs every once in awhile to help remove dislodged paint while it soaks.

, Let them air dry, outside if possible. The stain should now be completely gone.









After being washed and dried, the canvas of the shoe may be a little tighter on your foot. However, the fabric will stretch out through continued wear.

Consider machine washing them.,
Fill your sink with warm, soapy water.,
Drop the slippers in and agitate them.,
Let them sit.,
Rinse the slippers.,
Remove the excess water.,
Let them dry.",How to Wash Slippers1," Cotton is one of the most common slipper materials. Just like cotton clothing, all cotton slippers will be washing machine safe.Use warm (not hot) to make sure you don’t shrink the slippers. Use a gentle cycle that won’t bang them out of shape.If you want to toss them in with the regular wash, use a washing machine bag like you’d use for a sweater.Use a low heat setting to dry. You can also allow them to air dry.;
, If you don’t want to risk machine washing those slippers, then you can hand wash cotton slippers.Use a stopper and fill your sink with warm, soapy water. A small dose of a mild laundry detergent will do.Hand-washing detergents will instruct you how much to use.

, You want to make sure that the soapy water saturates the material. Use your fingers or a gentle cloth to scrub the inside lining to penetrate the grime.

, The soap solution won’t hurt the cotton. Give the slippers a good ten minutes to soak after you give them the mild scrub.You’ll see the soapy water changing colors as it leaches out all the funk.

, After the slippers have soaked, go ahead and let the water out of the sink. Turn the faucet on at about the same warm setting as before and give the slippers a thorough rinse.Squish the slippers as you rinse like you would to get excess soap out of a sponge or luffa.


You can refill the sink with clean water to rinse them. Let them soak for ten minutes. You can also rinse them under the running faucet for two or three minutes to get all the soap out.

, Don’t actually wring the slippers. This can misshape them. Instead, press down on them at several points to remove the excess water.You can also squeeze them in a towel to absorb the excess water., Set the slippers aside to air dry. You can also use a warm setting on a blowdryer to dry them out.A blowdryer will also fluff the soft, cottony insides of the slippers.

Listen carefully to the squeaky shoe.,
Unlace the shoe.,
Remove the insole.",How to Get Squeaks Out of Air Jordan Sneakers1," Listen carefully to the shoe when it squeaks to hear the source of the squeaking. Place pressure on different parts of your foot with the shoe on. Rock it back and forth. Stand up on your toes.Most likely, the source of the squeaking will be the insole of your shoe. In some cases, friction from the tongue of the shoe may cause squeaking also.Visible damage to your shoe, like holes in its fabric or rubber, can sometimes cause squeaking.
If you know the source of the squeaking, you'll be able to target this area with de-squeaking techniques, which may resolve your problem faster.;
, This will give you easier access to the insole, which can be difficult to remove for Jordans. Pull the laces through the metal grommets of the shoe until they come free. Place them off to the side in a safe place.

, If your insole is not glued down, it will pull free easily. If it is glued, pull the tongue to further open the shoe. Work your fingers between the side of the shoe and the side of the insole. With firm, steady pressure, peel the insole up and remove it.


Be careful not to pull too hard, as this may damage or deform the insole. Replacement insoles can be bought at shoe stores, drug stores, and general retailers.
Some glue may remain on the bottom of the insole or sole. It may also be tacky. This is normal and should not harm your shoe."

Steep black teabags in hot water.,
Insert one teabag into each shoe.,
Leave the teabags in your shoes for about an hour.,
Drip essential oils on the insoles of your shoes.,
Distribute the oil across the insole.,
Stuff your shoes with oil-scented paper.Newspaper works well for this purpose.,
Fill two clean socks with clean cat litter.,
Place the cat litter filled socks into your shoes.If you notice that your socks cause your shoes to deform or otherwise change shape, you may want to remove some litter from the socks.,
Leave the socks in your shoes overnight.,
Tuck fabric softener sheets into your shoes.,
Wear your shoes with dryer sheets.,
Remove the dryer sheets when the odor is gone.,
Choose a suitable spray.,
Spray the inside of your shoe.,
Allow the shoes to dry and respray as needed.,
Place your footwear into a plastic bag.,
Put your shoes into a freezer.,
Thaw and dry your shoes.",How to Use Household Items to Remove Shoe Odors," Black tea has a high concentration of tannins, a substance that works well for killing odor-producing bacteria in your shoes. Steep two teabags, one for each shoe, in boiling water for two to three minutes.To prevent yourself from getting burned by a hot teabag, you may want to use a utensil for removal. A spoon, fork, or tongs can help you safely remove your teabags.
Allow your teabags to cool for a few minutes after removing it from the boiling water. This will make it easier to handle with your fingers.
For light odors, a single teabag per shoe may be enough to rid it of its bad smell. Odors that are especially strong may require several teabags.;
, The teabags should still be moist from being steeped. The moisture will allow the tannins to seep into the insole of your shoe to more effectively fight the odor-causing bacteria.For very strong odors, you may want to layer extra teabags along the entire length of each insole from the toe of the shoe to its heel.

, An hour should be enough for the treatment to lessen or eliminate the odor in your shoes. Then, remove your teabags, wipe up any remaining moisture, and allow your shoes to air dry.In bad odor cases, you may want to let your teabags sit in your shoes for up to two hours.
You can speed the drying process along with a blow drier. Simple point the blow drier so the hot air blows into the shoe until the shoe is completely dry.

, Choose an essential oil that both fights bad smells and suits your preferences. Some popular oils for you to consider include tea tree, clove, and peppermint oil. A few drops on each insole should be sufficient to mask the smell.If you have difficulty dripping the oil on the insole of your shoe or getting the oil into the toe of a shoe, you could soak a cotton ball or two in the oil. Then, push the cotton ball into the toe of the shoe., To spread the odor fighting properties of the oil throughout your shoe, you'll need to spread it around the entire insole. To do this, you can use your fingers or an applicator, like a cotton swab. Keep in mind that essential oils have a potent scent. Using your fingers could leave your hands smelling like the oil for a while.


Be careful to keep the oil from coming in contact with the outside of the shoe, or any visible part of it. Some materials can be stained by essential oils, especially oils that are dark in color.For extra odor fighting potential, you can mix a few drops of essential oil in with a heaping spoonful of baking soda, which absorbs bad smells. Stir these ingredients together in a small bowl, then spread it liberally over the insole., Crumple the paper into balls, add a few drops of essential oil, and stuff your shoes with the paper. The paper will absorb moisture from your shoe and create a less hospitable environment for odor causing bacteria. You can remove and throw away the paper when the odor vanishes. A few hours might be enough to free your shoes from the unpleasant smell, but bad cases can best be treated by leaving the paper in overnight.You may want to check your shoes after a few hours have passed. Remove the paper and give your shoes a sniff to see if the odor has dissipated. If it has not, replace the paper and allow more time to pass before removing the paper for good.

, To prevent the cat litter from spilling inside or around your shoes, you should tie off the top of each litter filled sock with a simple knot. You can also put cat litter directly into your shoes, though litter can sometimes get caught in the crevices of your shoe and cause you discomfort later on.


In place of socks, you could also use pantyhose. The thin material of these will form less of a barrier between the odor fighting elements of the litter and the bad smelling parts of your shoe.To give your cat litter a little more punch, you might consider adding some baking soda to it. Simply add a heaping spoonful to each sock, tie each off at the top, and shake or massage the socks to distribute the baking soda., You'll be leaving the litter filled sock in your shoes for a long period of time, and a sock that is too full might alter the shape of your shoe.If you find that your socks are too full, hold your socks over a garbage can while unknotting the tops. This way, stray litter will be contained in the garbage, preventing a mess.

, In most cases, it should only take a night for the odor fighting properties of the cat litter to eliminate the smell. Especially bad cases, however, might take more time. You can check the odor of your shoes by removing the sock briefly and smelling the shoe. If you notice a lingering odor, you should leave the litter filled socks in the shoe for longer.Once the odor is removed from your shoes, you can throw away the cat litter and wash the socks as you would normally.
If the cat litter is still good enough to use in a litter box, you may want to reuse the litter there.
Give your shoes a thorough inspection after you've removed the litter filled socks. Small pieces of litter can sometimes push through the fabric of the sock and become an irritant later when you wear the shoes., You may be more familiar with softener sheets by the name of dryer sheets, but in either case, the odor fighting properties of this product are perfect for de-stinking shoes. You can simply push a sheet into each shoe, or you can slip one underneath each insole.Used dryer sheets can also be used to combat shoe odor. This is a great way to recycle, and will leave your shoes smelling laundry-fresh.

, Dryer sheets are relatively thin and light, and the heat of your foot will help release its odor fighting ingredients.However, sometimes dryer sheets can bunch up in the toes of your shoe and become uncomfortable. If you find this happens to you, leaving dryer sheets in your shoes while you're out and about might not be the best option.


Most sheets will last about a week before the odor fighting potential is lost.
Once your dryer sheets stop smelling fresh, you can throw it out and replace it with a fresh one., If your shoes have thin insoles or you have sensitive feet, or if you find that dryer sheets uncomfortably wad up in your shoes, you may only want to use dryer sheets when your shoes are off.


A few hours with dryer sheets inserted will usually be enough to chase away the stink.
Severe cases might benefit from a night spent with dryer sheets inserted in each shoe.

, The odor coming from your shoes is often the product of bacteria and sweat.You should choose a spray that is anti-bacterial to kill the odor creating germs, but you might also want to use an anti-fungal foot powder. Molds and other kinds of fungi thrive in dark, moist environments, and an anti-fungal could help your foot odor problem.Some common disinfecting sprays include Lysol, Smelleze, and Dr. Scholl's foot spray.
Most of these products can be found at your local drug store or pharmacy.

, Pick your shoes up one at a time and spray a liberal amount of your disinfectant/deodorizing spray inside. It may be easiest for you to hold your shoe upside down and point the sprayer toward the toes of your shoes. This way, the spray spreads throughout the entire length of your shoe.

, Your shoes should air dry quickly after being sprayed with disinfectant/deodorizer. If you applied your disinfectant/deodorizer in the evening or before going to bed, in the morning it should be dry.


For daytime deodorizing, you can speed the drying process by leaving your shoes in the sun.
If the smell comes back later, repeat this process.

, If you don't put your shoes in a bag before freezing, your shoes might become frozen to your freezer. A large, resealable plastic bag is highly recommended.Using an open mouthed bag, like a grocery bag, can sometimes cause the shoe stink to transfer to your freezer., Many kinds of bacteria, but especially foot odor causing bacteria, are weak to cold.Leave your shoes in your freezer for anywhere from 12 to 24 hours. Mild odor might be eliminated quickly, but the longer you allow your shoes to freeze, the more likely the odor causing bacteria will die.


If you live in a cold part of the world or a place with cold winters, you may be able to leave your shoes outside to kill the bacteria. However, you might want to cover the tops of your shoes to prevent snow from blowing in.

, Fresh from the freezer, you might not be able to tell right away if your shoe odor is gone. As the shoe thaws, it should become apparent whether or not your odor problem has been resolved.


If the odor remains, freeze your shoe again, allowing even more time for the cold to work on the bacteria. After this, the odor should be gone.
To speed the drying process, you might try putting your shoes in a clothes dryer, though this method may be damaging to more delicate pairs of shoes.
A blow dryer can also be used to thaw/dry your shoes, though this might take a while."

Apply a medium-thick layer of polish over the boot, applying on the area that is from the sole edges up to the lowest lace strand.,
Let the polish to dry for 5 to 10 minutes.

,
With your hand that you are not going to use for polishing, stick your hand into the boot so your fist or fingers are at the toe of the boot.,
Using a cotton ball (or using a soft clean cloth that is wrapped around your forefinger), dip your finger into a container of water.,
Buff the dried polish using smooth circular motions (small circles preferred) until the wax becomes shiny.,
With the damp cloth or cotton ball that you are still using, apply a thin fine layer of polish and keep with the circular motion until a hazy shine appears.,
Dip the cloth or cotton ball in the water again (keeping it from being dripping wet), and keep applying thin coats of wax to the boot, making sure you work them in uniformly along all parts of the boot that require shining as much as possible.

,
When the boot has finally reached its high gloss point, use a clean dry soft cloth (or another dry cotton ball) or a shining brush to give it a final buffing.,

After application and drying the first heavy coat of polish fine amounts of polish need to be used to build up the shine. If you use too much polish, you'll dissolve the base you've built up instead of building on it.

,,


The shiniest part of your boot should be the toe from the laces forward, as this is the most visible and noticeable portion of your foot. The heel and sides doesn't have to be as shiny, as your stance and pant leg will hide most of it.

Use a suede cleaning kit.,
Use a baby wipe on the interior.,
Use a clean damp washcloth to wipe out the detergent.,
Allow them to air dry.",How to Wash Slippers2," You cannot machine wash or hand wash suede slippers by submerging them. If you spill something on the suede, use a clean towel to blot and wipe at the spill.If the suede is waterproof, then you can use a damp towel to wipe at the spill. If not, stick with a dry towel., If the spill can stain the suede and you know the towel treatment alone will not suffice, then use a suede cleaning kit on the exterior.A suede cleaning kit will come with a stain eraser and a small, stiff suede brush with which to work in the eraser.A suede brush, nail file, or soft-textured sandpaper can also remove mud or scuff marks. This will also return the nap texture to the suede.Once the exterior of the slippers is clean, consider applying a suede-safe waterproofing spray to make cleaning them easier in the future., Baby wipes allow you to scrub out the slippers without wetting the suede. This works for both cotton and fleece-lined interiors.Baby wipes are low in moisture and have a mild detergent.Use a couple of them to work the inside of the slippers until you stop seeing the grime staining them.


You can alternatively dampen a washcloth and dab just a drop or two of wool detergent or another mild soap such as baby shampoo on the washcloth before using it to scrub the soft insides of the slippers., Once cleaned out, use a clean, damp washcloth to wipe out the insides. Remove any leftover detergent. Baby wipes are mild enough that this might not be necessary, but it will be if you use the couple drops of wool detergent or baby shampoo., You do not want to apply heat to suede slippers, so you’ll simply have to give them plenty of time to air dry before you wear them again. Wads of newspaper are actually a great way to absorb moisture without using heat, so you can stuff the insides with balled up newspaper to help dry them out more quickly."

This includes non-enzyme liquid soaps designed for leather products.You can use the same leather shoe cleaner you would use on other leather shoes to remove dirt and scuffs.If the insides of the slippers are leather, use the same process to clean the interior.

, After cleaning them with a leather cleaner, let them sit for approximately five minutes. Then shine the slippers with a clean, soft, cotton cloth., To keep leather slippers soft and moisturized, apply a leather shoe conditioner after cleaning.The leather will absorb a natural conditioner easier than synthetic ones. Apply the conditioner as directed to help them age better., For fleece-lined slippers, use the same process as with fleece-lined suede slippers. Namely, baby wipes, which are low in moisture and contain a mild detergent.Use a couple of baby wipes to scrub out the inside of each slipper until the wipe is no longer discoloring from the grime.


You can alternatively use a mildly damp washcloth with just one or two drops of wool detergent or baby shampoo to scrub out the insides of the slippers. This method requires using a second damp washcloth to remove any excess soap afterward.

, You don’t want to apply heat to leather slippers. You will need to give them time to air dry. As with the suede slippers, you can use a wad of newspaper inside the slipper to help draw the excess moisture out of the lining, which will hasten the drying process a bit.

Sprinkle baby powder in the sole-less shoe.,
Remove excess powder from the shoe.,
Cure squeaking with WD-40, alternatively.,
Re-insert the sole and test the shoe.,
Reapply powder or WD-40 as necessary.",How to Get Squeaks Out of Air Jordan Sneakers2," Hold the shoe so its toes point on a slight downward angle. Apply several shakes of baby powder or talcum powder to the inside of the shoe. Upright the shoe and tilt it back and forth to distribute the powder.Massage the powder lightly with your hands into areas of the sole the squeak seemed to come from.
To more thoroughly ingrain the powder in the sole, replace the insole and wear the shoe for 10 to 15 seconds, then remove the insole.

, For the best results, allow powder to remain in the shoe overnight. In the morning, upend the shoe over a garbage. Shake and tap it lightly to remove the powder.To maintain the shape of the shoe while it sits overnight, insert a couple of pieces of bunched newspaper into it. Remove and throw away the paper in the morning.

, Take your shoes outside and/or lay a drop cloth or newspaper beneath them to catch any spills. Spray a thin layer of WD-40 over the entire sole. Apply WD-40 more precisely by soaking a cotton ball or swab in the solution and rubbing the ball or swab on the sole.


When the WD-40 is dry to the touch, your shoe is ready for its insole. Wash WD-40 from your hands to prevent eye or skin irritation.
If WD-40 gets on a visible part of your shoe, it may cause discoloration. Using too much WD-40 may be harmful to the shoe., Slip the insole back into the shoe. Without lacing the shoe, insert your foot and take a few steps. If there is no squeaking, re-lace the shoe and enjoy your de-squeaked kicks.

, Over time, your shoes may start squeaking again. This can usually be solved by another application of powder or WD-40. Shoes that squeak constantly likely have a physical defect and may require professional repair."

Sand away squeaking caused by shoe tongues.,
Mend damage or loose heels with glue.,
Have a professional repair the squeaky shoes.",How to Get Squeaks Out of Air Jordan Sneakers3," If the tongue of your shoe is squeaking, this is likely caused by friction between a part of the tongue and the rest of the shoe.Pull the tongue as free of the shoe as you are able and lightly sand its edges with a fine grit rating (120 to 220 grit) sandpaper.Depending on the material of your shoe, you may want to use a finer or coarser sandpaper. Extra fine sandpaper (240+ grit rating) may be best for delicate material.
Avoid sanding visible parts of the tongue if it can be helped. Although sanding will smooth rough spots creating squeaks, it may cloud or deform the surface of shoe material.

, If a small hole or loose heel is the source of the squeaking, you can repair this with glue. Use water and heat resistant urethane rubber for soles. Super glue works well for repairing holes for most shoe material. Follow the glue directions for best results.Some glues may contain chemicals that do damage to the rubber or material of your shoe. When in doubt, consult a shoe repair professional on the best glue for your particular shoe., If none of these de-squeaking techniques worked, there may be a physical defect with your shoe at the root of the problem. In most cases, these kinds of repairs can only be made by professionals with special tools.


As shoes are broken in, they should squeak less. If your shoes continue to squeak even after being broken in, this may be a sign your shoes are in need of professional repair."

, Take out the laces and lift the tongue up and out to dry the shoes out faster. By keeping them dry, you help prevent bacterial growth that causes odor.








, The cedar wood that they are made of is antifungal and can help you prevent odor. Plus, cedar smells fresh, light, and crisp, making it a great choice for removing odor and preventing bacterial growth.

, Put your smelly shoes in a plastic bag, and then put them in the freezer over the course of a night. Thaw them naturally the next day in the sunlight for the best results.









There is inconclusive evidence that this strategy works. The idea is that freezing the shoes kills the odor-producing bacteria, but some suggest that this method will only temporarily relieve the odor. Try it out for yourself and see what you think.

, Ball up one or two fabric freshener sheets (that you stick in the drier, or in between your sheets) and place them in your shoes after you use them. The sheets should impart their pleasant perfume into the shoes and wick away any moisture that is still left in shoes.

, Steam may help to eradicate bacteria and fungus, thus getting rid of odor. If you're not worried about getting your shoes a little damp, give it a try.

Antifungal foot powder is commonly associated with athlete's foot. While athletes foot is a cause of foot odor and smelly shoes, it is possible to have smelly shoes without also having athlete's foot.
If you do have athlete's foot, consider using a cream, lotion, or other mixture of tea tree oil on the feet to fight the fungus. Tea tree oil is a natural, great-smelling anti-fungal oil. Rub it onto the feet in order to combat athlete's foot.

, Wash them in a water cycle that is around 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Repeat this a second time as soon as the first cycle is over, and then let the shoes air dry.








, If the freezer trick does not work, put in a healthy dose of baking soda and let the powder absorb the odor overnight. Baking soda can be used in a wide variety of ways, including as an anti-fungal powder.


Alternately, mix baking soda with zinc oxide powder to create an odor-crunching, fungal-fighting powder. Mix equal parts baking soda and zinc oxide and apply to shoes overnight. Zinc oxide has deodorizing and antibacterial properties.Dump out the powder the next day prior to putting the shoes back on so that you don't give yourself a white, powdery mess or trail all day.

, Most contain bacteria and/or enzymes that eat away at what is causing the odor.

, Swab shoes that you cannot wash with a cotton ball or cotton square with rubbing alcohol on it. This will help dry out offending odor causes and hopefully allow you full use of the shoes again. Rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly in addition to being an antiseptic. When it mixes with other liquids, it helps them evaporate, too.








, Cat litter might seem a bit off-putting, but it works for a reason: it has great deodorizing properties. Stuff a sock with fresh, unused kitty litter, seal it off with a knot on top, and stuff into shoes overnight.








, Spray your shoes with a combination of 50 percent water and 50 percent white distilled vinegar. Spritz the mixture into your shoe lining and sole, and let it air dry for 30 minutes.

,,, Brush it in medium strokes across every section of the shoe. Try to work in one direction across the sides, the uppers and the tongue.


Make sure to cover every part of the shoe with the conditioner.

,, Excess liquid can gather on these seams.

, Spritz it lightly with water.

, Apply to each section of the shoe. Dip your cloth into the polish again before starting on a new section. This will ensure that you get enough polish onto the shoes.

, Buff the leather. This requires light sweeping movements across each part of the shoe.

,, Open the clear coat polish and spray it with water. Apply it to each section of the shoes with a clean shoeshine rag.


Buff the surface of the shoes with your horsehair shine brush again.
This clear coat can also add extra shine.

, Spray it lightly with water.

,, Rub very quickly from side to side, starting at the top of the upper and working down to the toe of the shoe.

, Then, repeat on the back of the shoe. The toe and heel are the places you want to achieve the most shine.


The spritzing cloth uses friction to create heat. The heat and water on the shoe makes it shine.
In place of a spritzing cloth, you can lightly wet a few cotton balls and dip them in shoe polish. Work the cotton balls into the toe of the shoe with circular motions until they shine. This should take five to 10 minutes per shoe to achieve the desired shine., Apply the shoe-dressing wand to the edge of the soles and the heel. It will make them shine brightly; however, it can wear off quickly.

Be cautious when using this method.,
Get the sides or top of the shoe damp.,
Dry your shoes in sunlight if possible.,
Dry your shoes with a blow dryer if necessary.,
Use other heat sources as a last resort.,
Apply additional water and heat if necessary.,
Treat your shoes with leather conditioner once dry.",How to Shrink Leather Shoes1," Water has the potential to damage leather, and if you use too much your shoe may become stiff, stained, or cracked. Optionally, you may apply a leather guard or leather protector solution to the surface you plan on treating, but this may make the shoe more resistant to water treatment.









If you do apply leather guard to your shoe, allow it to dry completely before you continue.;
, Focus on the portion of the shoe that is too large, such as the sides or toe. Use a small spray bottle full of water, or dip your fingers in water and rub the area you want to shrink. While this area should end up quite damp, avoid getting any water elsewhere, especially on the soles or the base of the shoe.







, While sunlight will likely take longer than other methods of drying, this slower process reduces the chance of heat damage to your shoe. If you are shrinking your shoes on a sunny day, place them outside or next to a sunny windowsill and check back after a few hours to see if they are dry.








, If the current sunlight levels and temperatures are inadequate for drying shoes, use a blow dryer instead. Use the lowest temperature setting and hold your blow dryer at least six inches (15 cm) from the shoe to avoid damaging or burning the shoe.







, The tumbling action of a dryer may damage your shoes, although some dryers include a stable drying rack for this type of situation. Placing your shoes in front of a fireplace or oven may cause damage to the portions that are not wet. If this is the only method available, keep the shoes at a distance that feels warm to your hand, not hot.








, The adjustments you make with this method may be small, depending on the thickness and type of your leather. If the shoes are still too large, try applying water a second or third time, then heating the same way to shrink your shoes further.









The elastic band method may also be used in conjunction with this one.

, The water and heat treatment may have made your shoes stiff or cracked. Leather conditioner should help reverse this and prevent further damage. Follow the instructions on the packaging for the most effective results. If there are no instructions, rub into the shoe with a clean cloth, then let dry without further heat treatment.









Some leather conditioners are made for certain types of leather. If you do not know which type of leather your shoe was made from, ask a shoe store employee to identify the material or try to find a general purpose leather conditioner.

All you need is some baking soda and vinegar, as well as a sink large enough to set your shoes.Fill each shoe with one cup of baking soda. Then, add a cup of vinegar. This will cause the baking soda to bubble.
Let the combination fizz for about 15 minutes.

, Once you've applied your chosen cleaning agent, you can finish removing odor via machine washing. You will need a pillow case and detergent to safely machine wash your shoe.If possible, remove the shoestrings before you begin washing your shoe.
Place the shoes in the pillow case and then transfer the pillow case to the washer.
Use a normal cycle and hot water. Use plenty of detergent so the smell is removed. For white shoes, you could consider adding bleach.
One cycle may not be enough if the odor is strong. You may have to run very smelly shoes through two cycles.
You should let the shoes air dry. A dryer can shrink shoes.

, Black teabags contain tannins, a substance that can help kill bacteria. Placing a black teabag in your shoe could potentially eliminate some odor by killing bacteria.You will have to place the teabag in some boiling water prior to use. After immersing the teabag in boiling water, remove it and let it sit for 5 minutes.
Place a teabag in either shoe. Let the teabags sit for an hour.
Remove the teabags and use a paper towel to remove any excess juice. See if you notice a reduction in odor.

, Clean kitty litter is usually infused with a deodorizer. Make sure you purchase kitty litter aimed at controlling odor, as this can easily be used to remove odor from shoes.Line the insides of the shoes with kitty litter. Let the shoes sit overnight, or until you notice the smell is gone.
Clean all the kitty litter out of the shoes. You can try shaking the kitty litter out, which should get rid of most of it. Use a paper towel to remove any lingering bits of kitty litter.

, Dryer sheets are meant to freshen the smell of clothing, so they can be used in shoes as well. Using dryer sheets to get rid of shoe odor is easy. You simply place dryer sheets inside each shoe. Then, wear the shoes as you normally would. The shoes should absorb the odor from the dryer sheets, minimizing a foul scent.Throw away the dryer sheets after using this method. You should use new dryer sheets each time.

, Freezing shoes may remove some of the odors. To freeze shoes, place both shoes in a resealable bag. Cold temperatures can damage shoes, so it's very important you place your shoes in a bag before transferring them to your freezer.Leave the shoes in the freezer overnight.

Use this method for thin shoes that slip off.,
Cut a piece of elastic intended for clothing.,
Fix the band to the heel of the shoe.,
Sew the band onto the shoe.,
Try on the shoes.",How to Shrink Leather Shoes2," This method works best on thin leather shoes, since thick material will be difficult to sew. This method will make your shoe more narrow and harder to slip off, but if your shoe is much too long for you, use the water method.









If your shoes are much too large, try using both methods for more pronounced results. Try the water method first so you have a better idea of how tightly you should sew the band.

, These elastic bands may be found at craft and sewing shops or online. You only need a piece a couple inches (a few centimeters) long. If you prefer, cut off a larger piece for easier manipulation, then cut off the excess once the band is sewed on.








, Stretch the elastic band across the inside heel of the shoe. Stretch until it extends tightly across the back of the heel, then use safety pins or hairpins to fix it to each side. You may find it easier to pin the band to one side of the heel, then stretch the other side of the band across the heel and pin it again.









Make sure the band can be pushed back against the heel so you are able to sew it. If the band is stretched too tight and there is a gap between the heel and the band that cannot be pushed closed with a light touch, unpin it and fasten it slightly farther back to make it a little looser.

, Use a needle and thread to sew the band onto the shoe, then tie off the thread once you're done. If you would like more detailed sewing instructions, read the article How to Sew. Remove the pins once the band is fastened.









A curved needle may be easier to use., The band should pull the shoe to a narrower position around your heel, preventing the shoe from slipping off. If the shoe is still too long or extends too high above your foot, consider stuffing the toe with tissue paper or inserting a thicker insole.








"
"
Stuff the toe with tissue paper.,
Add a thicker insole.,
Find a cobbler in a location near you.,
Ask your local dry cleaners if you cannot find a cobbler.",How to Shrink Leather Shoes3," If the shoe is too big in the toe, a small bundle of tissue paper may prevent the shoe from slipping. Cloth or newspaper may work as well, but you may wish to walk around at home for an hour to see if it is comfortable before leaving the hose.








, If there is a gap between the top of your foot and the shoe, you would probably benefit from a thicker insole. Insoles can be purchased at shoe stores and some drug stores, or removed from another shoe. They are typically made from rubber or foam. Cut them to fit your shoe if they are too large, using an ordinary pair of scissors.









Remove the existing insole in your shoe first if one is present. This is a thin piece of material which can be lifted out from the inside heel. If the bottom of the shoe seems attached, leave it inside the shoe.

, Cobblers are shoe-repair specialists, and may have experience shrinking leather shoes. Consider requesting estimated costs for this service from several cobblers, since some may be more expensive than others.








, Dry cleaners are accustomed to working with different types of material, including leather, and may know how to shrink your shoes. However, the typical dry cleaning process is intended to avoid shrinking. A cobbler will likely have more expertise.

Clean the insoles of your shoes.,
Use a washing machine on machine washable shoes.,
Wash your shoes by hand if they are made from nicer materials.",How to Disinfect Used Shoes1," When it comes time to wash your shoes, remove the insoles and wash them first. In a small bowl, prepare a mixture of warm water and laundry detergent. To wash the shoe insoles, use a sponge or a rag to scrub away the smell, dirt, and stains. Rinse the insoles off with warm water when you've finished scrubbing them with your detergent mixture. Lay them near a window or on a towel to dry.


If your insoles are still smelly after washing them, put them in a plastic bag with some baking soda and leave it overnight.
If the insoles still smell bad after a night of baking soda, soak them for 2-3 hours in a mixture of vinegar and water. Then, wash the insoles again with soap and water to remove the scent of the vinegar.;
, Many shoes can be washed in the washing machines, including running shoes, sneakers, and most cloth shoes. If your shoes are machine washable, wash them in warm water with strong detergent. After washing, let your shoes air-dry instead of putting them in the dryer.


Remove the shoe laces before putting your shoes in the washer.
If your shoes are made of suede, leather, plastic, or any other delicate material, do not put them in the washing machine., If you are washing nicer sneakers or shoes made of more delicate materials, wash them by hand instead of in the washing machine. Make a soapy mixture out of warm water and liquid laundry detergent. Use a rag or a soft brush to gently scrub the shoes with this mixture. Once you've scrubbed the shoes with the mixture, get a fresh rag and wipe the shoes down with warm water to rinse the soap away.Leather shoes can be washed by hand. Use a rag to gently scrub the shoes with your soap and water mixture.
Suede shoes can be washed by hand, but you must be careful. Use a rag or soft bristled brush, and clean the suede in downward strokes. Brushing/cleaning the suede in one direction will help to lift stains from the material. If you're nervous about washing your suede shoes, then you should take them to a professional cleaner."

Sprinkle baking soda inside.,
Stuff the shoes with newspaper.,
Try kitty litter.,
Try coffee grounds.,
Rub with white vinegar.,
Swab with rubbing alcohol.,
Use dryer sheets.,
Freeze your shoes.",How to Deodorize Shoes1," This classic fix is famous for a reason — it works. Sprinkling about a tablespoon of baking soda inside a smelly pair of shoes will help absorb the odor and draw out moisture that makes it easier for bacteria to thrive. For best results, add the baking soda when you take the shoes off at night and shake it out before you put them on in the morning.


You may want to avoid this for leather shoes — the baking soda can dry them out.;
, Instead of tossing yesterday's newspaper in the trash, recycle it with this odor-removal trick. Pack smelly shoes with bunched-up newspaper, then leave them in a dry spot to sit for several days. The newspaper will gradually absorb the odor and moisture from inside the shoes, leaving them fresh and new.


You can also try sprinkling the newspaper with your favorite sweet-smelling perfume or aromatic. A few drops of vanilla extract can work especially well., While it may not seem like the first thing you'd want in your shoes, kitty litter is designed specifically to neutralize odors, so it's actually a great choice. Spreading a tablespoon or two of (clean) kitty litter inside each shoe before you go to bed should greatly cut down on odor. Don't forget to shake your shoes into the trash in the morning!

, If you're a coffee addict, make use of the leftover grounds you produce every day to fight shoe odor. Sprinkling a handful of dry grounds inside each shoe and letting them sit for a few hours is an excellent way to eliminate bad smells. Using dry grounds is crucial here — wet grounds will leave your shoes damp (which can make them smell worse before they dry out) and can stain the fabric of lighter-colored shoes.


Coffee grounds also work well as a general-purpose odor remover. Try setting an uncovered bowl of dry grounds in the fridge. The results should be similar to what you'd get with baking soda., Swabbing the inside of each shoe with a rag or paper towel dampened with white vinegar is a great way to remove foot odors. Let the shoes dry completely before wearing them again — otherwise, you'll just replace the odor with the smell of vinegar. Stuff with crumpled up newspaper to help remove excess moisture if you use too much vinegar.


Alternatively, try using vinegar along with the baking soda method above to create a fizzing foam that fills the shoe and removes odors.Stick to white vinegar here. Other varieties, like apple cider vinegar and balsamic, can stain your shoes.

, Alcohol is a powerful disinfectant — it's great at killing a wide range of bacteria and other microorganisms.This makes it perfect for removing odor-causing bacteria from a pair of shoes. Soak a cotton swab or Q-tip in rubbing alcohol (also called isopropyl alcohol) and scrub the insides of your shoes. Be thorough, hitting every corner of the inside fabric and re-soaking your swab as needed.

, These disposable laundry accessories are a cheap, convenient way to fight foot odor. Stuff one sheet in each shoe at the end of the day to remove odors overnight. For best results, be sure to use scented dryer sheets — unscented ones may absorb some of the bad odor, but they won't leave your shoes smelling as fresh.

, According to some cleaning resources, this odd trick will leave your shoes smelling fresh once they come to room temperature.Leaving your shoes in the freezer overnight allegedly kills the bacteria that cause shoes to smell bad.


Note, however, that some sources dispute this method.You may want to pair it with one of the other tricks above to be safe if you need good-smelling shoes.

Scrub the stains with a toothbrush.,
Wipe the toothpaste away with a towel.,
Dry your shoes.",How to Clean White Leather Shoes1," Scrape off any excess dirt that's been left over and that hasn't seeped into the leather. Use a soft nylon brush or a cotton rag and wipe over the entirety of your shoe. This should loosen and remove most of the dry dirt and dust that's on the surface of the shoe., Soak your laces in a bowl with warm water and laundry detergent or throw the laces in the washing machine. Removing them while you clean the rest of the shoe will make cleaning them easier., Dampen a rag so that it's wet, but not soaking. You don't want to over-saturate the leather on your shoes because it can damage it over time. Rub the damp cloth over the entirety of the shoe to remove the initial dirt., Make sure to use non-gel whitening toothpaste that doesn't have artificial dyes that can stain your shoes. Put dabs of toothpaste over the problem areas of your shoes and start to rub the toothpaste into the leather with your fingers., Scrub in the toothpaste, working in small circular motions. Continue to do this until the stain breaks up. Clean the entire shoe this way., Make sure to remove all the toothpaste that was left over from cleaning. If you have trouble removing the toothpaste, dampen the rag with a little bit of warm water and rub the toothpaste off of the shoe., Once all the toothpaste has been removed, wipe your shoes down with a microfiber cloth or a rag. You can repeat the cleaning process if your shoes are still dirty. Make sure they are completely dry before storing them. "

Remove the shoes and let them dry slowly in the open air.,
Stuff the shoes gently with tissue or newspaper if they are soaking wet, approximating the shape of your foot.,
Lightly brush off any mud or dirt with a suede brush or gentle nylon brush.,
Know that water will not ruin your suede shoes if you take your time letting them dry.,
Spruce up the dried suede with a suede brush to return the soft texture to normal.,
Apply a suede-protecting spray to your shoes to avoid further damage.",How to Fix Wet Suede Shoes1," Do not put the shoes in sunlight or next to a heater -- excessive heat can cause suede to warp and crack if you're not careful. Simply take them off and place them somewhere dry.


Do not try and remove stains while the shoes are still wet, as this can strip the soft, felt-like texture.;
, When leather or suede gets wet, it often contracts. It then dries in this shrunken position, cracking the leather when you later stuff your foot in it. To prevent this, lightly ball up some paper and stuff it into the shoe lightly, so that it looks like there is a foot in the shoe. You don't want it busting at the seems or stuffed to the brim, just enough to absorb the water and help the shoe hold its shape.


Make sure you get at least one piece all the way into the toe.
Newspaper ink may run on your shoes if it gets wet. This is not a concern for most shoes, as it will stay on the inside, but you should still be careful., You can also use a nailbrush or a toothbrush if it is all you have around. Gently, working with the nap (the direction of the suede hairs), brush away any major mud stains. Don't worry about getting them perfectly -- you don't want to to scrub suede while it is still wet if you can help it., Do not wipe, rub, or scrub your suede vigorously. When the soft, delicate hairs get wet they will tense up and become brittle, making them easy to rip off. When your shoes get stained or wet, resist the urge to start scrubbing until they are fully dry. With a little bit of patience you can fix most damage to suede shoes.


You cannot fix suede shoes if you've already stripped away the soft outer layer. Once you've ruined the felt, you cannot get it back., Once the shoes are clean and completely dry, grab a suede brush and massage the fibers back into position. Work in small circles, massaging each area of the shoe until the fibers are soft and glowing. While older shoes will never be completely returned to their former glory, you can still vastly improve the look of your shoes from their sad, damn state., Suede shoes can survive anywhere, as long as you are prepared. Most shoes will need suede-specific sprays or coatings, but the benefits are enormous. A protecting spray will keep your shoes dry, prevent watermarks and stains, and maintain the soft outer coating for years to come.

Take the laces off.,
Scuff up your footwear with sandpaper.,
Hit them with a hammer.,
Use acetone to strip the dye.,
Grind a hacksaw along the curves of the shoes.",How to Scuff Up New Shoes1," This way you won’t damage the laces and you’ll get better access to some of the shoe’s hidden surfaces. Specifically, you’ll get better access to the tongue if you’re wanting to scuff it., Sandpaper will grind into the leather, scratching the surface without causing any real damage. Fold a sheet of sandpaper in half and rub it on your shoe vigorously. Focus on the heel and toe, where you’d find more wear on a naturally worn shoe. Then, wear down the rest of the shoe to your liking.


Stick to a fine grit for best results., Wrap the hammer in a cloth to avoid accidentally causing more damage to the shoe than intended. Hold the hammer near the head and hit the shoe from no higher than about eight inches (20cm). This will allow every hit to scuff the shoe without accidentally going through it or crushing it. Start with the heel and toe until they’re scuffed to your liking, then hit along the sides of the shoe.


When dealing with boots, fold the top of the boot over the toe (if possible) and hit it. Fold it back towards the heel and hit it again.
An added benefit of this technique is that it softens up new leather, making it more wearable., Pour about a tablespoon or two of acetone onto a clean cloth and rub the shoe with the cloth. The acetone will lift the dye from the shoe and onto the cloth, creating spots where the leather is darker than others, mimicking signs of regular use. You can be creative with this step and experiment., This will cause some serious scuffing to your shoes and imitate years of tough wear. Start at the top of the toe, and grind into the leather, following the curve until you slide off the front of the shoe. Notice how deeply you’ve scarred the leather. If you’re satisfied with the depth of the scuff, you can repeat the process, changing the angle a bit to create new damage.


You can also use a hacksaw to add deep damage to the heel of the shoe. Start at the top and grind the hacksaw down the shoe."

Soak your sneakers in rubbing alcohol.,
Use a bleach and water mixture to disinfect the inside of your shoes.,
Purchase antibacterial sprays to sanitize all types of shoes.",How to Disinfect Used Shoes2," If you need to get rid of smell and bacteria, turn to rubbing alcohol for your solution. If your shoes are sneakers or made of cloth, soak the shoes in a tub or large bowl of rubbing alcohol. If your shoes are made of more sensitive material, gently scrub them down with rubbing alcohol using a rag., Bleach is a powerful chemical, which makes it a great tool for disinfecting shoes. Unless your shoes are white, be careful to only spray bleach on the inside of your shoes, otherwise they could get bleach stains on the outside. Use a small spray bottle to spray bleach on the insides of your shoes to disinfect them., You can use an antibacterial spray, such as Lysol or Clorox, to disinfect the inside of your shoes. Spray the entire insides of your shoes, and allow your shoes to dry completely before putting them on. Using an antibacterial spray will disinfect your shoes and help eliminate bad odors.

Use vinegar to deodorize your shoes.,
Use baking soda to deodorize your shoes.,
Put dryer sheets in your dress shoes.",How to Disinfect Used Shoes3," Vinegar is known for getting stubborn odors out of things – shoes included. When washing your shoes with soap and water, add a bit of vinegar to the mixture. After washing your shoes, you can also rub them down with pure white vinegar and a rag. The vinegar smell will fade, but the smelly odor will be completely eliminated., Baking soda is a great deodorizer, so it's one of the best ways to get smelly odors out of shoes. Pour 2-3 tablespoons into each shoe, and shake the shoes so that the baking powder spreads out evenly. Let the shoes sit overnight, and then pour the excess baking powder out of your shoes., Dryer sheets are great for giving clothing a fresh scent, and they're also great for freshening up smelly used shoes. Place 2 dryer sheets in each shoe and leave them there for a few days. Remove the dryer sheets before you put your shoes on. This should greatly improve the scent of your used shoes.


You can place dryer sheets in all types of shoes, but this method is particularly recommended for dress shoes that cannot be soaked in vinegar."

Run the shoes through the washer.,
Use a disinfectant treatment.,
Get a new pair of insoles.,
Carefully microwave to kill bacteria.,
Treat your feet.",How to Deodorize Shoes2," When your clothes smell bad, you (hopefully) wash them, so why not use the same method for your shoes? For best results, remove the soles and laces from the shoes, then put all the pieces in a pillowcase or laundry bag to keep them together. Wash on warm or hot with your standard detergent. Repeat the wash cycle for especially-smelly shoes.If you can, let the shoes air dry in the sun. Not only will this expose them to plenty of fresh air so that they can ""air out"" — the sun also acts as a natural disinfectant for odor-causing bacteria.Note that this is not a good choice for shoes that can be damaged by water (like leather shoes).

, Shoes that have been exposed to sweat, moisture, and foot odor for years can have bacteria and fungi living deep within their fabric. To kill these organisms, a strong disinfecting soak may be necessary. This method uses bleach, so it's not a good choice for dark-colored shoes. You also won't want to use it for moisture-sensitive materials like leather. Follow the steps below:


Soak the shoes in rubbing alcohol. Let it saturate the outside and inside fabric completely for about five minutes.
Let the shoes air dry in the sun. If the weather isn't being cooperative, use a dryer set to low.
Mix equal parts bleach and water. Put this mixture in a spray bottle and mist the inside and outside of each shoe carefully. Pull out the tongue, sole, and laces to make sure the spray gets everywhere.
If you have an anti-fungal spray, use this like the bleach mixture. Otherwise, let the shoes air dry again before wearing.

, If your shoes smell especially bad, you can try replacing parts of them to eliminate the source of the odor. A new set of insoles it probably the most effective thing you can buy. Insoles are sold as accessories at most of the same places where you might buy shoes and are usually fairly cheap. They can also feel great — many are made to provide extra comfort and support to people who spend lots of time walking or standing.

, Heat is a great way to kill bacteria — this is one of the reasons why meat is usually cooked before eating. You can heat your shoes in the microwave to kill bacteria, but if you do, you need to be cautious. Heating for too long can damage your shoes or the microwave itself. As with some of the methods above, this is not a good method for shoes made out of leather or water-sensitive materials. It should also not be used for shoes with metal pieces. Follow the steps below:


Soak a rag in water. Rub the inside and outside of the shoe so that the material is damp all the way through, but not soaking wet.
Put the shoes in the microwave. Remove the rotating plate if your microwave has one.
Heat the shoes on high for 30 seconds. Stop and carefully check their temperature with the back of your hand. If they aren't hot, heat for another 30 seconds.
Continue heating in 30-second intervals until the shoes are quite hot. Use a set of tongs to remove them and let them air dry.

, A great way to get rid of smelly shoes is to fight the odor at its source — your feet. Keeping your feet as clean, dry, and odor-free as possible will make it much harder for your shoes to get smelly in the first place.


One way to keep your feet fresh is to use talcum powder. Sprinkling a little on your feet and in your socks once you start sweating will help absorb moisture and prevent the bacteria that cause odors from forming.

Typically, you'll want to apply the water repellent over the entirety of your shoe and then allow it to dry before applying an additional coat.Remember to do a cleaning of your shoe before you apply a repellent.
Popular leather water repellents brands include Meltonian, Obenauf, Scotchguard, and Jason Markk Repel.Make sure that the repellent is designed for leather, not suede.

, Spot cleaning is an easy way to maintain the look of your white shoes. Use a damp rag or paper towel to clean off scuffs, scrapes, and dirt, as soon as they get on your shoes. Check your shoes every day after you get home from work or school and clean off any debris on your shoes. The more diligent you are with regularly spot cleaning, the less you'll have to clean the white leather.
If you have deeper stains, you can use an undyed mild dish soap and a toothbrush to remove the dirt.

, Sunlight can cause yellowing and damage to the leather in your shoes. Keep them in a cool dark spot somewhere in your house when you aren't wearing them to preserve them."

Dry shoes completely before attacking any stains.,
Invest in a suede eraser to remove almost all stains and watermarks.,
Remove salt stains with a little white vinegar.,
Remove oil stains with some cornstarch or talcum powder.,
Remove ink with cotton balls and rubbing alcohol.",How to Fix Wet Suede Shoes2," Even though some stain treatments do require a bit of water, you want the whole shoe to be dry before working. Water makes leather (and thus its cousin, suede) a little more pliable, and weaker. Working on wet shoes can lead to warping or cracking. Only add a touch of water when needed for cleaning; otherwise, work on dry shoes., These simple tools are made to clean suede while still protecting the texture and color, and are invaluable tools for saving suede shoes. Simply rub the eraser gently in a circular motion to lift stains off the shoe, be careful not to scrub violently. When you're done, use a nylon, lint, or suede brush to gently comb the fabric back in the same direction. In general, suede erasers are great for:


Watermarks
Salt stains
Water-based stains (like juices, drinks, etc).

In a pinch, a sturdy pencil eraser will actually work similarly to a suede eraser, though not quite as effectively., Mix in equal parts white vinegar and warm water (1/4 cup of each should be more than enough) and use a sponge or tooth brush to gently wipe away the stain with the mixture. Vinegar also works well for colorful stains, such as wine or chocolate, though it does not help much with mud or oil., If you've spilled some oil on your shoes, you're going to need to adjust your cleaning strategy to save the shoes. Dust the stained area with cornstarch or talcum powder, then let the powder sit overnight. In the morning, take a dry brush and gently wipe away the talcum or cornstarch. You might have to moisten it a bit as well. Finally, use a suede brush to return the nap to its normal direction.Oil stains are notoriously difficult to remove, so know that it may be impossible to remove without ruining the suede.

, Simply blot away the ink with rubbing alcohol, 91% if you can find it. Once you've finished, let the shoe dry and use your suede eraser to remove any other issues."

Remove the laces.,
Scuff the fabric with sandpaper.,
Use an industrial brush for rougher scuffs.,
Use black shoe polish to scuff any rubber parts.,
Cut lines into the denim with a knife.",How to Scuff Up New Shoes2," Not only will this prevent any damage to the laces, it also gives you better access to the shoe’s other surfaces. Specifically, you’ll get better access to the tongue if you’re wanting to scuff it., Start by focusing on the heel and toe. These two areas are usually the most scuffed when a shoe is allowed to wear naturally. Stick to fine grit sandpaper, and pass it over the heel and toe. Once you’re satisfied with these areas, sand the rest of the shoe more lightly.


If you see blue fuzz come off the shoe, you’ll know the sandpaper is working.
Denim and canvas aren’t particularly hard to sand. If you feel like you’re not making progress, change to a new sheet of sandpaper., The stiff bristles on these brushes, often made of metal, will tear into the fabric deeper than a piece of sandpaper. For these deeper scuffs, you’ll want to focus on the heel and toe of the shoe. This is to imitate the natural wear and tear found on old shoes. Be careful not to pass over the same spot too many times; you might tear a hole into the shoe., Whether it’s the sole or the toe, black marks make for very obvious scuffs. Rub some shoe polish onto a rag, and push streaks onto the rubber of the shoe. Be careful not to overdo it, or it will definitely look like you faked the scuffs. Don’t make the scuffs too large or too dark., Use light pressure, only enough to create a visible line on the shoe. Too much pressure and you’ll slice right through the shoe, making it less comfortable to wear and even affecting the shoe’s structural integrity if the cut is large enough.


You can also drag the knife along the surface of the shoe to scuff it without cutting. This will mimic damage from regular scraping."

Fill a small bowl with equal parts of baking soda and cornstarch.,
Consider adding a 2 to 3 drops of your favorite essential oil if you'd like a nice scent.Try something fresh-smelling, such as lavender, peppermint, or eucalyptus.,
Mix the ingredients together with a fork.,
Sprinkle the mixture into each boot.,
Hold the boot by the cuff, and shake it.,
Leave the powder in the boots overnight.During the time, the baking soda and cornstarch will soak up any bad odors.,
Shake the powder out of the boots into the trash the next day.,
Repeat this regularly.",How to Deodorize Ugg Boots1," 2 teaspoons (10 grams) of each ingredient will be plenty.Both baking soda and cornstarch have odor-absorbing properties.


If you can't find cornstarch, use cornflour instead. Don't use cornmeal, it is not the same thing.;
, Tea tree oil not only smells fresh, but is antibacterial as well.

, Be sure to break up any lumps or clumps. If you are using essential oil, make sure that it is evenly distributed throughout the baking soda and cornstarch.

, Try to use the same amount for each boot. If you washed your Uggs earlier, make sure that they are completely dry first.

, This will distribute the mixture through the inside of the boot. Be sure to tilt the boot back and forth so that the mixture gets into the toe area as well.

, For very stinky Uggs, leave the powder inside for up to 24 hours.

, If the shoes still stink, repeat the process.Keep in mind that some boots may be beyond salvaging., You should aim to deodorize your Ugg boots more frequently than you clean them.

"

Use some baking soda or activated charcoal.,
Leave 2 to 3 tea bags inside each boot overnight.,
Leave a dryer sheet inside each boot overnight.,
Stick a sneaker ball inside each boot after you take it off.,
Try some rubbing alcohol.",How to Deodorize Ugg Boots2," Fill a small cloth bag or nylon stocking with 2 teaspoons (10 grams) of baking soda or activated charcoal. Leave the bag inside the boot overnight, then take it out the next day.Much like baking soda, activated charcoal absorbs odors.You can find it in the aquarium section of a pet store.

, You can use any type of tea you want, but consider one with a fresh scent, such as peppermint. The tea bags will absorb foul odors while leaving behind a fresh one., They help deodorize stinky boots while leaving behind a fresh scent. Use caution, however, as many dryer sheets may also cause allergic reactions. If you have asthma, you might want to skip these., Much like baking soda, sneaker balls will absorb foul odors. They will also prevent odors from building up., Dampen a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and wipe down the inside of your shoe. Be careful not to soak the inside of your shoe. The alcohol will kill any odor-causing bacteria."
"
Keep your Uggs dry, and don't wear them while they are wet.,

Replace the inserts often, especially once they begin to smell.,
Wear socks with your Uggs.,
Keep your feet odor-free.",How to Deodorize Ugg Boots3," Wet Uggs are stinky Uggs. When water gets inside your boots, odor-causing bacteria will begin to grow and develop. If your boots get wet, let them dry completely before you wear them again.


Consider spraying your boots down with a water protection spray. This will help keep them dry during the winter months.

, Don't wear the same shoes every day. Instead, allow at least 24 hours before wearing the same pair again. This allows the old pair of shoes to dry and air out. If you really love wearing Uggs daily, consider buying two pairs, so that you can alternate them.

, This will help your boots dry faster. Remember, wet Uggs are stinky Uggs. If your boots get wet while you wear them, stick a piece of newspaper inside each boot after you take them off. The newspaper will soak up the moisture and any odors., Consider getting inserts that are labeled as ""antimicrobial"" or ""odor absorbing/preventing."" These types of inserts are specifically designed to prevent bacterial buildup. They will help keep your boots odor-free longer.

, The manufacturer may recommend wearing Uggs barefoot. Unfortunately, this allows sweat and bacteria to settle in the wool. Consider wearing some cotton or moisture-wicking socks with your boots. This will keep your boots dry and sweat-free inside., If your feet tend to get stinky, consider washing them with an antibacterial soap. This will help kill odor-causing bacteria. If your feet tend to get sweaty, dust some baby powder onto them before you slip your boots on. This will help absorb sweat.

Choose a cleaning product.,
Place the shoes on a covered work surface.,
Cover the canvas of colored Vans.,
Dip the brush in the cleaner.,
Wipe them down with clean water.",How to Clean Vans1," It's common to want the white, rubbery sole on Vans to look crisp and new, so it might take a little extra effort and extra supplies to return that fresh out-of-the-box look to your old Vans. This works for other canvas-style shoes, as well, like Toms or Keds.To clean the whites of your Vans, you can use a variety of household ingredients, like:


Bleach
Liquid nail polish remover (acetone)
Rubbing alcohol
Window cleaner
Magic eraser
Hydrogen peroxide
Baking soda and water
Lemon juice;
, Set out your shoes and cleaning product on a clean towel and use an old toothbrush or a shoe brush to apply the cleaner. If you're going to work inside with bleach, or some other cleaning product with the potential for staining, make sure you've got plenty of cover down.


Acetone and bleach need to be applied outside, probably, or in well-ventilated area.

, Using one of the serious above-described cleaners on the canvas of colored Vans will leave stains, which means you need to use some masking tape to cover the canvas, at least where it meets the sole.


Alternatively, some people think it looks cool to have bleach-spattered Vans. Your choice.

, Put a small amount of cleaner on your brush or old toothbrush and firmly buff the rubber sole of each Van, working in circles and loading the brush as needed. Work around the outside of the shoes, and the bottoms if you want.








, When you have done both shoes, wipe them over with either a paper towel or kitchen towel, slightly dampened with fresh water. Your shoes should be bright white on the rubber strips now.








"
"
Remove any caked-on dirt outside.,
Use dish detergent and warm water.,
Take a medium to large soft brush and dip it in the sudsy water.,
Rinse with warm, clean water.,
Dry the shoes thoroughly.",How to Clean Vans2," If your Vans are really dirty and you want to start getting them clean, take your shoes outside. Hold them over an area onto which you can shake dirt.









If your shoes are muddy, let them dry thoroughly before brushing them off. It'll be easier that way.
Use a soft shoe brush or toothbrush to brush away caked on dirt. Hit the soles of the shoes together to knock away any small particles of dust and dirt.

, Fill a bucket halfway full with warm water and one or two tbsp. (15 to 30ml) of mild dish detergent. Swish it around in your bucket, until suds start to rise.

, Taking the shoe in one hand, work the brush back and forth on the surface of the shoes with the other.









If the shoes are quite dirty, you can dip the surface lightly in the water, brushing hard to clean the bottom of the shoe.

, After you've scrubbed the shoes thoroughly, give them a quick rinse with fresh warm water, inside, or from another bucket.

, Lay the wet shoes on a clean white towel and wrap the towel around each shoe. Press the excess water out of the canvas with the towel. Repeat with the other shoe.









Place the shoes open outside to air dry. If the shoes are white, place them in direct sunlight to bleach them slightly.
Stuff them with hand towels or plain white paper towels to absorb water. This helps to avoid shrinkage and those dark lines in the places where the Vans bend when you're walking."
"
Only use this method for canvas or synthetic vans.,
Pre-treat stains on your shoes with a mild pre-treater.,
Set your washing machine cycle to gentle, with cool water.,
Put the Vans in a pillowcase.,
Use half the normal detergent you would normally use.,
Air-dry machine-washed Vans.",How to Clean Vans3," Vans make all kinds of shoes of different materials, including leather, which would be ruined by getting them wet. Look at the shoe's tag to determine whether or not the shoes are canvas or another synthetic material.


If you own leather or suede Vans, you should use the same cleaning directions as you would use with other leather shoes. You should not dip them in water or use laundry detergent to clean them.

, If you've stepped in some serious mud, or gotten oil or grease on your shoes, use an enzymatic stain remover, or another commercial product of your choice to lift the stain before the wash. Apply to the stains in question and let the shoes sit for a while, while you prepare the washer.

, You want to use the gentlest and coolest setting on your washer, both for the safety of the shoes and the washer itself. It's not generally great to have shoes banging around in a washing machine, but it should be fine, done properly.

, Many people fear the glue and seams of Vans coming loose when placed in the washing machine. If you place the vans in a pillowcase beforehand, however, and include the shoes in a wash with other soiled items, like bath towels, or small rugs, it'll be a good way to keep everything padded, and from bouncing around too much. Your Vans should be fine.


It's not generally recommended that you wash shoes in the washing machine more than once every six months or so, or you'll risk damaging the shoes.
If you're concerned about the liners or inserts in your Vans, it's usually best to remove them entirely from the shoe and replace after washing, or replace with new inserts.

, Make sure to use mild detergent for machine washing as well as hand washing and add the shoes in the pillowcase with the rest of the wash.


To cut down on the amount of time you soak the shoes, wait until the load is half-full, if you're using a top-loading washing machine. The shoes will still get plenty clean, but won't sit for quite so long.

, Don't put shoes in the dryer. This can dry out the canvas as well as the soles, resulting in cracks along the seams. It's also a good way to damage your dryer.


If you need to get your Vans dried quickly and don't care about cracking, put them in the dryer with a few towels to soften the jostling.

Mix 1/4 cup window cleaner with 2 cups warm water
Mix 1/4 cup shampoo with 2 cups warm water
Use the Vans cleaning solution, sold at Vans retailers or online.;
, You'll use this to rinse your dishcloth as you clean your shoes.

, Work on one section at a time, dipping your cloth/brush in the water and scrubbing your shoes in a circular motion. Rinse the dishcloth in the clean water, then dip it in the cleaning solution and keep going until you've cleaned the canvas part of both shoes.









You can use the same method to clean the inside of the shoes as well.
If you want to wash your laces separately, pour some of the cleaning solution into a separate small bowl and soak your laces in it. When you're finished cleaning your shoes, rinse the laces in clean, warm water.

, Dirt and grime can grind into the rubber parts of Vans shoes, so you may need something stiffer than a washcloth to tackle these parts. Dip an old toothbrush into the cleaning solution and use it to scrub the sides of the soles and all other rubber parts of the shoes.









If you don't have a toothbrush handy, use the abrasive side of a kitchen sponge or a small scrub brush.
If the rubber parts of your shoes aren't that dirty, you can clean them using wet wipes to remove scuff marks and other light marks.

, Use it to wipe away any dirt and soap residue remaining on your shoes. When you're finished, check out your shoes to see if you're happy with their color. If you see places where the cleaning solution didn't work, you may have to move on to stain removal techniques.

, Containing everything in a bag will protect both the shoes and your washer from getting beat up during the wash cycle. Make sure the pillowcase or bag is tied tightly so it won't come undone in the wash.








, This will be sufficient to clean your shoes without damaging them. Don't be tempted to use hot water, no matter how dirty your shoes are. Hot water can cause the glue holding them together to start coming loose.


Remember to add the same amount of detergent you'd add for a small load of wash.
Don't wash your shoes with other articles of clothing, especially delicates. Your shoes could end up damaging your other clothes.

, Do not tumble dry them, even on low heat, because the heat will damage the glue in your shoes. Stuff them with newspaper so they'll keep their shape, then place them to dry in a sunny spot.


Check out the shoes to see if you're happy with how clean they are. If you still see spots and stains, use a stain removal method.

If your Vans are stained with paint, try using a dab of paint thinner.

, Water, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide make a great white-shoe cleaner. If you don't have hydrogen peroxide in the house, you can use a simple paste made with baking soda and water. Here's how to do it:









Make a paste with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) baking soda and 1/2 tablespoon each of hydrogen peroxide and warm water.
Take a scrub brush or a toothbrush, dip it in the baking soda solution, and scrub the stains.
Allow the baking soda solution to dry on the shoe for at least thirty minutes.
Once the baking soda has dried, rinse with clean water thoroughly. Repeat as many times as necessary.

, Lemon juice is another home remedy that works wonders on stains. Combine one part lemon juice and four parts water. Dip a sponge in the mixture and use it to scrub the stain. When the stain is gone, rinse the area with clean water.








, If you need to get rid of a nasty stain on your white Vans, bleach is probably the way to go. Bleach is a hazardous substance, so be very careful not to breathe it in or get it on your bare skin. Wear old clothes you don't mind being stained with bleach splatters since it will turn anything it hits white. Here's how to use bleach effectively:









Mix one part bleach and five parts water. Undiluted bleach can turn white fabrics a yellow color.
Take a scrub brush or a toothbrush, dip it in the bleach solution, and scrub the stain.
Rinse with clean water.
Repeat this process until the stain is gone.

, If you've got to be somewhere quick and can't go through the hassle of cleaning your white shoes, smudge a bit of white toothpaste carefully into the stain area. Work into fabric until stain is no longer visible. Finish removing the stain with another method described above.

Use cold water instead of warm water to prevent any stains from setting in or any colors from running and ruining more of the white canvas.
You can work over the sink for the entire process, or you could spread out a sheet of wax paper or plastic over your counter or floor and work on that. The process can get messy and the cleaning solution can affect your counter or floor, so you want to avoid letting any excess drip off and onto something it could damage.

, Combine enough baking soda and white vinegar in a glass or plastic bowl to form a foamy, thin paste.

Do not use a metal bowl or spoon. Metal can react negatively to the vinegar.
You could also use washing powder instead of baking soda or liquid laundry detergent instead of vinegar, depending on which you have on hand. The mixture may not fizz as much when made, but it will still be effective.The paste should be about two parts baking soda and three parts vinegar. Do not use red wine vinegar, however, as it stains. As a general rule, though, only use enough of each to form a paste-like consistency.

, Dip a clean toothbrush or nail brush into the homemade cleanser. Scrub the surface of the shoes all over with the same brush, cleaning all sides and focusing on any especially dirty areas.

Rinse again under cool water when done. This is not strictly necessary, but you can check on your progress and avoid getting baking soda or vinegar all into your washing machine.

, Place your white Converse shoes in the washing machine along with a little standard detergent. Run the machine on a full cycle using cold water.


Do not use a chlorinated bleach or detergent.
To help prevent your shoes from banging around too violently inside the washing machine, wrap them in a mesh or fabric laundry bag before throwing them in.

, Converse shoes must be allowed to air dry. To speed the process up and help further the whitening effect, place your shoes in a warm, sunny, and dry location to dry.


The dry warmth of the sun can help dry the shoes faster, and the light of the sun actually has a mild bleaching effect.
Do not use a dryer. Machine drying white Converse will result in the shoes losing their shape.

Make sure the entire surface is wet, as this allows it to accept the cleaning product., Ideally, you should be using the ""Sheepskin Cleaner and Conditioner"", a product specifically designed by Ugg to clean their sheepskin boots. Alternatively, you can use any suede shoe cleaner, available at most good shoe stores.


If neither of these products are available, you can make your own cleaner by mixing equal parts water and plain white vinegar. This cleaner is not ""Ugg approved"" but it has been used with success by other Ugg owners., Start at the top and work your way to the bottom, spending extra time on the dirtier parts. Make sure to scrub the boot gently, both the sheepskin and leather underneath are very delicate, so cleaning too vigorously may damage the boot.


Don't miss any spots––if the cleaner is not applied all over, you may end up with water marks.
If the sponge becomes dirty while cleaning, rinse it out to avoid redepositing dirt on other areas of the boot.

, Once you are satisfied that you have thoroughly cleaned the outside surface of the boots, you need to wash off the cleaning product. You can do this by holding the boots under cold running water, or by using a wet cloth to wipe off the cleaner.


If you are using the rinsing method, be sure to rinse as quickly as possible. If the boots become too wet it can damage the leather.

, When the boots become wet they may lose their shape, so it is important that you stuff them lightly with newspaper or paper towel so they can dry into the correct shape. This will also help the boots to dry naturally.

, It is very important that you allow the Uggs to dry naturally, away from sunlight or any direct heat source. Too much heat will cause the boots to wrinkle and stretch, ruining their appearance.


You can speed up the process slightly by adding a silica gel pack (which soaks up moisture) to the bottom of each boot. You can also use a boot dryer (which blows room temperature air into the boots) to finish off the drying process.

, Once the boots are dry, you can use the suede brush to brush out the surface of the boots, evening out the nap and removing any matting. It is advisable that you then spray your boots with a protective spray, such as Ugg's ""Stain and Water Repellent"", as this will help to keep your boots clean in future.


To use the protective spray, hold the can about six inches away from the boots and spray until the entire surface of the boots are wet (but not soaked). Leave the boots to dry in a well-ventilated area, away from direct heat, for about 24 hours. Brush the boots again before wearing.If you do not have Ugg's ""Water and Stain Repellent"", any protective spray designed for suede boots will work.

, However, sometimes this is the easy way to get them clean, especially when the Ugg boots are already old and you're not wearing them beyond the front door. Use something to protect the Uggs and a gentle cycle.

, Tie a firm knot to keep them inside the pillowcase.

, The wool cycle will produce the acceptable temperature. Add wool detergent only. Allow the cycle to proceed.

, Allow the boots to dry slowly in the open air, using the process outlined in the previous part (Sponge Clean). Keep away from heat and direct sunlight. Do not use the dryer.

, Once dried, use a lint brush, nubuck brush, soft cloth or a suede brush and gently brush the natural line back into the boots. This will also pick up any fluff that may have dried on during the washing process.

, The instructions outlined previously are for classic sheepskin Ugg boots only. Other types of Ugg boots, such as metallics, paisley, mosaic, embroidered, croc, floral, sweater knit or specialty suede should not be cleaned with a cleaning product.

, Use a soft cotton cloth dampened slightly with water.

, These types of Ugg boots can be sprayed with a protective spray to help prevent stains. Anything else risks damaging the boots., If a splash of oil or grease lands on your Uggs, it is important that you clean them as quickly as possible and keep them away from heat sources, as this sets the stain. Use a piece of white chalk (or cornstarch or talcum powder) to ""draw"" over the stain. Pat it gently into place.


Leave the boots to sit overnight -- this will allow the chalk to soak up the oil or grease.
In the morning, brush off the chalk and the stain should be gone. You can then clean the boots as normal.

, If your boots become stained with dirt or salt, you should first brush the surface of the boots with a suede brush to remove large particles. Then use an eraser (like the one on the end of the pencil) to gently rub out the stain.


Wet the stained area with some water and use damp sponge with a little suede cleaning product to gently rub the stain in a circular motion.
Remove the cleaning product with a damp cloth and allow the boots to dry naturally.

, Water spots are very easy to remove using this simple trick -- simply fold the boot over so another part of the suede surface is touching the water stain, then gently rub the two suede surfaces against each other and the water spot will disappear., You can clean the wooly part at the top of most Ugg boots by turning the boot upside down and using a wide-toothed comb to brush out any dirt that has become stuck in the wool. Holding the boot upside down will ensure that any dirt will fall out of the boot, rather than into it., The inside of Ugg boots, particularly cheaper knock-offs, can develop an unpleasant odor due to sweat. You can remove this odor by sprinkling a tablespoon of baking soda into each boot. Cover the top of the boot with your hand and shake to distribute the baking soda.


Leave the boots to sit overnight, then shake upside down to remove the excess baking powder.
If you like you can mix a drop or two of your chosen essential oil into the baking soda to add a pleasant scent to the boots.

, This will prevent having to clean them as regularly. Any areas where they can be soaked, such as puddles and streams, should be avoided. Also avoid wearing Ugg boots anywhere that they might be scratched, such as hiking trails, as the leather is soft and will scratch easily and permanently.

, Be aware that the manufacturer does not recommend putting your Ugg boots in a washing machine or dryer, or even get them dry cleaned, as these processes are considered to be too rough. There is a risk that the machinery processes will stretch and damage the boots. Ugg boots are best only be cleaned by hand, using the damp clean method outlined above. (However, as explained in the washing machine method, there may be times when you decide an older pair of Uggs is just easier to clean this way; see the Method suggested and do this at your own risk.)

, If you wish to maintain your Ugg boots properly and keep them looking as good as new, it is probably a good idea to invest in an Ugg care kit, sold by the company. This contains everything you need to care for your Uggs, including a sheepskin cleaner, protector spray, boot freshener, a brush and a stain eraser. Alternatively, you can use suede shoe care products, available at any good shoe store.

, Use a dampened white cloth towel. If the color comes off easily, you should be aware that the entire article will ""bleed"" dye onto other areas of the item and may become slightly faded during the cleaning process.

, Ugg boots can be dried over a boot holder (hanging upside down) at room temperature and away from direct heat. Do not put your Ugg boots next to the fire or heater to dry, or place them in a sunlit window. If you do not have a boot hanger, stuff them with paper towels, a rolled-up towel or newspaper to help them retain their shape. Leave to dry for at least 24 hours.

/images/thumb/b/b5/Clean-White-Converse-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-7-Version-2.jpg









Use a mild soap, such as hand soap or a liquid dish detergent with no added fragrances or chemicals. Mix a few drops into a cup of warm water and stir until bubbles form on the surface.
When scrubbing the scuff mark, rub the shoe with your sponge using firm, circular motions.

, Spray a little WD-40 directly on the scuff marks and buff the marks away with a sponge or rag.
/images/thumb/e/e5/Clean-White-Converse-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-8-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e5/Clean-White-Converse-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-8-Version-2.jpg









Among other things, WD-40 is often used to extract moisture and clean off dirt and residue from a range of surfaces. Only use it on the rubber part of the shoe, however, and not the canvas. As an oil-based product, WD-40 can leave stains on material like canvas.

, Soak a cotton ball or cotton pad in a little acetone nail polish remover and scrub the scuff marks with the remover until cleaned.
/images/thumb/9/90/Clean-White-Converse-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-9-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/90/Clean-White-Converse-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-9-Version-2.jpg









Vigorously rub the mark with the nail polish remover to get rid of it. The scuff mark should fade in appearance almost instantly.

Bleach is a known whitener, but it is also a harsh chemical. As such, you should only use just as much as you need to avoid damaging your shoes. You should also only use it on the rubber portion of the shoe and not on the canvas part.

, Apply the toothpaste directly to the scuff mark and scrub at it with a toothbrush.
/images/thumb/7/76/Clean-White-Converse-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-11-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/7/76/Clean-White-Converse-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-11-Version-2.jpg









A toothpaste with baking soda in it is preferable to any other. Baking soda has additional benefits as a cleanser, and as a mild abrasive, it can strip away the stain causing the scuff mark.
If you cannot find a baking soda toothpaste, though, another toothpaste with a whitening agent in it can also work.

, Cut a lemon in half and directly apply the cut side of one half to the scuff marks on your shoe. Scrub vigorously to remove the mark.
/images/thumb/e/e2/Clean-White-Converse-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-12-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e2/Clean-White-Converse-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-12-Version-2.jpg









Lemon juice is often used as a natural alternative to bleach.
Leave the lemon juice on the scuff mark for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing it off with cool, plain water.
If you do not have whole lemons, you could also scrub the spot with a little lemon juice and a toothbrush or rag.

, Rub petroleum jelly on the scuff mark. Let it sit for five minutes before wiping it away with a damp rag.
/images/thumb/6/6b/Clean-White-Converse-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-13-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/6/6b/Clean-White-Converse-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-13-Version-2.jpg









Petroleum jelly can cling to the dirty particles of scuffed up material and lift away the debris.
Keep the petroleum jelly on the rubber portion of the shoe and avoid the canvas part, if possible. The oil in petroleum jelly can sometimes leave a light stain of its own on fabric.

, Apply the rubbing alcohol to the scuff marks with a cotton ball or cotton pad. Scrub well, and clean any remaining alcohol off with a damp rag when done.

You could moisten the magic eraser instead of the shoe, but making the shoe damp ensures that there will be enough moisture throughout the entire cleaning process.

, Use a “magic eraser” cleaning product to gently scrub the canvas shoes from toe to heel, getting as much of the material as possible.
/images/thumb/d/d9/Clean-White-Converse-Step-17-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-17-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d9/Clean-White-Converse-Step-17-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Clean-White-Converse-Step-17-Version-2.jpg









As one spot of the sponge gets dirty, turn it to another portion of the sponge.
Magic erasers do not use any harsh chemicals, making them especially good options if you have pets or young kids, or if you otherwise prefer to keep chemicals out of your home.
This eraser contains a melamine polymer.It feels flexible and somewhat soft to the touch, but this polymer is actually a rather effective abrasive foam. When you use the eraser, you literally scrape the dirt away with physical force.

, Place the shoes in a warm, sunny, and dry location to dry. Doing so speeds the process up and helps to heighten the whitening effect.


The dry warmth of the sun can help dry the shoes faster, and the light of the sun actually has a mild bleaching effect.
Do not use a dryer. Machine drying white Converse will result in the shoes losing their shape.

, If your shoes have deep grass, food or oil stains, they'll come out cleaner if you pretreat them with stain remover. Use the same stain remover you'd use on clothing. Apply it to the stain and let it sit for the recommended amount of time before washing your shoes.









If your shoes are a deep, saturated color, you might want to test the stain remover on a discreet part of the shoes (like inside the tongue) before applying it to the outside. If it seems to lighten the color, don't use it.
You should also brush off excess dirt and other debris before washing the shoes. This can clog up your washing machine.

, You can use a delicates bag or a pillowcase tied at the top. This will protect your shoes and keep your washing machine from getting pummeled during the wash cycle.

Get a suede brush and make sure your shoes are dry.,
Brush gently to remove dirt.,
Brush vigorously to remove scuff marks.,
Use an eraser for stubborn marks.,
Protect your suede.",How to Clean Suede Shoes1," Suede has a soft grain that is best cleaned with a special brush, which you can purchase with a suede cleaning kit. If your shoes have a care label, use whatever the manufacturer suggests. Suede is also very sensitive to water, so basic dirt and scuffs are best dealt with when the shoes are dry.






;
, Use the suede cleaning brush to lightly brush away dust or dirt that has accumulated on your shoes. Don't go back and forth: brush repeatedly towards the same direction. Once you get off this layer of grime, your shoes will already look newer.








, When you scuff your shoes, the suede's grain can get pressed down in one direction. Lift the grain by brushing scuffed areas vigorously back and forth. Again this is best done with a suede brush.









For scuffs that are too matted down to respond to the brush, try scraping the area with a knife to lift the nap.

, Scuffs and marks that won't brush out can often be removed by rubbing with a pencil eraser or a piece of crepe rubber (the crinkled rubber that many shoe soles are made from). You can also by a special suede eraser designed for just this task. Apply a moderate amount of pressure and increase as tougher marks require.







, Once they are clean (or when you first get them), spray a coat of suede protector spray on your shoes. This will help prevent further stains and marks. Follow the manufacturer's directions.

Use a sponge or dry cloth to soak up excess water.,
Stick paper and shoe trees in your shoes.,
Let the shoes dry at least overnight.,
Once dry, go over the shoes lightly with a suede brush.",How to Clean Suede Shoes2," Apply a light coat of water with your brush. Water can discolor suede, but properly applied water can also remove those stains.








, Dab gently until the leather is evenly wet without visible water stains.








, Especially if you used a large amount of water, put dry paper in the shoes to help blot out excess water on the inside. Shoe trees (or just wads of paper) will help the shoes retain their original shape. Do not use newspaper because excess ink can soak into your shoes.








, Put them in a dry, well ventilated spot and let the water evaporate.








, This will help shake out the grain back to its original look.

Then use a nail brush to scrub stubborn stains with warm water. Grease stains can be particularly difficult to remove from suede, and badly stained shoes may never look good again.









Some recommend cornstarch for oil stains if the oil is still wet. Sprinkle it over the stain and then leave it overnight. The next day brush away the starch and mist the stain with an iron., Wipe away the excess mud without pushing too hard against the suede, then leave your shoes to dry in a sunny spot. Once the mud has hardened, you should be able to break off the larger chunks with your hands. Then use a suede brush to break off the remaining dirt particles.








, If you get gum stuck to your shoes, put them in freezer for a few hours. The gum will eventually become hard enough that you can chip it away in large chunks. Finish off with a suede brush.








, Dab at the stain with a peroxide-soaked cotton ball slowly until the blood comes out.








, If you spill ink on your kicks, grab a towel and try to blot it up quickly. If it sets, scrape the stain off with sandpaper. A cotton ball with rubbing alcohol can also help in these dire circumstances.

, Brush steel wool vigorously against dry stains. However, be aware that this may require roughing up the rest of the shoe for an even look once the stain is removed.








, If you don't have a suede brush, agitate the suede with the emery board nail file, then steam it with a kettle or iron. The heat should help open up the pores of the suede and make cleaning easier.

",How to Clean Timberland Boots," Brush off each boot with a brush or a towel to remove any dirt particles. Don't forget the bottom of the Timberlands. The soles are especially likely to pick up loose dirt and gravel that can be brushed off easily before cleaning. If you don’t brush the dirt off, you’re going to have a muddy mess on your hands (and most likely in your house.)








Timberland sells specific brushes that you can buy to clean your boots with, but buying the brand name brush isn’t totally necessary. If you have a soft-bristle brush lying around your house that you don’t mind getting a bit dirty, feel free to use it. Brushes work better than towels simply because they can get into the nooks and crannies of the boots, however, be careful when using a brush on leather boots, as brushes with very hard bristles may scratch the leather.;
, Take the shoelaces from each boot and wash those by hand. Wash them in warm soapy water until all of the dirt has been removed. For a thoroughly clean, scrub them together with the soap and then soak them in warm water. Hang them out to dry.









You could also include them in a load of laundry in a washing machine. Keep in mind that if they are really dirty, you will probably want to wash them separately from your other clothes.

, Rinse the rubber soles of the Timberland boots with water. Scrub them with a mild dish soap, using a toothbrush. Using a toothbrush helps to get all of the dirt that is wedged into the tread in the sole, as the bristles can reach deeper into the tread than a washcloth could. Gently scrape out any build up that is in the soles. Rinse the soles with warm water. Allow them to air dry.









You could also use cotton swabs to get the dirt out of the tread. Dip the cotton swabs in warm, soapy water and run them along the grooves until all of the dirt has been removed.

, Use baby wipes to rub down the outside of the boots that run along the fabric line. Baby wipes condition the boots along the fabric lines. Make sure the wipes are moist, and use as many as necessary to completely cover the fabric of the boots.









If you do not have baby wipes, you can use a washcloth and warm water to scrub the outside of the boots.

, Timberland boots come in suede and leather styles, including Nubuck and Wheat. Suede and nubuck can be cleaned in the same way (follow the directions listed in the substep.) When cleaning leather, including wheat leather, make sure to buy leather cleaning supplies that match the color of your leather.








Use a foam cleaner on suede and nubuck boots or you can use a cotton swab and put dish detergent on it on the area that is dirty. Timberland sells suede and nubuck cleaner that is designed to clean and protect Timberland boots called Renewbuck. You can also use other brands of suede cleaners that you do not purchase from Timberland. These can be purchased online or at drugstores like CVS. Make sure to follow the directions on the cleaner to apply it and scrub out stains.
For leather Timberlands, use a leather cleanser. These cleansers generally come in cream form. Most leather cleaners come with a sponge or an applicator which can be used to apply it to the boot. Timberland sells its own form of leather cleanser that is designed for their boots called “Boot Sauce” gel. Make sure to purchase the cream made for your color of boot Follow the directions on the tube and rub it into the leather.

, If there are noticeable stains that have not been removed by cleaning the boots, buff them out. If your boots are made of smooth leather and you have noticed black stains, dip a washcloth in water and then baking soda. Rub the spot with the stain gently. When the stain is gone, wipe the spot with a damp, clean cloth, and then let the boots dry.








If you have suede boots that are looking a little matted, or the nap (the fuzzy part of suede) is lying flat against your boot, scrub the nap with a clean, dry toothbrush. Doing this should make the nap stand up again. If it is really matted, so much so that brushing it doesn’t do much, hold the boot close to the steam from a kettle and then scrub it with a toothbrush. The steam untangled the matted nap, allowing your to scrub it straight and make it stand up again.

, Once the cleaning agent has been applied and any stains treated, let the boots air dry in warm air. Do not place the boots near high heat (such as a fire) as high heat could potentially melt any glue holding the boot together, or destroy the leather parts of your boots.







, Use a simple pencil eraser to remove scuff marks on the toe of the boots. Rub the eraser lightly over the marks until they disappear. Brush off any bits of eraser left over after scrubbing the boots.

, You may be eager to clean your shoes off right away, but trying to wipe the mud off before it has dried can actually stain the fibers of your shoe. Put your shoes somewhere warm and dry--outdoors in direct sunlight, if possible.


Don't put your shoes by a radiator or other direct source of heat to dry, as this can warp the plastic and alter the shape of the shoe.If it's humid, damp, or there's no sunlight, dry your shoes with a household fan. Either put the shoes on a towel or plastic tray with the top facing the fan (so the air gets inside the shoe), or use an over the door hook (or ""S"" shaped hook) to hang the shoes directly on the grill of the fan.Don't leave your shoes outdoors overnight. They'll just get damp again.

, The mud will chip and flake off, and you should be able to get most of the mud off your shoe.


If you can get the shoes on your feet, stomping your feet will also cause the mud to fall off the exterior of your shoe. However, it may not be possible to even get them on if your shoes are filled with dried mud.

, A wet paper towel could grind the dirt into your shoes and stain the fibers. The dry paper towel should remove the fine, powdery dirt left from the larger chunks that fell off.

, Removing the laces will allow you to pull the tongue up and open the shoe a little wider, so you can really get into those hard to reach places. If there's mud trapped under the inserts, your shoe can become moldy and smelly.


Sometimes you can't remove the insert without ruining the shoe. If this is the case, then leave them in and just try to get them as clean as possible.
If your shoelaces are knotted and won't loosen or come out, you can always cut them and buy a new, clean set of laces wherever shoes are sold.

, Use water and a few drops of dish detergent and go to town on the exterior and the inside of your shoes. Get into every little crevice where mud might be lurking.

, Stuff your shoes with newspaper or paper towels to help absorb dampness.The same rules apply as before--try to let your shoes ""bake"" in direct sunlight and don't leave them outside overnight. Do not put them by a radiator or in the dryer, as this can ruin the shoe (and your dryer).


Your shoes should be dry in about 12 hours.If you insist on trying to dry your shoes in the dryer, lace them back up and tie the laces to something heavy.

Let your boots dry completely between uses.,
Leave a dryer sheet in each boot overnight.",How to Clean Stinky Winter Boots," Like anything else, if your boots are dirty, they need to be cleaned. Fill a basin with warm water and mix in a small amount of mild detergent. Remove the insoles from your boots and whisk them through the soapy water, making sure each is washed and rinsed thoroughly. Wipe the inside and outside of the boots clean using a washcloth. Allow the boots to dry completely, or microorganisms will build back up due to the moisture.If your boots see a lot of use, you should aim to clean them every couple of weeks.
Hang the boots or set them aside in a well-ventilated area until dry.;
, Sprinkle a little baking soda into the bottom of your boots. Make sure the baking soda gets down to the toe and midsole areas. Allow the boots to sit overnight. The baking soda will absorb and neutralize foot odors that have set into the material on the inside of the boots.Be sure to shake the excess baking soda out of your boots before wearing them.
Try out a mixture of baking soda and cat litter, which is also formulated to absorb odors., Purchase a small bottle of disinfecting spray (the pharmaceutical variety will work, or you might look for kinds that are specifically designed to be used to treat footwear), or whip up a homemade batch using rubbing alcohol/and or vinegar and essential oils. Spray each boot thoroughly, inside and out. This won’t do away with a powerful stench immediately, but it will work to kill the bacteria that are causing it.If you decide to use vinegar, it’s recommended that you top it off with a spritz of air freshener or a drop of essential oils to offset the smell, which can be unpleasant on its own.

, Even after you’ve dealt with the worst of the problem, subtle odors may remain. Continue cleaning and disinfecting your boots consistently, and freshen them with essential oils in the meantime. Essential oils are natural fragrant botanical extracts that are wonderful for covering up offensive smells. Just dab a few drops of rosemary, peppermint or tea tree oil into your boots at night, store them somewhere dry and let the oils do the rest.Because of their pleasant aroma and antimicrobial properties, essential oils are commonly used as a holistic alternative to deodorant, hand soap and even perfume., Your best line of defense against stinky feet is to keep them clean. Make sure you’re bathing regularly, and pay particular attention to the tops of your feet, toes and arches while washing. Many people don’t clean their feet well enough, not realizing that the dirt, oil and clogged pores that build up are all more likely to produce embarrassing foot odor.Wash your entire body, including your feet, once a day, or any time you engage in strenuous physical labor or activity.

, Perspiration, warmth and dark, enclosed conditions are all prime factors for bacterial growth, which makes boots a hotbed for smelly germs. Choose a strong antibacterial soap to wipe out the bacteria that make your feet their home. If you have a particularly bad foot perspiration or odor problem, it may be a good idea to wash your feet with antibacterial soap multiple times a day between showers.Antibacterial soaps come in both liquid form, which is more versatile, and as bar soap, which can be used conveniently in the shower.

, One of the biggest contributors to stinky boots is sweaty feet. You can reduce the amount of perspiration that is being absorbed by the fabric of your footwear by dusting your feet with a light coating of baby powder or talcum powder before putting on your socks. Sprinkle baby powder onto the bottom of your feet and between your toes. Massage lightly to work it nearer to the skin. The talc will absorb and dissipate moisture and thus prevent smells, and should disappear on its own over time so that it doesn’t cake onto your foot.Use talcum or baby powder to keep your feet dry whenever you know you’ll be wearing your boots for an extended period.

, Sometimes, bathing alone may not be enough to stave off unwanted foot fumes. Keep your toenails trimmed short, and make sure that you’re cleaning under the nail and around the nail bed. While you’re at it, be on the lookout for signs of fungal infection, such as a slight darkening of the skin or discoloration of the toenail. Maintaining clean, neat toenails gives germs fewer places to hide.Toenails should be clipped straight across and kept fairly short. Try to trim your toenails once a week to prevent them from growing too long.
Athlete’s foot and other fungal infections are persistent, and, unlike normal bacteria that grows on the skin’s surface, cannot simply be washed away., There’s no sense in keeping your boots clean if you’re wearing the same dirty socks all the time. Change your socks after prolonged wear, or after anytime you sweat in them. Their absorbent, porous material will hold onto sweat and germs, which can then be transferred to your boots.Health experts recommend putting on a fresh pair of socks at least once a day.Invest in a few pairs of high-quality boot socks. These are designed to be thick yet breathable, so they’re harder to sweat through and won’t stay damp like ordinary socks.

, Most shoe companies offer special insoles that contain compounds like activated charcoal which are known for their odor-fighting properties. Trade out the standard insoles in your boots for a set of odor-eliminating inserts. In the case of especially old or hard-to-clean boots, these may be all you need to cut down on unwanted smells.Odor-fighting insoles typically retail for around $20, making them a slightly pricier but longer lasting solution.

, Rain, snow and ice will keep boots wet throughout winter. After wearing your boots, take them off and leave them somewhere well-ventilated to dry out. Placing them up high near an open window will work, provided it’s not too humid out, or you can lay them tongues-out near a space heater or fire. The longer your boots stay damp without having the chance to dry, the more likely they are to become a breeding ground for bacteria.Switching out your choice of footwear so that you’re not wearing the same pair every day will allow each pair to dry out between uses.If you’re in a time crunch or have no other options available, using a hair dryer on a low setting can help get your boots dry in a hurry. This should be done sparingly, as too much direct heat can potentially ruin the materials.

, A simple solution for combating odors in clean and lightly worn boots is to stick a fabric softener dryer sheet in each boot before you go to bed. Dryer sheets act to trap smells from clothing and replace them with a slow infusion of more delightful fragrances. This is perhaps the easiest method for maintaining fresh-smelling boots.Using dryer sheets is largely a preventative measure, and won’t do much if your boots are in need of thorough cleaning or disinfecting.

Then make a light lather by rubbing the sides of the cloth together.Use a soft cloth such as a cut-up cotton t-shirt. You can also use a very soft-bristled brush.
The cloth should be damp, not wet. If it’s dripping with water, you need to squeeze out some excess liquid.

, You can also find liquid leather cleaners. Pour a small amount (no more than a small circle) of liquid onto a dampened cloth. Rub the sides of the cloth together to make a light lather.

, Make sure your boots have been cleaned. Then, dip a dry, soft cloth into a jar of petroleum jelly. Rub the jelly onto the spot that’s scratched or scuffed up. Use a different dry cloth to buff it off by rubbing the spot in small circular motions.Do not use petroleum jelly on suede boots.

Practice good foot hygiene.",How to Clean Leather Sandals," Leather stains and discolorations are caused by a lot of different factors, so you need to figure out what is ailing your shoes before you can fix it.


Leather sandals often show spots or discoloration from contact with water, which might look unattractive but isn't ""dirty"" per se. One quick remedy involves a 1:1 ratio of white vinegar and water, which you can light blot on the discolored areas-- this also works on salt stains on leather boots in the winter.Be sure not to saturate the leather.
Dirty sandals carry everything from streaks of mud to deeper stains of oil, wine, or other liquids. You will need to consider the type of stain and desired results to clean leather sandals properly. You may also just want to polish or buff out scratches, scuffs, or other marks.
If you only have a small stain, dish soap or liquid hand soap will work fine. Avoid bar soap, which has a higher pH level than leather,and can cause it to dry out. For larger or stubborn stains, try leather conditioner, available at your local big box store or shoe store, or online at most big retailers.;
, You should always remove any dry debris from your shoes before applying any type of cleanser or moisturizer to the leather. Otherwise, you'll create a muddy mess that will be harder to remove.


Use a dry, soft cloth or soft-bristled brush (an old toothbrush will work well) and a very gentle hand. Keep in mind that soft, supple leather can be easily scratched, so if you are wiping off dirt and you use too much force you might actually cause a permanent mark on your shoe.

, Begin by moistening a clean, soft cloth, then apply a small amount of soap or leather conditioner to the cloth.


Now, gently rub the dirty spots. You should try to use a gentle, even motion, and create a lather.

, Using another clean, slightly damp cloth, use a circular motion to remove the product from the leather. Be sure you remove it all.


Although you want to reduce the level of moisture that you're introducing into the sandal, it's important to wipe away any cleaning products from clean sandals. A damp cloth is the best way to do this. If one cloth is not enough to remove the product, use another.

, Before you wear them again, you need to let them dry thoroughly. Otherwise you may get more dust or debris on the wet spots and cause a stain.


Natural light and sun is the best way to dry leather footwear, but don't place them in direct sunlight. The sun can break down the leather and cause cracking.Don't try to dry your sandals by rubbing them, and don't wear the sandals until they're completely dry.

, Baking soda naturally absorbs odors, is very affordable, and is available at any grocery store or big box store.


Place shoe inside a large zip top plastic bag. Sprinkle the inside of the shoe liberally with baking soda. Seal the bag and leave it overnight.
You can also try adding a drop or two of essential oils, like lavender or sweet orange oil, to add a pleasant scent. Put the oil directly on the baking soda before applying to the shoes, not on the shoes themselves. Don't add more than a few drops, as the oil can cause even more problems by sticking to the shoes and attracting dirt.
Be sure to wipe out all of the powder before putting the shoes on again., If baking powder alone doesn't do the trick, you can try using cat litter to absorb the remaining smells.Get a pair of old pantyhose. If you don't have any handy, you can use the little disposable socks available at most shoe stores for customers trying on new shoes.
Fill the foot end of the pantyhose with a scoop of cat litter.If you don't have a cat, ask a friend who does if you can have a bit of litter. You will only need about two cups total, so it's really not worth buying a whole bag.
Tie off the pantyhose and stuff it inside the shoe, again leaving it overnight.The litter is formulated to absorb smells and many brands will also leave behind a nice aroma.

, The smell inside of leather shoes is often contained in the insole, where dirt and sweat get trapped and bacteria cause a stink. Taking out the insoles is often the only way to salvage the shoes.


If your insoles are removable, replace them with fresh ones. You can buy insoles based on your shoe size at any big box store or online. Look for a brand that gets good customer reviews and that is specially designed for open shoes.
If your shoes do not have removable insoles, you might want to take them to a shoe repair expert. Often a cobbler can cut out the insoles and fashion new ones. This is probably only worth trying if your shoes are expensive and/or no longer available for purchase, since a cobbler will charge quite a bit to replace the insoles in your shoes.

, Shoe odor is caused by bacteria feeding on the dirt and sweat inside your shoes. If you want to eliminate the smell, you have to eliminate the bacteria.


At the end of every day, spray the inside of your shoe with a commercial shoe deodorizer or disinfectant that is specially formulated to kill bacteria.Look for a shoe spray that is marketed for use in athletic shoes; these are the strongest available since athletic shoes tend to be the smelliest.You can also try making your own natural disinfectant spray from water, tea tree oil, and vinegar, and using this to spray your shoes instead.
Be sure you leave your shoes to dry thoroughly before wearing them again. You can place them outdoors on a warm, dry day, but be sure to place them out of direct sunlight. You can also place them atop the dryer or in another warm spot inside.

, When you first purchase leather sandals or other footwear, you can apply spray to the outer leather parts to make them water-resistant and stain-resistant.


To prevent the spray from getting in the sandal footbed, stuff the sandal with crumpled newspaper before spraying.

, Leather discolors if it becomes wet, and saturating your sandals can also lead to odor problems.


Choose synthetic materials for your rainy-day footwear, such as rainboots or rubber flip-flops. If you want to wear your fancy leather sandals for a special occasion, stash them in your purse or backpack and change when you're inside where it is dry.
Be sure to let your sandals air out completely if they do happen to become wet. Place them in a warm, sunny, and dry place until dry. Don't leave them in direct sunlight, though, as that can dry out the leather and lead to cracking.A window is a good location.

, During hot weather, dirt, dust, or sand often gets trapped inside sandals. When the dirt combines with your natural foot sweat, it can create a very stinky situation. This can be particularly noxious in humid climates, where moisture in the air contributes to the wet, warm environment in your shoes. This is why people who don't typically have smelly feet might suddenly develop foot odor in the summertime.


Wear closed shoes like tennis shoes if you will be walking through sand or dirt, like when you go to a playground or beach. If you want to feel the sand in your toes, take your shoes off, and don’t put them back on until you can wash your feet properly.
Be consistent in keeping dirt out of your shoes. It only takes one time for dirt to get into your shoes and create a stink problem, especially if your shoes have a fabric footbed that is hard to clean.

, This might seem like a no brainer, but sometimes stinky shoes are caused by stinky feet, and the only way to address the smell is to take better care of the feet that go in the shoes!


Clean your feet with soap and water every day when you get home from school or work, and again before bed at night.
Apply a daily foot powder, which will help to absorb odors and reduce sweatiness. You can also try a foot antiperspirant, which can actually help to prevent sweatiness in the first place. To find a good product, try doing an internet search and look for a product with high customer reviews."

, This will make the cleaning process easier, and give you a chance to clean the laces.Swirl the laces around in some soapy water, and give them a scrub if they're dirty. Rinse them under clean water, ring them out, and hang them to dry.

, With a shoe brush or old nail brush, carefully brush off dirt, dust, and dried mud from your Docs. Be sure to get into all the hard to reach places as well, such as where the stitching is and inside the tongue.


If you don’t have a shoe or nail brush, you can use a clean, damp, lint-free cloth to remove dirt and dust., If you have any scuffs or polish build-up on your Docs, you can remove both with an acetone-free nail polish remover. Apply some nail polish remover to a clean rag or lint-free cloth. Gently rub at scuffs and polish build up until the scuffs wear away and the polish comes off.


When you're finished, rub the shoes down with a damp, clean cloth and allow them to air dry.Don’t rub too hard with the nail polish remover, otherwise you may damage the finish.

, Because leather was the skin from a living animal, it needs to be moisturized and conditioned (just like human skin) to prevent it from drying, cracking, and losing its durability.Rub your Docs with a cloth or sponge to massage a conditioner into the leather, making sure to get the hard to reach places as well. Let them dry for about 20 minutes afterward. Popular leather conditioners include:


Lemon essential oil (not olive oil, which can cause oil damage)Mink oilWonder Balsam, which is a product made by Dr. Martens that contains coconut oil, beeswax, and lanolin, and which is designed to help protect against water and saltWhile saddle soap is often recommended as a conditioner for leather, the lye it contains can actually cause your leather to dry, crack, and deteriorate faster, To polish leather, you want to match the color of the polish to the color of the leather as closely as possible. Choose a neutral polish if you can't find one to match your Docs, or if your Docs are multicolored.Dr. Martens recommends using only wax-based polishes, and just on their smooth leather products., Choose a location that can get dirty if any accidents occur, and protect the surface you're working on with bags, newspaper, or some other cover., Take a rag or lint-free cloth and run it around in the polish in a circular motion to warm the wax, which will make the polish easier to apply. Apply the polish to the entire shoe, using gentle but firm pressure to get the polish into the leather’s pores.If necessary, use a cotton swab or soft-bristled toothbrush to get polish into the hard to reach places.If your shoes are old and have never been polished, consider applying a second layer of polish.When you're finished, allow the polish to sit on the shoes for 10 to 20 minutes.

, With a shoe brush, begin to gently buff and polish the leather all over, working the polish into the shoes and removing excess at the same time.If you're looking to achieve a mirror shine, the process is slightly more in depth:


Dip your finger into a pot of clean water and allow a couple drops to fall onto a spot on the leather.
Dip a cloth into your shoe polish and rub that spot using circular motions. Work in small areas at a time, applying water and working more polish into the leather with a cloth.
It will likely take a couple hours to cover the entire boot or shoe, but you should notice the leather getting increasingly smooth., When you’ve finished buffing your Docs with a brush or using the mirror shine technique, rub the leather with a clean piece of nylon to remove dust and extra polish, and to buff the leather to a shine., To give your Docs the longest life possible, clean and condition them every three months.To keep them looking as new as possible, polish them every time you clean and condition them.

, With a scraper, spoon, or credit card, remove as much of the gum as possible. Take a hair drier and heat the remaining gum until it becomes tacky. Then apply the sticky side of a piece of tape to gum and peel it off. Press the tape on again and peel it off a few more times. If necessary, reheat the gum with the hair drier and repeat until the gum is gone.After removing any stubborn stains from your boots, proceed with regular cleaning to remove excess residues and cleaning products.

, The best thing to remove paint from your Dr. Martens is mineral spirits. Mineral spirits is a petroleum-based solvent that works well at dissolving paint. Because it’s oil-based, it’s safe to use on leather.


Take a clean rag and dip it in some mineral spirits. Rub the affected area with the rag, adding more mineral spirits as needed. Continue rubbing until the paint dissolves and comes off., For this DIY project you will actually need a penetrating oil like WD-40. Apply the oil to the glue and a small area of the boot surrounding the glue. Let it sit until the glue becomes soft, then scrape the glue with a butter knife or plastic scraper. If necessary, repeat these steps again until the glue is gone. Wipe away the excess oil when the glue has been removed., Use a scraper or credit card and scrape off as much of the sticky substance as possible. Take a clean rag and dip it in some acetone, nail polish remover, or even peanut butter.After rubbing the cleaner into the shoe, take the scraper to it again. Repeat as necessary.


Wipe the area with a clean damp cloth and allow it to dry.

Brush or wipe away surface dirt and debris.,
Rub away stubborn dirt, scuffs, and stains.,
Nourish the leather after letting the shoes dry.,
Polish the shoes.,
Add a “spit-shine,” if desired.",How to Clean Dress Shoes1," Use the horsehair brush that comes with many shoe cleaning kits, or another soft-bristled brush. Alternatively, you can use a piece of clean, soft, lint-free cloth, like a strip of an old t-shirt.The more often you do this basic surface cleaning — e.g., every time you take the shoes off — the easier it and the rest of the cleaning process will be.
Save your old t-shirts for shoe cleaning and polishing. They’ll come in handy often.
Remove the laces from the shoes before continuing; they’ll just get in the way.;
, Lightly moisten another clean cloth and work in a small amount of either saddle soap or leather shoe cleaner. Rub the shoe firmly but not aggressively.For stains caused by road salt, try applying a two-to-one mix of water and white vinegar with a clean cloth. Lightly dampen the leather; don’t saturate it with the solution.If you have caked-on, clumpy layers of old polish to contend with, try adding a bit of nail polish remover (acetone) to cotton balls and wiping gently. This should remove the old polish.

, Give the shoes a bit of time to dry fully if you used any liquids in the cleaning process, then apply your chosen product to make the leather more soft and supple. You can use a leather conditioner, saddle soap, or an oil renovator (like mink oil), all of which can be found alongside other shoe repair products.Follow the product instructions for application, but remember that a little goes a long way no matter what you’re using.

, Choose either a wax or cream polish, or even start with a layer of cream followed later by wax. Shoe cleaning kits include a brush meant for polishing, but a strip of old t-shirt fabric works quite well also. Apply a small amount of polish to the brush or cloth, and work it onto the shoe with a circular motion. It’s better to add small amounts of polish multiple times than to glop on too much at once, so take your time.After you’ve finished applying a coat of polish, buff the shoes using a clean cloth and the same circular motion. Buffing evens out the wax, helps work it into the leather, and removes excess.
If you want to add one or more additional layers of polish, let the shoes dry for a short while between rounds, and always buff after polishing., If your goal is a mirror-like sheen on your shoes, polish and buff at least twice apiece. Then, after the shoes dry a little, sprinkle a few drops of water on them and buff them with the cloth used to apply the polish. Keep repeating this process (with brief drying intervals) to further enhance the shine.If possible, let the shoes dry overnight, then give them one final buff with a dry cloth.

Clean untreated leather shoes differently than treated leather.,
Clean satin shoes carefully.",How to Clean Dress Shoes2," Buy a suede brush, and use this to remove general dirt and debris with gentle brushing in a consistent direction — that is, don’t rub back-and-forth or in circles. However, for scuff marks, brush more vigorously and back-and-forth with the brush, then gently in one direction. Rubbing a suede eraser or even a regular pencil eraser on a stubborn scuff mark can also help.If you must use water to clean a stubborn stain (or need to remove a water stain), wet the entire shoe lightly and then blot it dry thoroughly. When the shoe is dry, use the suede brush to restore the texture.
Apply a spray-on suede protector after cleaning and on a regular schedule, as per the product directions.

, Most leather dress shoes are made of treated leather, but you may have a nice pair of untreated leather shoes or boots that need cleaning. Check the tag on the shoes to determine if the leather is treated or untreated. For either type of leather, use a soft brush or cloth to gently wipe away dirt and debris.


To give untreated leather a deeper clean, use saddle soap. Moisten a clean cloth, then rub a small amount of the soap onto it. Gently rub it onto the shoes, then wipe away the lather. Let the shoes dry thoroughly.
Protect untreated leather with mink oil. Apply a small amount using a clean cloth, then buff it with another clean cloth.

, Satin shoes are a common accompaniment to women’s formal wear (like a prom or wedding dress), since they can be dyed to match the dress color. A deep cleaning isn’t really possible with these delicate shoes, but you can remove minor debris and scuffing.


Wipe the shoes with a dry cloth.
Mix a small amount of oil-based soap with water, dampen a clean cloth with the mixture, and rub it gently over the entire shoe. Scrub a bit harder (in a circular motion) for more stubborn stains or scuffs.

",How to Clean Converse All Stars," Whether you want to deep clean your Chucks so they look brand new, or you’re just trying to get some major stains out, you can make your Converse shoes look great with a few simple cleaning supplies in no time.


Get some stain remover, laundry detergent, 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and a Magic Eraser for the dirt and stains.You can use a couple hand towels and/or rags for scrubbing and laying out your shoes.
Make sure that none of your cleaning supplies have bleach in them. Even if you have a white pair of All Stars, you want to avoid any chemicals that may discolor your shoes.;
, Fill a bucket with warm water and add enough soap so that you can see bubbles.









If you don’t have a bucket readily available, you can also fill up your sink or bathtub with some soapy water.
Add some hydrogen peroxide for extra cleaning power.

, The easiest way to clean your laces is to remove them from your Chucks and clean separately. This will also make it much easier to scrub the tongue and eyelets of your shoes.


For now, set the laces aside on a dry towel or rag.

, If your shoes have recently gotten dirty or muddied then it’s easiest to let the mud dry off before trying to clean your shoes. This may sound counterintuitive but it will be easier to scrape dry mud off of your shoes.If you soak or scrub your shoes with a lot of mud on them then you’re more likely to smear the mud into the canvas, making it harder to remove stains.
Smack your shoes together to knock any mud off.
You can also use a toothbrush or bristle brush to get dry mud off your shoes.

, To protect your washing machine and prevent your shoes from banging around, you should pad your washing machine with some clothes or towels that are similar in color to your shoes.


Don’t fill the washing machine too high so that your shoes won’t get the full effects of the washing machine.
It’s also advisable to only use old clothes or fabrics that you won’t mind if they get affected by your shoes.

, Let your Chucks sit for a few minutes so that the hydrogen peroxide and soap can sink into the canvas fabric. After your shoes have soaked for a few minutes lay the Chucks on a clean towel.









The majority of your shoes are canvas which is a form of cotton, so don’t worry about really letting your shoes soak.
If you have bike grease on your sneakers, you can add some baby powder or even hair spray with alcohol to your shoes and letting it set before soaking., Start scrubbing with a rag to remove any lighter stains that you may have on your shoes. If the rag isn’t working then use a toothbrush or bristle brush.









Scrub in small circular motions to get deeper into the fabric.
For some added cleaning power, grab a stain remover stick and apply it to the problem areas of your shoes like you would on a shirt or pair of pants.
You can also use your Magic Eraser on both the canvas and rubber parts of your sneakers to lift stains.

, Depending on how long you’ve had your sneakers and how much wear there is, you may not be able to clean the rubber completely.









If you’re hitting a tough spot where the rubber may be scratched or stained by something like bike grease, grab a toothbrush and a cup of water and baking soda. Scrub at the tough areas of the rubber as an extra measure.
Be conscious of the rubber strips that wrap around the bottom of your shoes. If you scrub too hard the rubber could break and start to peel off.

, You can clean your shoelaces by simply soaking them but you run the risk of ruining the plastic tips making it harder to thread your laces back into your shoes. To keep the tips intact, unscrew a spray bottle of cleaning solution and put your laces in, screwing the lid back on with the tips hanging out.









Let the laces sit in the solution for about a minute. Then shake the bottle for about 30 seconds.
Be careful since the lid won’t be screwed on completely with your laces hanging out and some liquid will probably leak out.
Remove your laces and wipe down, removing any extra dirt before laying the laces out to dry.

, While you don’t need a mesh washing bag, it doesn’t hurt to put your shoes in one. The bag will keep your shoes from bouncing around too much and possibly hurting your washing machine.


Sandwich your shoes between your other clothes and fabrics for extra padding.
Set your machine to a gentle cycle and use cold water to prevent any color bleeding.

, It’s best to dry your sneakers indoors so that you don’t see a fade in color from overexposure to sunlight. Find a bright, warm, dry place for your All Stars to sit.


You may have to reshape your sneakers a bit after the washing machine. Simply bend the rubber and canvas with your hands to mold your shoes back in place.
Make sure that you lay your shoes on a towel that’s on a flat surface.

The shoelaces will not be replaced until after they’ve been cleaned, and the shoes have been washed and polished., Take your shoes outside and knock them together a few times to remove any caked on mud. For stubborn mud, use a dry brush with stiff bristles to get the mud off. You don’t need to scrub at the dirty fabric, just get off the large hunks of dirt and debris before getting them wet.








, Pour a small amount (just a quick squeeze will work) of mild dish detergent, such as Dawn, into a medium-sized bowl or shallow pan. Fill the bowl with lukewarm water. The soap should get sudsy; if it doesn’t, use your fingers to swish the water and soap together until you get suds.







, Dip a stiff bristled brush into the cleaning solution, then begin scrubbing. Start at one end of your shoe and methodically work your way to the other end, making sure to scrub all areas.








You don’t need to get your shoes soaking wet, just get them wet enough to keep a lather worked up as you scrub.

, Many black Vans have black rubber soles, making them easy to get clean. If your rubber side strips are white, spend a little extra time scrubbing them until they look clean and bright white.








, Wet a clean cloth with fresh water, then wring it out. Use the wet cloth to wipe away the soap on your shoes. Rewet it, wring it out and continue wiping until you’ve removed the soap completely.








Don’t use a soaking wet cloth and avoid drenching your shoes with water.
Let them dry for a few minutes before moving on to polishing them; however, it’s fine to polish them when they are slightly damp.

, Both shoes have a small red Vans logo tag on the heel. These tags are located on the rubber strip, not the shoe fabric. Tear two small tag-sized pieces of masking tape off the roll. Stick them over the red tags, covering them completely.


Most people prefer to preserve the original look of the tags, so they need to be protected against the black shoe polish.

, When you remove the cap, you’ll see a sponge applicator on the end. Turn the bottle upside down over your shoe and squeeze a dollop of shoe polish directly onto the fabric of your shoe.








You can get this kind of shoe polish at any shoe store, as well as grocery stores and big box stores.
Start with one shoe and complete the process before moving on to the next one.

, Move your hand quickly back and forth, spreading the small amount of polish on one area of the shoe until the polish soaks in. You don’t need to push the applicator hard against your shoe. Keep your grip loose so you can work the polish over the surface quickly.








You’ll see the black polish immediately begin to renew the color of the fabric.

, Continue to squeeze small amounts of polish onto the shoe and use the same quick back and forth motions to cover the entire surface. Avoid adding more polish until the first application has soaked in. Work quickly so you can spread the polish evenly, before it seeps deeply into one spot and over-saturates the fabric.









The surface of the shoe should not look soaked in polish. Don’t leave any polish pooled on the surface of the shoe.
Give scuff marks and faded areas additional attention as needed.

, Once you’ve completely covered the fabric, use the same process to renew the black rubber along the sides of your shoes. Apply a small amount of polish and work it quickly around the perimeter. The rubber will immediately look refreshed.








Don’t forget to polish the black plastic rings around the lace holes. The tiny brand tag near the lace holes should be avoided, unless you don’t mind covering up the Vans logo.
Some black vans have white rubber side strips. If yours don’t have black rubber soles, you can omit this part.

, The black polish should bring the whole shoe to a consistent color. Check your shoe for uneven application or remaining visible scuff marks or stains. Be sure to get into any crevices you may have missed.








, Run a clean cotton cloth under the tap. Wring it out. Brush it lightly over the shoe’s surface, buffing the polish into the fabric and rubber completely. If you notice any areas pooling with excess polish, dab and buff until the shoe’s surface looks uniform. Your shoe should look shiny, renewed and slightly wet.







, Work on one shoe at a time. Once you’re satisfied with the way the first one looks, set it aside and work on the next shoe. Repeat the same process of quickly spreading the black polish over the entire surface of your shoe, including the black rubber side strips.








, Set your shoes aside to dry while you move on to cleaning the laces. Polish usually takes around 15 minutes to dry completely. If you used a lot of polish, it may take a little longer. Make sure they feel dry to the touch before wearing your shoes.


Peel the masking tape off the heels once the shoes are dry to the touch.

, Dump the used solution out and start over with another squirt of mild soap and lukewarm water. Fill up the bowl with enough water to completely submerge your laces. Make sure the soap and water incorporate thoroughly. The solution should look sudsy.








, Submerge them completely in the solution. Allow them to soak for a few minutes, which will loosen up any embedded dirt or stains. Use the end of an old toothbrush or your finger to lightly agitate the laces in the solution for a little extra cleaning power.







, Starting at one end, scrub the lace vigorously, concentrating on any stained areas. Work your way to the opposite end. Flip the lace over and do the other side. Then move on to the second lace and repeat the same actions.







, Put them on a clean dry cloth or a few paper towels and give them a few hours to air dry completely.Once they no longer feel damp to the touch, lace your shoes back up and wear them as usual. The polish should be long dry at this point, but it wouldn’t hurt to brush your fingers over the surface of your shoes to make sure.

Wait twenty-four hours for your shoes to dry. You can place a rubber band over the fabric to hold it to the shoe.

, You may also consider not using the fabric and just sticking to fabric glue to hold the shoe together.








, To make your TOMS last longer, you'll need the inserts that came with the shoes, duct tape, and scissors.









It's likely you don't have the inserts from your old shoes, so you may have to wait to buy a new pair to try this trick.
You can also ask any friends who are buying a new pair for their inserts, or find an insert of similar size.

, The thicker the tape, the better.









The sticky side of the tape should be facing up, and it should fall in line with the place where your toe hits the fabric.

, When you get them in the right position, press down on the fabric so the tape sticks to it.









Remove the cardboard and let the tape remain in its place.

, Now that you've reinforced your shoes, you can wear them in, so the new taped part doesn't bother you.









If the tape comes lose, repeat the process.

Use older shoes for dirty or damaging tasks.",How to Care for Shoes,"


Don't pile the shoes on top of each other, as that might leave dirt or marks on your shoes.
Don't rest things on top of your shoes or rest shoes on their tops. This avoids crushing them.
Create special storage for special shoes. If you have a pair of good dress shoes that you only wear with your good suit, keep them free of dust by storing them in a box or bag.
Maintain the shape of the toe of softer shoes by packing them loosely with clean tissue. Or, use a cardboard, wood, or plastic shape designed for this purpose.;
, You can get the necessary supplies and do the job yourself or ask your nearest cleaners if they clean shoes.

, Keep your shoes away from mud, wet grass, and water puddles, as that might make your shoes dirtier and reduce their lives.

, Wear slippers around the house, and change into them when you can. This will make it so that your shoes don't wear out as fast and make them last much longer.

, People tend not to be careful with other people's shoes, so try not to lend them out, no matter how cute they are.

, Untie lace-up shoes and put your feet all the way in. Untie them again to take them off. If you want to slip in and out, get slip-ons or clogs.

, If you know you will be out in your shoes in snow or rain, apply a suitable waterproofing agent periodically. A good shoe store can recommend an appropriate product.

, Keep last year's sneakers for this year's gardening, painting, or walking on rough surfaces or gravel. You'll get a little more use out of the older shoes and spare the newer shoes premature damage.

Store shoes in door-hanging shoe bags.,
Put them in boxes for longer storage.,
Avoid storing shoes wet.,
Don’t wrap leather shoes in plastic.,
Store shoes with cedar, not mothballs.,
Don’t stack shoes on top of one another.",How to Store Shoes," Storing shoes that have dirt, dust and other residues on them could cause the material the shoes are made from to degrade over time. This is especially true for shoes made of leather or suede, but all shoes benefit from being cleaned up before you store them. Even if you’re just storing your shoes for the night, and you’re planning on wearing them again tomorrow, it’s a good idea to clean them before you put them away. Let them dry before storing.


Clean leather and suede shoes by brushing off dirt and dust with a soft, non-scratchy brush. Use a special leather or suede cleaner to remove stains.
Clean canvas shoes by brushing them off, then using soapy water to clean stains.
Wash plastic shoes with soap and water.;
, If you’ve previously been throwing all your boots, heels, and running shoes in one big pile, picking out pairs as you need them, it’s time to sort your shoes. Sorting them by season and purpose will help your closet stay organized and keep your shoes in better condition than if you just toss them all together.


Group your heels and other dress shoes together.
Plan to store your winter boots and other winter shoes in the same place.
Group flip flops, sandals and other summer shoes together.
Group your exercise shoes and casual shoes together.

, Shoes remain in their best condition when they’re not exposed to lots of sunlight or hot or cold temperatures. The best place to store shoes is in a cool, dark closet that doesn’t get excessively warm and stuffy. If you don’t have enough room in your closet, you could store them under your bed or on your bedroom wall.


Don’t store shoes in the basement, garage or other places that might get cold in the winter and hot in the summer. The fibers the shoes are made out of cold break down over time under these conditions.

, If you’re going to be storing shoes for a month or longer before you next wear them, stuffing shoes with paper helps them retain their shape. Just make sure it’s acid-free paper, since paper that contains acid can damage shoe materials. Avoid using newsprint, since it could discolor your shoes.


Cut up toilet paper rolls also work well.
Use shoe trees for your best shoes. If you have a pair of nice leather shoes, store them with shoe trees so they stay in tip-top condition. Shoe trees made out of cedar keep shoes smelling fresh, and they also repel moths and other bugs. Shoe trees are available at shoe stores or online.

, If you have a nice pair of boots you want to store, use boot stands to keep them upright. If the tops flop over, they could end up with a permanent crease after a few months of storage. If you don’t want to invest in boot stands, try this clever trick: use empty, dry wine bottles to keep your boots upright.

, If you and your family have certain pairs of shoes you wear almost every day, a convenient way to keep them in one spot is to have a designated mat for everyday shoes. Keep it near the door or coat rack, and have family members kick off their shoes and line them up neatly so they’ll always know where to find them.


You could also get a shoe cubby for this purpose. Reserve it for the shoes that are worn most often, like school shoes and tennis shoes.
Have a separate spot reserved for wet shoes that need to dry out. This could be a mat on a covered porch or a mat in your entryway.

, If you have a big collection of shoes, you’ll need a second storage area for the shoes you don’t wear very often. Shoe racks make it easy to organize shoes in a closet or along a bedroom wall. Choose a plastic or wooden shoe rack and group shoes by purpose, lining them up neatly and putting them away after each use.


If you have an old wooden ladder, consider using it to make a unique shoe rack. Just paint the ladder to match your room, then place it sideways against a wall. Line up your shoes on the rungs of the ladder for easy storage.
Another great solution is to get a wooden pallet from a home improvement store. Mount the pallet to your wall ( use a stud-finder to make sure you mount it securely with screws) and store your shoes by inserting the tips of the shoes into the slats. You might not want to use this method for your most expensive leather shoes, since it can cause creasing, but it’s great for tennis shoes, flip flops and the like.

, If you’re low on storage space, pick up an over-the-door shoe bag from the store and start using it to store your shoe in pairs. This keeps them off of the floor and organized so they don’t clutter up your closet floor.

, If you’re storing shoes that you don’t plan on wearing for a month or more, it’s best to store them in a box. You can store shoes in their original shoe boxes or use clear plastic containers so you’ll be able to see what shoes you’ve stored.


Old wine boxes are good substitutes for shoe boxes if you can’t locate a pair’s original box.
Wrap the shoes in acid-free tissue paper to keep them safe during storage.
You can also use silica gel to keep the materials shoes are made from fresh. You can purchase a container of silica gel from a craft store.

, Don’t put shoes in their storage containers, even just a cubbyhole, until they’re completely dry. Wet shoes can get moldy in storage, plus storing them wet will make them more likely to smell bad. Place shoes in a dry, ventilated area to let them dry out completely before you store them.

, Leather and suede shoes need to be able to breathe while they’re in storage. Wrapping them in plastic could cause them to end up moldy or discolored. Always wrap leather shoes in acid-free tissue instead of plastic.

, Mothballs are made with toxic chemicals that repel moths, but are also dangerous for use around kids and pets. Mothballs also have a distinctive stuffy, chemical smell that infuses anything they’re stored with and is very difficult to remove. Instead of using mothballs, store your shoes with cedar balls or cedar shoe trees. Cedar naturally repels moths, is nontoxic and leaves shoes smelling fresh.

, Many people store shoes one on top of the other to make more room, but storing your shoes this way can cause them to lose their shape over time. It’s fine to stack flip flops this way, but for any shoe that has more structure, store them side by side instead. Even if you stack them so that one shoe is upside-down, storing them this way for several months will cause them to start getting misshapen.

Purchase a small can of mink oil.,
Rub the mink oil into the shoes very liberally.,
Place the shoes in the sun directly.,
Wipe off the excess mink oil.,
Try on the shoes.",How to Break in a New Pair of Tennis Shoes1," This can be found at any retailer that sells shoes or any discount retailer. A can costs about US$3-5.00.;
, Leave a residue on the shoes, this is okay to do. Use more oil than what you think you will need, as it soaks into the shoe.


Be certain the put a lot of mink oil on the shoes.

, Place them outside and in a temperature of at least 90 degrees or above. Above 90 degrees is preferred. Leave the shoes out in the sun for at least 6 hours.

, However, leave on the shoes and rub in the remainder.

, You will be amazed how soft the tennis shoes are and are ready to wear. The stiffest tennis shoes will become soft and wearable immediately.

Hold one canvas tennis shoe.,
Stuff scrunched up newspaper or sock balls into the tennis shoes for a few hours.,
Put the tennis shoes on.,
Wear them for a game.",How to Break in a New Pair of Tennis Shoes2," Bend the toe end back and forth a little. Repeat for the other shoe., This will slightly stretch the shoes.

Be careful of newspaper print transferring to the canvas. You can use butcher's paper or some other plain paper and scrunch it into balls instead.

, Wear them around the house for a few hours. They should start to feel comfortable quickly.

If you can, wear the tennis shoes with thick socks, to increase the stretching.

, Bring along an old pair just in case the new pair starts to hurt. However, by the end of the game, the new canvas tennis shoes should be comfortable and broken in."

Start with thick socks.,
Wear the shoes for 10 minutes.,
Increase your shoe-wearing time in 10-minute increments.,
Manually stretch the leather.,
Keep the shoes stretched even when they’re off your feet.,
Take your boots on an outing.",How to Break in Your Brand New Dr Martens Boots1," Put on socks that will both push the leather outwards and protect your feet from any rubbing or pinching, preventing the formation of blisters.;
, Keep the shoes on long enough that they begin to mold to your feet, but not so long that they cause pain or injury. Walk around and stretch your feet while your wear them.


Do this whenever you have free time to change shoes and walk around, at least two to three times per day.
To find the time to switch between your comfy shoes and the Dr. Martens you’re breaking in, wear your new boots either before or after work, or during your lunch break at the office.

, Slowly expand the amount of time you keep your shoes on your feet, paying close attention to how your feet feel. Don’t push through the pain!Because this is a slower and more time-consuming method, plan ahead. If you want to show off your new Dr. Martens at a particular event, begin this process about a month before that date.

, Bend the back of the shoe inwards to make the heel area more spacious, then push the toe to and away from the laces. You can also bend the leather in and out on the instep (or the middle, by the laces) of the shoe. This may cause creasing in the leather. To avoid noticeable or permanent creases, be sure your leather is properly conditioned before you use your hands to stretch it. Dr. Martens has its own product, Wonder Balsam, for this purpose.
Periodically conditioning your boots will also aid in the overall break-in process. Soft and supple leather is much easier to stretch than stiff leather., Stuff your shoes with newspapers or a shoe tree to make sure they don’t shrink back down when you’re not wearing them. If you use newspaper, be sure to fully stuff the shoe.

, Once you can comfortably wear your Dr. Martens for an hour, they should be fully broken in. Test the fit on a walk or excursion that allows you to come home and change shoes if necessary.


If you’re worried, bring an extra pair of reliable shoes along with you.

Pour water into a resealable freezer bag.,
Seal the bag.,
Place the bag in your shoe.,
Freeze the boot.,
Let the boots thaw.,
Remove the bag.,
Check the fit.",How to Break in Your Brand New Dr Martens Boots2," Fill the bag no more than halfway to avoid spills or tears.


Be aware of the areas of your boot that need the most stretching, as this may alter how much water you place in the bag. If it’s a smaller or larger portion, fill the bag with the amount of water that makes it fit comfortably within that space.
Use a high-quality plastic bag. You don’t want any water to touch the leather directly, as this will damage your boots. Choosing a bag specifically labeled for freezer use will help ensure that no leaking occurs., Leaving only a small corner of the bag unsealed, remove the excess air from the unfilled half of the bag, and then fully seal the bag. Double check for leaks, tears, or an incomplete seal.Just in case you’ve spilled a bit of water while filling or sealing the bag, wipe it off with a dishcloth or paper towel.

, Check to make sure that the bag presses against the area(s) of the shoe that need to be stretched.


Use crumpled newspaper to keep the bag in position.
You can use several bags of varying sizes to fill the various portions of your shoe. The toe, in particular, may call for a smaller bag that fully touches the entire front of the shoe.

, Put your boot, complete with filled bag(s), into your freezer. Leave the boots in the freezer for a minimum of eight hours, or overnight. The water should be completely frozen before you remove the shoes, as the expanding ice is what stretches the leather.

, Once you remove your boots from the freezer, wait at least twenty minutes and up to an hour before you remove the bags. The ice needs time to melt and soften a bit so that you’re not forcing the bag out of the shoe. Taking the bag out too early may tear the bag, leaking water that will damage your boot.

, Be very careful not to tear the bag as you pull it out of your boot.

, If your boots are still too tight, repeat the process, focusing your attention on the problem areas.

Put on thick socks.,
Wear your boots on top of the socks.,
Break out your hair dryer.,
Let the boots cool.,
Check the fit.,
Condition your leather.",How to Break in Your Brand New Dr Martens Boots3," You want the boots to feel tight, so use woolen or winter socks., You may need to force your feet to fit into the boots, and this won't be the most comfortable experience. Without a tight fit, however, the leather won’t have any reason to stretch or expand.


If the boots still feel loose, try putting on two or three pairs of socks at once.

, Keeping the hair dryer about six inches away from the shoe, blow hot air on the tight areas of the boots for about 30 seconds, flexing your feet and wiggling your toes as you go.Each problem spot should receive its own 30-second heat treatment.

, Keep wearing your new shoes until they’ve cooled down, walking around and flexing your foot as you wait. The boots should be about room temperature to the touch before you remove them, otherwise you’ll negate the heating process.

, You may need to repeat this method several times, paying close attention to which spots need the most attention. Focus the heat treatment on those areas.


Try wearing a thicker pair of socks if you find it necessary to repeat the steps. It’s possible your fit wasn’t tight enough to force the leather to stretch.

, Heat removes moisture from the leather, which may cause cracks or breaks in the shoes. Avoid this side effect by applying products designed to restore moisture and keep the leather supple, such as Dr. Martens Wonder Balsam.

, Use a clean, white rag or cloth to test the solution on a small, hidden part of the shoe. Let the solution set for one minute. Then, blot the spot with a wet, clean cloth to remove the solution. Look for any discoloration, residue, or stains left by the solution. Choose a different method if there are any unwanted effects.








Alternatively, test the solution on an old shoe first before using it on the shoe in question.
You always want to test any cleaning solution on a small surface before applying it to larger surfaces. This way you can avoid any unwanted effects.

, You can do this by using a clean sponge, cloth, or rag. Let the solution set for 30 minutes. While the solution is setting, dab the stain with more solution every five minutes.







, Run a clean dry cloth or rag under cool water. Then, remove the solution by sponging the stain with the wet cloth. Sponge until the stain is removed. Re-wet your cloth if necessary.

Rinse with warm water and soap.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Your Shoes2," Make sure to use white, creamy sunscreen as opposed to colored or spray sunscreen. Use a white rag or cloth so you will be able to see if the sunscreen is removing the coloring of the leather.








If you start out with a small amount of sunscreen, removing the coloring of the leather should not be a problem.

, Use gentle pressure when rubbing the stain so as not to remove any coloring of the leather. If it is a large stain, only work on small sections at a time.








While removing the stain, use more sunscreen as needed.

, Once the stain is removed, clean the area with mild soap and water. Use a clean cloth or rag to clean the area. Also use a clean, dry cloth to dry the area.

Gather your shoe shining supplies.,
Prepare your work space.,
Clean the shoes to remove any dirt.,
Apply the shoe polish.,
Remove the excess polish with a shoeshine brush.,
Buff the shoes with a cloth.",How to Shine Shoes1," Properly shining your shoes will require certain supplies, which you can purchase altogether in a specialized shoe shining kit or you can piece together individually. The non-negotiable you will need include a tin of shoe polish, a horsehair shoe brush and a soft cloth.









Tins of shoe polish are available in a variety of colors, from browns to blacks to neutrals. Try to get a polish that's as close to the original color as possible.
Polishes are also available in both wax and cream varieties; cream polishes feed the leather and make it more supple, whereas wax polishes make the shoes more water resistant. If possible, get a tin of each and alternate between the two with every second polish.
The soft cloth can be a specialized buffing cloth, such as a chamois or ""shammy"", or just an old t-shirt.
Optional extras include a polishing brush (used to apply the polish), a toothbrush or some cotton buds, sole dressing and a leather cleaner and conditioner.;
, It is important to prepare your work space so you can avoid getting shoe polish on any furniture or flooring. Shoe polish can be extremely difficult to remove, so you don't want it anywhere but on your shoes.









Lay down some newspaper or old paper bags on the floor or work surface and grab a cushion or pull up a comfortable chair -- shoe shining can take some time.
If you're planning on doing a very thorough job on your shoes, it is probably best to remove the laces before you polish. This way you can easily get at the tongue.

, Before you begin polishing, rub down the surface of each shoe with your horsehair brush or a dampened cloth to remove any dirt, dust, salt or other debris. This is important, because if any debris is left on the surface of the shoes it might scratch the shoes as you polish.









Leave the shoes to dry completely before moving on the next stage.
If the shoes are very dirty or worn out looking, you may want to clean them more thoroughly using a leather cleaner and conditioner before polishing., Using an old t-shirt or polishing brush apply an even layer of polish to the surface of the first shoe. Use a circular motion to really work the polish into every part of the shoe. Pay extra attention to the toe and heel, which may need an extra layer of polish as these areas tend to get the most wear.









If you are using an old t-shirt or cloth for this step, try to wrap the cloth tightly around your hand and use your index and middle finger to work the polish into the shoe.
You may also want to shine the section of the sole between the heel and toe which doesn't touch the ground, as this may be visible as you walk.
Use a toothbrush or cotton bud to work the polish into hard-to-reach areas, such as the edges of the upper and the crevices in the vamp.
Once you have finished polishing the first shoe, set it aside on the newspaper and begin the same process with the second shoe. Allow each shoe to dry for about 15 minutes before moving onto the next step., Once the polish is dry, you can begin to remove the excess with your horsehair shoeshine brush. Brush the entire shoe vigorously, using short, even strokes. Remember that the movement should come from your wrist, not your elbow.









This step is necessary to remove the extra polish, while the heat generated from the quick strokes helps the rest of the polish to sink in.
While an old t-shirt or cloth can be used for most of the steps in the shoe shining process, a proper shine brush is necessary for this particular step, and cannot be replaced by anything else.
Make sure to use a different brush for each color of polish. Otherwise you run the risk of adding the previous color to the current shoe. Especially when the previous polish is darker than the current.
You may want to use a clean cotton bud or toothbrush or cotton bud again at this point to remove any extra polish from cracks and crevices.

, The final step in the polishing and shining process is to take an old (clean) t-shirt or chamois cloth and buff the shoes until you achieve a high shine. Use a brisk side-to-side motion for buffing -- this may be easier to do using a shine butler or while actually wearing the shoe.









Some people advise breathing onto the toe of the shoe (like you would do to fog a mirror) before buffing to add extra shine.If you like, you can also apply a sole dressing to the outside edges of the sole to give them a nice shine, but this is completely optional.

Wear your new shoes around the house.,
Wear your shoes little and often at first.,
Bring your shoes to work.,
Wear them with socks.",How to Break in a New Pair of Shoes1," Before you go out in them, try walking up stairs, standing around (cooking dinner, playing with kids, etc.), sitting down, and even running.










Note: This is the most trusted method for easily and lightly breaking in your new shoes. If you have nice leather or dress shoes — shoes that you would be frustrated to see scuffed, altered, or even discolored — this method is the safest to try.;
, When you try out new shoes before you've bought them, you rarely walk away with sore feet, right? That's because you haven't donned your shoes for long enough to cause any pain (or alter the frame of the shoe to fit your foot). So, when breaking shoes in at home, wear early, wear often, and don't feel like you need to put your shoes on for hours at a time to notice a difference.









In fact, start with wearing your shoes 10 minutes at a time in the beginning.Try this for a couple days. Gradually, wear your shoes for 10 minutes more, every couple of days, until you're wearing the shoes for an hour at a time. By this time, the shoes should be tamed!

, Wear some old shoes to work, but when you're sitting at your desk, bust out your new ones and simply get in the habit of having them on your feet. This is a simply way to break in your new shoes while saving time.








, This way, you can tell if you need socks when you wear them. This can also prevent blistering when getting used to new shoes.









Wear your shoes with socks that are a little bigger than you normally would use. Try thick cotton socks, and squeeze into the shoes. Don't do any heavy walking, or you'll give yourself blisters. Just keep your feet in the shoe. The size of the sock will help stretch out the frame.

Prep the shoes and apply the first layer of polish.,
Dip a cloth or cotton ball into water.,
Buff the shoes.,
Dip the cloth into water again and apply a second layer of polish.,
Continue to apply additional light layers of polish to the shoes with a wet cloth, until you achieve the desired shine.",How to Shine Shoes2," The first steps involved in spit shining shoes are the same as above. First, you will need to clean the shoes with a damp cloth or horsehair brush to remove any dirt and debris. Then you will apply the first layer of polish using a cloth or polishing brush, using small circular motions to really work the polish into the leather.









Allow the polish to dry for about 15 minutes before moving on to the next step.

, Spit shining involves using a damp cloth or cotton ball to apply successive layers of polish. If using a cloth, make sure to wrap it tightly around your hand, with the index and middle fingers covered by the material. Dip your cloth-covered fingers or a cotton ball into a dish of of water until wet but not dripping.









The water is used to prevent the polish from sticking to the cloth and encourage it to stay on the shoes instead.
Some people prefer to use rubbing alcohol instead of water.

, Pick up a shoe and begin buffing the first layer of dried polish using the damp cloth or cotton ball. Work slowly, using small circular motions to really work the polish into the shoe. Spit shining is all about finesse, not speed.









Work from the toe to the heel, doing one side of the shoe at a time.
Move onto the second shoe once the first has developed a nice even shine.

, When you have finished buffing and the shoes are completely dry, dip the cloth or cotton ball into the water again and wring out until just damp. Use this dampened material to apply a second light layer of polish to the surface of the shoes, using the same thorough technique as before.









After this second polish, you should begin to see a hazy shine developing on the surface of the shoe., The surface of the shoes should be perfectly smooth and even, with a glass-like shine.









It is very important that you apply multiple light layers as opposed to just one or two thick layers -- this allows each successive layer to build on the previous one, giving spit shined shoes their mirror-like finish.If you like, you can use a chamois or an old t-shirt to give the shoes one final buff before wearing, though this may be unnecessary.

"
"
Clean the shoes.,
Ignite the shoe polish with a lighter.,
Apply the melted polish to the shoes with a dampened cloth.,
Continue to apply light layers of polish until the shoes begin to shine.,
Heat the surface of the shoes with a lighter or hair dryer.,
Apply a final layer of polish.",How to Shine Shoes3," Before fire shining your shoes, you will need to remove any dirt or debris using a damp cloth or horsehair brush. This will prevent the surface of the shoes from becoming scratched while polishing. Some people will also use a technique known as ""stripping"" before doing a fire shine, which basically involves removing any previous coatings of polish from the shoes. To strip your shoes:









Apply a few drops of rubbing alcohol to each shoe and work it into the surfaces using a cotton cloth. You should notice previous layers of polish rubbing off onto the cloth.
It may take some time to complete this process and get the surface of the shoes evenly stripped, but it will be worth it for shoes so shiny you'll be able to see your reflection in them!

, Now comes the fun part. Open your can of shoe polish (most regular brands of shoe polish will work fine) and hold it upside down, over a cigarette lighter. Turn on the lighter and allow the surface of the polish to catch fire. Quickly turn it right side up so none of the melting polish drips onto the floor.








Allow the polish to burn for a couple of seconds, then extinguish the flame by blowing it out or carefully replacing the lid.
When you reopen the tin, the surface of the polish should be melted and gooey.
Be extremely careful when using this method of shoe shining. Fire is dangerous and can cause burns. It may be best to wear a glove while doing this, and have a bucket of water close by in case of emergencies.

, Wrap an old t-shirt around your hands and dip it into a cup of warm water until wet but not dripping. Dip this wet cloth into the melted polish and start applying it to the shoes, using small circular motions.









Take your time and try to really work the polish into the shoes in a smooth, even layer. Don't forget to work the polish into any hard-to-reach cracks or crevices.
If you need more polish, or if the cloth becomes too dry, dip it in the water and polish again.

, Depending on the shoes, you may need to add multiple layers of polish to achieve the desired shine. Use the same technique each time, dipping the damp cloth into the melted polish and working it evenly into the shoes.









Remember that it's better to use multiple light layers of polish than one or two thick ones.
Make sure that you let each additional layer of polish dry completely before moving onto the next. Shoe shining requires a lot of patience.

, This step is completely optional, but will really help to add shine to your shoes. Take your lighter (or hairdryer set to high heat) and run the flame over the entire surface of the shoe.









The flame should never actually touch the shoe, but should be close enough to allow the polish to melt.
Never hold the flame over one spot, or it will burn the leather. Keep it moving constantly, as if spray painting. Stop once the polish has melted slightly and the surface of the shoes look wet.Set the shoes aside for 15 to 20 minutes until the melted polish has dried.

, You can now apply one final layer of polish, using the same technique as before. Your shoes should be extremely shiny by now, almost glass-like in appearance. If you want, you can use a chamois or any clean, lint-free cloth to give the shoes one last buff.

Fill up two sandwich bags halfway full of water.,
Place the one of the baggies in each shoe.,
Put the shoes in a bigger, sealed plastic bag and place into freezer.,
Wait 3 to 4 hours.,
Take the shoes out of the freezer.,
Take the baggies out of your shoe.,
Try on your shoes.",How to Break in a New Pair of Shoes2," Make sure the bags are big enough so that they'll put pressure on the shoe when they expand in the freezer.









When you seal the plastic bag up, remove any air from the inside of the bag. This will make it easier to ""mold"" the water inside the bag to the contour of your shoe.
This method will involve placing your shoes in the freezer for an extended period of time, during which time they may get wet. Be sure that the shoes you are using with this method aren't irreplaceable or susceptible to water damage.

, Make sure that the seal is tightly locked. You don't want your shoes covered in ice when you remove them from the freezer.








, Your shoes should contain a smaller plastic bag inside the cavity and a larger one protecting it from outside moisture.








, When the water inside the shoe freezes, it expands, putting pressure on the cavity in the shoe and breaking them in. The advantage of using water as opposed to a shoe stretcher is that the water will adjust to the contours of the inside of your shoe perfectly.








, The water filled baggies should now be solid ice.








, You may have to wait a few minutes in order to slide them out easier.








, Once the shoes have warmed up a bit, try walking in them and even running and jogging in them if they are athletic shoes.









Your new shoes should now be broken in and even expanded a little, and a lot more comfortable!

Wear the shoes for 10 minutes.,
Take the shoes off and stretch manually.,
Blast the shoe with heat.,
Immediately after heating, wear the shoes.,
Repeat at least one more time.",How to Break in a New Pair of Shoes3," Get the shoes on your feet, preferably with socks, and walk around for no more than 10 minutes. This is just to get them prepped.








, If the shoe permits, bend it upwards and downwards a few times.








, Heating the shoe will expand the material, especially if it's leather, making it more supple.









Use a hair drier, turned to a hot (but maybe not hottest) setting, and heat the shoe up for 2 to 3 minutes.
If you don't have a hair drier, try placing your shoes next to an indoor heater, or even directly out in the sun. Some heat is better than no heat.

, Wear them around for another 10 minutes, walking, sitting, or even running.








, Your shoes will be tangibly more comfortable after a couple heat treatments.

"
If possible, buy a shoe stretcher.,
Use a potato.,
Purchase some stretching spray.,
Get a cobbler to machine-stretch shoes for you.,
Avoid these gimmicks.",How to Break in a New Pair of Shoes4," These can help your shoes get a little less tight. If you don't want to buy a stretcher (though they can be cheap online), taking the shoe by the heel and the tip and flexing it back and forth works just fine.

Make sure you wear your shoes after using the flex method or your shoes will lose their shape!

, Peel a large potato and leech some of the moisture off with a paper towel. Place the potato inside the cavity of the shoe and leave overnight. Remove in the morning.








, Spray the shoes with some stretching solution, following instructions on packaging. Most of the time, instructions will recommend that you manually stretch the shoe back and forth in between sprays.








, Americans spend nearly $2 million on shoe stretching per year.A cobbler will spray the shoe with a stretching solution and then stretch the shoe over a machine for a couple hours while it dries. This shouldn't cost more than $20.








, Some shoe-stretching techniques plain don't work or are bad for your shoes, especially nice leather ones. Avoid the following breaking-in techniques:









Applying rubbing alcohol to your shoes. Alcohol can leave unsightly marks on nice leather shoes, as well as rob the leather of its natural oils.
Hitting the shoes with a hammer or another hard object. Hammering the backs of shoes could work, but at what cost? Is it worth it to have broken-in shoes that are actually broken?
Having someone with bigger feet break your shoes in. Having someone with bigger feet break your shoes in is immoral and ineffective. Not only are you placing the burden of pain on another person (poor, poor person!), you're also letting the shoes conform to his or her feet, not your own! Avoid.

Leave the shoe in the freezer for an hour or two.,
Remove the shoe from the plastic bag.",How to Remove Gum from a Shoe1," Take your gum-ridden shoe and put it in a plastic bag, such as a large food storage bag or a grocery bag. It doesn't matter if the entire shoe doesn't fit in the bag, just make sure the part with the gum is pressed against the plastic.;
, Press the plastic bag firmly against the piece of gum for several seconds. You need the gum to stick to the plastic before freezing, otherwise this method won't work.








, Clear a space in your freezer for the plastic-covered shoe. If the shoe is not fully inside the plastic bag, you may want to keep it away from any food items, to avoid spreading any germs.








, This will give the gum a chance to freeze onto the plastic bag. Once frozen, remove the shoe and the bag from the freezer.

, The gum should stick to the plastic bag instead of your shoe, leaving your shoe gum-free!

Fill a large plastic bag with ice cubes.,
Keep the ice cold.,
Firmly press the ice onto the gum until it freezes.,
Once frozen, scrape the gum from the shoe.",How to Remove Gum from a Shoe2," Place your shoe on top of the ice cubes, gum-side down. Avoid letting the ice cubes go inside or around the shoe, as this will make your shoe wet.








, To prevent it from melting too fast, use a food storage bag that can be zipped closed or tie the bag shut.








, You will only be able to remove the gum after it has frozen solid. This may take a little while -- so have patience!








, Carefully use a dull butter knife or putty knife to scrape the hard, frozen gum off the shoe. Move the knife slowly to avoid cutting the shoe or yourself.

Spray the gum with WD-40.,
Wipe away the gum.,
Clean the sole of your shoe.",How to Remove Gum from a Shoe3," Get a can of WD-40 (available in supermarkets and cleaning supply stores) and spray it onto the sole of your shoe, on and around the gum. Let it sit for at least a minute, to allow the WD-400 to loosen the gum's adhesive bond.








, Use a paper towel, rag, or any cloth to wipe the gum from the sole of the shoe. It should come away pretty easily. If not, give the gum a second spray and try again.








, Once the gum has been removed, use a paper towel or clean rag to wipe the shoe again to remove any additional residue left from the spray. Toss the rag or paper towels away when finished.

, After 10 minutes, use a wire brush to scrub away both the peanut butter and the gum. It may take a little elbow grease, but the gum should come away too.









Remember to scrub with the grooves of the sole instead of against them, to avoid damaging your shoe., Hold the sole of your shoe underneath some cold running water and scrub with a sponge to remove any peanut butter residue.

Find a wooden stick and some dry sand.,
Sprinkle some sand over the gum.,
Continually add more sand and keep rubbing.",How to Remove Gum from a Shoe5," This method works well if you're outside and happen to step on some fresh gum that is still pretty soft and pliable. All you need is some dry sand (or dirt) and a small wooden stick.

, Remove your shoe and sprinkle some sand on top of the gum. Use the stick to start rubbing the sand into the gum -- it should start coming away in small chunks.








, As the gum starts to come away, sprinkle some more sand on top and continue rubbing. The sand acts kind of like an exfoliator for the bottom of your shoe!









Keep going until the gum is more or less completely removed. This may take a little while, but it's better to act quickly instead of allowing the gum to dry and harden onto your shoe.

Use lighter fluid.,
Use nail polish remover.",How to Remove Gum from a Shoe6," Soak an old cloth or piece of paper towel in some naphtha and rub it onto the gum. The gum should start to dissolve away.









Make sure to use the naphtha in a well-ventilated area, away from any heat sources, as naphtha is highly flammable.

, Acetone-based nail polish remover can also be used to dissolve chewing gum from the sole of a shoe. Soak a paper towel or cloth in the remover and rub it onto the gum until it disappears.









Just be careful what type of shoes you use this method for, as acetone may damage the finish on patent or suede shoes."

Buy smart.,
Use preventatives.,
Read the instructions.",How to Protect Winter Boots1," Suede isn't an ideal material for winter boots if you live in a very wet climate. While the boots can be protected by commercial products, chemicals in these can weaken the fabric after a time. Moreover, dampness and salt stains gradually destroy the suede.


One solution can be to only wear suede boots when it's not going to rain and when the sidewalks are obviously cleared of snow.Or, accept that suede boots won't look as good at the end of the season as they did at the beginning!
Synthetic boots may be more durable for some purposes. This will depend on your wearing preferences and the comfort of the boot. Ask a retailer for specific advice when purchasing your winter boots.;
, There are some commercial products available that you can apply to your boots before you wear them out in the weather. Some products include:


Waterproofing to stop material from becoming spotted in water or salt. These usually come in aerosol sprays and are sold at shoe stores or by the manufacturer.Oils, waxes, or rubs that create a protective layer on the boot material. You can find these at leather-repair stores, shoe stores, or hardware stores.Protective agents that keep the boots from fading or falling apart. These are often recommended by the boot manufacturer.

, Always read the instructions accompanying any waterproofing or cleaning product. Some are flammable, some require good ventilation and some require careful application. For your own safety, be aware of all the requirements for using the product before using it.


When you do use a product, always test it on a small, inconspicuous part of the boot. That way, it will not ruin the whole boot.

Clean salt stains immediately.,
Carefully dry your boots.,
Remove scuffs.,
Eliminate oil spots.,
Clean boot liners.,
Deodorize your boots.",How to Protect Winter Boots2," If you live where it snows and where salt is used on the streets to keep them clear of snow, your boots are going to pick up the salt. Salt stains mar the look of boots and weaken the fabric. If there are metallic parts to your boots (zippers, hooks, etc.), these will begin to rust if the salt is not removed.For the best results, always clean off any salt stain as soon as you spot it. Use the cleaning agent recommended by your boots' manufacturer (desalting agent).
Still wet salt lines can be quickly fixed by wiping over the leather boot with a damp, warm cloth. Leave to dry in the mudroom (not near a heater). To retain the shape of the boot if it's not able to do so on it's own, stuff with newspaper or other scrap paper.
Dried-on salt lines can be removed with commercial products or you can make your own easily (for leather boots). Combine equal parts of vinegar and water to make a liquid solution. Dip a cleaning rag into the solution, then wipe around the salt line. To finish, use a clean damp cloth to wipe off the solution and any remaining salt line. Wipe with a dry towel, then leave to dry away from direct heat. When dry, buff. (This method is not suitable for suede boots.)
For suede boots, clean marks off with an eraser or sand gently with an emery board.To restore flattened nap, use a clean toothbrush or towel to brush it up or steam gently over the spout of a just boiled kettle.

, Never dry boots in front of an open fire or open heat source. This will cause them to crack and dry out too much. Dry in a warm, dry place away from direct heat sources. Try to dry them upside down over a boot holder or similar item or stuff with newspaper to retain the shape.

, Scuff marks can be removed from leather boots using baking soda. Simply dip a damp cloth in baking soda and wipe over the scuff marks. Wipe clean, let dry and buff., Oil stains can be removed from suede boots by rubbing as soon as possible with either cornmeal or talcum powder. Gently brush off with a towel after leaving for a few hours to soak up the grime., Boot liners that can be removed should be washed separately by hand or in the washing machine (see manufacturer's instructions). Make sure they're completely dry before re-inserting into the boots.

, To do this, remove the insoles or liners from the boots.You should wash them and completely dry them before putting them back into the boot. You can then add a generous amount of baking soda (as much as desired) to the boot to eat away at the stinky bacteria. Let the boot completely dry. You can then easily vacuum or wipe out the baking soda.


You can also simply air out stinky boots by removing the liners and loosening up as much as you can on the boot. If the boot has laces, remove the laces and pull the tongue of the boot up as much as possible to create airflow. If the boot has a zipper, completely unzip and open the boot as much as you can to let air in.

"

Keep the boots polished and clean.,
Store winter boots clean and dry.,
Seek professional help.,
Repeat yearly.",How to Protect Winter Boots3," If your boots are leather, keep them well polished. All types of boots should be kept clean. A regular wipe-down with warm water for many synthetic boots will help remove dirt and other encrusted elements.

, At winter's end, never store boots without cleaning them first and ensuring that they are completely dry. Otherwise, you risk finding moldy, cracked, and possibly ruined boots next winter. Stains left too long may set permanently and weaken the boot. And mold that grows on one boot can cross-contaminate other shoes, boots and items of clothing stored in the same vicinity.


Do not store boots in plastic bags. Suede and leather need to ""breathe"" and plastic bags restrict this ability, drying out the boot and trapping mold. Better choices include pillowcases, fabric shoe bags and cloth bags.
Store boots away from direct light or heat sources. Direct light can fade the boots, while direct heat can cause them to dry out and crack.

, If the stains are really bad, seek professional help from a shoe repairer, dry cleaner or similar. You could also call the manufacturer for advice.

, A well maintained boot is a long-lasting boot. Repeat the preventative and storing process on your boots every year or wearable season. This will keep your boots in good condition so that they will last longer!

Apply a natural oil, such as olive or coconut oil, to restore the leather’s sheen.,
Allow them to air dry for several hours.",How to Clean Your Shoelaces3," Removing debris now can save effort and help spare the fabric. These laces are not as absorbent as synthetics, and do not need to be handled as if they have absorbed the dirt they have been exposed to.








, Soak them briefly, apply the soap gently and thoroughly to the whole shaft of the lace. Do not soak the leather in the soap solution, as this can ruin the tan or discolor the leather. Wipe it off with a damp rag.








, Allow them to air dry, and avoid exposing them to the sun, as they can bleach and lose color. They should be completely dry before advancing to the next step.

, Apply with a clean rag. Make sure you are working above a drop cloth and with gloves, as leather-treating oil can stain surfaces. Allow the oil to soak in. This treatment will soften and improve the appearance of leather laces. 







, After the first hour, wipe off any excess oil. Wait until the laces are completely dry before attempting to relace, as this can stain the shoe or damage the lace. Mink oil resembles human sebum, and will feel greasy on most fabrics if not allowed to absorb properly.

Buff your shoes with a microfiber cloth.,
Take special care with suede shoes.",How to Clean Sperrys1," Using a soft toothbrush or a bristle brush made for leather, gently brush away any dirt, dust, or debris. Brush the leather with soft strokes in the same direction. If you scrub the shoes in multiple directions, you're likely to leave scars.

Use a rubber-bristled brush rather than a nylon-bristled brush. Rubber brushes will be easier on your shoes.;
, Make a cleaning solution with water and mild dish soap.Dampen a microfiber cloth with the solution, and use it to clean your Sperrys. Apply firm pressure while you rub in a circular motion to remove residual dirt and scuffs.

Don't get the leather too damp, as excessive wetness can make the leather fibers less supple.Avoid using saddle soap on your Sperrys, which can break down and damage most leathers., After you have washed your Sperrys with water, wipe them dry with another microfiber cloth. Use the same circular motion as you did to remove the scuffs. Continue wiping until your Sperrys are dry, at which point you can proceed to the next step., Before you can polish your Sperrys, you need to apply leather conditioner. Using a soft cloth, apply a thin layer of conditioner to your shoe's leather. Let the conditioner absorb into the shoe for 10-20 minutes, then remove it with a dry section of the cloth., Use a soft cloth to apply the polish in a clockwise motion around the shoe. When you have polished the entire leather surface, use a separate cloth to remove the polish in a counterclockwise motion.

Test the polish on a small part of the shoe first to make sure it won't cause discoloration.
Cream polishes will retain your shoe's color best, but wax polishes are ideal for shine., Using a soft microfiber cloth once again, buff your shoes in a circular motion by applying direct pressure to the shoes. For an extra shine, apply a few drops of water onto the cloth before you buff your Sperrys., You cannot clean suede shoes the same way that you clean leather. Suede is treated differently and has a napped finish because it is made of the underside of animal skin.Follow the cleaning instructions for suede shoes to avoid causing damage."

Air dry your Sperrys.",How to Clean Sperrys2," Fill a bucket with warm water and add a mild laundry detergent. Liquid detergent works best, but powdered detergent can be used if on hand. Swirl the solution around until the detergent is completely dissolved. If bubbles appear and the surface is worked into a lather, your solution is ready to be used., Hold the shoe above the bucket or water basin and scrub the outside with a soft toothbrush or sponge. This will remove most dirt, debris, and stains. If caked-on dirt does not yield to the brush, dip the shoes gently into the water and continue scrubbing.

Avoid submerging the shoes entirely, as soaking wet shoes are more likely to mildew., After you have finished removing stains, dip a soft cloth into warm water and wring it dry. Then, wipe your Sperrys down until no traces of soap remain on the shoe., If your Sperrys still have stains after hand-washing, set your washing machine to a gentle cycle with cool water. Add half the normal amount of laundry detergent and allow your washing machine to run a full cycle., Let your shoes dry in the sun after one cycle in the washing machine. Remove the insoles and allow them to dry separately. This will prevent your insoles from molding and help them dry faster. Stuff your canvas shoes with newspaper to preserve their shape as they dry.

Dab a sponge across the exterior to remove water stains.,
Sprinkle cornstarch over the shoes for oil stains.",How to Clean Sperrys3," Suede's soft grain is best cleaned with a suede brush. Brush the shoe gently to remove dust or dirt accumulated on the surface. Brush repeatedly in the same direction in short strokes to avoid scuffing your shoes.

For scuffs that are especially matted down, try rubbing the area with sandpaper to lift the nap., For scuffs you cannot brush or sandpaper out, rub a suede bar or a piece of crepe rubber over the scuffs. Apply a moderate amount of pressure to the scuffs, increasing as you reach tougher areas. You can also use a pencil eraser in place of a suede bar., For water stains, dab a slightly damp sponge over the shoe's exterior. Remove any excess moisture with a dry microfiber cloth. Then, ball up newspaper and fill your shoes so they retain their shape while drying.For tough water stains, dampen your sponge with vinegar and rub over the stain.

, If your shoe stains do not disappear from the method above, they may be oil stains. Sprinkle cornstarch lightly over the stain and let it sit for ten minutes. Cornstarch absorbs oil and prevents it from soaking into the suede, especially if the stain is treated early."

Take a good look at the garment.,
Take a look at the substance that is used to close the garment.,
Look at the garment's footings.,
Look at the sole of the garment's feet pieces.,
Look and consider the fabric type the sleeper is made of.,
See if you can spot an applique on the sleeper.,
Look for a hood at the top of the garment.,
Look for a drop-seat drawer area in the back-end of the garment.",How to Tell the Differences Between the Different Styles and Options of Adult Blanket Sleepers," Although most blanket sleepers are made of a one-piece set, there are some sleepers that are two-piece. If it is a two piece set, you'll see that one half is a shirt-like piece,and the other is a pant-like piece.;
, These garments may use either zippers, Velcro, buttons or some other closure system.


If this garment uses zippers, take a good look at how far down the zipper reaches. While all children's blanket sleepers terminate near the child's ankle area, there are only a few blanket sleepers for adults that come relatively close to terminating there. Instead, in most adults' blanket sleepers, you're likely to find them terminating at about a chest-high height. There is only a slim chance that the sleeper will terminate at the ankle in adult blanket sleepers.







, While most popular blanket sleepers come with feet, there are a few out there that don't. It's a pick-and-choose world, and you'll be lucky if you picked up a sleeper with some attached feet on them.

, Some have non-skid fabric attached to them, and others don't. It may not be too common for companies to call this white non-skid surface by it's common name, but some companies still use them in their adult products. The white surface is called JiffyGrip. Almost all child's blanket sleepers will come with JiffyGrip on them, as most parents find it the most-suitable fabric to keep the child from slipping on the floor for safety.


Some blanket sleepers come with a vinyl backing instead of JiffyGrip, and some even decide to go without any gripping mechanism at all. It's preferable to most people, that all people should have some non-skid surface on their blanket sleepers. Look for this feature in a product.

, Some blanket sleepers are warmer than others. The warmer the sleeper is, the more comfortable the user will become and more apt the user may be to wear them again on the next consecutive night. If the wearer looks for heavier material, the heavier material may make it uncomfortable when the wearer is trying to consider this type of garment as ""normal"".

, While almost all child's sleepers come with appliques on them, only a few adult blanket sleepers sold offline will tend to come with appliques on them. At online stores you can ask for an applique as an optional feature, and therefore for a few extra spare dollars added to the selling price.

, While most infant and child blanket sleepers come with an attached hood, many adult blanket sleepers make you deprived of wearing one. Only those companies who do business online can sew a hood onto the garment for a few more dollars.

, Some adult blanket sleepers now come with a drop seat area that can better help the user establish a quicker retrieval at the toilet, without fully having to undo their sleeper so they can use the toilet and still be able to keep warm everywhere else on the body. No children's blanket sleepers sold offline come with these features. Most children are either potty-training or are still in diapers, and what good would it be to have something that would never be used on a child?

If you don't already have your blanket sleeper on when you arrive at the doorstop, plan on arriving for an additional fifteen minutes before instead.;
, You shouldn't need much slumber-party materials when you arrive except for your blanket sleeper. However, you should have your blanket sleeper nearby, so you can change into it the moment you arrive, as long as a private bathroom is available to be used.


You shouldn't even need to pack anything but your blanket sleeper. Since sleepers are comfortable enough for both winter-wear and summer-wear, you'll just need the blanket sleeper and a change of clothes for the next morning.

, Don't feel embarrassed by wearing one; Be courageous when wearing your blanket sleeper around other people in public again.

, Hearing the voices and seeing your friends can help you become less frightened and boost your morale when you become upset or feel ""awkward"".

, Change into your adult disposable diaper before you ever leave home.

, If you have more than enough people that have to fit into a small area, you may need to form two circles. Sleep in a pattern that is most similar to that of people around an external campfire at night.


Make sure there is plenty of space between each person and their adjacent ""friend"", and that there is little chance of rolling into any other furniture that may be positioned nearby.

, What worse way a party can start off, than with someone who forgot to bring something that's almost always a requirement!

, You might find out that they acted just like you. You might very well be surprised at their reactions! Ask them to elaborate and tell you how they got started, and follow up and tell them how you got started wearing them too.

, Although some people can get overly excited and not loose much concentration, it's entirely plausible to do.

, As long as the parental figures are allowed to travel along and have an area where other planned activities will be taking place, the folks may be able to create their own sleepover/slumber party themselves, and be ready for your exit at the party that next morning.

,, Get to sleep around the same time the party has been requested to be ""over"" and is officially ""sleep time"", and try to re-awaken without much arousing from other sources of sounds as possible.

Attach some Jiffy Grip to the foot pieces if you feel you want a non-skid surface.",How to Make an Adult Blanket Sleeper1," Lay several feet worth of untouched Christmas wrapping paper down on a large flat surface. Grab a pair of your night pants and a heavy long -sleeve sweatshirt on a flat surface so that both touch each other at the waistline. (Make this seem natural when placed down on the surface with the paper). Make sure the pieces are folded and laid in the same direction on the same side of the paper that should be folded over so that the white side is showing outward. You don't need to worry about the armholes too much, but you should sketch the approximate look of the armhole placements.


Trace around the way the clothing fits on the paper. You will need to make two sides to suit both the left and right side.
Any remainder of the paper can be used to make the arms and feet which will come later.
For the shoulders, bring the sweatshirt away from the edge a little bit and trace. (Three inches above the sketch in the region of the shoulder should provide ample enough growing room for the wearer later, or for when they move around at night).
Make some adjustments to the leg sections of the pattern to give yourself an estimate of placement in relation to the rest of the clothing and to know where you'll need to connect your pattern together. Allow for some seem allowance and write it in where the seam would be placed.
Make yourself a designation of where the sleeve location line area is when creating it.;
, Make sure to make an additional cut at the center fold line to make the two matching location show separately.

, Make sure that you've folded the piece of fabric in half so to make two sides and so that the fold line is the very side of your body area for later use.

, Face the two back pattern right side pieces together and sew them along the center back.

, Face the front right sides together and place your zipper on the edge of where the garment would normally have the zipper and mark where the zipper will end. Trace the zipper on the garment itself with a pencil or a lightly with a pen or thin marker. Place the zipper in the place you designated in the middle and pin it down in place and sew it onto the garment.

,, Use the same shirt you used when you originally made the pattern for the body cavern of the sleeper. Connect the top and bottom lines of the sleeve, but leave this a bit curved to provide for a less tight fit in the armpit area.

, Fold them and sew the two sides together where the seems would meet perfectly.

,,, Wrap a piece of the elastic around one ankle and approximate it's length (Cut the elastic when only a centimeter or so is seen extending over the edge of the beginning edge of the elastic). Then do the same for the other ankle. Sew each one separately.

,, Draw a large line that measures half the length of the real measurements of your ankle measurements.


Get a measurement for the length of your feet's length from toe-tip to the back of the ankle. Drop it down an inch or inch and a half(drop it down 3 times the distance in the back area of the boot. Measure this length out and at a distance on the paper below the original area and draw out this location and draw out an estimated pattern of what a shoe should look like.
Cut this pattern out.
Place your fabric down and create your boot pieces. Make sure to do this four times and sew two of each side of the boot together, but don't close off the bottom of the boot as you sew the sides together. Do this for both feet.

,,,,, Jiffy Grip can be found more commonly online, but if you walk into your nearest sewing center and ask for Jiffy Grip, they might be able to find some for you or be able to order it online. Jiffy Grip is the same fabric used on almost all baby blanket sleepers available on the market, and why not give your feet that same feeling.

",How to Make an Adult Blanket Sleeper2,", Measure their height from their ankle/foot location up to an imaginary terminus at their neckline or shoulder.

, Just relating the size of the foot to their shoes size, isn't a reliable method, and could be very illegal if done to a friend who's an adult who doesn't live with you, or isn't under your care.

, You will just have to look a bit to find them, as they aren't widely publicized. The Kwik-Sew pattern number is pattern 2919. (McCalls does have a similar one, but isn't exactly the same style as those most people recognize as being a ""blanket sleeper"" - so be careful of McCall's pattern 3665.

, Make sure to buy a long enough and non-itchy styled fabric.


Polar-fleece fabric is good for Winter temperatures, along with Alaska-styled winters.
Nylon and rayon make for a sticky feel for any person, young and old, and in summer or winter. Try not to choose either type when buying these fabrics.
Cotton fabric is always beneficial, for it's non-itchy and non-allergenic properties. Cotton can also help alleviate the need to remove them during summertime due to cotton's ability to hold sweat into the fabric.

,,, Sew the seams and the shoulder seems of the sleeper, while the right sides are together. Sew the sleeve seems and pin these to the armhole at the shoulder.

, Use a long running stitch, such as on a serger or sewing machine.

Find and use a sleeper that doesn't use a zipper.,
Try not to change your children into garments that are associated with slightly-warmer temperatures than what is to be expected for that night (unless you plan on making it mandatory to swaddle them in heavier-weighted blankets-no matter what their age might be).,
Remove the blanket sleeper entirely, and instead, swaddle the infant in several layers of bigger-sized blankets.",How to Prevent an Infant or Toddler from Playing with Their Blanket Sleeper Zipper," Some children will tend to listen and take mental notes on the intonation of the parents speeches asking them to zipper back-up. They might very well begin to stop un-zippering shortly thereafter, without much action being taken.;
, Something that wraps over-top of the zipper is often-times enough to deter the kids away from unzipping their garment. Use this flap anytime your child uses these sleepers/pajamas. Day or night; it doesn't matter!

, Fingerless mittens tend to make it harder for small hands to work with such a tiny zipper closure. The bigger the mittens enclosure, the better possibility that it will work on the child.


If you can't seem to possibly find a pair of completely-fingerless mittens, let them wear a pair of their own socks (or one of your bigger socks would work too).







, Resew these feet back onto the garment. This action will cause you the parent, to be the only person that will be able to effectively zipper-up the sleeper on your child every night, since the zipper pull will then be in back of the child. It's not too easy for a child to unzip something that they cannot reach very easily, without parental assistance (and thereby without parental permission).

, Many online retailers sell sleepers with zippers in the back for this exact reason. It keeps the zipper out of sight and out of mind to the child, and makes it more difficult for them to unzip if they are determined to wriggle out., If there is one available in your child's size, they will be very worthwhile your money. You could find one with snaps or one with Velcro, but you'll have to look hard to find these.

, Again, they'll resist you doing this, but to keep them warm (and thereby still keep them healthy), it's pertinent that you still follow the standard protocol.

, Not only does an infant enjoy being tightly cocooned-up like a ""jelly roll"", they still get to enjoy the same warmth from your body when you hold them that close to their body and may even be able to forget what they were attempting to do in the first place. The child's parent (who should take this as bonding time with the child) will be able to relax too, knowing their child is safe and secure, held in front of them at all times.

If no local thrift shops take it, consider the Salvation Army, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and almost any other thrift store such as Goodwill (Goodwill Industries International, Inc).

, The American Red Cross will only be able to help you make the donation, if these blanket sleepers are being donated in bulk amounts for fair distribution.

, There are some donation-program pages listed online where the nearest drop-box is located. Some donation programs can take your donations by mail, but look a bit around to ensure that this is the thing you really want to do with the sleeper.

, Go through your town and jot down some of these charitable places. Look for a social-services type of business. These businesses will hand these clothes to a reputable place who can take and redistribute them to other people who desperately need them just as well!


Other organizations may want to use them too. You'll need to perform due diligence with some of them. Some very well known organizations are ""for profit"" with little or none of each donation providing benefit to the needy.

, Although some people near your house might need some clothes very desperately after a very devastating fire, they can feel a sense of relief that they will have some clothes to wear and will be very generous in taking the clothes comfortably away from you.

Continue with the normal process of life.",How to Change a Blanket Sleeper on an Infant or Child,";
,, While most sleepers use zippers as the closure system, some undoubtedly will use buttons or snaps.

, While most children's blanket sleepers have zippers that zip from neck to ankle, there are a few that only go from neck to waist and can make it harder on the parents to change. However, most snaps or buttons will go from neck to waist.

, If the child is tiny and/or small, you will need to pick them up and carry them over to the changing area. At first, you won't need the new blanket sleeper (or at least not until the old blanket sleeper has been placed to the side.

, Unzip or unbutton/unsnap the blanket sleeper from the top of the garment to as far down as allowable at the bottom; when the zipper stops you must stop and not before then or you could risk accidentally tearing the garment when taking the older garment off the child.


If the garment has a zipper-flap closure at the top of the garment, you'll need to unsnap this piece first. These closures are used to intentionally stop the child from un-zippering the garment without the parent's consent (which can intentionally ""mess-up"" the child's thought process enough, thereby making them lose their concentration and quite possibly be able to stop them from undressing themselves at all from it).

, If you have a chance, you can separate their legs outwards a little bit, pushing the blanket sleeper closer to the child's still-attached side and laying their leg down.


When the parent grabs the child's ankles, don't be too rough. Keep a firm grip on the child's ankles to stop the child from fidgeting (especially in the case of a wiggly child who resists getting his/her sleeper changed).
Don't bend the child's knees backwards too far when pulling out the legs from the leggings. If you do it too rough, you could easily break or fracture a bone in/near the child's knee.
If this zipper runs to waist-high height, you can't quite use this step. You'll need to pull the arms out of the sleeves first instead, with the legs following with this step. Pick up the child from behind and fold the blanket sleeper to a location underneath the child's back.

, Reach into one of the sleeves and grab the child's arms from just above their elbow, and pull out their arm from the sleeve. Repeat this process with the other arm once you have gotten arm number one out. If the zipper or buttons were neck to waist, you had to complete this step in the step before and so you can skip this step and move on.

, Reach far enough down into the legging that hasn't been pulled out yet so that you can grab the child's ankle and pull out this leg. The child's knee will bend (as it naturally should), but as long as you don't push the knee so it stretches too much at an uncommon angle (to where the knee can't bend, and can snap/break), you shouldn't have a problem.

,, Have them lay so that their head and neck is just a hair above the neckline of the sleeper (you'll be able to readjust and resituate the child into the sleeper when you move it onto them). If the child can't do this themselves, you may need to pick them up and carry them over to the new sleeper.

, Take care of securing the legs followed by the arms. If it's a neck to ankle closure, you can deal with the arms in between taking care of both of their legs,and finishing with the leg that didn't take much effort to pull out and placing it gently down into the sleeper.

, Zipper up the zipper to the very top portion of the garment, or close up the buttons that run the length of the garment's closure system.

, Snap the closure snap into place, if a zipper-stop flap is available (most will have this attached to the child's garment.

, Dependent on what you choose to do with the child when they are dressed, you don't need to worry so much after they are dressed into their new sleeper. Grab the child under their arms, and you'll be ready to continue the night. Rest assured: your child is ready to spend their cozy night, all snugly and peaceful again, with a fresh new sleeper on.

Modify your wardrobe on your blanket sleeper for summertime temperatures.,
Unzip your blanket sleeper anytime you are wearing it.,
Consider using an air conditioner in the room you will be wearing your blanket sleeper in.,
Consider wearing lightweight cotton, ankle-high socks as opposed to any other style/any other full-length sock.,
Don't wear your blanket sleeper's hood, if the garment contains one.,
Consider wearing a cotton t-shirt under your sleeper, to soak up some of the sweat from your body.,
Sleep on top of the sheets and blankets of your bed when you wear a blanket sleeper during the night when your body is ""stable"" from cooling and warming trends.

",How to Be Comfortable While Wearing an Adult Blanket Sleeper in Summertime (As an Adult Wearer)," With the exception being your normal underwear, consider wearing only your sleeper during these months and nothing else.;
, The cooler air can help keep your body slightly closer to normal air-temperature nearby. As long as the air has a large amount of surface area to cover, this can help immensely.

, Let the cooling system focus on that room first, before the cooling must occur in any other part of the house. Use other cooling methods for kids rooms, unless the cooling is a whole-house air conditioner.


Make sure the thermostat on the air conditioner is down to a temperature that is as low as the thermostat can possibly go, to ensure the cold air will be chilly enough to keep you at normal room-temperatures.
Consider closing off any doors that you may not be using at the current time. Even if you are in the room with the air conditioner, make sure all other doors that enclose the room can be closed most of the way or all the way.

, These smaller sized socks can help wick away moisture from your feet. If you wear a sock that's any higher, the sock would hold in more heat, and thereby help your feet sweat which can travel to your brain and cause the signals of ""feet getting too hot"" to become major signs. And if the blanket sleeper has Jiffy Grip-styled skidproof-bottoms, the socks can hold back the remainder of the moisture that will for sure accumulate at the bottom of the feet when you walk or do some activity that requires exertion on the feet., Most of your body's heat gets lost through the head (or so scientists make us believe), so why would you want to add more layer of latent heat to your ensemble in the process, when you in turn want to reverse that and loose some heat?

, Again, cotton can help wick away moisture, and even if you're not used to wearing no shirts to bed, cotton can help become an intermediate mediator over not wearing an undershirt at all while still keeping your body cool.

Wash your hands well prior to makeup use.One of the keys to preventing infections correlated with makeup use is to wash your hands well before applying makeup.,
Sanitize your makeup brushes.You will most likely be using brushes to apply your foundation etc.,
Thoroughly clean other makeup equipment.In addition to keeping your makeup brushes clean, you can sanitize powder palettes.,
Clean the surrounding area.Since you will most likely be placing your makeup brushes and tools on the counter in between use, it is important that this area be clean as well in order to minimize your risk of infection.,
Store your cosmetics at the right temperature.It is important to store your cosmetics in a place where they will not get too hot — specifically, where they can remain at a temperature below 85°F (29°C).,
Change your cosmetics every few months.Few people are aware of the risk of microbial (bacterial or viral) contamination of their cosmetics, which only gets worse with time.,
Consider using disposable brushes.Another option to avoid the the cross-contamination of the bacteria from your skin and eyelashes getting into your makeup containers is to use disposable brushes while applying makeup.,
Do not share your cosmetics.One of the key ways to prevent infections caused by makeup is to not share your cosmetics with others (and to not borrow a friend's cosmetics).,
Know when to see a doctor.It is important to see your doctor if you notice any potential signs of an infection that may be related to your makeup use.,
Seek prompt medical attention.If you suspect that you have either an eye infection or a skin infection caused by makeup use, see your doctor sooner rather than later.,
Consider eye drops for an eye infection.The exact treatment that your doctor recommends will depend upon your symptoms, as well as your specific diagnosis.,
Ask about treatment for a skin infection.If you have developed a skin reaction (which may be allergic or infectious), or an unusual lesion on your skin that you think may be related to makeup use, ask your doctor for help with diagnosis and treatment options.",How to Prevent Infections Caused by Makeup," When you apply makeup, your hands will very likely come in contact with your face. Ensuring they are clean can help you avoid unnecessarily contaminating your face with germs.


Wash your hands for 15–30 seconds with soap and warm water.
Alternatively, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands prior to applying makeup.;
, Ideally, you would wash your makeup brushes after each use, using soap and warm water or baby shampoo. In reality, however, this is somewhat difficult to do on a daily basis. You can try spritzing your makeup brush with a brush cleaner after each use or, at the very least, wash your brushes every two weeks.This will prevent the bacteria that is naturally present on your face from staying on the brush and multiplying.


Leave your brushes out to air day after washing them.
It is important that they dry completely, as a moist environment can further the growth of any germs that are present.
Always wash your brushes before using them on someone else.

, Palettes such as those for eye shadow and blush can be touched repeatedly with makeup brushes because you can sanitize the tops of them with 99% alcohol rubs after each use. Therefore, if you are wanting to mix colors prior to application, you can do so on the tops of the powder palettes and subsequently clean these with alcohol rubs after each use.


You can also clean any metal makeup devices such as eyelash curlers with alcohol rubs, or by simply washing them with soap and warm water.
Keeping your makeup equipment clean is a key step in preventing infections caused by makeup.

, Use a cleaning product or an alcohol wipe at least once a week to keep the counters that you use for makeup application clean.

, This is because cosmetics exposed to the heat for too long (such as those inadvertently left in a hot car) may have a reduced effectiveness of the preservative ingredients. In other words, reusing cosmetics that have been exposed to the heat for prolonged periods of time carries a higher risk of infection.

, Consider your mascara — your eyelashes naturally have bacteria on them, so even after your first use of mascara, bacteria are being introduced into the mascara container when you put the brush in after use. Needless to say, the longer you have a particular cosmetic for, the more of a chance there is for bacteria to grow in there, heightening your risk of an eye infection.


For this reason, it is recommended to change your cosmetics at least every three to four months.
If you have not used a cosmetic product in several months, your best bet is to throw it away and to buy a new one to decrease your likelihood of infection.

, They key with disposable brushes, however, is to not ""double dip"" (in other words, to use each disposable brush only once without re-inserting it into your makeup container).


Using disposable brushes is not the most convenient or environmentally friendly option; however, it is the surest way to avoid contamination of your cosmetics.

, Sharing cosmetics introduces the other person's bacteria into your cosmetic containers as well as your own bacteria, thereby multiplying the risk of infection.


It is especially important not to share cosmetics if you or the other person has (or has recently had) a pink eye infection.
Pink eye (medically known as ""conjunctivitis"") is extremely contagious, and can be passed from one person to another via makeup tools.

, Signs to be aware of include swelling of your eyelids, discharge from your eyes, or redness and inflammation of the whites of your eye(s).


Also see your doctor if you develop an unusual rash or skin problems following makeup use.
You may have a skin infection, or you may have an allergy to the cosmetic product.

, Also, avoid using any further cosmetics until you have had the area of concern looked at and diagnosed, as continuing to use cosmetics may worsen the situation.


You may also want to buy new cosmetics after your infection has cleared, in order to ensure that the cosmetics you are using do not have microbial contamination.

, For some eye infections, medicated eye drops can be of help in treating the condition and resolving it sooner rather than later. Ask your doctor if this is the best option for you.

, A topical antimicrobial cream may help, or your doctor may offer you oral antibiotics. It will vary on a case-by-case basis.

Don't worry about what your friends might say when they find out that you wear a blanket sleeper in your private life.,
Don't worry about what others may say if they do find out that you wear one.,
Be able to stand up for your rights to wear one.,
Romanticize with yourself every night, while thinking of trying to remember how cool it was to wear one when you were a infant or toddler!,
Try a blanket sleeper on for size at an offline retail store's dressing rooms.,
Think about the times when you were able to put a smile on your face.,
Avoid trying out blanket sleepers in summertime months.,
Sample the blanket sleeper for a number of consecutive nights.,
Realize that you are not the only one that is going through this predicament right now.",How to Be Courageous when Forced to Wear an Adult Blanket Sleeper (as an Adult Wearer)," Unless you choose to tell your friends, your friends will never find out that you wear one when away from the public's eye. Most people change into a blanket sleeper or nightwear at night, and so after others could potentially find out their dark secret.


If you are able to overcome the fear and become courageous enough to wear blanket sleepers, don't brag about your experiences later to your friends both online and off, as these events may come back to haunt you later, causing you to no longer be courageous and you'll be back to square one (where you once started)!;
, Comfort in wearing them is your key to wearing one with courage. Whether it is for luxury or warmth (or for both reasons), let them say what they want about your choice in nightwear. Realize that when they come to their senses and find out that they themselves have fought the courage to ward off evil and/or have even forced themselves to wear a blanket sleeper too, they'll eventually see why you wear one and may very well stop pestering you with these child-like taunts the next time.


If they get physical or begin to bully you into wearing one with the blanket sleeper, you may need to stop them from bullying you. You shouldn't have to deal with the fighting, or ever feel courageous enough to wear one ever again if put under these conditions.

, Be civilized when you argue the comfort and courageousness inside of the blanket sleeper with them., Though many adults want to be courageous enough to wear one but feel timid to wear one are often pressured to wear one, when they realize the values they are getting themselves into when wearing one when are forced, are more likely to withstand consistent wearing later on. Ask yourself if you would like to return to those comforting days and feeling youthful again! Not having a care in the world during the night shouldn't stop you from being courageous when wearing these pair of nightwear. Feel free to choose whatever style you should want...now who wouldn't want that? So, don't stop yourself from wearing them.

, Though few offline retailers sell blanket sleepers for adults (especially of the zip-up kind), there are a few during the winter that sell ones that will fit most who come to have to wear them. You might see the comfort in wearing one when you actually try them on. Try and determine their plushiness and coziness level when you move around in them.


Make sure the blanket sleeper fits properly; there is nothing worse than being squished up like an infant or toddler would be while wearing the blanket sleeper. Be sure that the feet are comfortable too; are not too loose or not too tight. Even if the sleeper feels tight, sometimes you may just need to try on a different size to really determine their coziness on you. Just the feeling alone should be enough persuasion to wear one when forced to. Bigger sizes are more comfortable and better for you.

, At times when you are feeling down and you are feeling like someone is forcing you to wear something you don't want to wear, think happy thoughts and put a smile on your face as you get to recognize that you'll get through this crisis soon enough. Once you can look back and beginlaughing at these times, you'll be just about ready to wear one. Happy times can turn into smiling times in a flash. Go for the good ol' days of yesteryear and wear one.

, However, if you are still being forced to wear one in the fall and winter months and have to continue during the spring and summer months too, you'll have to adjust the room to more-suitable temperatures to effectively feel just as courageous and cozy when wearing them with that same ""zest"". You won't see it as grand as wearing one when it is cooler or more adequately-seasonal to the suitable temperatures, and you'll potentially give up rather quickly., If you don't feel the results of being courageous by the end of at least the fifth night, you'll be likely to realize the blanket sleeper's benefits, and so you probably won't give the sleeper up. This is just the same feeling as allowing your children to break one in when they first wear a new garment they haven't liked but you had forced them into without their opinion being heard one., You might be thinking that you are the only one who is being forced into wearing one, or being put into an uncomfortable situation, but when you find out that there are others out there that can help you embrace this change, you'll soon think differently. Let your inner child out, so it can embrace the blanket sleeper again.

Apply some primer and foundation.,
Start by applying the highlighter.,
Blend and soften the highlight.,

Know how to work with a nose that is wider at the bottom, or bulbous.,
Use shadow to make a crooked nose appear straighter.,
Use a soft blending brush to blend your work.,
Dust on some setting powder over your nose and face using a large, fluffy powder brush or a kabuki brush.",How to Make Your Nose Look Smaller1," You can use makeup that is slightly darker/lighter than your natural skin tone to make your nose appear slimmer. Keep in mind, however, that it won't physically make your nose smaller. Also, if you have a very long nose, contouring will not make your nose look shorter in side view.;
, You can use powder or cream-based makeup, but many people find powder easier to blend and work with. You can use special contouring and highlight makeup, or you can use matte eye shadow. Avoid anything with shimmer in it, or your skin will look shiny instead.For the shadow, choose a color that two to three shades darker than your natural skin tone.For the highlighter, choose a color that is two to three shades lighter than your natural skin tone.Consider your skin undertone. Some people will have a warmer/yellow-tinted undertone while others will have a cooler/pink-tinted undertone. When choosing your highlighting and contouring shadows, try to find something that also matches the undertone of your skin. Wearing the wrong one can look unnatural.

, You will need some brushes to apply the makeup. If you are using a powder-based makeup, choose a soft-bristled brush. If you are using a cream-based makeup, choose a brush with stiffer bristles. Here are the specifics of what you will need:


An angled brush to apply the shadow and highlighter. This will also give you the most control.
A soft, blending brush to blend the two colors together. You can also use a blending sponge, if you find that easier to use.

, The primer will help minimize any pores, and the foundation will give the contouring makeup something to grip onto. It will also make it easier to blend and even out skin tone.









Use your fingers to apply the primer and a makeup sponge or a foundation brush to apply the foundation.
Make sure that the foundation matches your face exactly. It is not a good idea to match foundation on your hand or wrist; these are usually a different shade than your face.

, Use an angled brush to draw a thin line down the center of your nose. Try not to make the line too thick, or your nose will look wider than it actually is. Start at the top of your nose, and continue down to the tip. Do not curve under the tip, however.








, Set aside the angled brush, and pick up the blending brush (or sponge. Gently run the brush down the center of your nose, to either side of the highlight. You are just softening any harsh edges; you are not widening the highlight or blending it out.








Highlighting helps to lift the face up, drawing focus to these points. It also adds dimension to your face.

, Use a clean, angled brush to draw the shadow from the inner corners of your eyes down towards the tip. Use a blending brush to blend the shadow upward towards the highlight.









If you want to slim down wide nostrils, then apply the shadow to the sides of your nose as well.

, Start by drawing the shadow down either side of your nose. Then, extend the shadow under the tip of your nose, just above the nostrils. Be sure to blend the ""bottom"" shadow up towards the tip of your nose. This will ""lift"" your nose up and make it look shorter







, Begin by drawing the shadow from the inner corners of your eyes down towards the tip of your nose. Curve both lines under the tip to form a small ""U"" or downward arrow shape. Try not to make it too pointy, or your nose will look unnatural. Instead, try to match the width of the ""U"" to the width of your nose' bridge.







, Crooked noses can sometimes appear large, even if they are small to begin with. Draw the shadows down either side of your nose. Start at the inner corners of your eyes, and end just at the tip. Instead of following the contour of your nose, try to make the lines at straight as possible in the mirror.







, Run it down the sides of your nose, right between the highlight and shadow. This will soften any harsh lines. Next, feather the shadow towards your face. Do this by brushing across the side of your nose, starting just next to the highlight, and going towards the side of your face.









If you added shadow to the tip of your nose, be sure to soften it by swirling your brush around it.
If you added shadow to the sides of your nostrils, be sure to sweep your blending brush across them too.

, This will set the contouring makeup and prevent it from shifting. It will also help soak up any excess oil. Try to use a translucent powder, or one that matches your skin tone. Avoid using anything shimmer, or your nose will look oily. If you notice any excess powder on your nose, use a clean brush to lightly dust it off.

Shop for your blanket sleeper.,
Pick a blanket sleeper that has everything you want.,
Get the right length and waistline-width.,
Step into the blanket sleeper the moment get home.,
Don't worry about the seasons.,
Pay attention to your feelings.,
Don't let your parents talk you out of wearing them again.,
Encourage yourself often.,
Feel proud when you wear it.,
Don't try to remove the blanket sleeper unless you need to remove it, or if your need to wear one will cause distress to the wearer or can cause other dangers to arise from their use.,
Secure yourself with it on.,
Explain to your other family members or relatives (who might still be pondering your decision to wear one) that it is a privilege to wear a pair of blanket sleepers at your adult age, and that you are able to take all responsibilities that come with this privilege when you wear a pair.,
Plan to sleep in on the mornings that you have chosen to wear it, and on these mornings when time restraints don't place a burden on your schedule.,
Purchase at least two copies of the same sleeper, after you've acquired the complete need to wear it consistently around the house.",How to Enjoy Feeling Like a Kid Again (When Wearing an Adult Blanket Sleeper as an Adult Wearer)," Consider going in person to a store; purchasing one at an offline store will remind you what it was like to go shopping and buy something new as a kid. However, the selection of adult sleepers is smaller at actual stores than it is online, so you might need to shop around a bit, both online and offline, to find one that works for you.;
, There are many different customizations including the blanket sleeper's closure system, color, and whether or not they have an applique and/or slip-proof bottoms on them. If you really want to feel like a kid again, touches like non-slip feet can make all the difference.

Choose a blanket sleeper with the closure system you had as a kid. Although many kids' sleeper blankets have ankle-to-neck zipper closings, these are sometimes very hard for adults to find in their size and are a bit tough to use. If you find the closure system annoying to use, consider going with another instead, like one with buttons (even though these aren't commonly used in kids' blanket sleepers).
Look for child-like colors, if desired. Look for either baby blue (or aqua), baby pink (or light purple), or even baby-yellow (almost sun-bleached yellow).
Decide if you want a blanket sleeper with an applique sewn onto the garment. You might not like the feel of these appliques, and generally you can only buy them online.
Look for slip proof (or JiffyGrip) soles to the garment's feet. Most child blanket sleepers come with slip-proof soles made out of a white gripping fabric called JiffyGrip. Not all adult blanket sleepers offer this, but you can find some that do. If you have slipper floors at home, they can help avoid slips, too.
Consider blanket sleepers with snapping zipper-tabs. All child-like blanket sleepers have them, but for adults you may find these are only available online and by special request with extra fees attached.
Although there are two piece blanket sleepers, you won't feel too much like a kid when you are wearing them. If you want to relive your youth, shoot for the one-piece models.
Determine if you'd like to have a hood and/or mittens attached to the garment. These might be hard to find offline for adults, but if you look a bit online you can commonly find blanket sleeper companies willing to customize what they offer for you.

, You'll obviously need a sleeper that fits the wearer well, and isn't too tight.

You want to look into the plushier fabrics as well as the length and width. Most often sold as fleece sleepers, the plushier the fabric and the silkier and warmer it is, the more comfortable you'll feel.

, If you really want to relax, tune out the outside world, and feel carefree again, there's no time like the present. At home, nobody else will see you.

, With the ability to adjust the thermostat in your house or apartment, blanket sleepers can be made to be kid-like in any weather. Adjust the thermostat so that it is cooler in your house during the summer or slightly warmer in the winter (to compensate for the warmth of the sleeper). Consider wearing them to bed during the spring, summer and fall months too.



Pay attention to the temperature in your house to avoid becoming overheated, and ascertain yourself over your water-intake, to ensure you aren't loosing too much bodily fluids routinely. Fix all other temperature-controlled devices in the house to plan for these clothes associated to match cooler weather pattern differences that exist during the winter and to avoid becoming overheated (and what could later be dehydrated) in the summer as a result of this garment's constant use!



, Paying attention to your feelings is a big part of being kid-like when you begin wearing it. While sleeping in a blanket sleeper isn't for everyone after you've slept in it for several weeks, at first you might feel like taking it off after wearing it for only a few minutes, but trust this article: you will not regret it. Take things one step at a time. Wear it for one hour one night and add in time on each consecutive day/night. If you need to regress for any reason, begin the very next night. Try to shoot for times when you are in your house and you wear it and only take it off when you need to leave your house (such as for errands or work).

Reacquire your lost feelings you probably are hiding right now (while you are reading this article), which you once had when you were a kid and had been wearing them. The same warm, fuzzy feeling that you once held onto without recognizing it will envelop over and through you, once you begin wearing the blanket sleeper again; just give it the first hour in the trial reminder run.







, Whether you are an adult now or are trying to shy back into wearing comfortable clothes at night, blanket sleepers can easily be talked back into your parents' minds. Express your feelings with your parents, only after you've worn your blanket sleeper for a few nights. Hear your parents out, but try not to shirk away from what they say. It is you who chose to wear them again, and you have the right to free speech., It's easy to feel ashamed at your ability to wear them at first, and it's tough to change your viewpoint. It won't be easy to encourage yourself at first to wear something this awkward garment. But once you return and have tried it out for a few extensive times, it'll become second nature to encourage yourself to want to try more and more and for longer periods of time to wear one.

Although encouragement could help you somewhat build a tolerance to wearing one, using them isn't for everyone; trial-run the sleeper for a few weeks and see if all the details here work to help you build up the tolerance to wearing one and encourage yourself that you're okay (your body figure hasn't changed by your ability to wear one, has it?)!

, Make yourself feel like telling all your folks ""What are you waiting for?"" and telling them to try one on for themselves, because you know right that they still want to feel kid-like but are missing this feeling because their parents talked themselves out when they were kids. Carry out whatever you normally do during the day and try not to remove it once you get home and into bed or during the night. Wear it to bed, move around the house with it on, launder your other clothes with it on - do whatever you normally do - just make others realize that it was only your choice to wear it, and that if other people don't like to see you wearing it, let them clearly know that they can try to enjoy life with one of them on their body for their kid-like feeling too.

, Unless you can pin back the sleeves or hold back a droopy sleeper sleeve when cooking, you might want to watch out for awkward situations that can cause great concern for the health of yourself and the garment.Know that you'll never have to take off the blanket sleeper unless you choose to, or unless another activity (such as work or other business-like activity) forces you to remove this garment.


No one person will ever feel the same way as everyone else. Being kid-like is only an acquired taste that every person will have differing opinions on. While it's awfully natural to remove it after you have tried it, give it some time before telling yourself ""I just can't take it anymore..."" and removing it.

, The security you once felt when you were a kid with it on can't be expressed in any audible words most English-speakers can mention, but it can be felt only when you begin to wear it consistently. Recognize that same security you'll get when you wear a blanket sleeper now. If you can see life through a younger person's viewpoint, realize that this feeling can be embraced and be beneficial to making you see this feeling from the light of a kids viewpoint too.

, Blanket sleeper wearing times do come with some drawbacks. They do need to be washed every few days to weeks (dependent on the amount of use they are used for), and they must be observed to ensure the item doesn't degrade it's quality too quickly. Your family members and friends and relatives might remind you of this, but don't let this stop you either. That same feeling will return again, the moment you can put it back on after being washed and dried.


Most parents will want to know why you have chosen this route again. Make it seem like you are telling them If a young child can wear one, so can I. Make yourself seem bold when you express this - bolder than any other statement you might make during the course of your day. Make your action in words seem firm - though relaxed - in your mind, body and soul.
Smile as you go about your daily chores or tasks if some well-known friends and family members ask you why you are began to wear them like a kid again. These people don't understand the amount of fun they are missing out on when they aren't wearing them at night again. Your smiling may make them try the idea out for themselves.

, Holidays and weekends for most people are crucial points when you could be most-likely to wear your blanket sleepers , since most likely you'll be most likely to not have to return to work the next day.

, People know that medical accidents/illnesses can strike in any season and with any type of weather. Save yourself the anger of having to get undressed for long periods of time (and thereby not making you feel proud like a kid), and buy them in multiples of two or more.

If you can't stand to think of yourself wearing your sleeper after a lengthened period of time, buy one and hope that the company is still around (many still be) after a few-months and buy a second sleeper; just keep the inventory/packing slip around for product details for re-order and re-order at the same site or through the same company.

, This can draw attention towards the center of your face, which in turn can draw attention towards the center of your face. Instead, consider doing a more natural looking eye makeup using neutral colors.








Shadows under the eyes can also draw attention towards the center of the face. Consider using some concealer to hide under-eye shadows.Choose a color that matches your skin tone, and apply it using your ring finger. When blending the concealer, try to blend downwards, towards your cheeks.

, Big, curly hair will draw more attention than a big nose. Another thing to consider is which way you part your hair. If you part your hair straight down the center, you are directing the eye straight down towards your nose.If you part your hair off to the side, you are drawing the eye away from the nose. Here are some other types of hairstyles that might draw attention away from your nose:








Side parts
Layers that frame the face
Soft curls or waves
Loose, messy, or scruffy up-dos
Try adding more volume to the back of your head to make your nose look shorter., Certain hairstyles draw the focus inward, towards the center of your face. For example, large bangs that cover up your eyes will prevent people from making eye contact with you. Since they can't look at your eyes, they will look at the next closest feature: your nose. Here are some other hairstyles that tend to draw attention to the nose:Center parts that draw the eye downward towards the center of the nose
Straight-across cuts
Sleek and straight styles
Tight ponytails

, Try wearing some earrings or a necklace. The sparkle will draw attention away from your nose. You can also try wearing a hat. If you wear glasses, skip the small, thin frames, and go for the larger ones. They will naturally dwarf your nose and make it appear smaller."

Nose humps or dips
Bulbous, hooked, or upturned nose tips
Crookedness or asymmetry

, The operation usually takes one to two hours, and is completed by a plastic surgeon under general or local anesthesia. As with most cosmetic surgeries, your medical history will be reviewed to determine whether or not you are a good candidate, or of any precautions need to be taken.

, Like with all other surgeries, rhinoplasty comes with certain risks. You can experience any of the following problems during or after the surgery:Allergic reactions to medications, including the anesthesia
Troubles breathing
Bleeding
Bruising
Infection

, Patients usually can go home the same day, although sometimes they are required to stay at the hospital overnight. Full recovery can take several weeks.During this recovery process, you may also experience bruising, puffiness, and swelling around your nose and eyes. It can take up to 14 days for this to go away., It will look like a large pad or bandage. A doctor may prescribe you some medication to help with the swelling and pain. Some people find that a cold compress also helps.

, Plastic surgery is usually without scarring, but if you are narrowing large nostrils, you may end up with small scars at the base of your nose. Sometimes, blood vessels may burst in your nose. This will result in tiny, red specks on your nose. These are permanent."

Make sure you have the right things in your bag.,
Fill your make-up bag with the right items you need for touching up your face.,
Fix your nails.,
Keep a bottle of hairspray or gel, some bobbles, and a hairbrush with you.,
Find a quiet place, such as a restroom with a counter and mirrors to repair make-up.,
If you have bad breath, take a Tic-Tac or spray some breath freshener into your mouth.",How to Prepare for an Appearance Emergency," Deodorant, a bottle of mineral water, T-Zone blotting paper, a small packet of tissues, a nail file, your makeup bag, perfume, dry scented shampoo, a small mirror, breath mints, bobbles, and a hairbrush.;
, Blotting paper, foundation, concealer, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and lipstick are usually the basics. Put in it anything you know might crease up or rub off, such as foundation or eyeshadow.

, Nails are always a big culprit in ruining your appearance. If you wear acrylic or fake nails, take a packet of false nails in your size, similar or the same as the ones you're wearing, and a small tube of the nail glue. If one of your nails snaps off, find a quiet place with a table or counter and carefully re-apply the one that broke. If you wear nail polish, take a small bottle of travel nail polish remover, a couple of cotton pads, and the bottle of nail polish you're wearing. Again, find a quiet place and repair the damage. It's also a good idea to keep a nail file with you, as rips and tears can happen at anytime, and can feel uncomfortable and uneven.

, If your hair goes frizzy, slick it back with gel or spray it into submission and scoop it into a ponytail. Another option is to use dry shampoo, which you can usually buy from your local drug-store. Try to get one that smells nice. It soaks up grease in your hair and stops oily locks until you have time to wash it.

, If your foundation is coming off due to oily skin, blot the oily areas with blotting tissue and sparingly and carefully re-apply your foundation. If you have very oily skin, take some loose powder or a compact with you and dust some onto your t-zone. If your lipstick has come off due to eating and drinking, put your lips between a piece of tissue or paper and kiss it, to get the last of it off. Then, re-apply it.

, Mint gum is another option but people can see you chewing it and it's not as instantly effective as the other choices.

",How to Make Your Makeup Last," A quick splash of cold water in the morning will not do the job. Choose an appropriate cleanser that will purify your pores. If your skin is prone to greasiness, invest in a quality sebum control product to reduce oil. Always remember that makeup will not stay or even reach its full potential if it is placed on a dirty canvas.;
, A standard cleanser will not remove dead skin as a gentle exfoliator will.

, Research and purchase a natural lotion if possible, so as to avoid weakening and tiring your skin with excessive chemicals.

, Primer is the makeup artist's secret weapon. A high quality primer smooths the skin's surface, adds radiance and keeps foundation in place throughout the day. However, primer is very miniaturizing, so unless you have exceptionally dry or tolerant skin, forgo the second step if you are planning to apply it.

, Choose the best match for your skin not only in shade but in type as well. A perfect fit will ensure your foundation is effective. Test how your skin absorbs the product. Does your skin need a creamier foundation or will a thinner one suffice? Always wear foundation and concealer only where strictly necessary and never more than needed. This will prevent sliding and a tired, midday face.

, A liquid liner, if done well, can add a subtle--or not so subtle--drama to the eyes. For maximum staying power, choose a waterproof liquid liner. If you must keep your pencil, choose a waterproof, waxy type. It will last longer but will not have the same crisp intensity as a liquid liner.

, Always wait for a coat to dry before applying another and do not load your lashes with unnecessary product. If you choose to use a waterproof formula daily, choose one that contains a moisturizer as these mascaras are generally extremely drying. Be sure to remove every last scrap of mascara and to apply a lash lotion before bed.

, A coarse, inferior shadow will soon fade and deteriorate. Always apply foundation or primer beneath shadow to keep the colour intense. It is best, when possible, to refresh eyeshadow as the eyelids are among the oiliest parts of the body.

, You must work swiftly to blend the stain for once it is applied only washing will remove it.

, Choose a creamy, quality pencil and fill in the entire mouth. Apply your chosen lip colour, blot gently and them reapply. If you don't have the time needed, choose a lip stain. Like a cheek stain, you can rely on it to carry you through the entire day.

, Be sure that you are not allergic to any of the ingredients. This trick is best avoided by those will sensitive skin or pores that are easily clogged. Always remember--close your eyes!

Wash your face.,
Exfoliate a few times a week.,
Moisturize.,
Prime your face.,
Use an eye primer.",How to Make Makeup Last All Day1," Washing away dirt, sebum and old makeup will help your fresh makeup stay in place a lot longer. If you put fresh makeup on a dirty face, it'll tend to slip off or flake away.


Wash your face in the morning, before putting on makeup.
Don't use harsh soap on your face. It can cause irritation and dryness, which will make your makeup come off sooner.;
, Dead skin tends to accumulate on the face, especially with age, so it's important to exfoliate a few times a week to remove it. Putting makeup over dead skin will cause it to flake off during the day. Your makeup will look, feel and behave better on a smooth, exfoliated face.









You can use a facial brush to lightly brush the dead skin from your face. Rub it in circles, never pressing too hard.

A homemade sugar scrub also works well as a gentle exfoliant.
Don't forget your lips! They need to be exfoliated, too, in order for lipstick to stay in place.

, For oily skin, buy an oil free or gel moisturizer, and for dry skin buy a more nourishing one. Make sure to get a moisturizer with at least SPF 15 in it to protect you skin from the sun, or a separate SPF 45 if you live in a sunny place. If you are older, you can use a moisturizer with anti-wrinkle properties.









Don't use a rich, creamy moisturizer during the day. It could make your face too slick for your makeup., Using a good primer is the trick to having makeup that stays throughout the whole day. Some primers can get a little pricey, but you don't need to use very much for a good finish. Apply the primer throughout your face, especially over red areas or oily areas, and any blemishes that you want to cover.








, It makes your eyeshadow last longer and prevents creasing in the lid. Also, it makes colors seem more vibrant and less translucent. A liquid concealer can work for this also.









If you don't use a lot of eye makeup, an eye primer may not be necessary. However, it can really help if your eye makeup tends to smudge and end up below your eyes.
Eye primer can also help your eyeliner stay in place.

Get a good matte foundation.If you don't want to use a liquid foundation, you should get a mineral powder instead of foundation.,
Use a translucent setting powder.,
Choose long-wear lip color.,
Use powdered eye shadow.,
Use waterproof mascara.Waterproof or smudge proof mascara work well to keep your eyes looking fresh all day.",How to Make Makeup Last All Day2," This gives lighter coverage then liquid, but it will also trap fewer bacteria in your skin and will allow your face to breathe.









Alternatively, try a cream foundation or powder foundation or cream to powder foundation or tinted moisturizer. Mineral makeup may be good for some, but for others it can be a drag. Getting the color right can be difficult if you have yellow undertones.

, It's simply a clear or very lightly tinted face powder that sets and gives a matte appearance to your face without the added coverage of a colored powder. A drugstore brand will work just as well as one from a high-end brand.








, This type of lipstick is formulated to stay on your lips all day long, even when you eat and drink. Make sure to moisturize your lips properly before applying as long-wear is very drying.









For even longer-lasting color, use a lipliner around your color. This helps the shape stay firm all day long.

, Applying this type of shadow over primer will keep your color in place all day long. Cream shadows tend to slip off a lot more easily. Apply the powder to the primer using an eyeshadow brush, and let it set.







, Waterproof mascara won't budge if you happen to get wet or cry. Just make sure you don't sleep with it, as it will clump and make your lashes fall off.









Do not waste money on mascara primer. Mascara primer weighs down your eyelashes, making them look shorter.

Take your time applying your makeup.,
Avoid touching your face during the day.,
Go lighter during the summer.,
Wear your hair up more often.",How to Make Makeup Last All Day3," Slapping it on in the morning and rushing out the door won't give your makeup time to set. After each layer you apply, wait five minutes before applying the next one. This will go a long way toward helping your makeup stay in place all day long.








, Every time you touch your face, you're removing a little bit of makeup and increasing the chances it'll get smudged. Avoiding touching your face with your fingers as much as possible.








, When it's hot outside, wearing a ton of makeup is never a good idea. As you perspire, your makeup will naturally come off a lot more easily. The best thing to do is wear waterproof eye makeup and go easy on the foundation, rather than fighting to keep it in place all day long.








, Having your hair brush against your face all day long is a sure way to take off your makeup a little faster. When it's essential for your makeup to stay set all day, go for an updo style that day.

Find a clean toothbrush.,
Run cold water on the toothbrush.,
Rub the toothbrush on your lips.,

The toothbrush must be soft; hard bristles will cause your lips to hurt!;
, Using it most helps it to work better.

, Do this for one minute. The rubbing motion will get the blood flowing through your lips, pumping them up for a short time.


As an added bonus, the brushing also removes the dead skin cells from your lips and makes them smoother.
You can also add honey or Vaseline to the toothbrush to add more color and smoothness., This combination of brushing and exfoliating is all you need to make your lips bigger. However, you will need to repeat it for the same effect; perhaps drop the toothbrush in your makeup bag.

Expect a small tingling to a slight burning sensation at first.",How to Make Your Lips Big Naturally3," Three suitable essential oils for this purpose are: Cinnamon essential oil, peppermint essential oil and cayenne pepper essential oil.As with any use of essential oil direct on skin, always to a skin patch test first and be aware of the contraindications associated with that oil; ask the herbal specialist at the store you purchase the oils from for advice.


Cinnamon oil stimulates increased blood flow in the lip capillaries.
Peppermint oil also stimulates the blood flow and plumps out the lips. It has a refreshing and cooling flavor.
Cayenne pepper oil stimulates the blood flow but must be used with great caution as anything more than minute amounts can burn your lips.

, After selecting the oil, it is applied as follows:


For cinnamon and peppermint oils, add one to two drops to your regular lip balm, lip gloss or Vaseline. Add the drop to the amount of balm, gloss or Vaseline being added, not the whole container.
For cayenne pepper oil, add one drop to your usual lip balm or to Vaseline. Do not use too much.
Add the enhanced balm, gloss or Vaseline to your lips as usual.

",How to Make a Lipstick Holder," Take one piece of your cardstock and cut it so that it is the same size as one side of your paper box. Hold the cardstock against the edge to check the size. Then, cut the other pieces so that they are all the same size as this piece.





;
, Next, cut four slits along the longest edge of each piece of cardstock. Make sure that the cuts are evenly spaced and that you cut them in the same spots on each piece of cardstock.








The slits should cover about 2/3 of the width of each card.

, Take two cards and connect them by interlocking the two outer slits. This will create an “L” shape. Then, connect the outer slit of one of these cards with another card to create a “U” shape. Then, add a fourth card and connect its two outer slits with the two outer slits at the top of the “U.” You should now have a box shape.








Keep adding cards to the grid until you have connected all of them. You may need to wiggle the cards into place to get them all in place. Be careful not to tear any of the cards as you connect them.

, When your grid is complete, put it into your paper box. The top of the grid should line up with the top of the box. The grid may look a little uneven and sloppy when you first put it in the box, but that is easy to fix. Just use your fingers to adjust the edges of the grid.







, When you have finished adjusting the grid, your lipstick holder is complete! Now you can begin filling the box with your lipsticks. This box will hold 25 lipsticks.








, Making a lipstick holder out of paper is easy, but you will need to gather some special materials before you begin. You will need:one square piece of scrapbook paper (any color or design)
eight pieces of cardstock (any color or design)
a pair of scissors
some tape or a glue stick

, To begin making the paper box, fold the scrapbook paper in half diagonally so that two of the corners meet. Then, press the fold to create a crease line and unfold the paper.Repeat the same folding process, but bring the other two corners together. Then, unfold these two corners.
When you are finished, the creases should look like a big “X.” These lines will help to guide you through the rest of the process.

, Take a corner of the scrapbook paper and fold it in towards the center. Line up the tip of the corner with the “X” in the center. Then, take each of the other corners one at a time and fold them in towards the center of the scrapbook paper.Crease the edges well to keep them in place. When you are finished, the scrapbook paper should look like a smaller square.

, Next, fold over one of the long edges so that it lines up with the center of your square and forms a rectangle. Then, fold the opposite edge over to create a narrower rectangle. Press the edges on both sides to create creases and then unfold these edges to return to the square shape.Repeat the folds on the opposite edges. After you have made these folds, crease them and unfold them again. You should have a square shape again.

, Take one of the corners and unfold it so that one edge looks like a triangle. Then, check for the grid lines that you just created. These lines should run along the sides of the triangle. Take your scissors and cut along each of these score lines, just to where the next score line begins.


Repeat the same cutting and unfolding process on the opposite side, but do not cut anywhere else. You should only make cuts on two sides of your scrapbook paper.
To hold the central corners in place, you can use a small piece of tape or a glue stick. However, using glue or tape is optional.

, Take the two small pieces next to the areas you cut and fold these pieces in towards each other. As you do so, the flat sides will come up and the paper will start to look like a box. Then, take your larger pieces on each side and fold them up and over the stems. Line up the points with the others in the center of the box.You can add a little tape to secure these points in place, but it is not necessary. They will stay in place after you add the lipstick holder grid.

A standard black artist portfolio with your name on the front works best.;
, Your first picture should be your best work and the style of make up you are most passionate about. This should set the tone for your entire artist portfolio. The first photo also needs to set you apart from other make up artists making the client want to see more.


If you have worked with well-known people, show off the make up you have done on them to demonstrate your notability.
If your work has been published in a magazine or catalogue, place that most highly accredited title you have first.
If your work has been published in a commercial, movie, or TV show, take a still from that work that accurately shows your make up as well creates a beautiful shot that will catch the client's eye.
When using pictures of your work that you've taken yourself, be sure to keep in mind the entire layout of the shot instead of just the make up itself. For example, instead of simply taking a picture of your subject in the chair you did the make up in, take the subject outdoors or somewhere with a nice background to add to your photo. This minor detail will make a huge impact in the client's eyes.

,


Put your natural looking make up first then transition to smoky colors, then vibrant colors and more and more intense until the portfolio ends with very artistic make up styles.
You can also put your portfolio order of technicality beginning with easier styles of make up and moving into more technical beauty story styles of your work that really showcase the model's eye, lip, cheek and textures of make up you are capable of.
Also take into consideration putting your portfolio in color order; for example, you could have an entire section on brown make ups and how you can work them. Be sure to also demonstrate the colors you can combine to create a unique look.
Your sections could be based on make up areas such as lips, to eyes, to cheek, etc. In your lips section show that you can create a clean lip line then leading up to a more creative, avant garde style of lip coloring.
If you have pictures that have slight changes in the make up, place all of those together to demonstrate to the client your ability to make slight changes in order to create a new look.
Also, use black and white photos if you have them. This exposure verifies you are able to do make up that can even register in non-color mediums. Doing make up for black and white photos requires a different technique and discipline, demonstrating versatility to the client.
Show your ability to proficiently apply classic, female favorite make ups skillfully and with a modern twist. These are styles that are loved throughout the generations such as black eye liner.
Illustrate your ability to put your own unique twist on a client's models instead of what would typically be done. For example, if you have a model that is typically portrayed as young, sweet, innocent, and neutral, use a photo of the model in something more luxurious or even something dark that still suits them, but shows your creativity.

Have fabulous hair.,
Wear makeup that looks good on you.",How to Glow from Both Inside and Outside," If you don't really love who you are, then start loving yourself! If you already have a lot of self-confidence, take it up a higher notch (this doesn't mean becoming conceited or self-centered, the point is to value yourself more). To step up your confidence, remind yourself that you are pretty, beautiful, smart, talented, etc. When you wake up, tell yourself how pretty you are. Be thankful for being you. Write yourself little messages such as: ""Attitude is everything"" and ""I am beautiful and I love me"" and post them on your mirror to remind you how great you are.;
, No matter what, don't act mean, rude, nasty, or disrespectful. ALWAYS have a sweet, bubbly, and friendly attitude. People will want to be around you because they will feel comfortable around you. Welcome people instead of rejecting them, even if they aren't as friendly and welcoming to you.

, But make sure your smile is pretty and perfect (details on this later on).

, Do this by giving them compliments on their hair, outfit, etc. Be happy and smile when you are around them, and listen to what they have to say. People will definitely appreciate that and will most likely start to LOVE being around you and will admire and notice you.

, This doesn't mean just showering daily and moisturizing. Take it to the next level. Take bubble baths as often as you can instead of showering, so you can fully pamper and beautify your skin. Pampered skin shows itself off. Use a body scrub and body salts to exfoliate and make your skin soft, and use great smelling soaps/body washes. When you finish your bath, put on a very rich moisturizer such as baby oil or body cream for that shine-like finish. It will set into the skin and make it seriously glow.

, Use self-tanners and tanning lotions (Jergens has a great self-tanning lotion) to achieve that bronze, sunkissed glow.

, Your smile can be one of your best assets if taken care of properly. Even with braces, a gap tooth, or teeth out of place, you still have to have the whitest and brightest smile. It can happen! Go to the dentist at least once or twice a year for a cleaning. After they clean your teeth, keep it up so it can stay that way. Brush your teeth two times a day with a mechanical spinning toothbrush. They really deep-clean your teeth and get rid of that disturbing yellow plaque build-up we all know and hate. Also floss, clean your tongue, and use mouthwash.

, Don't wear plain hairstyles, because that WILL NOT make you glow. A nice haircut with layers is nice, and so is a full bang or side bang. If you don't want to cut your hair, then do something different with it - add curls, or wear it super straight. Wear waves and high ponytails. And make sure to have clean, shiny, healthy hair. You WILL NOT glow without clean, shiny hair.

, This is the part where you can do anything you want as long as you apply it right. The only thing is not to wear it too heavily or the real YOU won't be glowing through. Don't hide behind a mask of makeup.

Sleep at least 7 hours every night.,
Consume plenty of fluids.,
Avoid salty food and and alcohol.,
Sleep on your back and use an extra pillow.",How to Get Rid of Bags Under Eyes Without Plastic Surgery1," Lack of sleep is one of the main causes of eye bags. It’s also one of the most treatable! Set a new sleep schedule for yourself and make sure you stick to it. Avoid late nights whenever possible.


Aim for a minimum of seven hours of sleep each night to reduce or prevent the appearance of eye bags and puffiness.The recommended amount of sleep for healthy adults is seven to eight hours per night, so if you can log more than seven hours, do it.;
, Daily fluid intake varies from person to person, but getting at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluids every day is a good rule of thumb to follow. Water is the best fluid source, but other beverages, such as milk, tea, coffee and juice, all contribute as well. Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit to up your fluid intake even more, since both contain a significant amount of fluid.Since dehydration is a major factor in the appearance of eye bags, make sure to drink extra water before, during and after exercising to replace what you lost through sweat.
You also need to ingest additional fluids if you’ve been ill, if you live in a humid climate and if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.
If you rarely feel thirsty and your urine is colorless or pale yellow, you are drinking enough water every day.

, Both of these can lead to fluid retention, which is your body’s automatic defense mechanism against dehydration.

Our bodies, expecting a drought, begin retaining as much fluid as possible, and some of that fluid pools beneath the eyes, causing puffiness and bags.

Whenever you do indulge, make sure to down a tall glass of water after. This will help to flush out your system and prevent fluid retention.You can also get rid of fluid retention by taking a diuretic.
Diuretics are available over the counter, but you should still speak to your doctor before taking one, especially if you’ve never taken one before.

, Gravity will cause fluid to pool underneath your eyes, causing bags. By sleeping on your back and elevating your head with an additional pillow, you are preventing gravity from causing this.

Hair: Do you feel like your hair is dull or lifeless?,
Skin: Oh, the skin.,
Lips: Many girls seek a full, smooth pout but your lips don't HAVE to be full to be gorgeous and kissable.,
Make up: While make up is not necessary, it can often help you feel better on days where you feel like you don't look as gorgeous as usual.,
Impurities: Use concealer, toner, exfoliator, and cleanser when necessary.",How to Go from Plain to Stunning," Like it needs to be spruced up? No problem! Every hair colour is beautiful, but if you want a change or think a different colour would enhance your features - make your way to the hair salon. They are professionals and will know what colour will suit your pretty face. If you don't want such a drastic change, try just getting a few sun-kissed highlights to brighten up your look. For a shampoo that will make your hair look fabulous; Try Mane n' Tail. Shampoo is not as important as conditioner! Choose a natural conditioner that will make your hair glossy and super soft. Also you could purchase a deep conditioner, or use a home remedy, to lock in shine. Deep condition or use a hair mask once or twice a week, or as often as you have time for. Washing your hair with cold water is much better for your hair, as it makes it so much brighter and shinier.;
, Skin may or may not be the defining feature that holds you back from looking as gorgeous as you truly are! If you have long-lasting break outs or acne, go to the dermatologist. There is a good chance drugstore cleansers won't help if you have severe acne. Otherwise, you can purchase the clear and clear line of acne treatment. Cleanser will help clean your lovely skin, toner will brighten up your complexion, and moisturizer will guarantee a touchable face. You should exfoliate once or twice a week, depending on how oily your complexion is. Many girls like the bronzed look, but this isn't necessary for everyone. If you do wish to have a year-round tan, you should purchase a gradual self tanning moisturizer rather than lying out absorbing dangerous rays or going to the tanning booth! Drinking 8-12 glasses of water a day will assure your skin to keep hydrated and healthy.

, Any lips will be gorgeous if you keep them hydrated by frequently applying a good lip balm (such as Bert's Bees) and exfoliating with sugar and Vaseline or by rubbing your toothbrush across your lips in circular motions. You may want to purchase a lip plumper for fuller lips, but a more natural substitute could be a small amount of cayenne pepper mixed with your regular lip balm, although this does sting and causes your lips to be very red.

, Foundation is not necessary and does nothing but clog your pours. A nice substitute for uneven skin is exfoliation and tinted moisturizer. Use a concealer for pimples or dark under eye circles. For a rosy glow, use a peachy pink blush on the apples of your cheeks to brighten up your face. Applying a white eyeliner on your waterline and a black eyeliner underneath makes your eyes seem bigger and curling your eyelashes and applying a lengthening mascara helps eyelashes stand out!

, Try a good brand, such as St.Ives, Clean 'n' Clear, etc. Or, for a more natural, home treatment, try this. For your exfoliator, go for some sugar and water and mix the two into a paste. For the toner, get a lemon or a lime. You could also use the juice mixed with salt. For the cleanser, water and soap work wonders. Dove, Ivory, and Softsoap are good brands. Create a thick, luxurious lather, apply to your face, let it stay on for one to five minutes, and rinse off! Toothpaste works well on your impurities when used moderately. For scars, acne-related or not, you could use concealer or liquid foundation. After that, to ward the nasty skin problems away, avoid oily foods, quit stressing, avoid touching your face so much, and always be clean. It will be hard, but over time you'll get the gist! For warts or eczema, lotions will help, but you should go to the dermatologist!

Avoid using other greasy products.,
Keep your hair out of your face.,
Avoid touching your face.,
Do not try a tanning bed.,
Avoid the toothpaste.,
Get a full eight hours of sleep.,
Continue with a standard cleaning regimen.",How to Clear Your Skin Overnight," You might think that clearing a blemish overnight would require you to scrub the skin repeatedly the night before; however, washing too much can dry out and irritate skin.If you dry out skin too much in an attempt to clear it, you can potentially wake up the next morning with even more blemishes than you went to sleep with. Washing twice a day is a great overall way to get and keep clear skin.Even if the blemish does not disappear completely, washing the appropriate amount reduces redness around blemishes to help reduce the appearance of them. Over-washing, on the other hand, will cause the dry skin to appear redder and irritated.;
, In addition to washing the proper amount, you should also make sure you’re washing with the correct cleanser. Grainy soaps or those with harsh chemicals can dry out skin as well. Dry skin then goes into overdrive on oil production, which can actually lead to more breakouts rather than fewer. Instead use a mild, oil-free cleanser with a dermatologist recommended ingredient such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.In addition to simply “oil free,” the cleanser may also be labelled as “nonacnegenic” or “noncomedogenic.”Any of these labels are fine because they all mean that the product will not clog pores.

, Washcloths, mesh sponges, or other scrubbing devices aimed at exfoliating skin can also cause irritation and redness because they’re too abrasive for many types of acne-prone skin.Avoid scouring your skin with these implements and simply use thoroughly cleaned fingertips to scrub the skin gently in a circular motion.You should also pat the skin dry with a clean towel rather than rubbing the skin, which can also irritate blemish areas.In addition to their abrasiveness, many of these exfoliating scrubbers left damp and hanging from shower racks can actually become breeding grounds for bacteria. Using these scrubbers can often spread around the pore-clogging germs you’re trying to eliminate.

, Even though you need to avoid treating your entire face too intensely, you can spot-treat the specific area you want to clear. Find a benzoyl peroxide acne cream specifically aimed at spot treating areas and apply as directed in the product’s instructions.Apply directly after cleaning the skin and apply either with thoroughly cleaned fingers or a cotton swab.

, If the rest of your skin feels excessively dry after cleaning it, then apply a moisturizing lotion to the other areas while leaving the area with the benzoyl peroxide alone. You should look for a lotion that says “noncomedogenic” on the label to ensure that it won’t clog pores and lead to more blemishes.Acne-fighting lotions are also available in many stores.

, While you can occasionally reduce a blemish in quick time, one thing you cannot do is heal a wound on your face overnight. Popping or squeezing a pimple not only spreads around the bacteria inside, but it also creates an abrasion on your face, which takes much more time to heal than simply allowing the blemish to go away on its own., If you know today that you would really like to have clearer skin tomorrow, then avoid the cosmetics. You may feel naked by avoiding the concealer you typically put on a blemish, but keeping the skin both clean and clear as far in advance as possible gives the area more chance to heal and clear.


A general guideline to follow with regard to cosmetics is that creamy foundations and blushes usually clog pores whereas light and powdery mineral-based or water based products are less likely to do so.As with cleanser, you can look for cosmetics labeled “oil free,” “nonacnegenic,” or “noncomedogenic.”However, leaving out the cosmetics altogether is still the best option when looking for immediate results.
If you absolutely cannot avoid using cosmetics the day before, thoroughly clean the skin to remove every trace as early into the evening as possible. No matter how tired you are, make sure you clean your face before sleeping because wearing makeup overnight is a good way to ensure you'll wake up with more blemishes instead of fewer.As with facial scrubbing pads, makeup applicators are usually very germy. Ditch the applicator and use cotton balls or swabs to apply makeup whenever possible.If you do need to use an applicator, keep it washed regularly and replace it often.

, Other greasy products, especially hair products, that can end up on your face can make a problem area worse or lead to new blemishes overnight.Avoid using any greasy hair products as far in advance as possible and shield your face when applying sprays or gels to your hair.

, Even clean hair without product in it has natural oils that can clog pores. While it might be tempting to hide behind your hair for the day—and even more so if you go sans makeup to try to clear the skin quickly—your best bet to have the blemish clear up overnight is to keep your hair away from your face as well., It’s always tempting to poke at blemishes throughout the day, but oily, dirty fingers are the last thing that will clear a blemish in quick time, so do your best to keep your hands away from your face. This tip applies to your phone as well. Many people don’t consider it, but we touch our phones with dirty fingers all day and store them in dirty pockets and purses that are also breeding grounds for germs. By holding your phone to your face, you transfer those germs over.If you want to clear a blemish quickly and avoid any others popping up, then stick to your speaker feature or texting for the day.

, It’s a myth that UV rays dry out blemishes and can be overnight miracle cures, so skip laying out in the sun or making an emergency trip to a tanning bed.If anything, the added sweat from being in the sun or the clogging effect of tanning oils can exacerbate the very problem you want to clear.


If you already see a dermatologist for your skin and have been placed on medication—especially those including retinoids—then your skin will be even more sensitive to UV rays than normal, making this an even more ill-advised option., Many people have heard the myth that toothpaste is a great overnight miracle cure for a pimple, but the myth simply isn’t true. While toothpaste does contain ingredients such as baking soda and hydrogen peroxide that can help reduce a pimple, they’re not formulated in a way that will be more effective than standard cleansers and benzoyl peroxide specifically meant for the purpose.Additionally, the pH of toothpaste and the other ingredients are more likely to irritate skin, causing redness around the area you’re trying to treat and possibly making the blemish even more visible in the process., Sleep is a naturally restorative time for the body. Studies have shown that cell turnover is eight times faster while sleeping, so giving your skin a full eight hours of sleep is a great way to help clear it., Even if you wake up the next day and the blemish is still there, do not panic. You notice it exponentially more than anyone else does, and a blemish is never the end of the world. Continue with the cleaning regimen outlined here, and if your skin doesn’t clear completely within three months, then consider seeing a dermatologist for prescription-strength acne treatments."

,
Always stay true to your friend, your family, your religious beliefs and your personal beliefs even if you now have the powers and beauty to be the next it-girl or mean girl at your school.",How to Go from Ugly Girl to Glamour Girl," Otherwise you could be pretty, behave nicely and still look like an unattractive person because of your clothing and makeup choices, or have great style, a great look, and still be unattractive because you are immature, rude or obnoxious.;
, Many stars have bad bone structure, crooked features or an overlarge nose, and still manage to look like a reasonably attractive person because they are fit and glowing with health. If you are anorexic, bulimic, or exercising too much, you'll really look unhealthy and you won't have the look. If you're consuming 5,000 calories a day, never exercising, and/or letting yourself go, then you will be unhealthy and thereby unglamorous as well. Go on an ideal weight website, and calculate your ideal weight for you age and height. You should be within 12 pounds of this weight. If not, ask a doctor whether or not yours is a healthy weight.

, If you are more than 9 pounds above your healthy weight, you may want to do something about it. The trick is not doing too much dieting or exercising excessively. Limit yourself to a maximum of two hours of exercise a day, but you probably only need around 15-60 minutes. Further, eat at least 1,300 calories a day if you don't play a sport or 1,700 if you do. Eat what you think is appropriate. Weight watchers is a good diet plan, but only your doctor can prescribe something that is 100% likely to work for you.

, If you are more than 9 pounds under your ideal weight, try consuming more healthy fats, like bananas and fat which is found in meats (not fast food meats or sausages; ham and chicken work). Try exercises that maintain flexibility rather than those designed to burn fat. If you play a sport, make sure to have enough protein and carbs.

, Remove all make up at night, drink at least 6 glasses of water a day and try to get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. Moisturize nightly and apply sunscreen daily. If you have acne, try an acne medication and change your pillowcase every night so you don't re-expose yourself to bacteria.

, Don't let your hair get greasy. Wash at least 3 times a week. Get a haircut to cure split ends, and try something fun and flirty. If your hair is just shoulder length go for a cut short style. If it's longer, try rocking long hair! Don't flat iron or blow dry often. It's terrible for your hair and it creates frizz. If you hair is flat use a teasing comb. Too full, use a sleek and shine serum.

, If you need glasses, try getting cute and chic frames or go with contacts.

, If you're curvy, emphasize your curves and your waist. Cinch your waist. If you're not curvy, don't wear clothes that will bag up in those areas. You can rock almost anything if you are skinny and flat. If you're skinny with curves, you can rock anything at all. If you're plumper, and without curves wear clothes that cinch at the waist to give the illusion of curves. Don't be afraid to wear skirts. Wear tops that have ruffles along the bust. If you're plumper with curves, also look for clothes that cinch at the waist and try curvy cut jeans or skirts that cinch at the waist. If you a medium without curves, you can get away with wearing lots of clothes. Avoid very low cut tops and curvy cut jeans. Try straight leg or skinny jeans. Try ruffled tops, and belts at your hips.

, If you have to chose between buying something classic or something trendy, go with classic. Don't have wild, all over the place outfits. Try not to layer to much. It looks sloppy. Wear clothes that are appropriate, and if you're skirt is slightly inappropriate, compensate by wearing an appropriate top or vice versa.

, They also make you automatically curvier and skinnier.

, If your outfit is wild, try for no accessories or only one. Chanel was wise to say, ""Take off one piece before you leave the house."" If you're only wearing a shirt, bottoms, and shoes, than you can discount this. The point is, if your wearing 4 accessories, lose the one that you least like or that clashes most. Try to go with at most, 2 accessories, apart from your handbag. This includes head bands and large scrunchies.

, If you must have a ponytail, try a layered ponytail. First pull up the hair around your crown so that your hair is half up. Secure it with a hair band. Next, pull all you hair into one ponytail and secure it with a hairband. By first pulling half up, your ponytail is given a slightly different style, and more volume that will stay. Two braids, half up, and side parted are also some things to try. If your hair is short, try clips or a headband.

, You should stay true to yourself, but you need to be calm at least 50% of the time. Calm doesn't mean bored or boring. It just means not hyper. You should be able to get excited sometimes, but not all the time. Always try to be friendly and if you don't like someone, at least be polite. Smile a lot, and make people believe that being around you is a fun thing.

, If it gets too quiet, they can come in handy to talk about or show off. Make sure to also ask people about their talents or interests. Do something really out there like write a book or a movie or go sky-diving or go somewhere exotic, so you can keep people interested always.

,, Follow this guide, and trust me, you'll have no trouble getting the best of both worlds.

Have someone who actually wants a makeover.,
Before you start applying makeup, make sure their face is clean and oil-free.,
When their face is clean, start by defining their brows.,
Conceal.,
If they want to keep their natural skin color, leave it alone.,
For eyeliner, use a brown or subtle color.,
For mascara, be careful.,
Lip gloss for a finishing touch.,
With completing the basic steps, start off with the skin color the person already has.,
Start with eyeshadow this time.,
Use eyeliner.,
Mascara is last for the eyes.,
For the lips, the nude look is cute to contrast with the eyes.",How to Give Makeovers at Parties," Or, try to convince them. You don't want to end up giving an amazing makeover on someone, only to find out they don't really care! You can ask the person what they're interested in- like the natural, smoky, exotic, etc. look.;
, When the skin has oils and dirt on it, the makeup will easily come off and it'll also cause more breakouts, which the person will most likely not enjoy. Use makeup remover or have them wash their face before you apply makeup on them.

, Don't pluck or anything- it's not a professional makeover. Just use a light eyebrow pencil and shade it lighter in the corner, darker going inwards. Create just a subtle arch.

, If they have wrinkles, concealer is pretty much a must. Don't conceal the whole face, just wrinkles, bags, and dark circles- and blend it. Use foundation for the oily spots, like the T-zone. (Forehead, nose.)


This is the natural look. (Think Lauren Conrad. Bronzed- Adriana Lima.)

, But if they don't mind a tan or blush, just add a touch a bronzer and blend. For blush, ask them to do the ""fish"" face, pouting their lips, and use a soft brush to sweep a skin color-suited shade along the cheekbones.

, (In other words, liquid liner isn't exactly subtle, but it can do if you're skilled at it.) Don't layer it on, just kind of sketch it on. When you sketch, you gently move the pencil back and forth. It may take a few tries to get it perfect, but being beautiful has it's flaws- remember that.

, Have the person TRY to keep their eyes open and not blink. Many people make the mistake of accidentally shoving the brush in someone's eye. This is NOT mandatory.

, Use a berry lip tint, a nude or light pink color, or light lipstick for the final touch. Lip liner isn't required for any look, really.


This is for the smoky/seductive look. Think Megan Fox.

, Adding more doesn't matter because it's the eyes that are the main attraction for this makeover. Don't do too much- save it for the eyes.

, Use a dark shade- purple, blue, or black works best. Use a soft, small brush to contour. Sweep it below the browbone (just the lid) and extend into a cat-eye angle if you wish- but don't go to far, and make sure it goes upward, not downward. It'll make the person look sad if you do.

, Black is the best color for the smoky eye. Thickly apply it with the person's lids closed and think scene kid. (The raccoon/panda eyes. JUST ON TOP.) For the bottom lashes, run it smoothly a few times so it looks noticeable, but still subtle and sexy.

, Sweep two coats on and when it's dry, (optional) comb the lashes so they don't clump and make the eyes more open.

, Use a little bit of concealer or pale foundation to cover the lips to make them paler. If you want color, use a light color. If you use a dark color, the person will look like Elvira, in other words a goth. The focus is the eyes!!!


Let the person enjoy their makeover- don't keep tracking them down to fix mistakes. This was just for fun, and maybe if you did it to their liking, they'll do it on a daily basis!

Realize that bacterial infections may cause peeling skin.,
Understand that peeling skin may be a symptom of an autoimmune disease.,
Realize that certain people are more at risk of suffering from peeling skin than others.",How to Cure Peeling Skin2," Skin loses its moisture when the weather is cold. The water levels in the outer layer of your skin diminish because the blood vessels in your skin constrict, which can affect the water levels in your cells, leaving your skin peeling and dry.

, Skin acts as a natural sun blocker because it contains proteins, lipids and nucleotides that can protect the rest of your body from UV rays. However, the UV rays can harm your skin, even with the help of sunscreen.When you get burnt, your skin is more than likely to peel.

, This disease is usually seen in children below the age of five years. Aside from peeling skin, this disease can also cause:


Redness in the eyes.
Swelling of the hands and feet.
Long lasting fever.
“Strawberry tongue”, when the tongue because enlarged and red.
It presents with conjunctivitis (redness in the eyes), Swelling of hand and feet ( edema), fever which lasts for a week , peeling of skin, Fat red tongue called as “strawberry tongue”.
So far the cause is unknown but it is mostly seen in Asian kids or people who would have travelled to an Asian country.

, Bacteria like staphylococcus aureus invade the skin through a cut or abrasion. They enter the body and produce a toxin which causes the keratin in the skin to break, causing the skin to peel.

, Autoimmune diseases are caused by a mutation in the genes that are responsible for skin and its properties. These types of disease can cause the skin to peel.

, These people include:


People who don’t maintain their hygiene.
People who don’t have a habit of using moisturiser.
People who like sun bathing and getting tan.

Check the toothpaste's ingredients.,
Apply a small amount to clean skin.,
Wash it off.",How to Clean Your Face With Toothpaste1," If you are going to use toothpaste to try and clean your face, you should check the ingredients on the tube before you go any further. A number of the ingredients commonly found in toothpaste can significantly irritate your skin.


If your toothpaste contains sodium lauryl sulfate, triclosan, and/or sodium fluoride, then think again about using it.
These ingredients in particular are known as irritants to the skin.
Ingredients such as calcium carbonate and zinc can have a more positive effect on your skin, but these can be found in specialist treatments which don't include the irritants.Plain white toothpaste may contain fewer irritants than clear gels.;
, If you decide to proceed with using toothpaste, it's sensible to test it out first. Apply small amounts to your skin in a few different places. If your skin reddens, becomes excessively dry or discoloured you should not continue to use toothpaste directly on your skin.


If you don't have a bad reaction, apply a small amount to a spot and allow it dry.
You can use a q-tip do this. If you use your fingers, be sure to wash your hands first.
Keep an eye on your skin around the toothpaste. If it becomes irritated or sore, wash it off immediately.

, Given that the benefits of using toothpaste on spots are unclear at best, the amount of time you need to leave it on your skin is not fixed. Some people leave the toothpaste on overnight, but if you have sensitive skin this prolonged exposure could cause irritation. Be conservative in order to minimise the risks of damaging your skin.


When you wash it off, use warm water and a gentle circular motion.
Splash some cool water on your face and apply a moisturiser if you skin feels tight and dry."

Make a diluted toothpaste face wash.,
Gently apply it to your face.,
Wash it off and moisturise.",How to Clean Your Face With Toothpaste2," If you want to use toothpaste to clean more of your face than just a few isolated spots, it's possible to construct a face wash which features toothpaste. Given the potential for toothpaste to irritate your skin, this is generally not recommended. Be sure to test the toothpaste on your skin before considering this.


There is no fixed formula, but you can just mix a small squeeze of toothpaste in a cup of water.
You probably shouldn't use more than a teaspoon, but you will have to judge how much of it an irritant it is to your skin.

, Once you have mixed the solution you can gently apply it to a clean face. Lightly brush the liquid onto your skin, ensuring that it does not sting or cause any irritation. Use plenty of water and don't scrub at your skin with your hands.


If your skin feels sore or irritated wash it off immediately.
Don't mistake dryness, redness or tightness for an indication that the solution is effectively drying out your pimples., Gently wash it off as you would with any other face wash, and pat your face dry with a soft towel. Given the potential for toothpaste to dry and irritate your skin, it's a good idea to apply a moisturiser to your face after using toothpaste. Ensure your hands are clean before you do this. If our skin is red, sore, or irritated, considered alternative ways to clean your face.

Try an over-the-counter treatment.,
Speak to a doctor or dermatologist.,
Consider tea tree oil.",How to Clean Your Face With Toothpaste3," Toothpaste does contain ingredients that can help dry out spots, but you can buy products that are specifically designed to work on your spots without causing the kind of irritation that the other ingredients in toothpaste can cause. Rather than using toothpaste, try an over-the-counter acne cream or gel to tackle excess oil.


In particular, you should consider treatments that contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as the active ingredient.You can buy these products at your local pharmacy or drug store.
Having a good skin care routine is a better way to help prevent spots and have clear skin, than experimenting with home remedies.

, If you are having consistent problems with your skin and have been unable to find an over-the-counter treatment that works for you, you can make an appointment to see your doctor or dermatologist. These experts will be able to closely asses your skin and give you advice about what treatments are most suited to your skin-type.You may be given a prescription for a topical treatment and/or some medication to take orally.
Commonly prescribed topical treatments include retinoids, antibiotics and dapsone.
You may also be prescribed antibiotics to take orally., If you are still keen to try a home remedy to help you get clear skin, tea tee oil is one of the best things to use. Tea tree oil is often used in skin care products, but can be bought individually from a drug store or pharmacy. There is research which suggests that tea tree oil can be as effective as benzoyl peroxide when used as a topical treatment for acne.Gently dabbing tea tree oil with a q-tip onto a spot is likely to be more effective than toothpaste.
There will also be less potential for negative side effects and skin irritation.

Make sure you are drinking enough water.,
Rethink your diet.,
Address stress.,
Exercise.,
Try supplements.",How to Clear Bad Skin1," If you are dehydrated, your epidermis (the outer layer of your skin) dries out along with the rest of you. As a result, your skin will lose its smoothness and bounce. If you already drink enough water, though, extra won’t really help your skin.Make sure you drink at least eight 8-oz glasses (2 liters) each day.;
, More and more, dermatologists are emphasizing the connection between what you eat and how your skin looks — from acne and greasiness to fine lines and wrinkles. This isn’t the old-fashioned “chocolate causes acne” warning, though — in fact, dark chocolate contains many of the antioxidants that are at the center of a skin-friendly diet. The latest research focuses on avoiding processed foods and adding in more natural ones.Try a Mediterranean diet, which focuses on fresh fruits and vegetables, Omega-3 rich fish, olive oil, and whole grains. In addition to heart-healthy compounds and antioxidants galore, this diet has even been shown to protect against skin cancer.Sources of Omega-3 fatty acids include vegetable oils such as flaxseed, canola,and soybean oils. These are good oils to cook with.Some people argue that drinking apple cider vinegar can reduce acne by balancing your pH level. If you’re up for it, try a tablespoon each day.
Limit your intake of salt, which can cause puffiness.
Be aware of foods that are high in iodine, like shrimp, crab, and lobster. A buildup of iodine can lead to acne, so dermatologists recommend eating these foods only a few times a month.
Try giving up dairy. There is no consensus on whether dairy causes acne, but some people have had success with eliminating it from their diets.Some doctors trace this possible connection to the hormones found in dairy products, with skim milk seeming to be the worst culprit.Keep in mind that dairy can show up in unexpected places, including many processed foods, where it masquerades as dairy protein.
Avoid foods that are high on the glycemic index, a measure of how much something spikes your blood sugar. These include things like white bread, pasta, and sweets, as well as sugary drinks like soda and juice.
Beware of added sugar. You know it’s in candy bars, but would you expect it to be in pasta sauce? Read labels carefully — it’s everywhere. There are over 50 different names for added sugar that might appear on a label (and there may be more than one in a product), including high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, fruit juice, molasses, sucrose, and rice syrup.

Limit your consumption of alcohol. Alcohol dehydrates you, emphasizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and possibly setting off a rosacea outbreak.

, When your body experiences stress, it releases the hormone cortisol, which can lead to breakouts. Stress can also trigger an outbreak of hives, along with many autoimmune disorders. All told, it can affect acne, eczema, rosacea, and more, so do your absolute best to keep it at a minimum.In a study, acne and psychological stress levels were evaluated, suggesting that there was a significant correlation between stress and acne, especially males. The correlation may or may not be due to an increase in sebum secretion., Getting sweaty helps to increase blood flow, making the process of carrying materials to and from cells more efficient. By exercising, you’ll be helping your blood carry waste—including skin-damaging free radicals—away from your cells.As a bonus, it is also one of the best ways to reduce stress., While the efficacy of vitamins in general is hotly debated, some experts recommend taking supplements to improve your skin. While multivitamins can help fill in any nutritional gaps, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Omega-3s, and Biotin are among the supplements sometimes recommended for specific skin problems."

Determine whether or not you have combination skin.,
Choose a gentle, water-soluble cleanser.,
Wash your face.,
Apply your acne medication.,
Choose toner carefully.,
Exfoliate.,
Choose a moisturizer designed for combination skin.,
Exercise.,
Relieve stress.,
Eat foods that moisturize your skin.,
Protect your skin from the sun.,
Don’t smoke.,
Choose makeup carefully.",How to Cleanse Combination Skin," If your t-zone (your forehead, nose, and chin) is oily and tends to get blackheads and your cheeks are often dry and flaky, you have combination skin. Try the tissue test. Press a tissue against your whole face for a few seconds. If there is oil along the t-zone when you take it away but none from your cheeks, you probably have combination skin. Combination skin is often genetic, but puberty can also affect your skin type. If you have combination skin as a teenager, you may grow out of it and need to change your cleaning routine.;
, Gel-based and mild foaming cleansers work well for combination skin. Typically, bar soap isn’t a good idea, because it can clog pores and dry out skin. Many people swear by the Dove Beauty Bar as a facial cleanser, so this may be the exception to the bar soap rule.Other gentle cleansers include Cetaphil and Noxzema.
Some people find that the first few days of using a new product causes their skin to break out. You may have to stick with it for a few days or even a couple of weeks to determine whether the product you’re using is working for you.
Don’t use harsh cleansers. Anything with sulfate or alcohol in it will remove natural oils from your skin and cause breakouts.

, Wet it with with lukewarm water. Use your fingertips to apply cleanser. Washcloths and sponges can irritate your skin. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a towel.Change your face towel often, since it can pick up bacteria, transfer that bacteria back to your face, and cause breakouts.
Wash your face twice a day — once in the morning and once in the evening. Too much washing can cause irritation, so don't wash more often than that.
Don’t skip washing your face, even for a day. Oils will build up in your t-zones and cause breakouts.

, If you are acne-prone and have chosen an over-the-counter medication or your doctor has prescribed you one, put it on right after you wash your face. Use it very sparingly and only as directed. Over-the-counter medicines with active ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid kill the bacteria that causes acne. They may also dry out your skin, so try to apply them only in the places where you are most acne-prone (probably the oily places).
Medical treatments include the use of tretinoin and antibiotics. Antibiotics can make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so be careful when outside and wear a good sunblock.

, Some people use a toner after washing their face in order to minimize the appearance of large pores. If you like using toner, avoid anything with irritants such as alcohol, witch hazel, menthol, fragrance, or citrus oils., Gentle exfoliation will get rid of dead skin cells. Try a product with beta hydroxy acid (BHA) in it, particularly for the oily parts of your face. BHA will both exfoliate and kill bacteria that cause acne.Some companies, such as Clinique, offer multi-step skincare systems for different types of skin. This may come with cleanser, toner, and exfoliant made for your skin type.

, You could use two different moisturizers, but it’s very easy to accidentally cross the barrier between you t-zone and cheeks. Instead, choose one meant to work on both types of skin. Some experts suggest applying your combination moisturizer to the dry areas of your face twice a day and only once to the t-zone. Look for an acne product that says it is “non-comedogenic.” This means it will not cause acne and should be suitable for any skin type.
Consider using a moisturize that contains an SPF as well.

, Exercising causes your blood to pump vigorously around your body. Blood delivers nutrients to your skin.Increased blood flow also helps flush cellular debris away, which helps your skin look and feel healthy. Do exercises that get your blood pumping, including:


Running
Team sports
Dancing
Hiking

, Stress causes the sebaceous glands in your skin to produce excess oil. People with combination skin may find that they have more acne on the oily parts of their face when they’re stressed, and eczema flare-ups on the dry parts of their face. People under stress are known to break out more than those who are not stressed out.To relieve stress try:



Meditation or yoga

Exercise
Deep breathing
Listening to calming music
Laughter yoga

, If you have combination skin, you may find that it’s a challenge to apply moisturizer to your face and avoid your t-zone. Instead of adding a moisturizing product to your face, try to eat more:


Salmon
Walnuts
Flaxseeds
Celery
Cucumber
Eggs
Quinoa

, Whether your skin is oily, dry, or a combination of both, it’s important to keep the sun off of it. Wear sunscreen and hats whenever you’re going to be outside for a long time.Use sunscreen every day during every part of the year.
You may need two different sunscreens if you have combination skin. Choose an oil-free sunscreen for the oily part of your face. Choose one with active ingredients titanium dioxide or zinc oxide for the drier parts of your face.The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a sunscreen with broad coverage of UVA and UVB sunlight. Further, they recommend SPF 30 or higher and suggest that you find a sunscreen that is water resistant., Smoking deprives your skin of the nutrients it needs to look and feel healthy. It can exacerbate any problems that your skin already has. Smoking also makes it hard for your skin to heal when it gets wounded.Additionally, some types of acne are worse in people who smoke., If you’re going to wear makeup, you’ll need to choose it carefully in order to address both the oily and dry parts of your skin.Cream-to-powder foundation is a good option. This kind of foundation goes on in the form of a cream but dries as a matte texture.
If you want more coverage, opt for a light dusting of powder over your foundation. Many people with combination skin prefer a mineral-based makeup that is talc free.
Traditional blush tends to work well on combination skin.
People with combination skin should choose a powdered eye shadow.
Touch up the oily parts of your skin with blotting papers during the day to control shine and prevent breakouts.

Take steps to eliminate acne.,
Soothe eczema.,
Combat psoriasis.,
Wear sunscreen to prevent brown spots.",How to Clear Bad Skin2," While acne is often associated with adolescence, more and more adults are also suffering from it. While there are lots of great medications out there, this condition is often so irritating that it requires a multi-pronged attack, starting with some tweaks to your daily routine.


Always wash your face at night. Between makeup, sweat, city grime, and who knows what else, your skin is begging to be cleaned by the end of the day. This is especially important for acne sufferers. If you find that you’re too exhausted to do this on a regular basis, keep a pack of makeup-removing face wipes next to your bed.Change your pillowcases frequently. Products and oils from your hair will transfer to your pillowcase at night. The longer these build up, the likelier they are to cause acne.Put makeup on after you have heat-styled your hair. Hair dryers, curling irons, and straightening irons can melt your makeup, leading it to seep into your pores and make breakouts likelier.Choose makeups labeled as non-comedogenic, which should not clog your pores. Products like glycerin and hyaluronic acid will help hold moisture in your skin. You may also be able to find products containing salicylic acid in it, which helps treat acne.Keep oil-blotting sheets with you at all times. Many acne sufferers are also affected by greasy skin. Oil-blotting sheets are a super effective way of dealing with this and won’t take up a lot of room in your bag. They also won’t disturb any makeup you are already wearing or cause any cakiness the way applying more powder might.

, Eczema’s classic itching, dryness, and rashes come from a weakness in your skin’s barrier. It can’t be cured, but you can take steps to control it. Many of these are strategies to avoid irritating the skin further.


Avoid hot water, which dries out and irritates your skin. Rinse dishes in lukewarm water, and turn the heat down in the shower. You also might want to consider showering only every other day to cut down on dryness and irritation.Avoid potentially irritating fabrics and styles. Cotton is cool and lets skin breathe, making it a good bet, especially in the form of loose, flowing garments. Some companies even make clothing like this specifically designed for eczema sufferers. Wool and synthetic fabrics, by contrast, can be itchy and cause overheating.You’ll also want to make sure that you wash your clothes with unscented detergent before wearing them.Sleep with a humidifier. You might find that your condition worsens in the winter, when heaters pump hot, dry air into indoor spaces. Sleeping with a humidifier in your room can lessen the dryness, itching, and flaking you might face., Like eczema, psoriasis can be characterized by itchiness, dryness, and irritation. Unlike eczema, it is caused by a buildup of excess cells that form scales on your skin. To treat it, you need to come up with a way to prevent these cells from accumulating.Avoid triggers. Certain factors can cause or worsen psoriasis. These include stress, smoking, alcohol, medications like lithium and beta blockers. Some of these are easy to eliminate, but reducing or getting off any prescription medication requires a discussion with your doctor.
Shower daily. Since water can help with cell buildup and irritation, psoriasis is the opposite of eczema this way. You should still avoid hot water and harsh soaps, though. For an extra-soothing experience, take a bath with bath oil colloidal oatmeal, or Epsom salts.Topical treatments for psoriasis include corticosteroid, vitamin D analogues, calcineurin inhibitors, anthralin, and topical retinoids.Phototherapy from natural sunlight is also therapy for psoriasis. Brief daily encounters with sunlight may help psoriasis, but you can overdo it and extended exposure can cause it to worsen., Brown spots are the discolored splotches of skin that most commonly appear on your face, chest, and hands—the places that tend to get the most sun exposure.If you’re worried about breakouts, look for products with labels like “oil-free,” “non-comedogenic,” “won’t clog pores,” or “breakout-free.”
Sunscreen should be broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher.

Try over-the-counter acne solutions.,
Treat eczema with combination treatments.,
Try brightening creams to address uneven skin tone.,
Look for creams like Mederma to help fade scars.,
Try natural solutions.",How to Clear Bad Skin3," The most common anti-acne ingredients available over-the-counter are benzoyl peroxide (which controls bacteria) and salicylic acid (which controls skin cell buildup).


Be sure to introduce one product at a time, and start with the lowest strength out there. It may be all you need, but even if it’s not, these products can be very drying.
Even after your skin adjusts, you shouldn’t be piling on product after product. This is irritating, expensive, and ultimately counterproductive.
Use a gentle cleanser on your face instead of soap and be cautious when using an exfoliant. Excessive scrubbing and washing can make acne worse, so be gentle and pat dry — don't scrub.Don’t forego moisturizer. If you have oily, acne-prone skin, you may feel that moisturizer is your enemy, but this is a mistake. If you’re using a lot of drying anti-acne products without moisturizing, your skin will overcompensate by producing more oil, leading to more breakouts.Look for moisturizers specifically made for acne-prone skin.

, Control itching with topical anti-itch medications or antihistamines. Work on repairing your skin barrier with a good moisturizer and hydrocortisone cream.Choose the right moisturizer. Your first instinct might be to go for lotion, but its high water content won’t work for people with eczema. Instead, look products labeled as ""ointments"" and ""creams"" that contain products like petroleum jelly or mineral oil and few or no additives.Eucerin cream is often recommended by doctors to help restore your protective skin barrier.
While you’re there, visit the first aid aisle to find hydrocortisone cream and oral antihistamines.

, Several new products on the market promise to fade brown spots and other irregularities, including acne scars. Look for products that contain the following ingredients:Soy
Enzymes
Licorice
Arnica flower extract
Alpha hydroxyl, glycolic, salicylic, and kojic acid
Vitamin C

, Pharmacists recommend that you apply it a few times a day, taking the time to massage it in. Both the cream itself and the rubbing motion can reduce scarring., Some people do not like to use products with ingredients that they do not recognize, but natural remedies are not necessarily any more effective, and they might be just as harsh. Try a variety of approaches to see what works for you.Natural products can be helpful for acne, but make sure they contain ingredients that have been proven effective. These include tea tree oil, alpha hydroxyl acid, zinc, green tea extract, and aloe vera.Try a garlic compress. Steep garlic in warm water, then dip a washcloth in the solution and use it to wash breakout-prone parts of your face.
Take advantage of honey’s antibacterial properties by dabbing it on a pimple at night.
Crush up mint leaves—or use mint oil—to soothe redness and irritation.
Place tomato slices on your face to help to draw out impurities.Consider alternative treatments like creams containing aloe vera or Oregon grape and foods or supplements that include Omega-3s. While none of these has been proven effective, they are safe and might be somewhat helpful.
Vitamin E has long been a popular natural treatment for reducing the appearance of scars, but there is no real evidence to support this claim."
"
Don’t let yourself suffer from acne.,
Reduce irritation from eczema.,
Pursue similar treatments for psoriasis.,
Ask about serums, chemical peels, bleaching, or laser treatments to treat brown spots.,
Discuss light therapy with your doctor.,
Consider more aggressive ways of treating scars.",How to Clear Bad Skin4," If over-the-counter solutions just aren’t working and you can afford it, save yourself years of frustration by scheduling an appointment with a professional. Your dermatologist will likely prescribe some combination of the following:Birth control pills for women, which works to control acne by regulating hormones. Your dermatologist might prescribe this herself, or she might recommend that you seek a prescription from your gynecologist.
Antibiotics like doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline
Topical treatments like sulfur, azelaic acid, dapsone, and benzoyl peroxide
Accutane (Isotretinoin), a Vitamin-A derivative that is taken orally. Accutane is only prescribed in the most severe cases, as it requires very strict commitment and comes with many side effects and potential health risks.

, Your doctor will probably prescribe a topical corticosteroid (to control itching and irritation) first, but if that doesn’t work, there are several other options you can try. Be persistent — it can take time to find the right strategy. Less common treatments include the following:Reparative creams
Oral antibiotics
More aggressive corticosteroid treatments
Exposure to natural or artificial sunlight

, Although eczema and psoriasis are different conditions, dermatologists often treat them in similar ways. Psoriasis treatments aim to slow cell growth and remove scales, generally falling into three main categories.Topical treatments like corticosteroids, synthetic vitamin D, and retinoids.
Light therapy involving either daily exposure to small amounts of sunlight or targeted treatment of affected areas.
Drugs that reduce inflammation (like methotrexate) or control the immune system (like cyclosporine).

, While you’re at the doctor’s office, be sure to rule out any potentially serious health problems — what looks like an annoying dark spot to you might look like a potentially cancerous mole to your dermatologist.

, Another possible treatment for acne is light therapy. Exposure to blue light can kill the bacteria that causes red, swollen (inflammatory) acne, and exposure to pulsed light and heat may also help shrink oil glands.Your doctor may need to apply photosanitizers to your skin before treatment to make it more sensitive to light.
Possible side effects include redness, crusting and peeling, changes in skin tone, and pain.

, Remember that your dermatologist has expertise in many different areas. He will know what treatments are right for you and, if necessary, can refer you to a plastic surgeon.


Try a chemical peel for acne scars. These treatments work by getting rid of old skin cells, allowing new ones to take their places.Their strength varies, from light peels that you can get on your lunch break to deep peels that must be done under anesthesia and require several weeks of recovery. In all cases, make sure you consult with your doctor beforehand and follow their instructions to avoid serious side effects afterwards.
Explore laser treatments. For some, over-the-counter treatments won’t be enough. You will need to talk to a dermatologist about this. He will know whether you are a good candidate for laser treatment and, if so, what kind of laser to use. Even so, the scar will likely never disappear completely."

Aim to diffuse rather than cover.,
Think about the color wheel.,
Don’t just cover up your problems—treat them at the same time.,
Don’t exacerbate the situation while you’re trying to cover it up.,
Give yourself a day off.",How to Clear Bad Skin5," You may have tried to cover up pimples with layer after layer of foundation, concealer, and powder. Unfortunately, this strategy can actually make the blemish more visible.


Instead, think about light-diffusing makeup, which will make your whole face look more luminous and will distract attention from pimples or other imperfections.
For pimples that are begging for concealer, use a concealer brush to dab just a tiny bit right on top of the pimple, then set with powder., Remember what you learned in art class — colors opposite each other on the color wheel can balance each other out. Today, this same logic has been applied to skincare products. The newest products will make you look balanced, not like an extra on Star Trek.If you’re worried about a sallow complexion, look for purple-tinted primers.
If redness is a problem, try a green-tinted product.

, These days, many makeup products pack a wallop in the skincare department, too. Find the product that addresses your particular issue.Acne sufferers will find products that contain skin-clearing salicylic acid, tea tree oil, and other compounds.
Mineral makeup contains zinc oxide to treat acne and will sit on top of pores rather than clogging them.
You’ll also find products geared toward treating uneven skin tone, fine lines and wrinkles, and more.

, If you’re applying makeup with dirty hands and/or brushes, you risk making acne and other conditions worse.Wash your hands before applying makeup (and touching your face in general).

Wash your brushes every two weeks to avoid oil and bacteria buildup. There are a number of products on the market just for this purpose, but soap and water will also do.
Your makeup becomes bacteria-ridden, too, so replace it every six months (three months for mascara).

, If you’re wearing makeup every day, your skin doesn’t have a chance to breathe. Take a break so you don’t get caught in a cycle where you keep needing even more makeup!

There are a few great home remedies for sensitive skin.Use something with sweet honey. It works as a great moisturizer and smells wonderful.Mix oatmeal with enough warm water to make a paste or cream. This helps remove oils and extra shine from the skin, and it may help with acne by removing dead skin cells and acting as an oil blotter.Try rose water. Using a product with rose water can help reinvigorate skin to a natural pH balance, and aids in healing light cuts and scrapes due to its antibacterial properties.It may even help fight wrinkles.;
, Dry legs thirst for moisture, so try a product with Shea butter for a variety of benefits (e.g. moisturizing, reduced inflammation, smoother skin) and perks (e.g. antioxidants, increased collagen production).If your skin is itching, try adding rose oil for a cooling effect.Maybe even include some willow bark which could provide additional inflammation aid.For the best results, apply your moisturizer immediately after bathing or showering, before your skin is completely dry. Moisturizers work by trapping water in the cells on the skin's surface, so it works best if you use it on damp skin., If you have a problem with cellulite, try a cellulite reduction cream/gel, also known as an anti-cellulite cream. It could take a month or more to work, but if you are patient and consistent you could see improvement.Consider using a moisturizing self-tanning lotion. Bronzing your skin can help disguise the appearance of cellulite.

, Whether you have minor bumps here and there or something like keratosis pilaris — a skin condition causing tiny bumps and dry skin — your legs won’t be smooth until you rid yourself of all the ups and downs.Try one of the following methods to cut down on the bumps:


Use a cream with lactic acid. Acid may sound dangerous in a skin product, but it a small percentage actually helps exfoliate dead skin, allowing the moisturizer to do its job properly.Glycolic acid is another great option. Start a regimen of low-percentage glycolic acid cream at night, and after a few weeks there should be results. Be sure to read the label, because some creams have up to 30% glycolic acid, and that may be a bit much when starting out.Take care of other blemishes. You can treat boils, use a variety of methods to get rid of a wart, eliminate a skin tag, or rid yourself of psoriasis. Whatever you do, however, treat your specific condition to help work towards smooth legs.
Use a cream with urea. Treating dryness and minor skin irritations is the primary purpose of urea-based creams. Some of these creams not only have moisturizing properties, but they also soften the keratin — a top layer of protective skin., Before even putting a razor to your legs, be sure to remove the dead skin cells. An added benefit of exfoliation is it raises the hairs, making them easier to shave.Make sure nothing impedes the ensuing razor swipes.

, It sounds simpler than it really is. There are a few ways to maximize your shaving efforts towards perfect legs.Try to avoid shaving as soon as you jump in the shower. Let the heat and moisture from the hot water work on your pores, opening them up and making the hair softer.
Nighttime shaving is best for smooth legs. There are a variety of reparative functions when you sleep, and shaving at night before bed may help the hairs recede some.
Be sure to use shaving cream or other lather that is not soap to assist when shaving. Not only does it help the blade glide more smoothly over your legs, but it also serves as a handy guide of where you’ve already been.
Use a good, fresh razor. Avoid the nicks and cuts, or worse, tugging of hair, by using a multi-blade razor that is replaced fairly regularly.
Go with the grain, then against it. This makes the blade-strokes easier, the cuts simpler, and the likelihood of issues.

, Moisturizer forms a thin layer that helps do many things, including sealing in moisture. Using a leg cream just after a shower, when your legs are still damp, helps lock it in., After the shower, there is only so much time before the moisture dries on your legs and dissipates. Wait too long and your skin may become dry enough that it not only loses the available moisture to be trapped, but it also invites the potential for allergens and bacteria., Most dermatologists seem to recommend starting out with a pea-sized amount and working your way up to more as necessary. You don’t want to leave your legs feeling oily, so use as little as necessary.

, Put extra lotion on the knees to reduce roughness and darkness, and be sure to gently rub it in. Apply liberally in the driest areas.

, Using a soft cloth so as to not aggravate the skin, spread the baby oil all over the leg. Repeat on the other leg, using any excess from the first leg.

, Results will not be something that happens overnight. Try to create a consistent habit so you can see positive results.

Cleansing your skin accurately is one of the most surefire methods to receive a clear, radiant tone.,
Moisturizing is important for all skin types.,
Exfoliating will help you achieve an even skin tone, and clear out your pores by removing dead skin cells.,
Maintaining habits for clear skin is important for lasting results.,
Make a facial appointment about every three to four weeks to help your skin’s cycle of cell growth.,
Microdermabrasion is a common method for clearing up skin issues involving anything from acne to rosacea to blackheads.,
While Fraxel laser treatments won’t help diminish existing pimples, this is possibly the best method for removing acne scarring, blotchiness, and large pores as a result of breakouts.,
Never pop pimples or pick at your skin.,
Giving up on a product after you’ve only used it for a short amount of time could mean you’re missing out on some amazing skin clearing benefits.,
Even if you're suffering from extreme acne, intense chemicals aren't needed to clear your skin up.,
Stop going to bed with your makeup on.",How to Clear Your Skin," However, if you aren’t doing this correctly, you could be doing more harm than good. For instance, lukewarm water, rather than hot, is sufficient for entering the pore and rinsing away dirt and oil. Scrubbing too hard can exacerbate oil production and break down collagen, leaving you with an oily face and fine lines. Make sure to take your skin type into account when choosing a cleanser. If you are acne prone, choose a soap that is alcohol-free and has an acne fighting ingredient like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.For those suffering from rosacea, non-soap cleansers like Cetaphyl work best, especially if they have a neutral PH level close to that of your skin.
Nothing triggers eczema more than scented, harsh soaps. Natural, soothing products are best for those who suffer from eczema. You can even try a baby soap.
Washing your skin more than twice a day is unnecessary as it strips your face of natural oils and can be drying. This could lead to premature aging.
Not rinsing thoroughly after cleansing can lead to a buildup of residue, clogging pores and causing acne.
Use your towel to pat your face dry, rather than rubbing.;
, Proper hydration can soothe dry skin, help reduce the appearance of scars, and is essential to restoring moisture after cleansing. A good rule of thumb is to moisturize no longer than a minute after washing your face. This is to replenish your pores of the hydration they've lost after washing. Leaving your skin just a little damp after you wash it will help lock in moisture.


If you have scarring on your face, a treatment such as Scarguard or Mederma can be applied after moisturizing to help diminish the appearance of the scar over time. Treatments with collagen and a moisturizing agent work best to reduce scarring.An oil-free moisturizer is best for acne-prone skin so your pores don’t become increasingly clogged.
For those with eczema or rosacea, the idea is to put hydration, or water, back into the skin to soothe it. Soak your skin nightly and moisturize with an ointment right after to improve its protective barrier., The best methods for exfoliation include scrubs and face brushes. How often you do this, depends on your skin type. If you suffer from dry skin, even if you have acne, you won’t want to exfoliate more than once or twice a week. Those with oilier skin can exfoliate lightly every day if needed.Especially if you’re acne prone, exfoliation is needed to rid your pores of dead skin cells that build up, causing pimples and blackheads.
You should avoid exfoliation if you have rosacea, as it can be too rough.
If you’re considering exfoliating and you have eczema, make sure you do it gently with a washcloth, and not very often.If you are hoping to remove light scars with exfoliation, use glycolic or lactic acid in a lotion or cream.

, Aside from cleansing, there are everyday steps you can take towards clearer skin. Two of the most important habits to adapt are using constant sun protection and watching what you eat. Wearing a broad spectrum SPF is vital for protecting skin against UVA and UVB rays. These cause premature aging and sun spots.Eating processed foods can contribute to a dull complexion. Make sure your diet consists of whole foods, especially berries and nuts, for a radiant face.Regularly wash your makeup brush with soap and warm water to keep from spreading around dirt and oil.
Keep your hair out of your face so that hair products and oil don't come into contact with your skin.

, Facials remove impurities and dead skin cells, ensuring your pores are clear of build-up and your products fully sink in to deliver results. If you experience frequent break outs, a facial every other week is recommended. Make sure you only visit a licensed esthetician with a good reputation.If blackheads and large pores are ruining your facial complexion, be sure to ask for extractions. This is the method of removed hardened sebum, or skin oil, either with a special tool or with the index finer and thumb.Rosacea and eczema should be treated with a soothing facial, preferably with no steam or extractions involved. Chamomile and lavender work to calm inflammation and redness., It works to buff away the outer layer of skin exposing the smooth and supple skin underneath and eliminating clogged pores. Microdermabrasion uses a diamond tip wand to remove dead skin, and a vacuum sucks away old skin cells rather than spreading them around the face as this can cause more break outs. This technique is suitable for most skin types, as the esthetician can cater the treatment to your skin’s specific needs.This treatment is especially effective for treating light scars, brown spots, and large pores.
Microdermabrasion also stimulates cologne production, making the skin more elastic.
If you have rosacea, Microdermabrasion will overstimulate your skin, possibly causing more redness. Although this treatment is often prescribed, because it can tone down redness in the short term, your condition will eventually return more aggressively., The laser goes down into your epidermis to stimulate collagen production, renewing your skin. Lasers stimulate the skin’s own healing process and replaces damaged skin with newer, younger looking skin.Typically about 4-7 treatments are needed, depending on the issue being treated.
For those who don't suffer from scarring, the laser also targets sagging, wrinkles, and sun spots.
Non-ablative lasers are typically used for younger patients with minimal skin issues. They don’t go as deep into the skin, and therefore don’t target concerns like wrinkling or deep scarring. Downtime after this procedure is typically three to four days.Ablataive lasers target serious signs of aging, deep scars and brown spots. Downtime can be anywhere from two weeks to a month.

, If you don't know what you're doing, you can severely damage a pore when attempting to squeeze the pus out of pimples. Picking at skin can cause scarring and redness.If you ever do touch your skin, make sure your hands are clean or you can cause an infection.

, Typically new products need six to twelve weeks to truly show a difference in your skin. It’s typical for skin to react gradually to a treatment, and you might not notice any difference at first.On the other hand, if you feel that you’ve honestly given the product a sufficient amount of time to work and still aren’t seeing results, or it's getting worse, don’t continue to use it.

, Too many fragrances and chemicals in your product could be exacerbating the problem.Consider if things like your laundry detergent or hair shampoo is accidentally leaving the residue of harsh chemicals on your sensitive skin.

, This will further clog pores and make acne or other rashes worse. Not to mention, the more gunk that makes its way into your pore without leaving, the more stretched out it will be.

Moisturize your hands as needed.",How to Clean Your Skin," Your skin changes as you age, especially during puberty, and looking for products in the skincare aisle at the drugstore can be confusing. There are so many options! Which should you choose? To find the right cleanser for your skin, it is important to first determine your current skin type:Normal skin is not too oily and not too dry, with minimal blemishes and no severe sensitivity to products or weather.
Oily skin often appears shiny or greasy, even if you recently washed your face. Oily skin is also prone to blemishes and larger pores.
Dry skin is often flaky, with more visible lines and some reddish patches of skin.
Sensitive skin is often mistaken for dry skin because it typically appears dry and red; however, the difference is that sensitive skin is often a result of a particular ingredient in a skin care product.
Combination skin is when you have patches of skin that are oily in some areas and dry or normal in others. Combination skin is typically oily around the T-zone (the T-shaped area created by your forehead, nose, and chin) and normal to dry on the rest of the face.;
, Before you start cleansing the skin on your face, be sure to wash your hands with warm water and soap to kill all the germs and remove dirt and grime. You wouldn’t want to rub more germs all over your face, would you?

, It is very important to cleanse your face every morning and every night before bed, especially if you wear makeup or are prone to breakouts. Keep in mind:Don’t use water that is extremely hot or extremely cold since this can damage your skin and trap grease and dirt inside your pores.

Gently massage your face with slow, circular motions. Don't scrub! Scrubbing will cause skin irritation, redness, or breakouts.
Treat the skin around your eyes extra gently, as it is the most delicate, sensitive skin on your face. Plus you don’t want to end up with cleanser in your eyes!
Don’t over-wash your face! Even if you have oily skin, over-washing can cause dryness, and your skin will produce more oil to compensate, which means you could end up with oilier, more blemished skin.

, For some skin types and conditions, exfoliating can be helpful, such as those with sun damage. However, for other skin types, such as those with cystic acne, exfoliating can damage your skin. Check with a dermatologist to be sure if exfoliating is right for you.Choose a scrub that’s designed for your skin type and that is not too harsh. Some varieties include:


Mild scrubs containing beads, sugar, salt or other types of natural exfoliators.
Soft skincare brushes. These can be manual or oscillating brushes that you squeeze your cleanser or a mild scrub into before gently rubbing the brush on your face.
Treatment masks that include mild acids like alpha-hydroxy acid or beta-hydroxy acid to slough off dead skin. Be very careful with this option and be sure to read the directions!

, Using lukewarm water, gently rinse the cleanser from your face either with a clean washcloth or by cupping your hands under the sink and carefully splashing water onto your face.Be sure all of the cleanser is removed, as any remaining cleanser can clog your pores and cause irritation and blemishes., Also, it is important to pat, not rub, your face dry in order to treat the skin as gently as possible.

, Apply moisturizer to your face after you dry it off.Many people skip this step, but applying a moisturizer designed for your particular skin type is very important post-cleansing. Moisturizers seal in the existing water in your skin so it doesn’t evaporate, which dries out your skin. You may need more moisturizer, or a thicker moisturizer, during the winter months.

, In addition to removing dirt and oil that can cause body acne, showering or bathing once a day will help wash away the bacteria that causes body odor.While very hot water should be avoided because it strips the skin of important oils, use warmer water when cleaning your body than you would on your face in order to kill the bacteria.

, As with cleaning your face, it is important that your hands and the products you use to clean your body are hygienic. Bar soap and body wash are sanitary, but loofahs, scrubbers, and washcloths, especially ones that are shared, are not. Be sure every member in your house only uses their own products and wash or replace these regularly!, Using a clean washcloth or loofah, focus your gentle, circular motions on areas that are prone to breakouts, like the chest, neck, and back.


Don't exfoliate too much because this can make body acne worse and irritate your skin., The skin on your body is less delicate than your face, but it is still important to only use a clean towel to dry off. Stay in the humid, steamy bathroom and towel off until you are only a bit damp, and then apply moisturizer to your entire body before exiting.The steam helps with long-lasting hydration because the moisturizer sinks into your pores while they are still open.

, Cleaning the skin on your hands multiple times a day is extremely important for your health and for the health of others. Germs are everywhere, and some can make people very sick so it is important to wash your hands often, but especially:After using the bathroom or changing a diaper
After playing outside
Before and after visiting anyone who is sick
After blowing your nose or coughing, especially if you are sick
Before eating, serving, or helping to make any food
If your hands look dirty

, You can use an antibacterial soap if you prefer, but regular soap will work just as well. Just be sure to use soap every time you wash your hands! Rinsing with water might make your hands look clean, but they will still be covered in germs. This is important to do whether you are in a public restroom or at home, as germs and bacteria are everywhere., Don’t just cup the soap in your hand and pass it back and forth between your palms. To really clean the skin on your hands, it is important to lather the soap onto both sides of the hands, in-between the fingers, under and around the nails, and up onto your wrists. You should do this for at least 20 seconds., If you are at home or a friend’s house, be sure the hand towel is clean. If you are using a public restroom, use the paper towel to dry off your hands and then, still using the towel and not your bare hand, open the door and throw the towel away outside of the bathroom. A shocking number of people don’t wash their hands after using the bathroom, and those handles collect a lot of germs., The skin on your hands might not need to be moisturized after every hand washing, but they can get chapped just like any other type of skin post-cleansing. Try carrying around a small tube of hand-specific moisturizer, which tend to be less greasy and sink in faster than other moisturizers, so you can keep your hands clean and soft.

Minimize your washings.,
Look for natural ingredients.,
Avoid extensive use of hot tools.,
Stay away from harsh hair dye.,
Brush it out the right way.",How to Make Your Hair Thicker1," Keeping your hair clean is a must, but washing it too frequently to accomplish this task may actually be thinning your hair. Each wash rinses out scalp-borne nutrients, causing your hair to become brittle and break. Instead of daily washes, try to keep your shampooing routine to only two or three times weekly.


Invest in a dry shampoo for in between washes to keep hair looking clean.
Use conditioner every time you wash your hair to restore moisture.;
, Most shampoos and conditioners contain harsh detergents that dry out hair, causing breakage. In addition to minimizing the total amount of washing you do, find a sulfate-free shampoo. When possible, use products that contain all natural or organic ingredients.

, These tools can burn ends of hair, causing split-ends and breakage. When possible, avoid using a blow dryer, flat iron, or curling iron; minimize their use to once a week.


Let your hair air-dry when possible, and save styling tools for special occasions.
If you don't like the way your hair naturally dries, apply frizz-fighting products to wet hair so that hair dries smoothly.
If you absolutely must use styling tools on a regular basis, use a heat-protecting product like argan oil and apply it to your hair right before styling.

, We all love to color our hair, but some bleach and other chemicals can have a drying-out effect that, when coupled with styling tools, can cause serious damage to your hair. Avoid using these harsh chemicals on your hair, referring to more natural means of lightening or coloring your strands, or try using vegan hair dyes, such as Manic Panic.

, Brushing your hair regularly is great for the overall health of your mane, as it spreads the natural oils created by your scalp to the ends of the strands, fortifying your hair. However, brushing can be damaging if done incorrectly. Use a wide-tooth plastic comb to brush out your hair, instead of a bristled brush (round or flat).


Avoid brushing your hair while it’s wet, as this is when your hair is most fragile and prone to breakage.
Try to brush your hair once a day to spread out the oils and stimulate the scalp."

Use gentle shampoo and conditioner.,
Avoid sulfates and parabens.,
Use appropriate conditioners.,
Wash your hair less often.,
Wash your hair in cold water.,
Brush and comb your hair gently.,
Use a comb instead of a brush on wet hair or knots.,
Use the right kind of brush.",How to Make Your Hair Grow Longer1," Long hair starts with good hair care, and good hair care starts with using the right shampoo and conditioner. It's important to use products that increase the strength of your hair rather than causing damage. Ask your stylist to recommend professional products formulated for your hair type.


There is an increasingly popular movement to use no shampoo at all, as your body naturally regulates hair oils.;
, Many shampoos contain chemicals called sulfates that are bad for your hair. These harsh chemicals make your hair weak and brittle, causing breakage which will keep you from growing those long, beautiful locks. Use shampoos labeled as being paraben and sulfate free, and avoid shampoos with SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) listed in the ingredients., Be sure your conditioner is free of silicones, which build up in your hair and cause damage over time. Condition only the longer parts of your hair, as the oils in conditioner can block hair follicles and slow the growing process., Over-washing your hair can make it fragile and prone to breaking. Washing too much can also strip away the natural oils that your scalp produces. Most dermatologists and stylists agree that washing every day is unnecessary. Three or four times a week should be enough for most people, though some people might have to wash their hair everyday if their hair gets greasy easily., Washing in hot, steamy water damages the hair shaft, leading to hair that is brittle and prone to breakage. Cool water will help seal the cuticle (outer layer) of your hair strands, making your hair sleeker and healthier. To keep it shiny and healthy, wash your hair in the coldest water you can stand.


It is especially important to use cool water when rinsing out your conditioner. This will help lock in the moisture from the conditioner.

, Brushing, combing, and the tools used to do this play a significant part in the health of your hair. Many people over-brush or use the wrong tools. While tangles and styling are a concern, be careful not to brush and comb too often. Using appropriate methods and tools will keep your hair strong.


Brush hair only when it is needed, either to combat tangles or for styling purposes. Over-brushing and vigorous brushing can damage or pull out hair. Do not brush it when it is wet, either. Instead, comb it using a wide-toothed comb.

, Combs and brushes serve different purposes. Use them correctly. Combs are for wet hair and removing knots, as well as parting hair and distributing styling products. Brushes are for distributing hair’s natural oils, styling and using with a blow dryer.For example, using a comb to remove tangles allows you to more carefully tease the knot apart without breaking the hair. Brushes do not allow for this kind of finesse.

, Don’t use plastic brushes, as these can be harsh on your scalp and create split ends. Instead, opt for a brush with soft, natural bristles. Boar-hair brushes are particularly recommended. Stiff bristled brushes are best for very thick and curly hair, which cannot be managed with a soft bristled brush."

Make a protein mask.,
Try a fenugreek paste.,
Give yourself a hot oil massage.,
Make a flax seed rinse.,
Create a fruit mask.",How to Make Your Hair Thicker2," Your hair is made up of protein, so what better way to thicken it then by adding a bit more? Mix 1-2 eggs (depending on the length of your hair) with a bit of fresh aloe vera gel. Completely coat your locks and allow it to set for 10-15 minutes before washing it out with warm water.

, Fenugreek seeds aren’t just good for your health, they can remove and reduce dandruff while thickening your hair. Soak some of the seeds (proportional to the length of your hair) in water for 8-10 hours. Then, blend them to create a thick paste. Apply this to your hair for 30 minutes, and then rinse it out using the water the seeds soaked in.

, Natural oils, especially olive, coconut, and jojoba, help to strengthen hair and promote growth. Massaging the scalp stimulates the hair follicles, helping them to produce hair. Combine these two by warming oil to a comfortable temperature, and massaging it into your scalp. You can additionally let it set in your hair for 30-60 minutes before rinsing it out.

, These tiny little seeds are packed full of fatty acids which add thickness to your hair naturally. Soak these little guys in a bowl of water for 5 days. Then, apply the flax water to your scalp and allow it to soak for 10 minutes. Rinse it off with fresh water, and wait for your hair to start thickening naturally.

, Turns out the nutrients and antioxidants in fruit aren’t just great eating, they also help to add thickness to hair. Make a mask out of fresh fruit by combining avocado, banana, and grated orange peel in proportion to your hair. Cover your whole head in the mask, leaving it to set for 20-30 minutes. Wash it off and shampoo and condition as you normally would afterwards.

Pay attention to your diet.,
Minimize your stress.,
Exercise frequently.,
Take a hair-boosting supplement.,
Check your medications.",How to Make Your Hair Thicker3," The nutrients in the food you eat can help strengthen the hair follicle and promote growth. Eat foods rich in protein, vitamins B, C, D, and E, and zinc. In general, try to include more fresh fruits and vegetables, seeds, nuts, and whole grains to thicken your hair naturally.


Examples of hair-fortifying foods include: walnuts, spinach, flax seeds, lentils, and blueberries.

, It’s not just an idiom when we blame thinning hair to high stress levels. Whether you’re ‘pulling your hair out’ or it’s simply falling out, your stress levels are likely to blame. Take steps to reduce your stress and you should notice a significant change in the health of your hair.

, One of the best ways to naturally relieve stress? Exercise. Keep your follicles healthy and stress-hormone levels down by getting your heart rate up at for at least 30 minutes daily. You’ll experience a great number of subsequent health benefits in addition to thicker hair.

, It’s not always easy to get all the nutrients that your hair needs to grow thickly, so help your body out by taking supplements. Several have strong ties to growing hair faster, thicker, and longer. Try taking biotin, Viviscal, or fish oil daily for better hair over several months.

, Although not always the cause, some medications that create hormonal imbalances can cause hair loss. The most likely culprit for thinning hair is the birth control pill, but any prescription medication that changes your hormone levels could be to blame. Talk to your doctor and see if there is a substitute to your hair-damaging meds."

Use a balding treatment.,
Get a hair transplant.,
Splurge on a laser comb.,
Get hair extensions.,
Try a keratin treatment.",How to Make Your Hair Thicker4," If your hair loss is extreme, try visiting your local pharmacy and getting an over the counter hair treatment cream. When applied on a daily basis, these help to increase hair growth in bald or thinning patches on your head.

, For extreme thinning or balding, consider a hair transplant. This surgical technique targets male pattern baldness by transferring hair from one part of the body to the balding area. Talk to your doctor to determine whether this treatment option is safe and viable for you.

, Just as high tech as it sounds, a laser comb is a relatively new innovation that uses helpful lasers to increase hair growth. These fancy hair combs come at a high price for all the thick, flowing hair they produce, with the set costing about $600. If you’re tired of thin or balding hair, splurge on a laser comb and you’ll have luscious locks in no time.

, Hair extensions are a temporary attachment of hair - real or fake - to your head using either thread or glue. Extensions can be made to look incredibly natural, but range in price from $100-$1,000 per set. They must be replaced every three months to avoid the look of grow-out as well.

, Available at most high-end salons, keratin treatments are specialty treatments that increase hair growth and add thickness and shine to your hair. You can get these once every couple of months, but be prepared to pay; each treatment costs $50 or more. If nothing else though, the keratin will work to greatly increase the health of your current hair, making it look fresh and damage-free."

Change your hairstyle.,
Use color to play up the volume.,
Invest in clip-on extensions.",How to Make Your Hair Thicker5," While you can't control your genetics, you can use the power of illusion to make your hair appear thicker. Ask your hairdresser for the best cut and style to create thickness and volume in your hair.


Add layers to create fullness, especially if your hair is very straight.
If you are feeling daring, consider getting bangs. The contrast between your bangs and the rest of your hair will help accentuate length.
Get a trim. When hair tapers off at the ends, it tends to appear thin and unhealthy. Trimming your hair so that it’s an even length will make hair appear healthier and more bouncy, and get rid of split ends in the process. Keep your hair looking salon-ready by getting it trimmed every 6-8 weeks.

, Highlights add dimension to hair, making it appear fuller. As mentioned above, however, bleaching hair extensively can cause further breakage, so stay within your natural color range.

, If you’re not ready to take the plunge and splurge on full extensions, try clip-ons. These are a much cheaper (albeit less realistic looking) version of hair extensions that can be purchased at local beauty supply stores. Find some in a color and texture similar to your own, and clip them in on a daily basis to add volume to your hair."
"
Minimize your use of heating tools.,
Wear your hair down as much as possible.,
Trim your hair.",How to Make Your Hair Grow Longer2," These are very harsh on your hair and should not be used too often. Products such as hair serum should always be used when applying heat, in order to protect your hair. Be sure that you also do not have the heat setting too high. Try to use things like blow dryers on their lowest setting.

, Avoid tight hairstyles like ponytails and buns or too-tight braids and extensions, as these pull hair and hinder growth. The strain on hair from tight styles such as these can leader hair to weaken and break. It also puts strain on the scalp itself by inhibiting blood flow. This can lead to headaches and keeps hair from getting necessary nutrients.


The places on your scalp which see the most strain could even see hair loss (traction alopecia).
Use looser styles if possible and try to avoid hair ties with metal pieces, as these can catch on and pull out hair. Rubber bands and tight elastic ties can also pull out hair. Look for “ouchless” or no-damage hair ties, or gentle elastic ribbon ties.

, It may seem counter-intuitive, but trimming your hair can actually promote hair growth. When split ends develop, this weakens hair and causes it to break. If hair is trimmed regularly, this will significantly reduce split ends, leading to stronger and better-looking hair. Hair should be trimmed by half to one inch every six to eight weeks.


Even if trimming means you have to sacrifice more length than you’d like, keep in mind that it’s better to have shorter, healthier hair than long, unhealthy hair.

Stimulate your scalp.,
Eat healthy.,
Take vitamin supplements.,
Give your hair an antioxidant mask.,
Drink water.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Make Your Hair Grow Longer3," Stimulating your scalp with massages, pinching, or brushing with a soft bristle brush can promote hair growth. This increases blood flow to the hair follicles, which brings needed nutrients to your hair. This can also help to reduce headaches brought on by the too-tight hairstyles mentioned above. Try one of these common scalp massage techniques:


Effleurage: This technique is meant to warm the muscle tissue and improve circulation to the scalp. It involves gently stroking the scalp with the fingertips or palms of the hands.Petrissage: This massage involves kneading the scalp, resulting in a deeper massage than the gentler effleurage technique. Petrissage relaxes and stretches the muscles, and also improves circulation to the scalp., Eating healthy will have a huge impact on hair growth. Your diet affects the nutrients in your body, and those nutrients are used to build new hair. If you do not have the proper nutrients, your body cannot build hair as quickly or as strongly. Eat a proper diet with the correct nutrients to promote hair growth.Protein: Hair is made mainly of proteins, so your body cannot build good strong hair if it does not have enough. Make sure you are getting complete proteins, either by eating meat, soy products, or multiple alternative sources of protein. Beans, seeds, nuts, milk, and seaweed are good alternative sources of protein but must be eaten in combination to produce a complete protein.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Your body needs these to produce hair. Hair is made up of 3% fatty acids such as these. However, your body can’t produce these on its own, so you need to be sure that your diet includes these. Fish (such as salmon) and nuts (such as walnuts) are an excellent source of these healthy fats, as well as protein.
Zinc: Without zinc, your scalp will become dry and itchy. This can lead to poor hair growth or even hair loss. Get more zinc in your diet by consuming fortified cereals and grains, oysters, and eggs.
Vitamin A or beta carotene: Consuming beta carotene allows your body to produce vitamin A. Vitamin A serves many functions in your body but also helps to regulate the oils on your scalp. Without these oils your skin will become dry and your hair will become damaged. Increase beta carotene in your diet by eating lots of sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apricots and carrots.
Iron: Iron is necessary for helping oxygenate the blood. This oxygen is necessary for healthy hair. Low iron is a major cause of hair loss, especially in women. Get more iron in your diet by eating dark greens, eggs, and meat.
Vitamin B: The entire vitamin B class will help promote healthy hair. Vitamin B5 is necessary to process the fatty acids mentioned above and B7 and B12 are used to process proteins. B9 affects cell growth directly. Get more B vitamins in your diet by consuming turkey, tuna, and lentils.
Vitamin E: Vitamin E is absolutely essential to healthy skin and healthy skin means a healthy scalp. It also helps to protect hair. Get more vitamin E by eating sunflower seeds, nuts, and avocados.

, Taking vitamins will help ensure that your body has the nutrients it needs to produce healthy hair. While eating a well-balanced, healthy diet should allow you to have the proper nutrients, vitamin supplements can help you ensure that you are getting the proper amount of each vitamin. Prenatal vitamin supplements are probably best suited to promoting hair growth, as these contain the vitamins most commonly associated with healthy hair.


Not everyone reacts to vitamin supplements in the same way, or has the same dietary needs. Consult your doctor before starting any dietary supplement.

, Applying a couple tablespoons of olive oil and coconut oil every couple weeks will flush your hair with antioxidants to fend off decay from free radicals.


Mix the oils together and heat the mixture up until it's warm. Make sure it won't burn your scalp.
Comb the mixture through hair. Make sure to get both the ends and the roots.
Let your hair sit for 20 to 30 minutes, then wash thoroughly and air dry.

, Drinking water will promote a healthier scalp and healthier hair. When your body doesn't get enough water, it begins to dry out. The skin and hair are the first and most noticeable areas of dryness from dehydration. Eight glasses of water per day is the typical recommended amount for an adult.

, Regular sleep cycles help your body regulate melatonin and cortisol levels, both of which affect hair growth. Also, sleep is necessary to maintaining your body in general. When your body doesn't get enough sleep, it begins to shut down side processes like hair production. Each person is different in how much sleep they need, so be sure to get the right amount for your body."

Raid your refrigerator.,
Mix your ingredients together in a bowl.,
Apply to first your roots, making sure to massage it in.,
Apply the remainder of your potion to the rest of your hair.,
Put your hair up and leave for 30 minutes.,
Wash your hair well and wash the eggs out with cold water.,
Style as usual.",How to Make Your Hair Grow Longer4," Here are the ingredients you'll need for a basic hair mask:


2 eggs
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp mustard
2 tbsp of an oil of your choice (such as coconut oil, jojoba oil, grapeseed oil, castor oil, agave oil, or olive oil -- or you could mix all of them!)

Of course, you could use other ingredients, too! Milk, lemon (though this could lighten your hair), honey, and apple cider vinegar are four common additions that are just as effective. And if you don't like the smell of mustard, replace it!
Olive is oil is great for hair strength and shine. Milk and coconut oil will make it soft and luxurious. Honey will add a glow and apple cider vinegar will bring it back to life. The healthier your hair is, the faster it will grow.



, Be sure all of the egg has been mixed in thoroughly, as that will take the longest to incorporate. If you have super long hair, you may want to use another egg or some more oil to make your mix go further.

, Don't be afraid to get your fingers messy! The more you really get in there, the better your results will be. You want every strand saturated by your magical concoction.


Coat your hair from the top, then flip your hair over and coat from the bottom. Part your hair in several different ways before you even think about being done. And make sure to get around your ears!

, Make sure to coat your entire scalp on through to your ends. However, the most important part is your scalp, as that is where the root is stimulated to grow. Once you think you're done, go at it for another few minutes.

, A bun, shower cap, pig tails or a ponytail will do, but since you'll probably be tempted to touch it, a shower cap is your best bet. You could also wrap it in a thin towel, too. Go do some yoga while you're watching TV, and come back when the episode is finished.

, It’s very important to rinse with cold water, since washing eggs out of your hair with hot water will cause them to fry in your hair. Eggs are some sticky business, so wash your hair as normal -- but wash it well. Make darn sure that all the sticky goodness is out, since you don't want to smell like a jar of mayonnaise later on in the day.


Shampoo and condition as usual, if you'd like. The drier your hair is normally, the less likely it is that your hair will need shampooing. You know your hair -- will the mask make it at all greasy? If you're prone to quick oil build-up, use shampoo. If not, you can skip it.

, You can use a deep-treatment mask like this up to once a week, if you'd like. You'll see a difference in no time!

, If your hair is thick and coarse, once a week is recommended. If you have thick and soft hair, you should wash your hair 2-5 times a week. If you have a range in-between, trust your gut. Washing your hair means using shampoo! You can take a shower everyday and simply condition it, but don't shampoo everyday, because it dries out your hair very easily.

, Sulfate dries out the hair, which can encourage frizz in your hair. You can, however, go for a silicone product. A common misconception is that silicone is bad for hair. In reality, that's false; silicone isn't necessarily going to strengthen your hair, but instead tame your frizziness and give the hair a healthier and sleeker appearance. A water-soluble silicone is recommended, because non-soluble silicone won't wash away unless you use a sulfate shampoo.

, Use a low heat setting if you don't have a heat protectant; even when using a hair dryer, you need to be careful.

Oily hair tends to pick up environmental smells.Try to wash your hair every other day or a minimum of twice a week., Smoke can cling to your hair and linger there for a long time, and it’s very hard to mask it. If you can’t completely stop smoking, try to only smoke outside and never in enclosed areas like cars. If you live or work with people who smoke, do your best to stay away from them while they’re smoking or encourage them to do it outside., If you work in a kitchen or are going to be at a smoke-filled party, cover your hair if you can. In a kitchen, wear a hairnet, kerchief, or a hat if the dress code permits. At a party, opt for a hat or a cute bandana.If you can't cover your hair, put it up in a bun, which will limit the amount of hair that is exposed to the smell.

, Anything that comes in contact with your hair (hats, kerchiefs, helmets, scrunchies, headbands, and pillowcases) can pick up the smell of your hair when it’s not clean and then transfer that smell back to you when you wear them on clean hair. Keep these items as clean as possible., Especially if you use products that build up in your hair and on your brush, you could be forcing smells into your hair when you brush it. Try to clean them out about once a week.If there is so much hair in your brush that you can’t pull it out with your hands, slide a pen or pencil under the hair in the brush and pull upward.
You can also use scissors to get stubborn hair out of your brush, just be careful not to harm the bristles. Insert the scissors parallel to the rows of bristles.
For an extra clean brush, fill up your sink with warm water and add about a tablespoon of shampoo. Wash your de-haired brush in the sink, rinse it well, and let it dry. , Zoophilic fungi grow on animals and can transfer themselves to humans.

If left alone, split ends can work their way up your hair causing your hair to look unhealthy and even shorter.To prevent the development of split ends, get your hair trimmed every ten to twelve weeks.;
, Brushing your hair can actually damage your hair. As a result, you need to be extremely gentle. If you have curly hair, you need to take extra precautions while brushing. You should brush your hair less frequently, but always make sure to detangle your hair prior to washing.To detangle your hair, start from the bottom and work your way up. This way you will not create large knots that need to be ripped out.
If your hair is extremely tangled, run your fingers through your hair before using a comb or brush.
Use a boar bristle brush because the natural bristles are gentle on your hair and will reduce the damage that is caused by brushing., Excessive heat, from either a blow-dryer, straightener, or curling iron can singe and damage your hair. If you need to use these tools to get the style you want, then try and only use one per day. Don’t blow dry and then straighten your hair on the same day..

Make your own shampoo.",How to Make Your Hair Smell Better Longer2," You can buy a variety of perfumes designed especially for this purpose, so these are your best option. You can use regular perfume occasionally as well, but since it’s not designed for hair, it can leave your hair oily or dry, so use it infrequently. Don’t spray perfume directly on your hair. It might ruin your hairstyle, weigh down your hair, or leave a shiny looking spot. Perfume can dry out your hair if you spray it directly onto your hair.

One advantage to making your own shampoo is that you can make it smell however you want! There are dozens of recipes out there, but here’s one that doesn’t call for too many hard-to-find ingredients. Mix together the following and use like regular shampoo:1/2 cup distilled water
1/4 cup liquid castile soap (soap made of plant oils)
2 teaspoons avocado oil
1/8 teaspoon peppermint essential oil
1/8 teaspoon tea tree essential oil
10-15 drops of the essential oil of your choice

Squeeze two fresh lemons into 1 cup of water, and then massage the juice into your hair. Let it soak for up to ten minutes. Be sure to condition afterwards so that the juice doesn’t dry your hair out. Beware that lemon juice also tends to lighten your hair and bring out highlights, especially if you go out in the sun with it still in.

Figure out what your hair type is and try to choose products that will improve the quality of your hair. If you can, go for all natural or organic products as these will be less damaging to your hair.


Your hair type may be fine, oily, dry, thick, coarse, etc. There are shampoos for every type of hair, so explore different products and find what works best for you. There are also shampoos and conditioners that increase the natural shine in your hair, so you may try out one of those to help you achieve softer hair.

When you are in the shower, wash with lukewarm water, and then finish off by rinsing your hair with cold water.Just as stylists will blast your hair with a blow dyer on a cool setting to create shine, a cold water rinse will also create shine. Cold water does the best job of sealing the natural moisturizers in your hair, which will make your hair feel softer., After you have showered, take a wide tooth comb and gently comb through your hair. Start from the ends and work your way up to your head, trying not to tug or snag any of your hair. Never brush your hair as this can really damage it, especially if it is already dry. If your hair is especially tangled after a shower, apply a detangler to your hair before you comb it out.To make the combing job easier post shower, consider running a brush or comb through your hair before you get into the shower. Then, when you apply shampoo and conditioner, your hair will be less prone to tangling.

, Some people feel that they have to wash their hair every day to keep it clean. However, washing your hair too much can be bad for your hair because it strips your hair of the natural oils it needs and doesn't leave much time for the oils to be restored. Try washing your hair every other day or every two days to allow the natural oils and shine to return.If you are worried about your hair looking greasy or oily, you can always use dry shampoo on your roots. Simply apply the spray and rub it in gently with your finger tips. Baby powder is a great product for this as well. Wearing your hair up on the second day is always a good idea too, because it may be harder to style down.
If you have always washed your hair daily, it make take your hair some time to get used to the exposed oils. You may experience very oily hair at first, but after a few weeks you hair will naturally produce less oil between washes. When you wash it daily, it's trying to make up for the oil lost so it produces it faster. Once your hair is used to going a few days without a wash, the oil production will slow down and become manageable.

, Blow drying and using styling tools like wands, straighteners, and curling irons can wear away hair's cuticles, resulting in dry or frizzy hair that breaks easier. If you really want softer hair, try to let hair dry naturally and try to avoid overexposure to heat.If you must use heat styling tools, make sure you spray heat protectant on your hair first. Then, when blow drying your hair use a cooler setting and don't keep the blow dryer in the same place for more than a second or two so that it won't scorch your strands.

, Once a week, apply a deep cleansing conditioner to your hair. This conditioning treatment will help restore life and moisture back to your hair but don't overdo it. If your hair starts to feel weighed down, or you are noticing build up, deep condition your hair less. Apply this conditioner mainly to the roots, and let it sit for 20 minutes. Then, rinse it out with lukewarm water.You can also use a leave in conditioner once a week to restore moisture back to your hair and bring health to the ends of your hair. Squirt a pump or two into your hands and then scrunch it into the ends of wet, freshly washed hair. Then, style your hair as usual. You can use leave in conditioner as a styling product, or solely as moisturizer., Hair naturally begins to split around three months, and once you have reached that mark your hair will feel drier, get easily tangled, and will not grow as quickly. Aim for getting a trim or hair cut every three to four months to keep your hair healthy. Keeping the ends of your hair trimmed will help your hair feel softer and it will be easier to style and manage., When you spend time in the sun, you might protect your skin with sunscreen, but you also need to protect your hair. Your hair can be damaged by overexposure to the sun, so when you head outside for a long period of time, make sure it is protected. Wear a hat or apply a light hairspray with SPF protection to keep your hair from being damaged by the sun.After you have been outside for a while, apply a hair mask to restore moisture and life back to your hair. Even if you protected your hair from the sun, it couldn't hurt to do some conditioning to keep it from drying out. This is especially helpful if you have spent time in a pool.

, Coconut oil is a natural product that can restore moisture and life back to your hair, leaving it soft and shiny. Warm up a quarter cup of coconut oil. Then, apply evenly through your hair and leave on for about an hour. Rinse it out with luke warm water once you have allowed it to sit.Coconut oil can stain clothing and linens, so be careful when using it! Make sure to have an old towel around your shoulders or put your hair up in a shower cap as you let the coconut oil sit.
Your hair can be wet or dry when you apply this mask, but it may be easier to apply over wet hair.

, Egg yolks can provide silkiness and softness to your hair as well as restoring strength to your roots. Olive oil is a natural moisturizer that can add shine and repair damage in your hair and honey has similar effects. Mix one egg yolk and three tablespoons of olive oil and honey and apply to damp hair by massaging it into your scalp and through your strands. Then, rinse out after 20 minutes.In place of an egg you can also use yogurt or buttermilk. There are many ingredients that are good for your hair, so it doesn't matter so much which ones you mix together.In place of honey and olive oil you can add an avocado. This ingredient works much like the other ingredients by bringing shine and moisture to your hair., Combine one ripe banana, one tablespoon honey, one tablespoon almond or olive oil, and two to three drops of lavender oil. Blend these ingredients until smooth and then saturate your hair with the mask, massaging it into your scalp for extra hydration. Wrap your hair with a warm towel and allow the mask to sit on your hair for 15 minutes. Then, rinse it out.The protein in bananas improves elasticity of your hair, while the honey can provide hydration to your scalp.

, Mix 1/4 cup of aloe vera gel, juice from half of a lemon, and three to five drops of argon oil. When you are in the shower, after you have washed your hair with shampoo, apply this mask evenly through your hair. Allow it to sit on your hair for three to five minutes and then rinse it out.This mixture is great for your hair because it replenishes moisture and shine to your hair, and is especially helpful if you have just spent a lot of time outside. You can also apply it to your skin if you are looking to moisturize especially dry, sun exposed skin.

Don’t skip the conditioner.,
Use cool water.,
Dry with an ultra-absorbent towel.,
Apply a product.,
Brush your hair gently.,
Reapply product as your hair dries.,
Avoid touching your hair.",How to Make Hair Shiny when Air Drying," Using shampoo every time you shower can dry out your hair, but you should condition every time. It will soften your hair, hydrate it, and help smooth the cuticle to create shine.Look for conditioners made for your hair type, and make sure you’re applying it properly.If you have fine hair, avoid applying conditioner to your roots. That can weigh down your hair. Instead, start halfway down the hair and coat your hair to the tips.
If your hair is medium or thick, you can coat your hair from root to tip. Let it sit on your hair for a minute or two so that you can absorb maximum moisture.
If your hair feels weighed down or oily, rinse with a clarifying shampoo before conditioning. This will clear off any excess build-up, making your hair feel lighter and letting the shine come through!;
, Don’t worry – you don’t have to stand in an ice cold water. In fact, warm water will open the cuticle of your hair and help your conditioner soak into the shaft. However, before you step out of the shower, give your hair a quick rinse with cold water. The cooler water seals the cuticle of the hair, locking in that moisture you just gave it with your conditioner., A lot of towels can rough up the shaft of the hair, leaving it frizzy and damaged. You can skip any sort of towel and use your hands to gently wring out the excess water in your hair. If you want to speed up the drying process, consider buying a ultra-absorbent, microfiber towel that will reduce friction on your fragile hair.If you don’t have a good towel handy, you can even use a t-shirt to soak up the excess water.

, To get super sleek, shiny hair, you have to be willing to use a bit of product. The key is to look for light products, to keep your hair from looking oily or stringy. Mists and anything with “light” in the product name are a good bet. Make sure to avoid products that are heat activated, because they will be useless without blow-drying.


Light oils, styling creams, and hydrating mists can all help your hair dry shiny and smooth. When it comes to finding the perfect product, it may be a bit of trial and error.
Look for products made specifically for your hair type (fine, coarse, thick, thin, dry, and so on).

, Wet hair is fragile, so you want to be extremely gentle as you comb or brush it. This step is important because it helps to distribute the product over the hair. Brushing your hair down also helps the cuticle lay flat, reducing frizz and increasing shine.There are brushes made specifically for wet hair with microfiber bristles to help dry your hair while also smoothing it.Brushes with flexible rubber bristles are also good for wet hair, because they bend as they move through the hair, reducing snagging and unnecessary damage.

, Depending on your hair, you may or may not need to do this. Some hair starts to frizz as it air dries. If this happens, you can rub a bit of product between your palms and gently smooth out any frizz. Avoid applying product near the roots so your hair isn’t weighed down., As your hair dries, playing with it can cause frizz. As much as you want to rake your fingers through it, avoid the temptation! The less you touch it, the better. The same rule goes once it is dried. The oils from your hands can make your hair look stringy, so hands off!"

You can find these at beauty stores.;
, The growth of curly hair can be slowed down if you use products with lots of chemicals.

Trim your hair every 6 to 8 weeks to rid your locks of damaged ends and to prevent split ends from re-splitting. When you maintain this hair trimming schedule, it will only be necessary to cut approximately ½ an inch off your tresses each time., Shampooing your hair strips the scalp of its natural, nourishing oils. These oils ensure the health of your long locks. If you choose to use shampoo, apply the product 2 to 3 times per week and always condition your hair after.If you wish to avoid shampoo, replace the product with cleansing conditioner.


Always apply shampoo directly to the scalp and conditioner to the ends of your hair.

, After showering, squeeze the excess water from your locks with a towel.Use a wide tooth comb to detangle your long locks. When possible, leave the blow-dryer in the drawer and air dry your tresses.Avoid roughly rubbing your hair with a towel—this leads to frizz and split ends.

, Your diet impacts the health of your hair. To maintain a healthy shine to your long mane, drink lots of water and eat a diet rich in vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K. To increase your intake of vitamins A, C, E, and K, consume more mangos, kale, spinach, sweet potatoes, avocados, and apples.To increase your intake of vitamins B and D, eat more animal products.These include fish and dairy products., While ponytails, braids, and top-knots are adorable and stylish, the tension these hairdos place on your hair can cause damage. The optimal style for long locks is to wear your hair down. If you prefer to pull it up and back, opt for a low chignon or ponytail, and don't wrap the hair too tightly., When your hair rubs against certain fabrics, the resulting friction causes split ends. Pull your hair up into a low bun or sweep it to the side when you wear fur, faux fur, or wool., When selecting products, read the label and ingredients list carefully. Always buy products that are formulated for your specific hair type. Avoid products that contain sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, and isopropyl alcohol. Instead, seek out products that contain natural items, like avocado oil, honey, and or coconut milk.Don’t haphazardly test new products on your hair.

, Routinely exposing your hair to excessive or harsh heat will damage your long locks. If possible, invest in salon quality tools.When purchasing a flat iron or curling iron, opt for a tool that lists its temperature in degrees instead of “High,” “Medium,” or “Low.” This feature will allow you to control the temperature. When buying a blow-dryer, search for a product with a heat distributing nozzle and or a diffuser attachment. These features spread the heat evenly throughout your hair., When you have long locks, a great hairbrush is a worthwhile investment. Select a brush with natural bristles—a boar bristle round brush is ideal. Your brush should be firm enough to detangle your hair, yet gentle enough so that it does not pull too hard on your hair., Hair dyes will damage your hair and overusing products will weigh it down.It is best to simply avoid dying your hair—wear your natural color proudly. If you choose to dye your locks, only dye your hair when it absolutely needs it.
Use a marginal amount of hair products to keep your long locks full and bouncy. Over time, hair products build up on your scalp. Using too many products will weigh down your already heavy locks, causing them to look lifeless and flat., Your bedtime routine should include brushing your hair. Run through your locks with a wide toothed comb or a boar bristle brush. Brush your hair from root to tip several times. This will detangle your locks and spread your scalp’s natural oils throughout your hair., When worn at night, elastic bands can cause undue damage to your roots and hair shafts. If you prefer to wear your hair up at night, trade your elastic band for a scrunchie. Before bed, twist your hair into a top-knot and secure the high bun with a scrunchie., When your hair comes into contact with a cotton pillowcase, the resulting friction damages your long tresses. Upgrade to a silk pillowcase to prevent split ends. If you cannot afford a silk pillowcase, wrap your hair in a silk scarf., Waking up with tangled tresses is never fun. Protect your hair at night with a sleeping cap. Sleeping caps constrain your hair—when your hair moves less at night, you wake up with fewer snarls."

Hair that hasn’t been washed in a day or two will be full of natural oils that will help you create a shape that stays.If you have your heart set on wearing a French knot right now but you just washed your hair, don’t worry. You can mimic second day hair with product, which will be discussed later.;
, Before you start creating your French knot, it’s important to work out all the tangles and knots. Begin combing from the bottom, slowly bringing your comb higher and higher.Don’t tug on your hair, as that can cause breakage. If you come across a tangle, gently focus on that section of hair until it’s untangled. Continue combing until you’re confident all of the tangles have been worked out.

, This step is especially important if your hair was recently washed, but it’s helpful to use a product on second or third day hair as well. Dry shampoo or texturizing spray both add a bit of “grit” to your hair, giving it texture that will keep it in your bobby pins.If your hair is silky and sleek, spray your hair with one of these products to make it a bit more coarse.


Start spraying the product about an inch from your roots, coating your hair thoroughly and then running your hands through your hair to work the product in.

, There should be two front sections on either side of your face, and one section down the back of your head. All of the sections should be equal sizes, so the actual size of each section will differ depending on how much hair you have on your head! Part your hair however you normally do. Side or middle parts both work fine. You will be working with the back section first, so bring the two front sections in front of your shoulders.If it is helpful, you can also clip the two front sections out of the way.

, You want to tease the hair at the base, or roots, of the middle section of hair you created. Teasing your hair is a simple way to create volume and to create texture for bobby pins to hold onto. It will ensure that your French knot stays in place.Grab a teasing comb, and place it a couple of inches away from the root of your hair.
Gently back-comb, or push your hair up, by moving the comb towards the root of your hair. In other words, you are strategically roughing up the hair, creating a little patch of “tangles” at the root of your hair.
Do this only on the hair at the bottom of the middle section. Feel free to clip the top of the middle section out of the way to do this successfully.

, Use a flat brush to sweep the two front sections of hair toward the back. Use your hand and your brush to combine them with the middle section of hair, bringing them together as if you were creating a ponytail. Hold your hair in this position, but do not secure it with a hair tie., Twist your ponytail at the base so that you feel it tighten up near your scalp. Then bring the length of your ponytail to your head, so that it’s flattened against your head. After your hair is tucked to your head, gently push on one side of the ponytail so that it becomes tucked into your hair. In other words, the hair from the ponytail should almost become concealed, pushed into the rest of your hair.This is the part of your French knot that will require practice. It is helpful to bring up a YouTube tutorial for this part so you can see what this step actually looks like.
After you understand the concept, practice it a few times. Soon, you will develop muscle memory and the French knot will become second nature!

, Open the bobby pins a bit with your fingers, so that they can grasp a bigger section of hair. Slide them into your knot so that they are holding both the “knot” section created by the ponytail and the hair at the base. Use as many bobby pins as you need until the knot feels secure.Because you will probably end up using a fair amount of bobby pins, find ones that match your hair color. The French knot should appear simple and effortless, and the bobby pins should be invisible.

, If you have bangs or short wisps that frame your face, style them however you like. Leave them untouched, create a soft curl with a curling iron, or make a sleek, straight style with a flat iron. If you would rather not have any hair near your face, use extra bobby pins to pull these strands back and secure them at the sides of your head.

, Even if your hair feels completely secure with bobby pins, it’s smart to give your French knot a spritz of hairspray as well. This will ensure that your knot stays in place all day, and it will also help to eliminate frizz. Don’t over-do it– no one wants their hair to look like hard plastic.


Hold the hairspray about 6 inches away from your hair and only hold down the spray for a second.
Once you’ve applied the hair spray, avoid touching your French knot. This can cause frizz and ruin the sleek look you’ve created.

, If you’re going to be out of the house all day, make sure you throw a couple of bobby pins in your purse or backpack. The French knot is a great style because of its simplicity and elegance, but one big stray hair can really throw off the entire thing. In case of stray pieces of hair, turbulence, or unforeseen bad weather, it’s always important to bring emergency touch-up supplies!

Refrain from overwashing.,
Trim your split ends.,
Massage your scalp.,
Avoid overstyling.,
Care for your hair at night.",How to Make Curly Hair Grow Faster2," Washing your hair everyday can negatively impact your hair’s health and slow down the hair grow. Try to only shampoo your hair every two to three days. This allows your scalp’s natural oils to get into the follicles and stimulate growth., Many people believe that trimming your hair slows the rate of your hair growth. Others think you should trim it every six weeks. You should trim your hair when you have unhealthy split ends. Trimming the dead, damaged split ends can help promote better hair growth.Don't stick to the every six weeks schedule. You can trim your hair every three to four months, or wait until you have a lot of split ends that start getting tangled. Only trim when your hair needs it, but make sure you trim the damaged hair.

, Massaging your scalp may help promote faster hair growth. Massaging your scalp helps promote follicle health by increasing the blood flow to your scalp, which can help the hair grow. Try massaging your scalp for three minutes before you wash it.Try using peppermint or eucalyptus oil diluted with coconut oil to massage your scalp.

, Styling your hair too much or with harsh products and instruments can slow the growth of your hair and cause your hair to become unhealthy. Be gentle with your hair, especially when you are trying to grow it out.For example, try not to blow dry, use heating tools, perm, or color too often.

, When trying to make your curly hair grow faster, you should protect it at night. Seal the ends of your hair with oil before going to bed. Try coconut, olive, or jojoba oil. Try sleeping on a satin pillowcase to help prevent damage during the night.You may consider pulling your hair back into a loose ponytail or braid while you sleep.

Eat fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Add in dairy.,
Eat lots of protein.,
Consider supplements.",How to Make Curly Hair Grow Faster3," Eating a fresh, healthy diet can help promote healthy hair and hair growth. Fruits and vegetables provide vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that can help your hair grow.Include dark leafy green vegetables, like spinach and kale, sweet potatoes, broccoli, peppers, avocados, berries, citrus fruit, and melon.

, Dairy foods can help your hair stay healthy and promote growth. Dairy foods contain protein, B-vitamins, and calcium. Try Greek yogurt, low fat milk, low-fat cottage cheese, and low-fat cheese.Consider tossing some fruit into Greek yogurt, or eating vegetables with cottage cheese as a snack.

, Protein is essential for having healthy hair. Healthy hair grows faster. To help with this, include more protein into your diet. Make sure you eat lean sources, like chicken breast and fish. Eggs are also a good source of protein that help make your hair healthy.Salmon is one of the best foods for your hair. It’s a source of protein, but also contains omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, both of which help your hair grow faster.

, If you don't think you are getting the right nutrients for your hair through your diet, try taking a nutritional supplement. You can try a multi-vitamin or supplement specifically made for hair growth, or you can take individual supplements that promote healthy hair.Always talk to your doctor before taking nutritional supplements.


Certain minerals help with hair growth, like zinc, selenium, and silicon.
Increasing your intake of vitamin A, C, and E can help give you healthier hair. All the B vitamins also promote hair growth.
Supplements for omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids can help give you healthier hair and promote growth. Taking fish oil supplements can provide these fatty acids.

Level out your testosterone.,
Never use steroids to aid in chest hair growth.,

Apply Miconazol Nitrate (also known as Daktarin cream).,
Cut an onion in two and rub it on your chest.,
Get advice from a male relative about their chest hair.,
Be patient.,
Know the myths about hair growth.",How to Increase Chest Hair," Talk with your doctor about whether you have normal testosterone levels. Testosterone has a peculiar relationship to hair loss. Not enough testosterone and your chest hair won't grow.Too much and it gets converted into DHT, which shrinks hair follicles.Try to have a healthy balance of testosterone; of course, because there's no testosterone test available over the counter, you'll need to seek the advice of a doctor.


Start working out. Both weight loss and weightlifting can boost a man's testosterone levels.Hit the gym, back up onto the bench press, and do some serious exercise. You'll feel stronger and grow some chest hair while you're at it.
Take testosterone supplements if your doctor diagnoses you with low-T. Only take supplements if your doctor has diagnosed you. Again, if you have normal levels of testosterone and you take supplements, an enzyme will convert the excess testosterone into a follicle-shrinking hormone. Not a good recipe for hair growth.
Talk to your doctor about estrogen inhibitors. Your doctor should know if you taking estrogen inhibitors is advisable for chest hair growth in your specific case.;
, Anabolic steroids pose serious health hazards. As there are dozens, if not hundreds, of different anabolic and androgenic steroids, each with different side-effects on the body and implications for your hair, it's not considered safe to use steroids for hair growth.

, If you have any chest hair already, shaving will help it get thicker, not help hair grow where it isn't. (This one of the reasons girls wax instead of shave.) Shaving cuts the hair at its root, where it's thickest; when it grows out, the hair will be thicker for its whole length. See How to Shave Chest Hair.


Shave your chest every 2-4 weeks.

, In the mornings, after a shower, massage the chest area with Daktarin. This method has been reputed to stimulate the growth of new hair, although not medically verified.



Note: Miconazol Nitrate is a fungus-busting crème used to treat foot and vaginal infections. Use in moderation, and with caution.

, Rub the onion onto your chest using a circular motion. Once the surface of the onion is dry, cut about 5mm of the onion and continue; this can stimulate hair growth because onions contain sulfur, a mineral known to help with hair growth.


This method should probably not be used during the day, because of the smell. So let it do it's work during the night, and shower the next morning.

, It may be embarrassing, but ask someone you trust about their own experience growing chest hair.


If the male relative wants to know why, you have two options:

Tell the truth, mention your intention of growing chest hair and maybe they can let you in on their secrets. You may have nothing to worry about.
Just say that you were wondering and wanted to talk about something random.



, The growth will probably only start after about two weeks and will be only dramatically noticeable after some time. Be patient and stick with your treatment. It may not necessarily seem this way, but there are many more important things in life than chest hair, so chin up!

, There are some well-intentioned myths out there about how to grow hair and what it takes to have a manly mane. Many of them have been debunked by science and are demonstrably false.


Increasing blood flow doesn't increase hair growth.Maybe you've been told to brush your chest with a toothbrush to increase the blood flow to the area, which is supposed to stimulate growth. It's not scientifically true. Brushing your chest will not get you chest hair.
Unclogging pores won't help you grow hair. Some say that blocked pores can cause hair to be trapped beneath the surface of the skin, and that the secret to hair growth is simply unclogging those pores. It's simply not true. While scrubbing away dead skin and unclogging pores is definitely a good thing, it won't help stimulate chest hair growth.

Do some chores to get yourself moving.
Do some squats, jumping jacks, or other aerobic exercises.;
, Getting up and exercising on the spot isn’t always an option, so if your hands get cold and you can’t increase your heart rate with aerobics, do some hand and foot exercises.


Wiggle your toes and fingers
Move your hands in circles
Clench and release your hands and feet

, Another way to get the blood flowing to your hands again is with a massage. Especially in the winter months when skin gets dry, spend some time massaging oil or cream into the skin of your arms, wrists, and hands.


Don’t forget to massage in between your fingers and your fingertips.

, Although this is a more long-term approach to warming your hands, both smoking and caffeine cause your blood vessels to constrict or narrow, and if there isn’t enough blood flow to your hands, they will get cold.In cold months, try white teas instead of coffee to get your mornings going.

, Because your body reacts to cold by sending warm blood to your internal organs, you can help prevent your hands from getting cold and help warm them up by keeping your core warm and protected. If your body doesn’t think your organs are in danger, it won’t take warming blood away from your hands.


In cooler weather, layer your clothing, wear a base layer, an insulating layer, and an outer layer that protects from wind and rain.

, Tight clothes, socks, and even underwear can actually constrict your blood vessels, meaning blood has a harder time circulating, and this can leave your hands chilly. To combat this, wear loose clothes that are comfortable and provide you with freedom of movement.If you are wearing tight clothes and your hands get cold, change into looser clothes as soon as you can.

, It makes sense that if your hands are exposed to the cold, then they will get cold, so keep them protected with warm, loose-fitting gloves.


Be sure to get gloves that cover your wrists as well, because a lot of heat can be lost here.
Put your hands in your pockets if you don’t have gloves, or stick them inside your jacket to keep them out of the breeze.

, Ginger is a thermogenic food, meaning it produces heat when your body metabolizes it.A hot cup of ginger tea could help warm your entire body, including your hands, and holding the warm cup is sure to bring some life back to your hands.

, No matter how cold it is outside, there are some areas of our bodies that are almost always warm, such as under our arm pits and between our thighs.


Put your bare hands directly on the skin in a warm area of your body and leave them there until they warm up.
You can also try sitting on your hands, but be aware that this could reduce the circulation and make them tingle.

, When you are going traveling outside in winter or at night, or going on a cold-weather excursion, you should be prepared with reusable or disposable hot packs that can provide instant heat to warm your hands and body. Good choices include:


ClickHeat
Hand Warmers
Charcoal hand warmers
UniHeat
Heat Pax

, Not only will the warm water heat up your hands as well as your entire body, but it’s also a relaxing way to recover after time spent out in the cold.


A safe bath temperature should never exceed 110 F (43 C), as this could cause burns, dizziness, low blood pressure, nausea, and vomiting.Alternatively, you can run your hands under warm water, or fill a bowl with warm water and soak your hands and wrists.

, The hot air from your lungs will instantly heat up your hands. Cup your hands to help keep the heat in as long as possible, and then rub your hands together quickly to spread the warmth to the back of your hands.

, Fires, heaters, hot car engines, and even running computers give off plenty of heat that you can use to warm yourself. Just be sure you don’t get too close, and don’t touch the heat source.


If you are wearing gloves, take them off and place your hands directly in front of the heat. Try turning your gloves inside out and placing them close to the heat as well. That way they’ll be nice and toasty when you put them back on.

, While alcohol may make your skin feel warmer, it actually lowers your overall body temperature. Alcohol causes the blood vessels in your skin to dilate, and this diverts blood away from your vital organs and toward your extremities., While having cold hands and feet is natural, if you start to experience numbness, changes to the skin color, hardened or tightened skin, sores and blisters, hair loss, or memory loss,talk to your doctor. There are many health conditions that cause cold hands, including: Anemia
Raynaud’s disease
Diabetes
Nerve damage
Hypothyroidism

, Look for flat or chunky heels to aid in your balance. Incorporate some slip on shoes because bending to put on shoes will become a challenge in your 8th and 9th month of pregnancy. Keep in mind that the feet generally swell a bit with pregnancy so you may want to add a 1/2 a size to the shoe.

Remember that your breasts will be expanding too.,
Choose panties that are comfortable.",How to Shop for Maternity Clothes6," Purchasing a comfortable bra will be one of your first orders of business once your breasts begin to swell. No matter how well your clothing fits, if your bra is too tight, you will be irritable and uncomfortable. In addition, you will look better in a bra that fits properly. Purchase bras that have two to three rows of hooks and adjustable straps so you can accommodate expansion.

, This is a personal choice. Some women prefer over the belly bands. Others prefer to stick with their bikinis or thongs. Comfort is the key so find a style that works for stock up.

Look for a high content of natural fibers.,
Avoid synthetics.,
Observe what buttons and zippers are made of.,
Focus on the thickness of the clothing.,
Look for garments that include extra or spare buttons.,
Spot garments that have fabric facing included.,
Pay attention to whether the garment has lining.,
Focus on good stitch work.,
Look for imperfections.,
Identify quality brands.",How to Spot High Quality Clothing," High quality clothes are often made with natural fibers. This is because natural fibers are not only more expensive, but sometimes hold up better over time. Ultimately, the fibers a product is made will tell you a lot about the product itself.


High quality clothing is often made of wool, cotton, cashmere, and silk.
Remember that a high content of natural fiber does not necessarily mean a piece of clothing is high quality. You’ll also have to look at the construction of the clothing, feel it to make sure it is soft, and make sure that thread work is secure.
Natural fiber and synthetic blends are okay, if most of the material is natural. Blended fabric may tend to last long and hold shape a lot better than cloths just made of natural fiber.;
, While synthetics are touted for being cheaper and more durable than natural fibers, they are the hallmark of cheap clothing. This is because they’re a good indicator that the manufacturer was focused on cost rather than quality. Thus, you should be wary of synthetics and scrutinize them.


Be careful of polyester fabrics. They’re exceptionally cheap and are probably poorly manufactured.
Watch out for acrylic. For example, sweaters that are more than 50% acrylic won’t last long., The material of buttons and other accessories can tell you a lot about the quality of a garment. Plastic parts are an indicator that a piece of clothing is cheaply made. Instead, look for:


Metal zippers.
Wood or metal buttons.
Look for robust buttons and other accessories, regardless of the type of material., The heaviness or thickness of a piece of clothing is also a positive indicator that it is high quality. Clothing that is made with generous amounts of material is typically high quality clothing and will be comfortable, maintain its appearance, and last for many years. To test thickness:


Hold the garment up to the light and see if much light penetrates it.
Pinch it with your fingers and see how it feels.
Feel how much it weighs against a similar article of clothing you know is high quality. If it is lighter, it likely has thinner material., Depending on style, high end clothing will have no shortage of buttons. In addition, higher end clothing will come with spare buttons you can use to replace lost ones.


Inspect the clothing and try to locate extra buttons.
Look to see that buttons are where they should be. For example, collars and the sleeves of arms will have buttons., Facing is the extra material manufactures sew along seams. They are often used around zippers and necklines. If a garment does not have facing or has a little bit of facing, the garment may be low quality.


Try to see if the manufacture used the same fabric for facing as they used for the rest of the garment. If they did, this speaks to the quality of the fabric., Lining is the material put in between the inner and outer fabric of jackets and similar pieces of clothing. Unlined jackets or other articles of clothing appear cheap, thin, and won’t be as warm.


Pinch the fabric lightly and rub your fingers together to see if there is lining present. Pay attention to the thickness of lining – the thicker, the better.
Try to spot marks of quality that demand the use of extra material such as plackets covering buttons, double darts, or French cuffs., Good stitching work is one of the best indications that a piece of clothing is high quality. If the stitch work is poor, chances are that the item was cheaply made and uses cheap materials. Look for:


Stitching work with many stitches per inch. Generally, the more the better.
Extra top stitching.
Buttons and other pieces that are securely sown to the fabric.
Hem work that is fully finished. For example, if the hem appears loosely stitched inside or is lacking thread, the clothing is probably low quality., A sizable number of imperfections are a clear sign of poor quality. Ultimately, you should see imperfections as a warning sign of poor workmanship. If the quality is put together poorly, it likely won’t last long. Avoid:


Missed stiches
Loose stiches
Crooked lines or seams
Fabric patterns that don’t line up with seams, One of the easiest ways to identify high quality clothing is to learn about the brands that produce it. This way, all you’ll have to do is see the manufacture’s tag to know an item was made well. Look for:


Handcrafted garments or garments produced by niche or small-scale producers. If you’re not sure, consult the manufacture’s tag and then look it up on the internet.
Popular high-quality brands include Levi Strauss & Co., Patagonia, Ralph Lauren, J Crew, Diesel, Pendleton, and others.
The quality of certain brands may decrease over time, so don’t assume that a brand that was high quality 10 years ago is still high quality."

Avoid buying from street vendors.,
Check the price.",How to Spot Fake Gucci Sunglasses," This is one of the quickest and easiest ways to tell if the glasses are fake. A fake pair might say ""inspired by"", ""like"", or simply misspell the word ""Gucci.” Look at every part of the sunglasses to check for misspellings., All Gucci sunglasses are only made in Italy by the Safilo Group. There should be a CE after it says ""Made in Italy"". This stands for ""Conformité European"", which means ""European Conformity.”Scratch the paint that say says “Made in Italy.” If the paint comes off, then the sunglasses are likely fake.

, After the letters GG (stands for Guccio Gucci) there should be a model number. The model number will have four numbers followed by an “S” for sunglasses. Look up this model number on the internet. The sunglasses that come up in the search should look like your sunglasses. Sometimes, counterfeiters will put a model number on the glasses that matches a different type of glasses.You can also look for the color code. The color code should have five digits/numbers, which can be all letters, all numbers, or a mix.

, If there are nose pads, inspect them. The Gucci logo should be engraved on the metal piece in the middle. Many fake Gucci sunglasses do not have this on the nose pads., Sunglasses may not be polarized, even if they are dark. Put on the sunglasses and look at your computer monitor at different angles. If the glasses turn dark at some point, then they are polarized., Hinges on real Gucci sunglasses should not be made of plastic or have screws attaching the hinges to the frame. In fact, there shouldn’t be any screws at all on your sunglasses. After you’ve checked the hinges, test their movement. They should move fluidly without getting stuck., Fake sunglasses are typically made of cheaper, lighter materials. Real Gucci sunglasses should have a not heavy, but significant weight when held in your hand. You can look up online at the Gucci store what the weight for your particular model of sunglasses should be., Real Gucci sunglasses come with a certificate of authenticity and warranty that can be found inside of the packaging. The certificate of authenticity should come as a card in an envelope. The back of the card should have information about the color and style of the sunglasses. Compare the information on the card with your sunglasses to make sure they match., Real Gucci sunglasses should come in a Gucci box. The box should say “Gucci” in a logo and font that matches the Gucci on your sunglasses. Newer models of boxes are usually brown with gold lettering, but older models will vary the color and style of the packaging.Keep in mind that fake sunglasses can be put into real packaging.

, A carry case should come inside of the box. The logo and font should match the box and glasses as well. Inspect the carry case to make sure that the stitching is even and straight. Newer carry cases are usually brown with gold lettering, but older models will vary in style., A dust cloth should come with the box and carry case. The cloth should have the Gucci logo in the center that is consistent with the logo and font of the sunglasses, box, and carry case. Even if you have an older model, the dust cloth should be consistent in style with your other accessories., The sunglasses should come packaged inside of a plastic bag. The plastic bag will have a manufacturer’s sticker placed on top of the plastic. Check the sticker to make sure that the details match up with your sunglasses., The best and most reliable way to make sure you’re purchasing real Gucci sunglasses is to buy directly from a Gucci store. This way, there will be no doubt or need to check the sunglasses to make sure that they’re real. Not every area has a Gucci store, but Gucci does have a store that you can purchase from directly online.If ordering from Gucci online, make sure that your package has not been opened or tampered with in any way.

, If you can’t buy directly from Gucci, the next best way to assure that the sunglasses are real is to buy from a reliable retailer. For example, Bloomingdale’s, Neiman Marcus, or Nordstrom are some reliable luxury department stores that sell Gucci products. These department stores are sometimes found in standalone locations, but often they are found in malls., If you must buy from an online retailer that is not Gucci or an upscale department store, then make sure a return policy is offered. Only buy the sunglasses if there is a conditional return policy, and if the seller is trusted and has good ratings. This will give you the chance to inspect the sunglasses for authenticity before deciding to keep or return them.

, You will often see street vendors selling what they claim to be “luxury” items on busy streets. More often than not, the goods will be fake. You can tell this by the price of the products and by a quick inspection. Unless you are okay with fake goods, avoid street vendors.

, Gucci sunglasses are known for being notoriously expensive. The price is usually at or above $200. It's unlikely that an authentic pair of sunglasses will be much cheaper than that price."

Take your measurements.,
Check each garment’s sizing information.,
Make a list of what you need.,
Avoid distractions.,
Try on your clothes as soon as they arrive.",How to Shop for Clothes Online1," Each manufacturer may size clothing differently, so you cannot rely on a standard small/medium/large scale or numeric size scales. Since you cannot try on clothes before you buy them when shopping online, accurate measurements are essential.


At minimum, women should know their bust, waist, and hip measurements. Additional measurements, such as height, inseam, and arm length, may also be needed depending on the garment being purchased.
Men should know their chest, neck, waist, and inseam measurements. Additional measurements, including arm length, shoulder width, and height may also be needed.
For children's clothing, parents should know their child's height, waist, and hips. Girls also need a bust measurement, and boys need a chest measurement.
For newborns and toddlers, parents should know their child's height and weight.
Also, know the season you're shopping for. For many of us, summer time is all about living easy and enthralling in the warm weather. Whenever warm weather is upon us, women decide to mix things up a bit and go out wearing shorts. In the fall, long blue jeans make your body warmer. So know the season you're shopping for.;
, Most manufacturers have a standard sizing chart they use for all their clothing, but many online stores sell items from a range of manufacturers. Check the product description of each garment you consider purchasing to double-check how the sizes are measured. You may discover that you are a small by one manufacturer’s standard, but a medium by another’s standard.

, If you decide to shop for multiple items of clothing at once, write down everything you need before you get started. Doing so will help you stay on track and may help prevent you from feeling overwhelmed by choices. Depending on where you're located, many seem to flock to Amazon or Walmart because the price meets the demand. If in Europe or the Middle East, the Amazon alternative is Jumia. In Russia, it's completely different than Middle Eastern or South American countries, and so forth. So really narrow your search down after finding which sites will offer your clothing based off location.

, Only look at the clothes you know you need. If you only intend to buy a new dress, avoid looking at tops and accessories. Otherwise, you risk wasting time looking at clothes you don’t really need, and may end up buying something extra and out of budget.

, Many online stores accept returns, but only within a limited time frame. Try on your clothes as soon as they arrive at your door. Do not remove any tags or stickers, since doing so may hinder your ability to return the item if it does not fit.

Take the shoes that you will be wearing most with any new jeans.,
Wear undies that are shiny or synthetic, you want the jeans to slide over them and not get stuck, especially if you are trying on lots of them.

,
If you stick to one brand of jeans, and one size, there are minute differences in the fit in every batch of your size; good jeans are hand cut and this can mean a 0.5 centimeter (0.2 in) difference in a seam here and there; so take a few pairs of the same size into the change room until you find YOUR pair!,
Beware of vanity sizes!,
Make sure you sit down in any jeans before you buy them, is that crutch seam comfortable?,
On purchase, check with the sales assistant that you may exchange these jeans if they do not fit when you get home: explain you will get a bigger/smaller size on return to their wonderful and well stocked store (a bit of flattery goes a long way when jeans shopping...)

,
On their first washing, turn inside out and wash ALONE in cold water; these may run like Usain Bolt on first wash and you do not want other items getting cross dye marks on.,

",How to Shop for Jeans," When buying a new pair of jeans, several factors have to be taken into account: do you want the latest trendy look, i.e skinny jeans or do you want comfort? Age does play a part here I have to say, you do NOT want to look like MDAL (Mutton dressed as lamb), or a fashion victim; Also forget shredded, ripped at the knees or anything too tacky.;
,, Maybe: it depends on the colour. Hot pink I would say only suits the under 18s but a dark green or black could be just what the doctor ordered.

, This enables you to see the leg length and how much hem needs taking up, if any.

,, And if you need to lie on the floor to do the zip up, trust me, you need a bigger size! Muffin tops are so not a good look.

, i.e a size 8 in one brand will be a size 10 in another; I have pairs of jeans that are labelled 3 different sizes, from 3 different designer brands and they all fit me.

, Waist not digging in? Knees not feeling like their wrapped in clingfilm? Good; these may be the ones for you... Ask your friend what she honestly thinks.

,, Machine washing is fine. Use delicate settings for your jeans as they last longer this way.

One small exception some of the fabrics are very stretchy so you could get a size smaller if you like your panties to fit snug.;
,, Go to the better department stores and the Victoria Secret store in the mall. Go to the lingerie/intimate apparel department in that store. Don't be shy ask for some help. Tell the salesperson what you want, thong panties in nylon or cotton in your size. They will be glad to help you.

, Get the prettiest pairs and hopefully you will not have to worry about price. When wearing the thong for the first time you may find it uncomfortable (the thin strap in back). Hang in there, you will soon forget you have them on.

, Get a fresh clean towel and lay the panties down on the towel and roll it up, gently squeezing the towel. Now just hang the thongs somewhere in your closet to finish drying.

Shop wholesale.,
Check shipping costs before you commit.",How to Shop for Clothes Online2," In order to avoid over-spending, you need to know how much you can afford to spend. Review your financial situation and determine how much extra money you have available.

, The true beauty of online shopping is convenience. Within minutes, you can check out the selection at multiple stores, all without leaving your chair. Take advantage of this convenience by comparing the prices and selection offered by several reputable online stores. You may discover that two stores are offering similar garments for vastly different prices.

, The easiest way to do this is to sign up for email newsletters with various online stores you frequent. These newsletters frequently include information about sales and clearances. Otherwise, quickly visit the online storefronts of different sellers and note which ones have sales going on.

, Many wholesale sellers require you to be a reseller to make a purchase, but not all do.


True wholesale requires you to purchase large quantities at one time, making it a good option for basic necessities like underwear and socks.
Retail wholesalers purchase large quantities of clothing at wholesale prices, then sell those garments with very little mark-up. As a result, clothing purchased from a retail wholesaler is often much cheaper than clothing purchased from a standard retailer.

, Shipping costs and additional check-out fees can dramatically drive up the price of your purchase, especially if you end up buying from a seller in a foreign country.


You should also make these costs a factor when you compare prices at various stores.

Buy from trusted sellers.,
Look for comments and reviews.,
Know how to spot a counterfeit.,
Do not give out personal information.,Shop on encrypted websites.,
Check out the return policy.",How to Shop for Clothes Online3," Department store websites and the official websites of well-known brands are a good place to start. If you buy from smaller stores or individual sellers, opt for sellers that go through PayPal or other secure payment methods.

, Only purchase from individual sellers when a detailed feedback system is available. Sellers with a 100% approval rating may be skewing their results, so you should aim for sellers who have vastly positive reviews and a few “resolved” negatives. Resolved negatives include any problem that was remedied after communication between the buyer and seller.

, When buying brand name items, be aware of the fact that many sellers are out to scam you. Know the peculiarities of a particular brand and look for detailed pictures that can be used to identify a garment as real or fake.

, Your name and address are necessary, but your Social Security number and bank account are not. If a feel skeptical about whether or not a seller is asking for unnecessary personal information, err on the side of safety.

, Websites that start with ""https://"" are secured, and many Internet browsers also display a closed padlock to indicate encrypted security. These security measures are not necessary while viewing products, but you should avoid websites that have you pay on unsecured pages.


, Before you commit to a purchase, verify whether or not a seller offers returns and refunds. Even a legitimate seller who does not offer returns can be a mistake to buy from, since you may find yourself stuck with an unusable product if it does not fit.

Figure out how much money you can dedicate for new clothes, and be sure to stick to your budget.Think about cost per wear. An item isn’t a steal if you get it for $50 and only wear it once, but buying a jacket that costs $100 and wearing it for the entire winter is a smart purchase.;
, You may be looking for something in particular, or you may just need a few everyday items. Consider whether your wardrobe is lacking in a particular area, such as work clothing or athletic wear. Perhaps you need a few new pairs of jeans, a nice suit, or something for a special occasion. Make a list of what you want or need, and stick to it.Consider sports stores for athletic wear and outdoor gear; check out department stores such as Nordstrom or Dillards for everyday items as well as fancy garments; or choose a brand-name outlet if you’re looking for specific items, such as Levi’s when you are in need of jeans.
You can also look at outfits online to get an idea of what you like. Do an image search or go to a fashion website or even a clothing retailer website. Consider how items are put together to get an idea of what kinds of things you would like to wear., Pick out things that you are automatically drawn to. You want to purchase items that you truly love and that you’ll feel great it. Trust your intuition and pick things that you think are fabulous. Don’t worry too much about current trends or styles.


Remember to think about what you will wear with the new item. If you are purchasing separates, be sure you have pants or a skirt that will coordinate with the top, and vice versa. If you are purchasing a dress or suit, consider if you have appropriate shoes and accessories to go with it. You don’t want to end up with a bunch of items in your closet that you can’t make complete outfits from.

, Only buy it if you really love it and are comfortable in it. Don't buy anything you may not want later or that does not fit properly, no matter how much its marked down from the ""original retail price."" Also, consider if you have similar items; if you have three pea coats, you don’t need another one, even if you like the color.


Check the labels to see how high maintenance the item is, and if you’re willing to care for it the way it needs to be so it lasts (i.e. hand wash only, needs ironed after every wash, etc.) If you know you’re unlikely to take an item to the dry cleaners, don’t purchase it if it’s dry clean only., Wear clothes you feel good in and shoes that can easily slip on and off for shopping. Pay attention to the undergarments you have on; they should be ones you would wear under the clothes you plan to purchase (e.g., wear a strapless bra if you are looking for a strapless dress).

, Otherwise you’ll quickly lose energy and may end up purchasing items just so you can be done. Bring a water bottle and a snack if you plan to be shopping for a while, or plan to take a break and have lunch while you’re out.

, You may find several things you like on the first few racks, but that doesn’t mean you should call it quits. Browse through different sections to ensure you see everything the store has to offer. You could also start shopping at the back of the store and work your way toward the front.

, If you’re struggling to find the items or size you are looking for, ask a salesperson to help you choose things. Remember to be kind and courteous. They can bring you multiple sizes or similar styles. A salesperson may pair items you hadn’t thought of, or bring you something that you hadn’t considered before but end up loving.


Keep in mind that it is their job to sell items, so don’t decide to purchase something just because the salesperson says it looks great. Ensure you really like the item and are comfortable with the price before buying., Ensure the item is well-made and the fabric is high-quality. Look carefully to be sure there are no stains, tears, or missing items (buttons, decals, etc.) on the clothes. Check out the seams, zippers, etc. to be sure they are of good quality. If it is hard to fasten or there are lots of threads coming out of the stitching, don’t buy it.

, Avoid buying items with puckering seams, uneven hems, unsightly gaps, or other issues. Sit, stand, and stretch while using the mirrors provided in the fitting rooms to check every angle. If the item is too tight or gaps open while sitting, it’s not the right item for you. Don’t get it if you won’t be comfortable while wearing it.


Only buy items that will fit you now. Don’t buy a different size hoping that you’ll one day fit into it, or the piece may end up just hanging in your closet., Sizes can vary by brand, so it’s a good idea to take your measurements before shopping online. Many manufacturers have a sizing chart available on the website, so consult this to be sure you’re getting the right size before purchasing an item., One of the best things about online shopping is the convenience. It’s easy to find multiple sellers for a single item. If you’re looking for a specific item or brand, do a web search for that item. You’ll get lots of results for the same thing, which makes it easy to compare prices and find the best deal.

, Spend some time reading comments and reviews from other customers so you will know what to expect when your package arrives in the mail. Other customers can let you know if an item didn’t look or fit as advertised, as well as whether the quality of the item was high or low.

, Since you can’t try on items you find online, make sure the store you are buying from has a good return policy. Ensure you can send the item back if it doesn’t fit, and look for free return shipping to cut costs.

, You may find a great deal on an item you love, but if the shipping costs are exorbitant you may end up paying far more than you’d like just to get the item in your hands. Look at the shipping costs for each item and store you want to purchase from. Some stores give discounts on shipping if you spend a certain amount, so consider buying several things from the same place.

, Coupons aren’t always advertised on the store website. Do a web search for coupons from the manufacturer as well as the supplier. You may be able to find coupons for the specific item as well as the specific store.

, Some stores have time-sensitive return policies, and you don’t want that new dress hanging in your closet for weeks before you realize it’s too big. Try things on as soon as you receive them so you know whether to send things back or keep them., Make a folder or choose a spot to store all your receipts and packing slips from online shopping. This will make it easier for you to return items if needed, as well as keep track of how much you spend and what stores or sites you frequent."

Look for the Fair Trade logo.,
Look for an organic or recycled certification.,
Know where your clothing is made.,
Shop for secondhand clothing.,
Shop locally.,
Rely on the guidance of websites and apps.,
Make use of fashion transparency indexes.",How to Shop for Ethically Made Clothes1," Fair Trade U.S.A. is a non-profit organization that helps identify brands that manufacture their products ethically outside of the U.S. They measure things like working conditions and wages. If a company meets their standards you will find their stamp of approval in the form of a little green, black, and white logo of a person holding a bowl in front of the world.You can also find the Fair Trade logo on food products like tea, coffee, spices, and sugar.
You can find the Fair Trade logo on brands like People Tree, Patagonia, and Eileen Fisher.;
, The first thing that you should look for on the label is the Fair Trade logo mentioned above. The label should also tell you if the material is made out of organic or recycled material. Keep in mind that just because a product is made from organic or recycled material doesn’t mean that it is ethically made., You should check the label to see where your clothing is manufactured. However, it is important to remember that the label doesn’t tell you everything about where the clothing is labeled. Even worse, sometimes the brand is dishonest with the country listed on the label. It is important to do your research instead of relying solely on the label.For example, a brand that lists the country as USA may source some of their materials from China.
According to the Fashion Transparency Index, H&M and Levi’s are excellent at reporting this information to customers.

, You can find secondhand clothing at a thrift or consignment store. When you shop secondhand you are extending the life of an article of clothing instead of purchasing it new from the company. You are also reducing the amount of cheap, unethically made clothing that a company needs to manufacture.Don’t forget to donate or resell your clothes when you no longer want them.

, You are much more likely to find ethical brands sold at a local boutique than at the mall. Chances are, the boutique owner can give you plenty of information about where they source their clothes and why they chose that company. They may even be able to give you information about the company’s practices and policies.You will also feel good about supporting a local company.

, Apps like GoodGuide and Free2Work can help you navigate brands while you are on the go. GoodGuide rates products on a scale of two to ten to help guide consumers to healthier choices. Free2Work is a tool that is used to increase transparency and give consumers the power to make informed decisions about their purchases.Keep these apps on your phone for use during your next shopping trip.

, Use The Higg Index, an assessment tool used by the fashion industry to evaluate their environmental and social responsibility, to do research about ethical brands while you are near a computer.You could also refer to the Fashion Transparency Index (FTI), which is an index published yearly to rank the world’s biggest fashion brands according to their level of transparency.

Browse your wardrobe for items you no longer wear.,
Select quality material.,
Look for stains and holes.,
Consider buying to sell.,
Decide how to price clothing.,
Take measurements of clothing.",How to Sell Vintage Clothing1," If you've collected vintage clothing in the past, you may have some old items lying around your closet.Oftentimes, people buy a vintage outfit for a special occasion. You may have worn a vintage dress or suit to a theme party or a wedding, for example. Be honest with yourself. Are you ever going to wear this item again? If the answer is no, it may be a good idea to sell.
You could also talk to older relatives, who may have vintage clothing on hand. If your grandparents are not interested in hanging on to old outfits, they may not mind donating them to you.
Check places where you may have stashed old clothes in the past. Browse your attic, basement, and other places where you store old things.;
, Not all vintage clothing is made the same. Items are more likely to sell if they're made from quality material. Vintage clothing is often seen as a collector's item and may be priced high. Therefore, buyers look for the best materials when making purchasing decisions.Artificial fabrics are notoriously difficult to clean. If an outfit is in good quality otherwise, you may still be able to make a sale. However, you should consider selling this item at a lower price to entice buyers.
Higher quality fabrics, like wool and cotton, tend to sell more easily. You can also sell at a higher price due to their quality.

, As vintage clothing is older, stains and imperfections are common. You may notice stains under the armpits and small holes here and there. An outfit with a small imperfection can still be sold, but you'll want to correct the problem before attempting to sell.Check for any obvious stains. If you notice sweat stains under the arm pits or any other wear and tear accrued over time, see if the outfit can be cleaned. Attempt to remove the stain using a cleaning method appropriate for the given material.
Small holes, tears, and missing buttons may be fixable. You can sew on a missing button or patch up a tear.
Some items may be too damaged to sell. If an item of clothing has stains that will not come out or very large rips, you may be better off tossing it.

, You do not have to rely on your old clothing alone. Sometimes, you can find items to sell in local markets. At a thrift store, a vintage dress may be priced well under what it's worth. You can also look into local flea markets or do clothing swaps with friends.Avoid vintage stores. You're unlikely to find something you can sell for profit. The owners have a certain level of expertise, and will be selling items at an appropriate price. You will only be able to sell back the item at the rough price you paid.

, Once you've gathered clothing to sell, you'll have to make decisions on pricing. Pricing is somewhat subjective, and you may find you don't have an exact method when it comes to pricing clothing. Each piece may have to be individually priced based on its worth.Do some research to see how items are generally priced. Browse online outlets to get a sense of the average price. You could also visit some local shops and look at prices. Break down price by type of clothing. You may find a vintage dress generally goes for $45 to $60, while a vintage blouse runs between $20 and $30.
Consider profit. If you bought an item, you'll want to sell it for slightly more than you paid. If you had to repair an item from your closet, make sure the price outweighs the cost of repairs.

, Before you sell items, measure them. Instead of listing sizes, it's a good idea to list specific measurements. Sizing charts have changed greatly over time. This is especially important if you're selling online, as potential buyers have no means to try on an outfit.Dresses are measured at the shoulders, hips, waist, and bust.
You can measure the waist of pants, as well as their length. You may also want to consider measuring shoulders and waist size for blouses and shirts.

Create an account on your chosen website.,
Take clear photographs.,
Build a brand.,
Provide accurate details about the clothing.,
Market yourself.",How to Sell Vintage Clothing2," There are many outlets available for selling vintage clothing online. Before you begin to sell, research your options and decide what works for you.You can sell vintage clothes on many mainstream websites. Auction sites like eBay can be helpful. You can set a base price and let potential buyers bid. You could end up making a good sum if two buyers want the same outfit. Sites like Etsy can also work, although bidding is infrequent.
You can also look into specialty sites. These are auction sites and websites specifically designed for the sale of vintage clothing. Such websites can be helpful as you'll be reaching your target marketplace instantly.

, Once you've decided where you'll be selling, create an account on your chosen website. This should not take long. Usually, you need to provide basic contact information like your name and address. You may also have to create a brief profile where you explain a little about your history and background. You can write something simple, just stating you love vintage clothing and are looking to sell some extras from your wardrobe.

, You'll need to put up some pictures of the items you're selling online. It's important that you get clear photographs. Buyers will want to see your outfits from multiple angles so they can decide whether or not to buy. Do not rely on a phone camera. Use a high quality camera to take photos of a given item from a variety of angles.If you don't have a great camera, see if you can borrow one from a friend. If you're not particularly adept at technology, see if a friend would be willing to take some pictures for you.
It may be helpful to have someone model clothing items for you. It may be easier to get a sense of how a dress may look like if you can see it on a person.

, If you want to sell vintage clothing professionally, you'll have to build a brand for yourself. Your brand is how you market yourself. Think of a unique story or style. There are many ways to brand yourself that increase your sales.You should get on social media outlets. Link things like your Twitter and Instagram to your online selling profiles. You can include pictures of upcoming items, as well as behind the scenes looks at you preparing items for sale.
A blog can also be a nice touch. Try starting a blog about vintage clothing. Talk about the history of vintage clothing and your adventures shopping for clothing and preparing them for sale.
Let your personality show. Drop references to TV shows, books, and movies. If you have a sense of humor, let it out in your social media. On occasion, post something amusing from your personal life. This will entice more followers and therefore more sales.

, Honesty is important when building a reputation online. You want to make sure you have buyers' trust. Most sites allow users to leave reviews. If you were dishonest about an item's quality, a buyer may call you out. If an item is slightly stained or worn down, be honest about it. Many buyers don't mind purchasing a fixer-upper, but they'll want to know what they're getting themselves into ahead of time. Honest sales will allow you to gain a good reputation, enticing more buyers in the future., You should find ways to market yourself. You can start by posting links to what you're selling on sites like Facebook. You can also get involved in online forums where people discuss vintage clothing. You can get to know other sellers, network, and advertise your products. You should also maintain active social media profiles advertising your brand.

Research local outlets.,
Browse typical prices for similar items.,
Be careful with thrift store and consignment shops.,
Set up a booth at a local fair or flea market.",How to Sell Vintage Clothing3," You may prefer the simplicity of selling locally. You do not have to worry about shipping fees and marketing yourself if you're selling your clothing to local outlets. Browse the market before choosing a place to sell your items.Look at local thrift stores and vintage stores. You can ask for advice on where to sell, and you may even get an offer for your clothing items.
You could also see if there are any small local auctions happening around your town. It may be a good idea to sell at a local auction, as bidders may compete with one another. This could result in you getting a fairly high price for an item.

, Before you sell an item locally, browse the local market. See what the typical going rate is for, say, a vintage dress or a vintage suit. You want to make sure, when you do choose to sell, that you get a good deal. Educate yourself going into any sale so you'll be able to use your knowledge to negotiate.

, Thrift stores and consignment stores often purchase old clothing for resale. However, be careful when selling at such places. You'll often end up selling your clothing for less than half the retail price. This is where educating yourself can come in handy. Always negotiate with the teller, showing him or her you know how much a piece is worth. While a store will never buy an item for its full retail price, you can work your way up to a higher percentage of the retail value., If there are any local fairs or flea markets coming into town, this can be a great place to sell. You'll be able to sell your items at their full retail value.


Research a fair beforehand to make sure you have the right audience. A craft fair may draw in buyers interested in vintage clothing. However, a fair designed for children is probably not the best option.
Look into the regulations at a given fair to figure out how to sign up and set up your booth. You'll need basic supplies, like a cash box, a table, and some chairs. You'll also need clothing hangers to display your vintage clothes.

, Draping your scarf over the front of your overcoat makes it the focal point of your outfit, while wearing it inside creates a more subtle effect.


To wear it on the inside, tuck the draped ends into the coat so that they cover the chest area exposed by the coat's neckline. Close your overcoat over the scarf and readjust the scarf as needed until it is even under your collar.
To wear the scarf on the outside, pop the collar of your overcoat up and place the scarf at the base of the collar at the back of your neck. Let the scarf hang down naturally over your coat.

"
Fold the scarf in half.,
Drape the folded scarf around your neck.,
Pull the loose ends through the loop.,
Readjust as desired.",How to Wear a Scarf for Men3," Fold the scarf in half lengthwise so that it effectively becomes half its original length.Since this scarf style requires you to halve the length of your scarf, the best type of scarf to wear this with is a long rectangular scarf. The ends can either be rounded or fringed.
This style can be moderately warm to very warm depending on how tightly you tie it.
This type of knot has also been called the European Knot, European Loop, Loop Pull, and Slipknot.

, Hang the folded scarf off the back of your neck, bringing the loose ends and looped end across your chest.


The loose ends and looped end should hang straight down over your chest on opposite sides.

The knot should be positioned in front of your neck.
Only the loose ends should hang down in front of your chest now.

This tying method is very warm and highly suitable for cold weather.

, Cross the longer end over the shorter end before threading it through the resulting loop. Pull the long end back over the front of the loop to tighten it.


Essentially, this move is the same sort of tie you would use when tying your shoelaces.
When you cross the longer end over the shorter end, a loop will be created around your neck. This is the loop you will need to pull the longer end through.
Pull the ends so that the knot is tightened flat against your neck.

, Arrange the longer end so that it lays flat over the front of the shorter end.


The longer end should already be positioned over the short end. If not, readjust the knot so that the longer end naturally lays in front.

, If the knot is too tight or too loose against your neck, readjust the ends of the scarf to fix the problem.


Button or zipper your jacket over the ends of the scarf. Do not let the scarf hang outside of your overcoat.
If wearing a long, fringed scarf, the fringe may peek out from underneath the jacket. This is acceptable, but it is an optional style choice that you can choose to keep or reject.

Drape the scarf around your neck.,
Make a loose knot on one side.Tie a knot 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.75 cm) from the bottom of the long end of the scarf.,

,


Keep the knot loose so that it will be easy to adjust and easy to stuff the other end through.

, Pull the short end of the scarf into the top of the knot and out through the bottom of the knot.

Cross the long end over your shoulder.,
Bring the long end back around to the front for a once-around.,
Pass the long end around your neck once more for a twice-around.",How to Wear a Scarf for Men6," Hang the scarf off the back of your neck so that the ends drape straight down over your chest.


The front of your neck should still be uncovered at this point. It should essentially look the same as the classic drape style.
This style can range in warmth from slightly warm to very warm, all depending on how tight you make the loops.
Choose a long scarf for this style. One that is 72 inches (1.8 m) works well. A longer scarf is especially good to have for a twice-round.
For a traditional look, choose a scarf with fringes. A scarf with rounded edges will also work, though.

, Pass the longer end over your neck, draping it over your opposite shoulder.


The long end should now hang straight down over your back. The short end should remain in front.

, Cross the long end over the back of your neck and over the shoulder it originally hung across.


Both ends should now hang straight down across your chest.
Tug on both ends of the scarf to even them out. Also tug on the ends to adjust the wrapped portion around your neck. A tighter loop will be warmer, but a looser loop can seem more easy-going and stylish.
This completes the once-around style. Depending on how much length your scarf has or how cold the weather is, you may wish to continue further with a twice-around style.

, Wrap the long end of the scarf around your neck once more, crossing it over the front and back of your neck as well as both shoulders.


When finished, both ends should lie straight down across your chest.
Tighten or loosen the loops around your neck to create the look and level of warmth you desire. Make sure that the scarf lies flat against your neck and chest instead of bunching up or twisting.
Both the once-around and twice-around styles can be worn both inside and outside your overcoat.

Apply cuticle oil to your cuticles.,
Fill a shallow bowl with acetone.,
Soak your nails in the acetone.,
Scrape the shellac polish off.,
Wash your hands.,
Apply lotion and more cuticle oil.",How to Remove Shellac Nail Polish1," Rub cuticle oil into the skin around your nails. Do not wipe away the excess.


Cuticle oil is a product designed to soften and moisturize your cuticles, and it can be found at any major drugstore. Applying it to your cuticles before removing the shellac nail polish will provide your skin with a protective layer against the harsh, drying acetone needed for this process.;
, Pure acetone will have the strongest effect, but acetone nail polish removers will also work as long as the concentration of acetone is around 60 percent or more.


Acetone-free nail polish removers or those that contain very little acetone will not be effective for removing shellac nail polish.You can use pure acetone, which is available at most drugstores, but pure acetone will cause your nails and skin to become extremely dry. As a result, it is best if you do not use it frequently.
The dish you pour the acetone in should have a mouth that is wide enough for you to fit your balled-up hand in. You only need to pour enough acetone into the dish to fill up about 1/2-inch (1.25-cm).

, Partially ball up your hand so that all five nails are exposed. Hold your hand in this position and dip it into the acetone. Keep it there for 10 minutes.


It is important that you expose as little skin as possible to the acetone since it can severely dehydrate your skin. By holding your hand in this position, you end up dipping your nails and cuticles into the acetone instead of your entire fingertip or hand.
Keep your nails submerged in the acetone for the full 10 minutes, even if you see the shellac nail polish flaking off before the full amount of time passes.

, After 10 minutes, remove your nails from the acetone and scrape the flaking shellac off with an orange stick or manicure stick.


To scrape the shellac polish off, place the flat edge of the orange stick at the bottom of the nail and gently push it along the length of the nail, beneath the shellac. Repeat this gesture until all the polish has been scraped off each nail.
You could also begin scraping the shellac nail polish off after 8 minutes with your hand still submerged in the acetone. This will allow the acetone to continue working on more stubborn spots while you begin stripping away spots that are already ready to come off., Use warm water and soap to gently remove the acetone and shellac residue from your hands.


After removing the shellac nail polish, you may see a chalky white residue on your nails and fingers. This is residue left behind by the acetone and will wash away with soap and water.

, Rub a generous amount of hand lotion over both hands when finished. Also rub additional cuticle oil around your fingernails.


No matter how careful you are, the acetone will dry out at least some of your skin. Lotion and cuticle oil will help restore some of this lost moisture, and applying them immediately after washing your hands will produce the strongest effect.

Finished.

",How to Dress in Simple Alternative Fashion," You don't need to decide on a label; go with what catches your eye. However, just make sure you have a pretty good idea of what you want. Print or cut our pictures from the Internet and magazines of styles you like to keep you inspired. Paste them to your wall, or create a little fashion notebook and put them in there, if you think it would look awesome with your décor.;
, A lot of times you can still use a lot of your current clothes in your new wardrobe. Get rid of anything that is too small or too large, that you dislike, or that you find uncomfortable or unflattering. Keep an eye out for things that could be altered to fit your new style, as sometimes they could end up being your favorite pieces.

, The alternative style usually includes long-sleeved, plaid flannel shirts, T-shirts of classic bands, black tights, dark or acid wash jeans or shorts, and vintage button-down cardigans. For shoes, look for Converse, classic boots, and combat boots. Keep an eye out for studded clothing and accessories, and make sure to pick up a few dressy outfits that fit your alternative style.

, Check basic stores such as Kohl's, JC Penny, and even Macy's to see if you can find anything that catches your eye. Make sure to always get the basics, and buy them good-quality so you don't have to keep buying them again. Next, try some stores that are more in your style. Hot Topic has some good band tees and accessories, but be warned: many alternative people shop there, so you most likely won't be ""one-of-a-kind"" unless it is very unpopular in your area. Zumiez, Journey's, and even Claire's all are good places to shop.


Shop at thrift stores for old-fashioned, vintage, or cheaper clothing. Don't be afraid to shop in unusual places or places that don't look like they'd have any potential; it's easy to miss a needle in a haystack.

, There are a lot of great websites that sell alternative accessories and clothing for fairly low prices, such as bluebanana.com, shanalogic.com, restyle.pl/, and shopplasticland.com. Be careful when shopping online; since you can't try on clothes, you have to pay extra special attention to the sizing charts and what the material it is made of. One brand's size large may be a medium in another brand.

, Try changing them around if you want to. Cut up your tees, rip up your jeans, and add embellishments. If you can sew, try attaching buttons and different fabrics to really customize your old clothes and make them look brand new!

, You can have short and punkish hair, long and flowing hair, cute and wavy hair; whatever you want. Learn how to dye your hair, or go to a friend or hairdresser, and maybe dye your hair different colors. You can make it all black, two-toned, rainbow; whatever floats your boat. Curl it, crimp it, iron it, scrunch it, braid it; do whatever you think looks best.

, Don't be afraid to wear something you would think would never match; it may look really good. Have a friend who wears similar styles help you decide whether they look good or not. Some good examples would include:


a ripped up tee, skinny jeans, any shoes
a long-sleeve shirt, skirt, Doc Martens
a simple tee, long skirt, ""goth boots""
plain tee, ripped up jeans, any shoes
alternative dress, Doc Martens (depending on the style of the dress)
tee with a vest, shorts, any shoes
layers upon layers of different clothing

, Don't let anyone put you down no matter what they say. It's your life and you should be able to do what you want.

, While there is no typical alternative hairstyle, many people opt for thick, sweeping bangs over one eye, or a high ponytail with studded hair accessories. Alternative makeup is generally kept pretty simple and natural, with the exception of heavy eyeliner, smoky or cat eyes, and red lipstick. Still, these elements of your style are highly variable, so go with whatever you like best!

Trim cotton pads and aluminum strips.Cut sterile cotton pads into small squares that are just large enough to cover the nail bed of each finger.,
Apply cuticle oil to your cuticles.,
Soak the cotton in acetone.,
Place the cotton onto your nail.,
Wrap the foil around your nail.Tightly wrap a square of tinfoil around each fingertip to hold the acetone-soaked cotton pad in place.,
Wait 2 to 10 minutes.,
Scrape or wipe away the shellac nail polish.,
Buff the nail, if necessary.,
Wash your hands.,
Apply lotion and more cuticle oil.",How to Remove Shellac Nail Polish2," Cut a sheet of aluminum foil in 3-inch (7.6-cm) squares.


You should have ten cotton squares and ten aluminum foil squares. You will need one of each for each finger.
The aluminum foil squares need to be large enough to wrap securely around each fingertip.
You could also use cotton balls instead of cotton pads. If using cotton balls, there is no need to trim them down to size. The aluminum foil strips may need to be slightly larger to accommodate the larger thickness of the cotton balls, though.

, Rub cuticle oil into the skin around your nails.


Cuticle oil is designed to protect, soften, and moisturize your cuticles. Applying it before stripping the nail polish will help to prevent your cuticles from drying out more than absolutely necessary.

, Dip the cotton square or cotton ball into acetone nail polish remover until it is fully saturated.


There is some debate over whether to use pure acetone or a diluted acetone nail polish remover. Pure acetone is most effective, but it can also cause your nails and skin to become extremely dehydrated. At the very least, you should not use pure acetone frequently.
Acetone-free polish removers are not powerful enough to work on shellac nails.

, Position each square of cotton directly over your nail, covering it completely.

,


Wrap each fingertip tight enough to secure the cotton but not so tight that you tear the aluminum foil or cause circulation problems.
Aluminum foil creates heat, which actually improves the effectiveness of the nail polish remover.
Give each nail a gentle press to make sure that the acetone comes into contact with the nail.

, The shellac will begin to peel away after 2 minutes, but you may find it more effective if you leave it on for a full 10 minutes, instead.


The more highly-concentrated the acetone is, the sooner you can remove the cotton.
If you wait much longer than 10 minutes, the cotton can dry out. If this happens, it can get stuck to your nail, making it more difficult to remove.

, Gently peel the flaking shellac polish off with an orange stick or manicure tool.


Place the flat edge of the tool against the bottom of your nail. Gently scrape the length of the nail until all the nail polish is removed.
You might be able to wipe the remaining polish away with another cotton pad soaked in more acetone remover.

, If there is any sticky or chalky residue left, use a soft cloth or other soft buffer to gently wipe it away.


Avoid buffing tools that use a motor or have a rough texture since these can weaken your nails.

, Remove additional residue with warm water and soap.

, After washing your hands, put some moisture back into them with hand lotion. Rub more cuticle oil into your cuticles and over your nails to further moisturize them.


No matter how careful you are, some dehydration is likely to occur. Lotion and cuticle oil will help restore some of the lost moisture.

Clean and dry your fingernails.,
Apply a base coat if you wish.,
Choose a magnetic nail polish color and design.,
Brush on a normal first coat.,
Apply a thick second coat on one nail to begin.,
Hold the magnet over the nail.,
Continue the process on every nail.,
Wait for the magnetic polish to dry.,
Apply a top coat if desired.,
Remove the polish when needed.",How to Apply Magnetic Nail Polish," Wash your hands and nails with water and soap, then dry them thoroughly on a towel to begin with a clean and dry surface.


Make sure to completely remove any nail polish you already have on using nail polish remover and a cotton pad, cotton ball, or other preferred method.
Magnetic nail polish can be applied to the toenails as well. Prep toenails in the same way as fingernails.;
, Brush on a layer of a base coat nail polish if you have one and want to help strengthen your nails and the final polish.










Applying a base coat is not necessary and should not affect the outcome of the magnetic polish, but it may help to strengthen your nails, protect them from staining, and make the main polish last longer.Base coat polish typically comes in clear or light shades that are designed to not affect the color of the main polish when applied.

, Shop for a magnetic nail polish that you would like to try. Note both the color and the design of the magnet included.










Pay attention to the magnet, which is typically built into the cap of the nail polish. You will see strips of metal that create designs such as parallel lines, a star, chevrons, or curves. See if the bottle shows an image of the final product, or find one online, to help you decide which you’d like to try.
Keep in mind that magnetic nail polish typically runs from about $3-15 US dollars from most retail and online stores. Popular brands like Sally Hansen, Essie, Nails Inc., and Layla all carry magnetic nail polish varieties.

, Use the magnetic nail polish to apply the first coat to each of your nails.










Don’t use the magnet at this time. The first coat simply helps even out the color so that you can perform the magnetization on the second coat.
Have a friend apply nail polish on your dominant hand or on both hands if you aren’t used to doing so.
Let the first coat dry before applying further polish.

, Use a larger amount of nail polish than you might normally to coat the surface of a nail before you use the magnet on it.










Apply more polish than you might on a typical coat, but don’t allow the polish to pool or drip on or off your nail.
It’s important to apply a thick coat that remains wet when you use the magnet, as it will create a more dramatic effect on the pattern of the polish., Hold the magnet provided in the cap of your polish over the nail that you just painted for 10-15 seconds, without touching it to the surface of the nail.








Use the magnet immediately on the nail before painting the others. Simply hover over the nail and do not touch the magnet to the surface of the nail at all.
Keep both the finger of your painted nail and the hand holding the magnet as still as possible for this process.
Some magnetic nail polish will come with a small ridge that helps you balance the magnetic cap against your cuticle or finger; otherwise, you will simply have to have a steady hand to hold it as still and as close as you can to the nail without making contact.
You will see that the magnet creates a pattern in the polish color, due to the iron shavings in the polish moving in the presence of a magnetic field., Keep applying a thick coat of polish then holding the magnet over it for 10-15 seconds, one nail at a time, on all ten nails.


Try to keep the magnet level and applied in the same way to each nail for a uniform look, unless of course you want to have some variation between the nails.
Feel free to experiment on how much polish you use, how long you hold the magnet over your nails, and how closely you hold the magnet. See if these factors create different final effects on the pattern.
Try turning the magnet at different angles to create a different shape or pattern on the nail. A magnet with a pattern of horizontal lines, for example, can easily be turned at an angle to create diagonal lines on the nail if you wish.

, Allow the magnetic polish to dry completely before applying a topcoat or doing too much activity with the hands, which could damage the polish.










The magnetic polish may take longer to dry than other nail polish, as you used a thicker second coat than you might normally. Wait twice as long as you would normally to apply a topcoat or perform other activities.Don’t apply a third coat of the magnetic polish, as it will obscure the pattern created on the second coat. Using the magnet again on a third coat will likely create uneven results or build up too much polish on the nails.

, Use a clear topcoat polish only after the magnetic polish has dried completely.










While not necessary, a topcoat can help the polish last longer by preventing chipping, nicks, or smearing.
Note that some topcoats (like China Glaze Fast Forward) may actually disturb the design of the magnetic polish, so buy and use topcoats with caution., Take your magnetic nail polish off with nail polish remover once it becomes chipped, damaged, or simply unwanted.


Use the same nail polish remover and cotton balls, cotton pads, or other materials that you’d use to remove regular polish. It may take more material and time to remove the thicker magnetic nail polish.
You may want to have remover and cotton on hand when you are first attempting application of the magnetic polish, as you may need to remove it from a nail if you mess up before starting again.

Fill a bowl with warm water.,
Soak your hands for several minutes.,
Scrub your nails with a brush.,
Clean under your nails.,
Rinse your hands with warm water and pat dry.,
Clip your nails.,
Apply a cuticle remover.,
Push back your cuticles.,
Smooth the edge of each nail with a file.,
Buff the nails until they’re smooth.,
Massage hand cream into the hands.",How to Perform a Male Manicure," For the manicure, you’ll need a large bowl. Ideally, it should be large enough that both hands can fit inside at the same time. Add enough warm water to the bowl to cover the hands.You don’t need to heat the water on the stove. It should be comfortably warm to soak your hands in, so it’s fine to take it straight from the sink.;
, Once the bowl is full of water, submerge both hands. Allow the hands to soak for approximately 10 minutes so the skin and nails both have time to soften.If your bowl isn’t large enough to soak both hands at once, it’s best to use two smaller bowls so you can still soak your hands at the same time.
If you have to soak the hands separately, the water will likely cool by the time you’re ready to soak the second hand. Dump out the old water, and refill it with warm water.
You can skip soaking your hands if you take a warm shower just before you do the manicure.

, When you’re finished soaking your hands, pat them dry with a clean towel so they’re not dripping. Next, use a nail brush to gently scrub the nails and surrounding skin to remove any dirt, grime, or loose skin.Be sure to choose a soft nail brush that won’t be too rough on the skin and nails.

, It’s also important to clean under the nails. Use a metal manicure stick or wooden orange stick to gently remove any dirt or grime that may be underneath the nails.It’s best not to use the pointed end of the manicure or orange stick when you’re cleaning your nails because you may hurt yourself. The slanted, rounded side usually works best.

, After brushing your nails and cleaning underneath them, wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap. Pat your hands dry with a clean towel.Use an antibacterial soap that’s meant for the hands so you don’t dry out your skin.

, With a pair of nail clippers, trim your nails to your desired length. Keep the shape square because trying to round the nails may cause ingrown nails.Make sure to use a good quality pair of clippers. A stainless steel pair is the best option, but check the feel of the pair too to ensure that there’s no risk of your thumb slipping off when you’re clipping.Don’t trim your nails too short. That can expose the nail bed at the tip of your finger, which may remain sore until the nail grows back.

, The cuticle is the thin band of dead skin that grows up over the bottom of the nail. To get rid of it, rub a small amount of liquid cuticle remover over the bottom of all of your nails to soften the skin and make it easier to remove.You usually have to allow the cuticle remover to sit on the cuticle for 30 seconds to 1 minute for the skin to be properly softened. Consult the package instructions to be sure.
You can purchase cuticle remover at a drugstore or beauty supply store.

, Once the cuticle remover has had a chance to soften the skin, use a metal cuticle pusher or wooden orange stick to remove the cuticles. Some of the cuticles will easily wipe away, but you’ll need to gently push more stubborn ones back.Never cut, trim, or snip your cuticles. They can easily become infected.

, While clipping your nails can get them to the right length, it usually leaves them with an rough, uneven edge. Use a nail file or a nail block to gently file the edge of your nails so they’re soft and smooth.It typically takes only a couple of strokes to file the edge of your nails.
File your nails in the same direction rather than going back and forth. That helps round out the shape of your nails for a neater look.

, Nails can develop ridges that give them an uneven surface. Use a sponge buffing block to gently buff your nails so they’re smooth and even.Pay attention to the instructions that come with your buffing block. One side is typically meant for buffing away ridges and smoothing the nails while another is meant for buffing shine into the nails. Use the proper side for your desired effect.
You can buff your nails to give them a subtle shine that’s not as obvious as a shiny topcoat. However, some men don’t like the shiny look so be careful when buffing.

, When your nails are properly filed and buffed, moisturize your hands, nails, and cuticles by applying a hydrating hand cream. Rub it into your hands in a circular motion until it’s completely absorbed.Massaging the hand cream into your skin also helps boost circulation to your fingers and hands.

If you’re interested in taking this trend into the colder weather with you, look for versions constructed from heavier fabrics. You can find thick, wool sweaters that fall off the shoulders, and you can also find versions in winter-friendly fabrics like velvet and poplin., One of the great things about off the shoulder tops is that they allow you to show a bit of skin while still being able to cover your arms, stomach, chest, and back. If you’re wearing this style in the cold, look for versions with long sleeves. Not only will you stay warm while still baring your shoulders, but you’ll also look appropriately dressed for the season.


You’ve probably seen those people shivering in winter weather in clothing that seems wildly unsuitable for the weather. No matter how great your outfit is, no one will care if you look frozen and out of place!

, There are a lot of off the shoulder tops that slide all over the place whenever you move your arms. That may be fine when it’s warmer out, but it will quickly get irritating if you’re trying to layer it in the winter.

These tops reveal the shoulders just like off the shoulder tops, but they also have normal straps, like a tank top. In other words, they basically have cut outs on the shoulders and normal straps to hold your top in place. This is a great option for anyone looking to show a bit of skin while still having a bit more structure., Just because these shirts have a unique cut doesn’t mean you can’t layer them with your cold weather staples. A crisp, form fitting off the shoulder top looks polished and trendy with a tailored blazer, leaving your collarbones and shoulders slightly exposed. Slip a comfy cardigan over an off the shoulder top to stay warm and cozy while flaunting a bit of skin.


Even though adding a jacket will cover up your shoulders, you will still be able to show the unique neckline of these tops.

Not only are they comfortable and convenient, but they made you look fashion-forward and sophisticated at the same time.Win win!

, You may get too chilly with your shoulders, upper chest, and neck all exposed. If that’s the case, add a big, warm scarf to your ensemble. If you’re dressing up or aiming to look a bit more elegant, a fur stole or shawl can totally transform your outfit. Depending on the option you choose, you can still show off your shoulders or the shirt’s neckline while bundling up., This might sound like it will ruin the effect of an off the shoulder top, but it can look very nice. While you won’t be showing as much skin, you can still show off the unique neckline of an off the shoulder top.Try pairing a structured off the shoulder blouse with a lacy or frilly shirt underneath for a cool contrast. You can add a basic t-shirt or tank top under a patterned or plunging off the shoulder top to keep the focus on the top.Try pairing your tops with pieces you already have in your closet, and you might be surprised what you end up liking!

Swap out your fabrics.,
Choose clothes with winter cuts.,
Consider your current wardrobe.,
Include a variety of items.,
Look for different shades of white and cream.,
Choose different textures.",How to Wear Winter Whites1," If you live in a region that experiences cold winters, you'll need to remove and store lighter fabrics. Remove any linens or light cotton clothing items. For winter-appropriate white clothing, look for fabrics that are heavy, soft, and warm. Good choices include:Wool
Cashmere
Heavy cable knits;
, To create a comfortable and cozy winter white look, you'll need pieces of clothing that do a good job of keeping you warm. Go through your wardrobe and remove any items that are short-sleeved or expose a lot of skin. Instead, choose items that will wrap around you and lock in heat.

For example, look for insulated blazers in whites or creams. Try oversized sweaters or cardigans and even pick up turtlenecks.

, If you're going into the new winter season, it's a good idea to take stock of what you already have in your wardrobe. Chances are, you'll need to store items that are in unseasonable fabrics or styles. Look at what remains and ask yourself how often you wear each item. This will give you a sense of what you need to replace.

For example, if you're often on the go and usually wear comfortable slacks with layered tops, ensure that you have a few pairs of pants in winter white colors. You should also store any of the tops that are sleeveless or too bright.

, Since so much of a winter white look depends on mixing different items of clothing, it's important to fill your wardrobe with a number of winter white items. Keep in mind that you don't need to buy everything new. You can often pick up great vintage styles at thrift stores. Your wardrobe should have winter white:Blouses or button-down shirts made of heavy materials (like flannel)
Sweaters or cardigans
Jackets or coats
Jeans or slacks
Skirts (that you can pair with thick stockings for warmth)

, Avoid simply choosing items that are pure white. Wearing pure white is difficult because it will make you look one-dimensional. Instead, choose clothes that are varying shades of white and even cream. Cream can soften a look and add interest. You can also look for clothing items in these colors:Gray
Camel
Tan
Blush

, You won't want your winter white look to match too much or look forced. To create a natural style, you'll need different textures. This will also help break up the pieces, if you're wearing all one shade of white. Try to include faux-fur, ribbed fabrics, heavy fabrics, and billowy silks that you can layer.Avoid cotton or linen fabrics since these can wrinkle easily. They're also lighter fabrics which are usually reserved for spring or summer wardrobes.

Maintain your manicure.",How to Do a Dip Powder Manicure," If you have polish on your nails, remove it with non-acetone nail polish remover on a lint-free pad. Use a cuticle pusher to gently nudge your cuticles slightly back. Gently remove any excess cuticle sticking up with a cuticle trimmer or scraper.








This will allow new nail growth to show so that your manicure will last longer before needing a fill.;
, Whether natural, acrylic or gel, smooth the surfaces of your nail manually with a nail file. Use a 180 grit file or block, or a natural nail stone. Brush away the grit from filing with a nail brush or makeup powder brush.








Pay extra attention to buffing the grooves and the cuticle area.

, Examine the sides of your nails for any loose or damaged edges. Also look for any lifting if you have a previous dip manicure you’re filling. Use a coarse nail file (100 or 180 grit) on any such areas.








If you don’t already have tips on and you want to add them to lengthen your nails, trim your natural nails down to short length. Use the nail file to smooth the edges.

, Dampen a paper towel or lint-free pad with alcohol or nail sanitizer. You can use an antiseptic spray, or a sanitizer in a pourable container. Rub the moistened towel over your nails, and your fingers – from the closest knuckle to your cuticles, down towards your nails.








This cleans and dehydrates the surface of your nails to prepare them for a dip manicure. You don’t want to seal in any bacteria or grime.

, If you want to extend the length of your nails, find a tip for each nail that covers no greater than a third of your nail bed. Each tip should reach across the whole width of your nail, from nail groove to nail groove, without overlapping onto your skin.Coat the wells of the tips with tip resin. Hold each one gently but firmly to the tip of the nail at a 45 degree angle for twenty seconds.








If you can’t find a nail tip that is the right size, you can use a nail file to make slight adjustments so that it will fit securely.
Pinch the sides of the tips for a few seconds to adhere the tips to curvature of your nail edges. Try not to get resin on your fingers.

, File the edges of the tips all the way across. Buff the top surfaces of the tips to remove their shine. Then buff the nails all over.

, Apply it in small strokes, starting about 1/16” away from your cuticles. Spread it out so that it doesn’t well up near the cuticle area.Let it sit for one minute.Follow the steps in this method for each nail, one at a time.








, Move slowly, and apply it evenly.Resin should be dotted on with the belly of the brush applicator, rather than applied in strokes like nail polish.








If you’re only doing a fill, and it has been two weeks since your last dip manicure, apply resin to your desired thickness – for instance, three to four coats. No follow-up with powder is necessary.If you’re doing a manicure to your natural nails or it has been three or more weeks since your last dip manicure, apply one coat of resin only at this point.

, Push your finger forward within the container and roll your finger gently. Keep your finger in the powder for five seconds. Remove your finger and tap the edge of the pot.Then, with your other hand, tap the finger you just dipped, to shake excess powder off your finger and back into the container. Once the nail is dry, use a nail brush to remove the rest of the extra powder over a paper towel.








Shake the closed container of powder well first. Open the container, then use a nail stick or pusher to mix the powder., Apply a layer of resin over the full nail, including the tips. Paint it on slowly and evenly. If you want to use colored powder, now’s the time to do it! Dip your finger into nail powder again, then remove any excess powder. Add a third and final application of resin.








You can repeat this step once more to achieve a slightly thicker and stronger manicure.

, Apply it in strokes as you would regular nail polish. Allow it to sit for five seconds on the nails. Apply a second coat, and allow that to sit for five seconds as well., Use a soft-grid file on the exposed edges and sides of the nails.







, Make sure it is a top coat meant for acrylic nails. Keep your fingers sedentary and allow your nails to air-dry for two minutes. Gently rub cuticle oil into the skin surrounding your fingernails.








Apply the top coat as you would normal nail polish.

, Make sure that your nails are completely dry first. Use warm water, hand soap and a nail brush. Make sure to get around and underneath the tips of your nails. Pat your nails dry with a towel.








, Follow tips to prolong the life of your manicure. Your manicure can last three to four weeks before needing a fill. However, you may notice new nail growth near the cuticle area and wish to do the fill as early as two weeks after your dip manicure.








If you apply colored polish on top of your manicure, don’t get it on your cuticles. This can cause chipping and lifting of the polish. Also, mix the polish by rolling it between your hands instead of shaking it, so that air bubbles don’t promote chipping.
If you use a fan to dry your nails, opt for cool air instead of warm air. Use a blow dryer on the cool setting.
Reapply a clear top coat every few days to deter chipping. Massage cuticle oil onto your nails every day, if possible.
Use mild soap to wash your hands instead of applying hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer is strong and dehydrating, and can eat away at your protective top coat.

Make sure that your ear warmer and clothes stay within the same family of tones. If you wear earth tones, make sure that your ear warmer is also earth toned.
If you like loud and fluorescent colors, make sure that you get an ear warmer that matches it.
Families of color include pastels, earth tones, or jeweled tones.
Another easy way to coordinate your colors is to look at a color wheel and find a complimentary color, or a color that lies as a direct opposite on the wheel.

Opposites on the color wheel include greens and pinks, yellows and violets, and reds and blues.

;
, Consider the look you are trying to embody and choose an ear warmer that goes along with it to keep your overall look cohesive.

If you're going for a casual or chic look, a knitted ear warmer in earth tones will work best., Ear warmers draw attention to your face and give you a more casual look and style. Put on subtle wintery makeup hues and keep your makeup as minimal as possible.Things like flashes of white highlights and minimal eyeliner will work best with an ear warmer., Wearing a scarf, beanie hat, or hood can help compliment your style when wearing ear warmers and will also give you better coverage over your head and neck.

, You've probably seen people modeling winter white suits in magazines or fashionable events. This is because it can be a very striking look. Choose a suit that is tailored to you and add interest by wearing a little bit of color. Avoid wearing a suit that doesn't fit you perfectly, since white will really show any imperfections. Look for a suit made from wool or an engineered textile blend which will keep you warm and wrinkle-free.An all-white jumpsuit can also streamline your look. Keep your accessories simple to keep you looking polished.

, Don't be afraid to introduce a sparkly accessory or clothing item to your look. This is a great way to add dimension to a mainly white outfit. Look for items that are metallic, gold, or silver. Look for fabrics that include a little shimmer or add a shiny accessory.For example, you could wear a metallic skirt along with an oversized cashmere sweater for a look that you can wear out to a fun social event.

, Since winter whites can be dramatic on their own, try to keep your makeup simple. Try using neutral blushes and eye shadows, but go for a classic red or burgundy lipstick. Tailor your makeup to your day, so your daytime makeup is more casual than an exciting look you might wear in the evening.You can wear a pinkish blush so that it looks like your cheeks are flushed from being out in the cold. The blush will really stand out with your winter white outfit.

Brush your hair.,
Put your hair in a bun or high ponytail.,
Stretch out your headband and put it around your neck.,
Pull your headband up.",How to Wear an Ear Warmer2," Brush your hair before putting on your ear warmer to remove any knots. Use your hands to fluff out your hair and to give it volume. If you have curly hair, you can use your hands instead of a brush so that it keeps its natural form. People with shorter hair can part their bangs on one side.


Longer hair or hair that tangles easily are styles that are the most prone to get messed up by wearing ear warmers.

, If you are wearing a headband-style ear warmer, putting your hair up in a bun will make it easier to fit the ear warmer over your head without messing up your hair. Use a hair tie or hair clip to give yourself a high ponytail or bun before you put on your headband ear warmer.

, Chips happen most frequently on the tops of your hand and toenails, where a lot of contact occurs. Use a nail clipper to remove the chipped area, then clip the rest of your nails to match.After all the nails have been clipped, apply top coat and polish to the tops of all the nails. This will seal in the manicure.
This is not a long term solution – once your nail chips or breaks, it’s only a matter of time before it chips or breaks again.
Try not to lose too much of the nail length or shape when clipping.

, There’s a reason accent nails are so popular – they’re a great way to hide polish problems. Rather than give yourself a whole new manicure when a nail gets chipped, use a glitter or metallic polish to paint over the whole nail.You can also try disguising the offending area by painting stripes or polka dots.
Try covering the damage with a nail sticker and some clear topcoat.

Most supplies can be purchased at a local makeup store or drug store. To do a salon style manicure, you will need the following:Nail polish, a base coat, and a top coat
Nail polish remover
Cotton balls
Q-tips
A bowl filled with warm water and moisturizing shower gel
A set of manicure tools that includes a cuticle pusher and cuticle blade
Cuticle moisturizer;
, Acetone nail polish removers tend to remove polish quicker. However, they also contain harsh chemicals that can wear down nails. You should opt for an acetone free polish remover, especially if you do your nails frequently. Check the ingredient list of any polish remover you use to make sure that it does not contain acetone., To start, you'll need to remove any previous polish. If you do not have old polish on your nails, you can skip this step. You should not soak you nails in remover, as this can be harsh on your nails. Instead, dab a cotton ball in remover and gently swab your nails until any leftover polish comes off., You should moisturize your cuticles before applying any polish. This can help your cuticles retain moisture, keeping your nails healthy.








Near the root of your nail, there is a small flap of skin known as a cuticle. Dab a small bit of moisturizer over this skin.
Gently massage the cream into your skin until the lumpy bits of cream dissolve into your skin.

, Take your bowl of warm water filled with shower gel. Place the tips of your fingers in the bowl. Allow them to soak for two minutes.You can use a clock to track time, but you may be able to gauge the two minute mark by just counting to 120 in your head.

, Take your cuticle pusher, which is a small wooden or plastic stick. You will use this to gently push each of your cuticles back so they merge with the skin in your fingers. Older cuticles will emerge from underneath the pushed back cuticles. Take your cuticle cutter and run the blade along the length of your cuticles to cut them off.








You want to take caution with this step. Be very gentle as you push your cuticles back and cut them. Use very slow motions. Forcefully cutting or pushing your cuticles could lead to an infection.Never neglect to soak your fingers before pushing back your cuticles. If your hands are slightly wet, the cuticles will move easier. This can also help prevent infection.

, If your nails are not in your desired size and shape, you should now cut and file them. You can use a set of nail clippers and a nail file to do so. You should also use a nail buffer to smooth out the tops of nails.Trim nails to your desired length. Then, take a file and file them into a good shape. Salon style manicures usually file nails into a square shape or round out the edges of nails. To create a squared look, file each nail flat across the top and then soften the edges slightly so they aren't too sharp. For a rounded look, file the tips of your nails into a soft curve. Be sure to file your nails in one direction only. Start at one edge and work your way over to the other.
Avoid using metallic files, as these can be too harsh. Opt for an emery board or crystal nail file.
Gently rub your nail buffer over the tops of your nails until they have a smooth, even appearance. Do not buffer for too long, however. If nails become too smooth, polish may slide off.

, A base coat will protect your nails from becoming tinted by polish. It will also make the nail polish come on smoother. Add one layer of base coat to your nails.








Use about three strokes to cover your nails in base coat. If there are any lumps or uneven patches, use a few shorter strokes to smooth out these bumps.
For best results, you should let nails air dry.However, as you're adding multiple layers, this can be time consuming. You can dry your nails with a hairdryer, but make sure to set it to low heat. If you set it to high or medium heat, you could end up burning your fingers.

, You'll want to add nail polish in layers for best results. Start with one thin layer of polish. Do not worry if the polish looks a little light. It will become darker when you add the second layer. As with the base coat, apply with two to three strokes. If you notice any uneven patches, use shorter strokes to smooth out the polish.The drying procedure is the same as the base coat. Air drying works best, but you can use a blow dryer set to low to dry your nails.

, Use two to three strokes to cover your nails in a second coat. If you need to smooth out any lines or bubbles, use a few shorter strokes to do so. This should make your nail polish darker and smoother. You can air dry your nails or use a blow dryer set to low., A top coat will protect your polish, allowing it to last up to two weeks. It will also keep your nails looking clearer and smoother. Apply a top coat the same way you applied the other layers. Work extra hard to get the top coat looking smooth, as this is the last polish you'll be applying.







, Your nails will look smoother and shinier if you allow them to air dry after adding the final coat. It can take up to an hour for nails to dry completely, so avoid touching or handling anything until your nails have dried.Find something to do to distract yourself. Turn on a TV show you like or listen to some music.

, Even when you work slowly and carefully, a small bit of nail polish may spill onto the skin around your nails. If you want your manicure to look professional, dab a q-tip in nail polish. Then, take the q-tip and rub it along the skin of your nails to remove any rough edges or spilled polish.








Go slowly here. You do not want to accidentally rub your nails themselves, as this will remove the polish.

, Products used in nail polish can be harsh on your nails. It's a good idea to add another layer of cuticle moisturizer once you've finished doing your nails.








Remember, to apply cuticle moisturizer you dab moisturizer on each of your cuticles. Then, rub the moisturizer into your skin.

There are different types of base coats available such as quick-drying formulas, sensitive formulas, hardening formulas, and more.Hardening formulas are formulated specifically for weak and brittle nails to protect them from breaking. They are often infused with vitamins and keratin to help you achieve stronger, healthier nails.Quick-drying formulas are perfect for individuals on the go and who don’t have a lot of time to wait for each coat of polish to dry thoroughly.
Sensitive formulas are great for those with sensitive skin and do not want to risk any reactions to the polish.

, Once the base coat has dried, applied your desired color or colors to the nails. If the color isn’t pigmented enough with the first layer, apply a second layer. Allow a bit of time between coats for the nail polish to dry.

, Place your nails in front of a fan or use a nail drier to help speed the drying process. Cold temperatures help nails dry faster--you can try blow drying your nails with the cold setting to help them dry. Another method would be to use ice water to harden nails.After the polish has been applied, wait at least one minute to allow the polish to set and harden a bit.
Dip your nails in a bowl of cold or ice water for approximately two minutes to help the nails dry.

, Select your desired pattern from one of the stamping plates. Paint over the design with polish. It is best to use a highly pigmented, thicker polish for this.


A good rule of thumb is to use a polish that will cover the nail with one coat and will not be sheer.
Some kits come with a special stamping polish. This polish is simply a thicker polish than ordinary formulas. You can choose whether or not you would like to use this polish, based on your preference., Hold the scraper at a 45 degree angle to the stamping plate. Firmly and swiftly scrape the excess polish away, until you can clearly see the design. Wipe the scraper on a paper towel to remove the nail polish. If it did not scrape away all of the excess polish the first time, scrape the stamping plate again., Pick up your stamper and roll it over the design on the plate, starting from one side of the stamper and rolling it to the other side. You should be able to clearly see the design on the surface of the stamper. Most of the polish should have been picked up from the stamping plate.

, With the polish covering the surface of the stamper in the chosen design, roll the stamper over the nail, moving from one side to the other. Press down firmly but not so firmly that the design gets smudged. Lift the stamper away from the nail and ensure that the design has imprinted on the nail. If not, you may need to try again or start over by removing all of the polish with nail polish remover and a cotton ball.

, When you have finished stamping the design on your nail, wait a minute or two for the polish to set and harden a bit. Coat the polish with a clear top coat to protect the design and to make the nail polish last longer. A top coat will ensure that the nail stays somewhat protected from daily wear and tear.

Clip only a small amount of the nail at a time. Otherwise, you may end up trimming too much.

, Next, you will need to file down any rough edges left on the nail. Use a nail file to smooth out ridges and to start to shape the nail.There are some important things to keep in mind when you file nails. Make sure that you:Start with a fine nail file. Nail files have grits like sandpaper, so choosing a nail file with a high number grit will mean that it is finer. A lower number grit nail file will have a coarser edge. It is best to start with a high grit or fine nail file to avoid tearing or damaging your nails.
File your nails in one motion. Do not use a sawing motion to file your nails. Instead, place the file against one edge of the nail, move it in a swift forward motion, and then remove it from the nail and start over.
Hold the edge of the nail file flat against the edge of your nail. If you angle the file, then this can thin out the nail’s tip and weaken it.

, After you are done filing, use a nail buffer to smooth out the tops of the nails. This will improve the texture of the nails and make it easier to apply and even coat of nail polish.


Use a back and forth motion to buff your nails.
Some nail buffers also include a shine edge that you can use to give nails a natural shine after you finish buffing them.
Buffing your nails is a good nail care practice as long as you do not do it too often. Buff your nails no more than once per week."
