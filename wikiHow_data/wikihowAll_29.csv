Be patient.,
Protect your nail.,
Wear shoes that fit.,
Consider getting an acrylic overlay.",How to Help a Toenail Grow Back Quickly1," You may be able to somewhat speed your nail growth with soaks and vitamins, but you'll still need to wait for the nail to restore itself. If you stub your toe and the toenail looks funky, don't worry: it will grow back. It just takes time! Don't disturb the nail, and don't chip at it. It may be tempting to pull off unneeded bits of nail – but you shouldn't mess with it unless it's a hangnail or an ingrown toenail.;
, If the skin underneath your nail is exposed, it's a good idea to put on a band-aid during the day and let it breath during nighttime. The band-aid can help prevent infection, and it may keep the sensitive skin from rubbing painfully against socks and shoes.

, If you try to wear shoes that are too small (especially high heels), you can easily bruise your toenails. Your toes will only have a small space to move during a long period of time, which can slow the process of regrowing the nail.


Also refrain from making sudden stops. When you're done running, for instance, steadily slow to a walk so that you don't pitch forward, and your toes don't hit the tips of your shoes.

, If you can't wait, visit a nail tech and have them do an acrylic overlay on your broken toenail (which usually costs no more than $3-$5). This is similar to an acrylic fingernail – there must be at least a small amount of toenail for the acrylic to adhere to. While this won't make your real nail grow any faster, it will camouflage the broken toenail while it grows back. You can polish and pedicure this acrylic overlay just like a normal toenail, and nobody will know the difference. If you do decide to go with an acrylic overlay, make sure to remind your nail technician that it's there before they perform any services on you!

Choose a nail polish remover.,
Choose a nail polish remover applicator.,
Set up an area for your nail polish removal.,
Saturate your applicator with nail polish remover.,
Rub the applicator on your nails.,
Wash your hands.",How to Remove Old Nail Polish1," Go to the drugstore or beauty store and buy a bottle of nail polish remover. It's usually in the cosmetic section near the selection of nail polish and other nail products. One bottle contains enough nail polish remover to remove plenty of manicures' worth of polish.





Nail polish remover usually comes in a plastic bottle with a screw cap, but you can also buy it in tubs that have sponges inside, where you submerge your fingers to take off the polish.
The main ingredient in nail polish remover is usually acetone, and some removers are enhanced with aloe and other natural ingredients meant to soften your skin while you remove the polish.;
, Nail polish remover needs to be applied and rubbed onto your nails using an applicator to be effective. Some applicators are better than others are for different types of manicures. Consider these options:





Cotton balls are great all-purpose applicators, especially for removing just a coat or two of regular nail polish.
If you have two or more coats of thick nail polish, you might want to use paper towels instead. The relatively rough surface of the towels helps scrape off the nail polish.
Cotton swabs are helpful for removing nail polish from the edges of your nails and your cuticles.

, Spread a newspaper or paper towel on a table or countertop. Set out your nail polish remover and cotton balls, paper towels or cotton swabs.





Removing nail polish may get messy, so it's best to do it in the bathroom or another area without linens and surfaces that could get ruined by a stray splash of nail polish. #*Choose a room with good lighting so you will be able to see your nails clearly.

, Unscrew the nail polish remover cap, place the applicator over the opening, and invert the bottle to soak it. Alternatively, you could pour the nail polish remover into a bowl and dip the cotton ball or paper towel into the solution.




, Using a circular motion, wipe your nails until the old nail polish comes off. Continue until you've removed the polish from all your nails.





You may need to use a new applicator every few nails, especially if you have more than one layer of nail polish to remove.
If you're having trouble taking off your nail polish with a cotton ball, try switching to paper towel.

, Nail polish remover is made with strong chemicals that can dry out your hands, so it's best to wash off the residue when you're through.

If you find there are dried-on blobs of polish that stubbornly resist removal, add nail polish thinner to cover, then soak for about five minutes. Then use a toothpick to pick off the stuck-on polish.

, Add the lid on tightly. Shake this around for about a minute, to lift off any remains and pick up the last of the nail polish. This will also clean the brush. Tip into the container, then dispose of the container properly.

, Then rinse out with soapy water.

, Once dried, it's ready for repurposing.

, Allow to fully dry before reusing.


Only use non-toxic cleaners on the brush if the brush is to be reused on your body, although even if it's just for craft use, non-toxic is a good idea.
If you don't need the brush but you do need the lid, such as for one of the storage options, simply snap the brush off at the highest point possible and dispose of it.

Dab the nail with olive oil, coconut oil, or flaxseed oil.,
Soak your feet in green tea.,
Use orange juice.,
Try taking a biotin supplement.",How to Help a Toenail Grow Back Quickly2," This can help moisturize the skin so that the area heals more quickly. Dip a cotton swab in the oil, then dab it against the part of your toenail that has grown out. Alternately, fill a small bowl with olive/coconut/flaxseed oil, then soak your toe in the oil for 10-15 minutes. Be aware that this latter method may not use the oil as efficiently.


Wear open-toed shoes (or no shoes) for an hour after application, or until the oil has soaked into the skin. The effect will be stronger if you give your skin time to absorb the moisture.

, First, fill a large bowl with warm (comfortable, not hot) water. Add 1-3 green tea bags, and let the tea steep for at least five minutes. Place the bowl on the floor in front of a comfortable chair within reach of your feet. Sit in the chair, make yourself comfortable, and then place your feet in the bowl. Sit for about fifteen minutes—or until the water cools down—before taking your feet out.


Consider keeping a towel nearby to dry your feet afterward.
Repeat every 2-3 days while your nail is growing back. The green tea should soothe your skin and stimulate your nail growth.

, Soak your nails in fresh orange juice for 10 minutes each day. Afterward, rinse your nails off with warm water, pat dry, and apply moisturizer. Repeat this process once a day until your nail has grown back.

, Hair and nails may grow much more quickly when you take biotin as a dietary supplement. Indeed, weak and slow-growing nails are often linked to a biotin deficiency. You can also increase your daily biotin levels by eating gelatin, which is a natural source.


Beware: gelatin and supplements containing gelatin are known to increase urine oxalates, which might increase the risk of kidney stones in some people.

Buy pure acetone.,
Saturate a cotton ball in acetone.,
Affix the cotton ball to your fingernail.,
Let your nails soak in acetone.,
Remove the cotton balls and take off the polish.,
Wash your hands.",How to Remove Old Nail Polish2," Some nail polish, such as glitter or gel nail polish, can be difficult to remove using the common rub-away method. In these cases pure acetone, the chemical that causes the paint to come off, is in order. Acetone is available at drugstores in the same section where nail polish remover is sold.




, Either place the cotton ball over the opening of the acetone bottle and invert it, or pour some acetone into a bowl and dip the cotton ball into it.




, Place it directly over your fingernail and use a piece of tin foil to hold it in place. Repeat with your remaining fingers until each one is covered with an acetone-soaked cotton ball.





If you don't have tinfoil handy, you can use a small rubber band to hold the cotton balls in place.









Have a partner help you if it's difficult to secure the cotton balls without causing them to fall off your fingers.

, Wait ten minutes for the acetone to work on the nail polish before you check to see if the method is working. Pull back one of the cotton balls and use a different cotton ball to swipe at your nail. If the nail polish wipes off onto the cotton ball, your nails are ready. If it sticks, let your nails soak for another ten minutes.




, One at a time, remove the cotton balls from each finger and wipe away the loosened nail polish with a second acetone-soaked cotton ball. The nail polish should easily wipe away. Repeat until all the cotton balls have been removed and the polish is completely gone.




, Rinse away traces of the acetone with warm, soapy water, then moisturize your hands to combat the acetone's drying effect.

Clean up.,
Finished.

",How to Manicure Short Nails2," Any color can look good on short nails, but the color you choose will depend on the look you are trying to achieve.


If you have fair skin try painting your nails dark reds and purples, as the contrast will make your nails more striking. Bright pinks and oranges look fantastic with darker skin tones.
However, if you want to make your short nails appear longer, you should stick to pale nude tones. Choose a nude that is one shade lighter than your natural skin tone.

, Before you apply the color, apply a clear base coat. This will help your manicure to look smoother and last longer. It will also stop the colored polish from staining your nails.


There are many types of base coats available -- some will even strengthen your nails, while others will fill in any bumps or ridges.

, Once the base coat is dry, paint your nails your desired color. Keep the first coat nice and thin -- this will help it to dry faster and prevent smudging.


The best technique for painting your nails is to apply a dot of paint to the bottom center of each nail, make one stroke down the center of the nail, all the way to the tip, then two more strokes on either side of the middle one.
Another tip to make short nails appear longer is to avoid painting all the way to the edge of the nail on both sides -- leave a slight gap instead. This will make your nails appear thinner and longer.
Don't worry too much if you get polish on your fingers, you can clean it up afterwards.

, Once the first coat of polish is dry, apply a second one using the same technique. This will really help to bring out the color.

, Use a clear top coat to seal the color. Make sure to swipe the brush along the top of the nails, as this will prevent the polish from chipping.

, Use a cotton bud dipped in nail polish remover to carefully clean up any excess polish from around the edges of your nails and on your fingertips.

You might have to spend a little money to accumulate everything you need, but over time doing your own nails is much less expensive than getting manicures. Here's what you need:


Nail trimmers
Nail file
Polish remover
Cotton balls
Buffer
Cuticle cream
Hand lotion
Orange stick;
, If you have an old, chipped coat of polish still clinging to your nails, use the nail polish remover and a cotton ball to take it off. You'll want to start with a fresh, clean slate.








, Soaking your nails softens them and makes them easier to trim. It also makes your cuticles more supple and easier to push back. Soak for about five minutes, until your nails are pliable, then dry them on a towel.








, Use nail trimmers to create the nail shape you want, either squared off or rounded. Don't trim too short; you want to leave a white crescent on each nail. This extra length protects your nail beds and looks pretty, too. Use a nail file to neaten the edges and smooth out the shape of your nails.








When you're using a nail file, move it in one direction across the tip of your nail. Don't scrape it back and forth, since this damages your nail fibers.
Avoid using a file to make your nails shorter; always start with a nail trimmer, then use the file just for shaping purposes.
Do not round the corners down into the sides of the nail bed, because this can cause ingrown nails, especially on the big toes.

, Dry your nails and apply a cuticle cream. Let the cream soak in for about three minutes, then use an orange stick (or cuticle pusher) to gently push back the cuticles, the skin growing at the base of your nail. This makes the shape of your nails prettier and prepares them for an even coat of polish. Wipe off the cuticle cream when you're finished.








Never force your cuticles back, and never trim them. Cuticles are there to prevent infection, and cutting them will leave your fingers prone to getting red and sore.
If you don't have an orange stick, try using a binder clip or another item with a flat edge. Just make sure not to use anything sharp.

, Use the rough side of your nail buffer to buff your nails, gently running it across the surface of your nails in one direction. Next switch to the medium-grade side and repeat the process. Finish buffing with the smoothest, finest side to add sheen to your nails. Don't grind down the surface of your nails too much. You don't want to thin out your nails. The goal with buffing is just to create a smooth, shiny surface.








, This cleanses your nails and moisturizes the skin on your fingers and hands. If you don't want to paint your nails, your manicure is complete. If you do, wipe the surfaces of your nails with cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover to get rid of excess lotion before you begin.








, While all you really need to paint your nails is a bottle of polish, your nails will look more beautiful if you use a few extra products to ensure a neat, even manicure. Here's what you need:


Clear base coat
Nail polish
Clear top coat
Cotton swabs

, This will be a clear polish or hardener that protects the nail and helps the manicure last longer. Let the base coat dry completely before moving on. Some base coats are a little tacky, making it easier for the colorful polish to stick.








, Roll the bottle between your hands for a few seconds to warm it up and mix the polish. Open the bottle and dip the brush into the pain, then swirl it against the rim to remove excess polish. To paint nails evenly, start with a vertical stripe down the center of the nail, then a stripe on either side. Allow the polish to completely dry.








Try to paint all the way to the edge of the nails without getting polish on your skin.
It helps to angle the brush forward and press gently to make the bristles spread out.
If you get polish on your skin, use a cotton swab to wipe it off while it's still wet.

, This will ensure that the color looks rich and even. After the first coat is completely dry, apply a second in the same manner: do a stripe down the center of each nail, then stripes on either side. Again, let it completely dry.








, This seals in the polish and adds a little extra shine. Top coat will help your nails stay beautiful for several extra days before chipping. Once your top coat is dry, the manicure is complete.








, Once you get the hang of painting your nails, you might want to try your hand at nail art. You could keep it simple by doing a simple two-tone look, or create mini works of art by using extra colors to paint detailed designs. Here are a few ideas:








Do a French manicure

Do ombre nails

Create a marble effect

Paint flowers on your nails
Paint pandas on your nails

, This bad habit damages and weakens your nails, making it a lot harder to keep them looking beautiful. Your nails don't have the chance to grow long and strong when you chew on them, so find another way to occupy your mouth and leave your nails alone.







, Acetone is a paint remover to that takes the polish right off, but it can also be damaging to nails. If your nails are brittle and dry, acetone can even cause them to break. Look for acetone-free nail polish remover; it doesn't take the polish off quite as quickly, but it's a lot better for your nails.







, Strong cleansers and other chemicals are hard on nails and skin. When you're using cleaning solutions, always wear gloves to protect your hands. This is especially necessary if you're using bleach and other strong chemicals to clean.









Consider switching out harsh household cleaners for natural substances that aren't damaging to nails. For example, a 50/50 white vinegar water solution makes a great everyday cleanser for most surfaces.
You should also protect your hands when you're doing the dishes. Dish soap is drying, so wear rubber gloves to keep your hands from getting soapy.

, If you tend to use your nails in place of scissors, clippers and knives, your nails probably tend to break pretty frequently. To keep them beautiful and healthy, don't use them in situations where they might rip off or get chipped. It's better to use the right tool for the job than to put unnecessary strain on your nails.








, Nail polish, gels, and especially acrylics can be hard on nails. These substances contain chemicals, and they're difficult to remove without using even more chemicals. Over time your nails will weaken and possibly even turn yellow unless you give them a break sometimes. Try going at least a week out of each month without applying polish, gels or acrylics.

UV-gel polish is easier to work with, but it is still possible to get a nice finish on non-UV gel polish and regular nail polish. It will take more work, however.
Consider covering the skin around your nails with some white school glue or liquid latex to make clean-up easier.

, Don't let the top coat dry all the way, however. You want it to feel rubbery, but not sticky or tacky.

A quick-dry top coat is recommended.
Remember to extend the top coat down past the tip.

Finish off with a layer of top coat.",How to Paint Rose Nails," You can get most of the supplies at a beauty store or craft store. If you can't find anything, you can also order supplies online. You will need the following:Four nail art brushesA light shade of nail polish for your base, like a white or pastel color
Red and light red nail polish
Green and light green nail polish;
, To start, take your base color. Paint your nails as you normally would in a coat of base color. If your base color is very faint, add a second layer. Allow your nails to dry before proceeding.








How long your nails take to dry completely depends on the type of polish. However, most nail polishes take between one to two hours to dry completely., Once your base coat is dry, you can add the bare outlines of the roses. Take one of your nail art brushes. Dip it in the darker shade of red.Paint several splotches on each of your nails. Each nail can probably comfortably fit two to three roses. Remember, you will be adding leaves later on, so leave some space between splotches.
Your splotches should be somewhat flower shaped. Do not make perfect circled. Add bubbled edges, like the petals of a rose.

, You will now start adding the layers to the inside of your roses. To begin, you will start roughly in the center of each splotch. Use a nail art brush and dip it in the lighter shade of red. Draw two semi-circles, the curved ends facing each other. Have the semi-circles intersect slightly.








The shape should look something like a rough outline of a yin-yang symbol.

, From here, you will add the rest of the petals. Draw semi-circles around the ones in the center, moving outward until you reach the ends of each splotch.








Try to draw the semi-circles in a pattern that resembles the petals of a rose.
Don't worry too much if your semi-circles are not perfect or symmetric. The petals of a rose are rarely perfectly even. You just want to get a shape that resembles a rose.
When you're done, your splotches should look like roses.

, You want the colors to smear together slightly so the roses do not look uneven. You can achieve this by adding a single layer of top coat while your roses are still slightly wet. It will give the roses a nice, soft look.







, Take another nail art brush and dip it in your darker green shade. Draw two leaves stemming from either side of each rose. The leaves should look something like small wings stemming from your roses.








If you're short on space, it's okay to have some leaves overlap with other roses. This can give your design a cute, layered look.

, Dip another nail brush in the lighter shade of green. You will use this to highlight your leaves, giving them a slightly more complex appearance.Draw a small line through the center of each leaf. Start at the part of the leaf that meets with the rose.
Draw your line towards the tip of the leaf, stopping slightly before the tip.

, When your design is finished, let it dry for a few minutes. You should dry it just enough that it does not smear easily. Top off the designed with a single layer of top coat. This will help your roses stay intact longer.

After applying the second coat of paint, give your nails an additional hour to dry.
Run your fingers under cold water to accelerate the drying process.

, Remove one to three pieces of tape from the dispenser (pieces should be roughly half the size of your middle finger). Attach the corner of one piece of tape to the bottom of your nail, then angle the other two pieces of tape so they make a point at the tip of your nail. Alternatively, you can cut a heart shape out of a single piece of tape. 








If you look at your nail, the space not covered by tape should form an upside down heart.
If the tape doesn’t line up on your first attempt, un-stick it and try again.

, Use the pink or red nail polish you selected to fill in the blank space on your nail. Rip the tape off each nail as soon as you’re done painting the heart – otherwise, the polish will become sticky and hard to remove.

Give yourself a gold, purple, and green ombre.,
Accent one of your nails with nail beads.",How to Paint Nails for Mardi Gras2," If you are short on time, try painting all but one of your nails (such as your ring finger) with a glitter nail polish. Then, do a special design on your accent nail.








For example, you could do a chevron design on your accent nail, paint it a solid color and then add some decals, or use a nail wrap to add a complex design.

, You can divide your nails into two solid colors for a festive Mardi Gras nail look. To do this, you can either use tape or a nail art strip to divide your nails in half diagonally. Then, paint one half of all of your nails with one color, let it dry, and then paint the other half with the other color.








For example, you could paint your nails half purple and half green.
You could even use a gold nail polish liner pen to draw a line over the diagonal divide between the two colors.

, Ombre nails are popular and fairly easy to do. You can paint your nails green and purple and then use gold glitter nail polish for the ombre effect. All you need to create an ombre look at home is some nail polish and a makeup sponge.









Start by painting your nails with the solid nail polish color(s) you have chosen. Then, allow the polish to dry completely.
Next, use a makeup sponge to dab gold glitter nail polish onto the ends of your nails. Try to dab more glitter polish onto the ends of your nails to get the ombre effect.Use some nail polish remover on a cotton swab to remove any excess nail polish from your skin.

, Mardi Gras is known for its plastic bead necklaces in purple, green, and gold. You can nod to this with your nails by adhering some nail beads to one of your nails as an accent.








Paint your nails and allow the nail polish to dry for a few minutes. Use purple, green, or gold nail polish.
Then, apply a gel topcoat to all of your nails. However, do not wait for the topcoat to dry before applying the beads.
Apply the beads to the nail you want to accent while the gel topcoat is still wet. Try to arrange the beads in a row so they look like they are connected. Then, let the topcoat dry completely.

, This is necessary, even if you plan on leaving your nails their natural color. It will not only protect your nails, but help your polish last longer. Wait 2 minutes before moving on., You can use clear polish, a nude color, or any other color you'd like. If you plan on using a metallic color for your feather, consider using a flat color for the base. Wait 2 minutes between each coat, and 2 more minutes before moving on to the next step., Black or white are great choices, but you can also use silver, gold, copper, or bronze. For best results, use a color that contrasts with your base color. This will make the feather stand out more.

You can paint the feather on every nail, or you can paint it on an accent nail, typically the ring finger.

, You can angle it however you want; you can make it straight or curved. The thinner end of the line will be the tip of the feather, and the thicker end will be the base.

Consider having the base of the stem touch your cuticle. This will solidify the design.

, Start on the bottom of the stem and work your way towards the tip. Angle the lines upward. Make the lines longer towards the base of the feather, and shorter towards the tip. Use light, feathery strokes.For a lighter look, don't reload your brush; drag the nail polish from the stem outward.

, Again, make them shorter at the tip and longer at the bottom. Angle the lines towards the top of the feather., Shake a few flakes of large, chunky glitter onto a small dish. Use a dotter tool or a toothpick to pick up a flake. Place the flake against the feather's stem.

You will need to leave room for the ""eye.""

Try to give the stem a slight curve. This will make the feather look longer, wispier, and more peacock-like.
You can paint the feather on every nail, or you can paint it on an accent nail, typically the ring finger.

, Use copper or bronze nail polish for this., Use light, tapering strokes to paint small lines on both sides of the stem. Angle the lines upwards, towards the teardrop. Be sure to outline the teardrop as well.Leave spaces between the black lines. You will be adding more colors.

, Clean your striper brush using nail polish remover, then blot it dry. Paint more wispy, tapering lines to either side of your feather stem.

Pick up some shimmery green nail polish, and paint a bean-shaped dot on top of the blue one.You will have something that looks like an eye.

If you are having trouble, make a green dot first, then add a tiny light blue dot right at the bottom.

Get some holographic nail powder.,
Do your manicure as usual, starting with a basecoat and finishing with your favorite color.,
Apply a layer of non-wipable gel top coat, and wait until it gets rubbery, but not tacky.,
Gently tap on the powder, starting from the base of your nail, and working your way towards the top.,
Use a soft brush to dust off the excess powder.,
Apply one more layer of non-wipable top coat.,
Cure your manicure under a UV light.",How to Make Holographic Nails1," You can find it online, or in a well-stocked beauty supply store. You may also find it labeled as “hologram mirror powder.""For the hologram look, choose something that is silvery or iridescent.;
, Apply your base coat first, then your favorite color. You can use any color you want—each color will create a slightly different look. The darker your base color is, the more dramatic the hologram effect will be.


If you are new to painting nails, consider using silver as your base color. This way, if you accidentally leave any gaps in the powder, it will be less noticeable., This will allow the powder to stick to it., As you tap the powder on, gently flick your brush downward. You can use a small brush, a special nail art applicator, or even one of those foam eye shadow brushes., Gently sweep the brush across your nail, starting from the base and going past the tip in a single stroke. This will not only get rid of any excess powder, but also help the powder lay more smoothly.Be sure to sweep to either side of your nail to remove any powder that might be stuck to your skin.
The best brush for this would be a soft, fluffy eyeshadow brush or a kabuki brush.

, Be sure to sweep it across the top of your nail, as well as down the sides. This will seal your manicure, and prevent it from peeling., This should only take about 60 seconds. Once it is done, your nails are ready to show off!

Dip your nail onto the design.,
Wipe off your finger.,
Repeat with other nails.",How to Make Tie Dye Nails1," Any solid color will work as a base coat. Choose something that works with the other colors you'd like. Some of the base coat might peek through, especially on your first try at the tie dye.;
, Brush cuticle oil or stick tape over your fingers from the nail to the first knuckle, on both sides.This will stop polish from sticking to you — so don't let it touch the nail itself.








, Use an old bowl if you don't want nail polish stains on your bowls. A small bow or cup will help you waste less nail polish.


Nail polish isn't a great thing to eat. You might want to use an old bowl you can keep as a makeup container — or just wash it thoroughly afterward.
Place it over newspaper to catch spills.

, Hold the nail polish wand over the water and let one drop fall. As soon as it spreads out a little, do the same with another color. Do this with at least three or four colors, making a series of concentric circles.









Do this quickly, as the polish can dry quickly on the surface of the water and ruin the effect.
Some nail polishes sink instead of float, and can't be used.There's no way to tell in advance, but fortunately it's not a common problem.
If you can't get any nail polish to spread out, try using slightly colder water, or filtered water.

, Lightly touch the surface with the stick, drawing lines through the polish. The stick will pull the design as it cuts through it, so you can create a tie dye pattern by drawing spirals. Keep drawing until you see a pattern you like.









It's best to touch down in the inner circles. The outer circles have already started to dry, so starting there can cause the polish to clump.

, Lower your nail over the part of the design you like most. If the nail polish is still runny, wait 10–30 seconds for it to set. Brush away the rest of the nail polish using your toothpick, then lift your finger straight up out of the water.








, The polish probably got onto your finger as well, but the oil or tape should stop it from sticking. If you used oil, wipe off your skin with a cotton swab. If you used tape, just wait until the polish dries, then peel off the tape.









Dampen the swab in acetone if the polish won't come off.

, Brush aside the rest of the floating nail polish with your stick, then start again with new drops. Once your nails are all tie dyed and dried, cover with a top coat and set forth to show them off.

Get some holographic foil.,
Start your manicure as you usually would, with a base coat and your favorite color.,
Cut your foil down to nail-sized pieces using a pair of manicure scissors.,
Paint on a thin layer of foil adhesive.It might be a good idea to do just one nail for now, otherwise the adhesive may dry out before you can get to it.,
Wait 30 to 60 seconds for the adhesive to get tacky.If you are using top coat, it might take much longer than that—about 10 to 15 minutes.,
Press the foil into your nails, foil-side-up.,
Gently smooth the foil down with an orange wood stick.,
Clean it up.,
Finish off with a top coat.",How to Make Holographic Nails2," You can buy special holographic or ""spectrum"" foil meant for nail art online or in a well-stocked beauty supply shop. You can also buy some holographic cellophane from any store that sells gift wrap., You can use any color you want. If you are new to the realm of nail art, consider choosing silver as your base color. This way, if your foil rips or tears while you are applying it, the gaps won't be as visible.Do not apply a top coat just yet.

, They don't have to be perfect, but try to get them as close to the right size as possible. The width is more important than the length; you can always trim off any excess foil from the top of your nail.

,


If you cannot find special foil adhesive, you can paint on a layer of top coat instead.,, If you are using holographic cellophane, check to see if it is the same on both sides. If it isn't, then make sure that you are pressing it holographic-side-up into the adhesive or top coat. Next, position the base of the foil piece against the base of your nail, then press it down. Any excess foil should be hanging over the tip of your nail.

, This will help adhere it to your nail, as well as smooth out any wrinkles or air bubbles. Avoid applying too much pressure, or it may rip!, If you are using foil, it is thin enough so that you can tear off any excess or overhang. If you are using cellophane, use a pair of nail clippers to trim off any excess from the tip of your nail.

, If you can, try to use a top coat designed specifically for nail art."

Get some holographic cellophane.,
Cut the cellophane into small, jagged shapes.,

Apply a layer of top coat.,
Start placing the cellophane pieces down onto your nail.,
Finish the rest of your nails, then clean it up.,
Seal your nails with a layer of top coat.",How to Make Holographic Nails3," You can get it in just about any store that sells gift wrap. If you want something that looks like an opal instead, you could get some iridescent cellophane instead., Try to get some different shapes and sizes; this will create a more ""natural"" and spontaneous look found in shattered glass and opals. Make sure that the shapes are much smaller than your nails, however. You will be piecing them together on each nail to create a ""shattered"" effect.


Place some double-sized tape onto your table, then stick your cut shapes down into it. Make sure that just the edges are touching the tape, so that they are standing up. This will make grabbing them easier., Here is where you can get really creative. For example, if you want something that looks like glass, you could go with silver nail polish. If you want something that looks like an opal, try nude (this works great with iridescent nail polish). If you want something dramatic, try black!

, It might be a good idea to do just one hand for now, or even a few nails. Make sure that you are using the regular kind of top coat, and not the quick drying kind—otherwise, you may not have enough time to set the pieces down!, Use a pair of tweezers to grab the cellophane pieces, and to place them onto your nail. You can place the pieces as close together or as far apart as you'd like, but avoid overlapping them. If you overlap them you will create seams, which will create bulk. Don't worry if some of the pieces extend past the tip of your nail.


If the top coat dries too quickly, just paint more on.
Try to get the position right the first time; if you nudge the pieces too much, you may create ""ripples.""
Don't focus too much on perfection. The shattered look is supposed to be random.

, Once you have everything done, get out a pair of nail clippers, and use them to trim off any excess foil that might be extending past the tips of your nails.

, Be sure to sweep some top coat over the very tips of your nails as well. This will prevent the polish from peeling.

Choose an artificial nail kit.,
Prepare your nails.,
Follow the directions of your at-home nail kit carefully.,
Keep in mind the specific needs of your artificial nails.",How to Make Fake Nails Look Real1," There are three main types of at-home kits for artificial nails: gel, acrylic, and press-on. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages to take into consideration when trying to achieve natural-looking, artificial nails.


Gel: Gel manicures most closely resemble your natural nail, and are less damaging to the nail plate. Gel manicures last at least two weeks, depending on maintenance. They are applied like normal nail polish. Gel manicures require an ultraviolet (UV) light for drying and setting. Gel nail kits are generally more expensive than the other options, especially if the kit includes a UV light. Price range: $30-$120.Acrylic: Acrylic manicures last about two weeks. They look more natural than press-on nails, less natural than gel nails. Prolonged use of acrylic nails can cause damage to your natural nail. Price range: $8-$20.Press-Ons: Press-on nails are the easiest to apply at home, but only last about one week. They are also the least-natural looking of these options. Press-on manicures cause minimal damage to your natural nail, and are easier to remove. They are also easy to repair; if a press-on nail falls off, you can easily glue it back into place. If well-maintained, press-on nails can be reused. Price range: $5-$10. ;
, Proper preparation of your natural nails is crucial; it helps artificial nails to adhere better and look more realistic.Wash your hands with antibacterial soap to remove any dirt, oils, or lotion.
Clean nails with nail polish remover. Acetone-based remover is most effective. Cut and file your nails.
Push your cuticles back with a cuticle pusher.
Buff your nails.
Re-clean your hands and nails to remove any dust caused by filing and buffing.
Dehydrate your nails using acetone-based remover or a nail dehydrating solution. This helps nail polish and artificial nails to stay on longer., Each at-home kit will have the same basic application instructions, but may vary slightly from brand to brand. Follow the directions of your kit closely, as each is specifically tailored to yield the best results for that kit.

, Gel, acrylic, and press-on nails all have different steps you can take to make them look more realistic.

File down the base of your artificial nail tip so it is as even as possible with the surface of your natural nail. Apply acrylic solution evenly across the nail bed so that the thickness of the acrylic nail corresponds with the thickness of your natural nail.Press-On Nails

Use the tip of the nail glue to spread it evenly onto your nail. Apply even pressure to press-on nails to help them stay on longer."

Paint your base color.,
Mark the peaks of your first stripe.At the top of your wall, or at the top of the portion to be painted, use a pencil to mark each peak for your top chevron stripe.,
Mark the peaks for your remaining rows.,
Plot the valleys.,
Tape off the pattern.,
Do some preliminary painting.,
Paint the stripes.,
Remove the tape.",How to Make Chevron Stripes1," If you plan on changing the color of the wall beneath the stripes, you should do so before you add the chevron pattern.


Let the base paint dry and cure for at least three days.Note that if you are satisfied with the color of the walls already and the paint is still in good shape, you can skip this step.;
, The peaks should be spaced apart evenly.


Use a level and yardstick to make sure that the peaks are also in an even horizontal line. Otherwise, you could end up with a chevron stripe that slopes downward.
Chevron stripes consist of peaks and valleys. The pattern should be even, so in order to accomplish this, the distance between the peaks should be the same as the distance between the valleys.
Note that a larger gap in between peaks will result in a wider set pattern while smaller gaps will create a tighter pattern.

, Use a pencil to mark the peaks of the second row beneath the peaks of the first. The vertical distance between peaks should be exactly the same as the horizontal distance, and the new peaks should be vertically even with the previous peaks.


Repeat for the remaining rows.
Use a yardstick and level to keep the peaks even both horizontally and vertically.

, Use a pencil to lightly mark the valleys of each chevron stripe. With the exception of the top row, each row of peaks should coincide with a row of valleys. The valley points should be spaced evenly in between each pair of peak points.


All the valleys should be vertically aligned with one another.
Use a yardstick and a level to keep the points even.
Note that you will also need a final row of valley points below the final row of peak points.

, Lay small strips of painters tape to create the outline of your chevron stripes. Lay the tape peak to valley, valley to peak, peak to valley, valley to peak, and so on, until all the dots are connected.


When done, you should see the shape of your chevron stripes.
Lay the tape so that it falls out the outside of the stripes, rather than on the inside.
Do not worry if the interval stripe appears smaller than the rest. This is only an optical illusion.
Make sure that the tape is securely and completely adhered to the wall to prevent possible bleeding underneath it.

, While you can technically paint your chevron stripes directly from this point on, it can be a good idea to do a bit of preliminary work with the paint before diving straight into the final product.


Dab a little paint into the stripes using your roller. Use the paint color that will go inside each row as you dab it on. This will help you stay on track.
Use a paint roller or paintbrush to seal the edges of the tape in place with your base coat color. Let dry before you paint.

, Use a paint roller to carefully paint inside the outlined chevron stripes. Let dry completely.


Work from top to bottom to avoid smudging and smearing.

, Once dry, carefully peel the painters tape off the wall. Your chevron pattern should now be complete.


You must wait until the paint is dry before removing the tape. Otherwise, you could end up smearing the paint into another area.

, Place the point of the toothpick in the center of a circle. Drag it outwards in a straight line, spiral pattern, or other designs. As you drag it through the other colors, you'll leave a multicolored trail. Repeat with other areas of the nail, until you have a design you enjoy.









Start with the first circles you put on, since they'll dry first., Point your nail downward and squeeze the side and top edge with your thumb. Some of the polish should slide off your nail and onto your thumb, without ruining your design. This will help it dry more quickly.







, This will take longer than you're used to, due to the thick coat. Once it's ready, cover in a top coat, peel off your tape, and admire your design.

Cut and file nails to match your natural nail.",How to Make Fake Nails Look Real2," Decide the kind of look you hope to achieve with your artificial nails. Bold hues and designs draw attention to nails, while neutral tones soften and downplay the look of your nails. A French manicure most closely resembles what your nails naturally look like unpolished.

, Nail polish that is too thick builds up on your nail and makes it look more artificial. Start each coat of nail polish using thin, even brush strokes. It is easier to apply more color afterward than to remove color.

, Shorter nails look more realistic, as natural nails are difficult to maintain at longer lengths. Cut your artificial nails to a length that conforms with your natural nails. Notice if the tips of your nails are naturally rounded or square. File your artificial nails to maintain that same shape.

Avoid activities that are rough on your nails.,

Fix nails when problems arise.,
Fill-in your nails.",How to Make Fake Nails Look Real3," Scrubbing, scratching, and scraping the nails shorten the life of your manicure. Exposure to harsh chemicals or hot water can eat away at the nail polish and/or nail glue. Wear gloves when washing dishes, gardening, cleaning, or crafting to reduce friction on your nails. , Picking at your nails can cause nail polish to chip, and nail tips to crack, break, or come off completely. Your artificial nails are not as strong as your natural nails.

, Dry, brittle nails can cause splitting and polish chipping. To prevent this, use nail/cuticle oil on your nail beds to keep them well-moisturized., This applies to gel, artificial, and press-on nails that required you to add your own polish. A top coat will help to prevent chipping and peeling, thereby extending the life of your artificial nail., Reapply nail polish to parts of nails that have chipped. Brush on more acrylic solution to areas of acrylic nails that have chipped or thinned out (and re-polish those areas). Use nail glue to re-adhere a press-on nail that has fallen off.

, After 10-14 days your nails will start to grow in, beginning at the cuticle. Nail growth makes it obvious you are wearing artificial nails. You can fill-in this area with gel polish or acrylic solution to lengthen the life of your manicure. On a press-on manicure, try painting the new area with a complementary color for an ombre look. A fill-in will only last for so long; eventually you will need to remove and reapply your artificial nails.

Cut pieces from the end.,
Tape the pieces into a chevron pattern.,
Tape this pattern over the wood base.,
Spray paint over the entire thing.,
Remove the tape.,
Glue the frame onto the wood base.",How to Make Chevron Stripes2," Use spray paint to paint the wooden base or mount for your frame a solid color. Let dry before pressing forward.Make sure that the entire board is covered in an even coating of paint.
You should also make sure that the wood is in good condition before you begin paining it. The cuts should be even, and any rough edges should be sanded off to prevent splinters.

, Fold an 8.5-inch by 11-inch (21.6-cm by 27.9-cm) piece of paper horizontally into accordion folds that are 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide.


The folds must be even. Otherwise, the resulting pattern will not be even.

, Use scissors to cut along each fold of the accordion, separating the paper into individual strips.


Do not let go of the paper after cutting the fold lines. You still need to hold the paper strip together for the next step in order to create even pieces you can use for your chevron pattern.

, Use your scissors to cut 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) pieces off the bundled strips.


You can let these pieces drop off. There is no longer a need to hold them together.

, Arrange the small pieces of paper together to create a chevron stripe. The right side of one piece should form a peak with the left side of the next, while the right side of the second piece should form a valley with the left side of the next, and so on.


The pieces need to by connected in a diagonal, zig-zag shape.
Tape the pieces together well enough to prevent them from coming apart as you work with them.
Tape enough pieces together to create a stripe that can extend over the width of the wood base. Afterward, create new stripes with the extra pieces that are all equal in shape and length.

, Arrange the stripes so that they are evenly spaced over the wood base or mount. Tape in place using painters tape.


The stripes should go over the places that will remain as the base color.
The distance in between each stripe should be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) so that stripes are all consistently equal.
Leave as little overhanging tape as possible. If you overlap the tap onto the board too much, you might end up creating chevron stripes in your secondary color that are too skinny. Consider using double-sided tape to avoid this completely.

, With the board lying flat, spray paint over the entire surface, tape, board, and all. Let dry.


Keeping the board flat will prevent the paint from dripping beneath the boundaries of the taped-off pattern.
If you want to use multiple colors, you may need to apply the colors using a paintbrush.

, After the paint has dried completely, peel away the tape and the corresponding paper stripes to reveal the final chevron pattern.


If you do not let the paint dry first, you may end up smudging the paint.

, Position the frame in the exact center of the board and glue in place using either hot glue or wood glue. Let dry before using.


Note that, ideally, the color of the frame will match the color of your chevron stripes.

Paint the base color.,
Attach the painters tape to wax paper.Place a strip of painters tape over a small scrap of wax paper.,
Cut out thin strips.,
Fix the strips to your nail.,
Apply the second shade of nail polish.,
Lock it in.",How to Make Chevron Stripes3," Apply your desired base color to your nails and let it dry completely.


You should wait for an hour or so before moving on. The coat needs to be very, very dry; otherwise, you will end up pulling up nail polish when you use the tape you need to use for this technique.
Avoid doing anything that could smudge or smear your nail polish as you let this base color dry. The bottom coat should be as smooth and flawless as possible.

, Use your knuckle to smooth it on so that there are no air bubbles.


Adding wax paper in between the tape and the nail will make it easier to handle and remove when the time comes.
Each section of tape and wax paper should be about the width of your nail.
Leave a little wax paper on the side so that the strips are easy to grab onto.

, Use your pinking shears to cut out very thin zig-zag strips of the taped wax paper.


The peaks and valleys should line up from top to bottom so that the chevron stripes will look more uniform.

, Press the strips onto your painted nails, making them flush with the nail to prevent the second coat of polish from sneaking in underneath.


It helps if your nails are still somewhat tacky but otherwise dry. If you cannot get the strips to stick, however, you try making zig-zag strips of painters tape without the wax paper.
Make sure that the distance in between the stripes is consistent. It should also be about equal the the width of the stripes.

, Carefully brush on the second nail polish, brushing over both your exposed nail and the taped-on strips. Peel the strips off carefully to avoid smudges and smears.


You should not wait for the nail polish to dry before doing this since you may cause the design to crack apart if you remove the tape once it is trapped beneath dry, hardened polish.

, Allow the pattern to dry for a few minutes, until it is tacky but no longer wet. Carefully brush on a clear top coat to lock in the color and let this top coat dry completely.


Wait at least an hour before doing any task that may require the use of your nails.

Get your supplies together.,
Apply a layer of polish to the flat back and let it dry.,
Add as many more layers as needed.,
Allow your gem to dry.",How to Make Nail Gems1," Before you begin your project, make sure you have all the supplies you need. You should be able to find most of the necessary supplies at a local craft store, although the gems are typically sold at dollar stores. They may be cheaper when purchased there.You will need a color nail polish you like. Nail gems look best when painted with glittery polish, so opt for a glittery shade if possible.
You will need glass gems with a dome top. Go for the larger gems, as these are easier to work with.
You will need paper towels to set down over your work station. This will catch any nail polish that leaks out.;
, Take the gem you're working with and turn it so the flat back is pointing upward. You want to paint on the flat back, and not the dome-shaped top. Using the brush that comes with the nail polish container, paint your chosen nail polish shade over the back of the gem.








Make sure to cover the entire gem. You don't want any bare bits of glass exposed.
You should let the nail polish dry completely before moving on to the next step. This can take between half an hour and an hour. If you want to speed up the project, consider buying fast dry nail polish.

, How many layers you need depends on the consistency of your polish. Thinner polishes may need several layers to adequately coat the gem. Thicker polishes may only require a couple of layers. Always wait for each layer to dry before adding another layer of nail polish.







, Before turning your gem over to see the results, let it dry completely. You don't want to smear the nail polish. It should take about half an hour to dry. However, some nail polishes can take longer. If you want to play it safe, you can set the gem aside overnight. It should be dry by morning.When you set the gem on the flat back, the nail polish should shine through, creating a sparkly, attractive effect.

, You get really creative here. You can bend it to the shape of your nail. You can also bend short pieces to fit your cuticle area or tip for a twist on the French manicure.







, Flush wire cutters have a flat side and a concave side. Make sure that you are cutting with the flat side of the cutters facing your design. This will give you a nice, smooth edge.








Having a smooth edge is important. If it's not smooth, then your design can get caught on your clothing and hair., The tip of the rest of the wire will now have a jagged edge. This needs to go. Cut the tip of the wire off with your flush wire cutters. Make sure that the flat side of the wire cutters is facing the spool. Discard the stub, and bend the wire into your next desired shape.








, You can make a new shape for each nail, or you can make a shape for accent nails (ie: the ring finger). Remember to trim both ends of your wire design so that the ends of the wire are smooth.


Consider cutting and making squiggles to fill in the negative spaces in your manicure.

, Wash your hands with soap and water afterwards, then dry them off. This will give you a nice, blank canvas to work on.








, Trim, file, and buff your nails to a shape that you like. Push back your cuticles, then apply some cuticle oil or moisturizer.








, Brush it over your nails to remove any traces of oil or moisturizer. It is important that you do this, or the polish may not stick.







, This is not absolutely necessary, but it would be a great idea for those who are new to doing manicures or who don't have a steady hand. It will make clean up easier.









I you used glue, be sure to let it dry before moving on to the next step.

, This is a must, even if you plan on using clear polish for a bare effect. It will help the polish stick to your nails longer and protect your nails against stains.








, You can use a clear nail polish or a colored one. For an interesting effect, consider using matte nail polish in black or white. This will contrast against the shine of the wire and give you a nice effect.








For best results, use gel polish., Do not let this coat dry. The polish needs to be wet in order for the wires to stick. At this point, it might be a good idea to work only 1 to 2 nails at a time so that the polish doesn't dry out too quickly.

, Place them lightly over the wet nail polish. Try to get the placement right the first time. If you need to, nudge them into place with the tip of your tweezers. Once you are happy with the placement, lightly press the wires into the polish with the tweezers.








, If you used gel polish, then you will need to set it under a UV light., If you used matte nail polish, however, you might want to skip this step. Using matte top coat would only dull the wire, and using regular top coat would take the matte-ness away!








, Use a thin brush dipped in nail polish remover to clean off any excess nail polish. If you applied glue to your cuticle area earlier, peel it away. If you applied petroleum jelly, wipe it off with a q-tip. Your new manicure is ready to go!

Shape your nails.,
Apply a clear basecoat.,
Create the cat’s head with the cat fur color of your choice.,
Make the ears.",How to Make Cat Nail Art1," The great thing about this nail design is that you don’t need long, perfect nails. The design is relatively small, so anyone with short nails can do this as well. Before you get started, however, you want to make sure your nails are shaped to your liking. Trim them to your desired length, and file them so the edges are smooth.

For more info on shaping nails, check out the article here.;
, The basecoat is important, and will ensure your beautiful nail artwork lasts. It helps the polish stick to your nail by creating a more adhesive surface for it. Additionally, your cat nail art won’t cover your entire nail, so it can also help cover imperfections in the exposed nail., You don’t need any special nail art tools for this – simply your polish and standard brush. Start at the tip of your nail, and paint approximately half of your nail. Where the polish ends, about halfway down your nail, is the top of the cat’s head. Carefully paint your polish up your nail, ending it in a curved semi circle shape., Dip your thin nail art brush into the same polish. Then, create two triangle “ears” on either side of your nail. They should be close to the edge of the nail, connecting to the semicircle top of the head you just created. Fill them in with polish and allow everything to dry.You can purchase tiny acrylic nail art brushes at your local beauty supply store or online.
You may want to fill in the head with another coat of polish at this point as well.

Mix your metallic colors.,
Paint the metallic mix onto your nails.,
Seal the metallic mixture with one layer of quick-dry top coat.Check your brand of top coat for specific instructions, but most of them say to wait about two minutes after applying your polish before applying the top coat.",How to Do Sunglass Nails1," Use a file to shape your nails into the desired look. Wash your hands to get rid of the gritty nail particles created by the file. Dry your hands thoroughly on a clean towel. Soak a cotton ball in polish remover and wipe each nail with it. This isn’t to remove polish (your nails should already be polish-free), but to clean them.

The metallic polish will adhere to your nails more successfully if they are free of dirt and oils. The polish remover will get rid of both.
Consider using an acetone-free polish remover (if you aren’t already) to avoid being around this harsh chemical.;
, Don’t use a regular base coat, as you normally would. Instead, put one coat of quick-dry top coat on each of your nails.Allow the top coat to cure for the amount of time the bottle suggests (which will probably be between one and two minutes). The sleek topcoat will help to create a smooth surface for the metallic polish.

An ultra-smooth base can make the mirror-like effects more pronounced.

, The sunglass look is multi-tonal, which means you need to use at least three metallic shades to achieve similar results. Go with the three metallic colors you like best, but make sure you have a variety of light and dark colors. The range of shades will help you create a final look that has depth, like the sunglass look, instead of cancelling each other out.

For example, you could choose gold (which is light), pink (medium) and midnight blue (dark) metallic.
Feel free to experiment with four metallic shades. Depending on the angle, the sunglass look changes between three and four colors., Metallic enamels tend to be thinner than opaque polishes, so the black base will provide some depth and dimension.

Allow the black polish to cure for the recommended amount of time before moving on.

, Place a sheet of wax paper or tin foil on a flat work surface and secure it in place with masking tape. Pour some of each metallic polish onto the wax paper. Use a toothpick to swirl the colors together until you end up with a color you like.

You may need to use more of one metallic polish than another to achieve the look you want.If you want to mix up quite a bit of the polish, consider using a shot glass instead of wax paper.

, For best results, apply nail polish in three strokes – one down the center and one down each side of your fingernail. Make the strokes even and narrow.Work as quickly as you can so your mixture won’t dry up. You may end up having to mix more if you don’t work quickly enough, which is fine.

There is no “right” way to do this, and you’ll find your natural rhythm once you practice a bit.

, This allows the metallic polish time to adhere to your nails and dry slightly before you add another element to the mix.

Do one coat of the top coat and allow the polish to cure completely.

Allow your gem to dry.",How to Make Nail Gems2," You should be able to find most of your supplies at a dollar store or craft store. You will need glass gems with a flat back and a dome-shaped top. These gems are usually sold at dollar stores, and you should opt for the bigger varieties.You will also need glitter in your chosen color. You can also mix together many different shades of glitter.
You will need a top coat. Make sure to choose a cheaper top coat, as the glitter will likely bleed a little into the topcoat. You probably will not be able to use it on your nails after using it for this project.

, Find a small bowl or Tupperware container. Fill it about 3/4 of the way full with glitter. Unless you're making a large amount of nail gems, you do not need a large amount of glitter.If you're mixing different colors of glitter, mix them in this bowl before you begin the project.

, Make sure you're working with the flat side of the gem. You should not coat the dome shaped side with top coat. Add two layers of top coat so you have a thick layer of top coat coating the bottom of the gem.








It's not necessary to wait for one layer to dry before adding the other. You need the top coat to be wet for the next step.

, Place your gem into the glitter bowl, with the flat back facing downward. Press the flat back against the glitter for a couple of seconds to get the glitter to stick to the gem.When you take your gem out of the glitter bowl, tap the dome shaped side a few times with your fingers. This will get off any loose bits of glitter.

, The glitter will peel off quickly if you don't seal it in with another layer of top coat. Gently paint over the glitter on the back of the gem with another layer of top coat.








If you notice any loose bits of glitter sticking out, gently pull them off the gem.

, The gem will take about half an hour to dry. However, you can also set it aside overnight. When you turn it over with the flat back facing down the glitter should shine through. This creates a colorful, attractive nail gem."

Allow the black polish to cure for the recommended amount of time before moving on., This product is sometimes referred to as a non-wipe top coat. It is clear and can be obtained at any beauty supply store. Be sure to coat each nail completely with the top coat, starting at the cuticle and brushing it all the way to edge of your nails.

Keep the three powders nearby in case you want to adjust the mixture as you work.

Mirror powder/chrome pigment can be purchased at any beauty supply store. These products can be pricey so choose wisely.
The powder is very fine. Work with it carefully so that you waste as little as possible.

, Dip the end of the sponge applicator into the mixture, picking up a small amount of the powder. Starting at the cuticle, use a bit pf pressure to press the powder down lightly. Use the applicator to work the powder down to the edge of the nail, then continue to brush the applicator from the cuticle to the nail edge with increasing pressure.The mirror effect will become more pronounced as you push down harder.
A little bit of mirror powder goes a long way, so don’t load the applicator with it. You can always add more if you need to.

, Use a fan brush to quickly brush away the excess powder from your nails. Carefully apply one last layer of the non-wipe top coat right on top of the chrome pigment. Make sure you work the top coat very close to the cuticle and all the way to the edges, which will seal in the pigment. Cure the topcoat for thirty to sixty seconds.The better you seal the pigment with the top coat, the longer the look will last.

Instead, they would look like 3D polka dots., You don’t have to use a special tool to create the water droplets. Nail salons use dotting tools, which can be bought online or at a beauty supply store. You can also make a dotting tool out of everyday items, like a pin, toothpick, or bobby pin. The easiest method is to use the applicator brush that comes with your clear nail polish., Begin by dipping the applicator into the nail polish. Make sure that it is not too saturated with nail polish. If it is, the nail polish may spread instead of making small dots. Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle.

, The dots may appear flat on the first few layers. Repeat the drops on top of the first set of drops you have created. Allow a minute for the first layer of dots to dry before building up the layers. Continue to build up the layers until you have 3D water droplets. Then, allow the droplets to dry.







, Look over your nails for any mistakes or problem areas. Correct the problems before finishing the look with a clear top coat. Use a Q-tip and nail polish remover to carefully remove excess nail polish on your cuticles and skin. If necessary, redo any nails that have been messed up in the painting process.

, Protect and complete your water droplet nails with a clear top coat. The top coat will protect the nail polish and add a matte finish that won’t obscure the water droplets. Only apply one or two light layers of the top coat. Too many layers could dull the look of the water droplets.








Use a fast drying top coat if you don’t have time to relax after painting your nails.

, Make sure you give plenty of time for your nails to dry. The best time to paint your nails is at night before going to bed. If that’s not possible, do your best to avoid using your hands for the next few hours after painting your nails. Be careful not to hit your nails on anything. The water droplets can be easily damaged. .Avoid wearing gloves.

If you have any nail polish on, then make sure that you remove it. It is also a good idea to wash your hands with soap and warm water to remove any oils or lotion that might be on your nails., Pushing back your cuticles will help to make your nails look neater and it will also allow more space for the fake nails. Use a cuticle pusher to gently push back your cuticles.








It is best to push back your cuticles right after a shower because the skin will be softer and more pliable. You can also soak your fingertips in warm water for about five minutes to soften your cuticles.

, The stiletto shape is not recommended for natural nails because it can break more easily than other shapes, so fake nails are best for this look. Choose a set of long fake nails with square tips so that you can shape them how you want.








When you are ready to apply the fake nails, apply a dot of the nail glue to a fake nail and then press it onto your natural nail. Hold the nail for about 10 seconds to give the glue a chance to bond with your nail. Repeat this process for all of your nails.
Nail glue lasts for a few days. If you just want to wear your stiletto nails for a few hours, then you can also use double sided fashion tape to attach them., After you have applied your fake nails, use a nail clipper to trim them into pointed shapes. Just trim a little bit of nail at a time to avoid making the nails too short or narrow.

, After you have achieved a rough version of the shape you want, then file the edges to even them out. Use an emery board to sand away any rough or jagged edges while maintaining the pointed shape.








The tips of stiletto nails can be dangerous if you leave them too pointy, so you may want to file them down a bit.

, There are many different nail polish and design variations for stiletto nails. You can browse some photos on the internet for inspiration or come up with your own unique design.








Try black nail polish or another dark color for a more severe look.
Go for red nails if you want something classic and sexy.
Paint your nails a pastel color, such as pink or lavender, for a soft contrast to your sharp nails.
Add glitter, rhinestones, nail decals, stripes, polka dots, or words to get a unique look.

, Cuticle oil may help to gently loosen up the fake nails so that you do not need any harsh chemicals.Apply a few drops of cuticle oil just under the edge of the fake nail and let the oil soak in. After a few minutes, try to rock the nail back and forth to see if it is ready to come off.









If the nail still seem stuck, don’t force it off. Just apply a few more drops of cuticle oil. If the nail still won’t budge, then you may need to try a different removal method.

, You can also try soaking your fake stiletto nails in some warm soapy water to help loosen them up. Fill a small bowl with warm water and a few drops of hand soap. Then, soak your nails in the water for about 10 minutes.









After ten minutes, press on the tips of your nails to see if they will come off easily. If they still seem stuck on, try soaking for a little longer or try a different removal method.

, If cuticle oil and warm water do nothing to remove your fake nails, then you may need to use some acetone nail polish remover. Pour some acetone nail polish remover into a small bowl and then dip your fingertips into the liquid.








After a few minutes, pull out your fingertips and see if the fake nails are ready to come off.
If you don’t want to dip your fingertips in acetone nail polish remover, then you can also apply some of the nail polish remover to your nails with a cotton ball. Try to get the acetone under the fake nail to loosen the adhesive.
Make sure that you wash and moisturize your hands after using an acetone nail polish remover. Acetone can dry out your skin.

, On each nail, press the toothbrush down on the nail in a couple of different spots. This will create tiny speckles at different points of the nail. Hold the toothbrush steady while pressing it down on your nails to avoid smearing your speckles.







, Take a nail polish brush. Go over each spot on your nails. Soften the edges and round out any smears using your nail polish brush.







, After allowing the speckles to dry completely, finish up your look with a clear layer of topcoat. This will protect your nail polish, keeping your look fresh for longer.

",How to Do Robin's Egg Nails4," Take a plastic bag, such as a grocery bag or a Ziploc bag. Cut out a small circle or chunk from the bag. It does not matter where you cut, as long as you have some plastic to work with.








Do not worry about cutting out a perfect shape or circle. You'll be scrunching up the plastic into a ball anyway, so the shape is not that important.

, Take a shade of metallic nail polish. The color is up to you, although more neutral shades like gold and silver work best against pastels. Dab some of the nail polish onto a paper plate.







, Take your piece of plastic. Crunch it up into a small ball using your fingers. Make sure the edges of your ball are not too smooth. There should be some edges sticking up. This will create texture for your nails.







, Before using your plastic ball to apply paint to your nails, do a few test runs on your paper plate. Dab your plastic ball in your nail polish and then dab it onto an empty portion of the plate. If the speckles are too big or blend together too much, adjust your plastic ball. You can unfold it and refold it or pull some of the plastic out of place slightly.







, Dab the plastic bag in your metallic polish, getting a small amount on. Then, dab the bag over each nail until you have as many speckles as you want. For some nails, you may end up dabbing the bag more than once on slightly different portions of the nail.








There is no strict amount of how speckled your nails should look when you're done. It's a matter of personal preference, so keep dabbing your nails until you're happy with the look.

Examine the finished nail and repeat as needed.",How to Do Sculptured Nails," Wash your hands with mild soap and warm water, then dry them with a lint-free towel.


Washing your hands will remove most bacteria and debris, but for more thorough cleansing, you should also scrub the area around and beneath the nail plate with a sanitized nail brush or soft toothbrush.
Note that all of your tools should be sanitized before use, as well.;
, Use a 180-grit nail file to shape the free edge of the nail. Keep the edge uniform in shape and length.


Ideally, you should keep the free edge fairly short when applying sculpted nails. The artificial nail tip will be very thick where it meets your natural nail, and keeping the free edge short can minimize the risk of damage.

, Scuff the surface of the nail using a 240-grit soft file. Work the file in the direction of the nail growth until you no longer see any natural shine.Etching the nail makes it easier for the artificial nail product to adhere to the surface of the natural nail.
Filing the nail from side-to-side could damage the nail plate layers. As a result, air, contaminants, and debris can wedge themselves into the nail bed and ruin the design of the finished nail.
After etching the nail, use a manicure brush to remove any dust from the surface of the nail.

, Soak the nails in warm water to soften your cuticles, then carefully push the cuticles back to reveal the entire nail surface.


Mix a little mild detergent into the warm water before submerging your nails. Keep the nails completely submerged for one to three minutes.
Dry the nails, then use a cuticle stick to gently push the cuticles back. Remove any translucent skin from the surface of the nail.

, Brush a light, even coating of nail primer over the entire surface of the natural nail.


The primer should remove oil and other moisture from the natural nail, allowing the artificial nail product to adhere more effectively. Do not touch the primed nail with your fingers since doing so could add more oil to the surface and cancel out the effect of the primer.
Only use small amounts of primer since too much can irritate the nail and surrounding skin. It might be a good idea to lightly dab the loaded brush on a sanitized towelette to remove excess primer before applying the primer to your nail.

, The best nail form will depend upon the shape of the nailbed. If the nail form doesn't fit properly, it will be difficult to apply the sculpted nail and the finished product will be more easily broken.Regular nailbeds can use standard nail forms. Nails with high free edges may require oval forms, however. Additionally, nails that are flat or severely curved usually require square forms.

, Peel the nail form from its backing, then poke out the center of the form.


Place the removed center on the back of the form, centering it over the area that will face away from the natural nail. Doing so will give the form more support.

, Pinch the matching corners of the form to gently curve it, roughly matching the curve of the form to the curve of the natural nail.


Carefully rip the back of the form so that it will fit over the finger more easily.
Ease the form into the right ""c-curve"" shape by gently rolling the center up and down. You may wish to pinch the outer corners of the form together to hold this curve, but avoid doing this if pinching the corners will distort the bend of the curve.

, Guide the form so that the center opening fits beneath the free edge of the nail. Use a light touch to avoid distorting the shaped c-curve.


The ripped back end of the form should be wrapped around the finger and beneath the natural nail.
Secure the form beneath the fingertip to ensure a tight fit.

, Hold your nail brush vertically over a dappen dish, then slowly pour a small amount of acrylic monomer down the side of the brush and into the dish.Monomer is the artificial nail liquid. It allows the colored acrylic nail powder to solidify into beads, and those beads are what you'll apply to the nail and form.
Dip the brush into the monomer, then drag it over the side of the dappen dish to release excess liquid.

, Lightly touch the tip of the brush to the white nail powder. Allow the powder to absorb the nail liquid, then shape it over the free edge of the nail and onto the applied form.Note that you do not need to use white powder. Use any color nail powder you want, but it should be the color you plan to use for the tip of the sculpted nail.
After positioning the bead over the free edge and form, tap down on the center of the bead with the side of your brush, spreading it over the entire free edge.
Continue patting the bead with the side of your brush to sculpt the desired shape. Use the edge of the brush to push in the sides and align the edge of the artificial nail to the edge of the natural nail grove.
Push along the seam of the bead with the tip of the brush to create a curve, then use the side of the brush to even out the tip of the artificial free edge.

, Reload the brush with nail liquid and dip it into clear powder. Once the powder absorbs the liquid, apply the bead to the stress area of the nail.


Place the bead directly beneath the sculpted white tip. Pause for three seconds, then pat the bead over the edge of the white tip. This edge is known as the ""stress area"" since it is the spot that is weakest to potential breaks.
Use the side of the brush to evenly smooth the clear product over the entire stress area and white tip.

, Reload your brush with nail liquid and dip the tip into pink powder. After the powder absorbs the liquid, apply the ball to the center of the natural nail. Shape it over the top of the nail.


If you do not want to use pink powder, use nail powder in whichever color you want for the main body of the nail.
Place the ball halfway down the surface of the natural nail, keeping it away from the sculpted white edge. Let the ball flow naturally for three seconds.
Use the side of the brush to stroke the color across the top half of the nail. Brush the ball to both sides of the nail, then draw up the color so that it meets the edge of the sculptured white tip.

, Use more nail liquid and pink powder to create another bead of product. Apply this product to the lower half of the natural nail, then use your brush to spread it.


Place this bead halfway between your lower cuticle and the edge of your previous bead. Allow the bead to flow naturally for three seconds.
Use the side of the brush to evenly stroke the product over the rest of the exposed natural nail.
Do not get any product directly on the cuticle. In fact, you should use a clean brush tip to gently direct the product away from the cuticle itself.

, Allow the sculpted acrylic to cure for several minutes before continuing. The product is fully cured once it feels dry and as hard as your natural nail.


The exact curing time will vary depending on the nail liquid and nail powder you use. Check the label for precise guidelines.
As the nail cures, you can use a c-shaping stick to perfect the shape of the side walls and new free edge.

, Once the nail product has cured, you can peel away the form. The form should lift away easily without causing any damage to the sculpted nail.

, Using a 180-grit nail file and 240-grit nail file, smooth the edges of the sculpted nail to even out any inconsistencies.


Start with the 180-grit file, then work over the side walls of the nail. Once the sides look good, file down the free edge.
Swap to your 240-grit file and work over the surface of the nail. Sand away any uneven lumps in the artificial nail surface.
Tilt the 240-grit file slightly and continue working over the surface of the nail to perfect the contour. Use a clean nail brush to wipe away any dust when finished.

, Apply a non-cleansing gel sealer over the finished nail, then cure the sealer under heat for two minutes.


Brush a thin layer of the seal over the entire nail just as you would apply a top coat of polish. Start at the cuticle, then gradually work down toward the free edge.
Place the nail beneath an LED heat lamp for two minutes to allow the sealer to cure. Note that some sealers may require more or less curing time, so it's best to check the label instructions before proceeding.

, Dab a small bead of cuticle oil onto the center of the nail. Use your fingers to rub the oil over the nail and into your cuticles.


You only need a small droplet of oil for each nail. It should help condition your cuticles while giving the artificial nail a slight shine.

, This step completes the first sculpted nail. Repeat the sculpting process until all nails are evenly decorated.


You can prepare your natural nails all at once, but the actual sculpting and finishing portions of the process must be completed one-by-one.

, Any shapes are suitable for Ravenclaw nails but you could consider square or rounded nails. Use a nail file, buffer and nail scissors.

, This allows the nail varnish to stay on longer and will prevent discolouration from occurring. It will also help to nourish the nails too.

Add a topcoat.",How to Do Nude Nails," While you can find nude nail polishes in a variety of finishes, including shimmer, matte, and metallic, the manicure looks most flattering if you opt for a creme shade. That’s because the polish’s shine will compliment your skin tone while still looking natural.You can opt for a sheer or opaque nude shade depending on your preference. However, sheer polishes tend to work best because they allow some of your natural nail to show through.
If there are some imperfections in your natural nails, such as as discolorations or ridges, an opaque polish can help hide them.;
, When you’re choosing a nude polish, you should select a shade that has the same undertone has your skin. If you have cool-toned skin and opt for a warm nude polish, the shade will clash with your skin. Be sure to match the polish’s undertone to that of your skin.If the veins on the inside of your wrist are blue or purple, you likely have cool-toned skin.
If the veins on the inside of your wrist appear green, you likely have warm-toned skin.
If your veins seem to be a mix of blue or green, you may have neutral skin, which means both warm and cool nude polish will work for you.

, When you do nude nails, you don’t necessarily want the polish to match your skin exactly. Instead, you want a slight contrast between the two, so the manicure looks intentional. Choose a polish that’s a shade lighter or darker than your skin to create some contrast., A nude manicure typically looks best on shorter nails. When your nails are longer, it can sometimes look like a French manicure. Before polishing your nails, you may want to use clippers to trim them down if your nails are long.You don’t have to trim all of your nails above your fingertips away. On average, nails that extend approximately ⅛ of an inch (3/10 of a centimeter) above the tips of your fingers are most flattering for a nude manicure.

, In addition to having your nails at the right length, you want to choose the right shape for them when you’re using nude polish. In general, natural shapes, such as round or oval, are best with a nude manicure. Use a nail file to gently shape your nails into your chosen shape.








Avoid metal files or very coarse emery boards when filing your nails. They can cause splintering. Use a crystal file or a gently abrasive emery board instead., To ensure that your nude polish goes on smoothly and adheres well to your nail, you should use a basecoat first. Apply a single layer of your favorite basecoat, and allow it to dry completely.








If your nails are weak or brittle, use a ridge-filling basecoat to help strengthen them before applying the polish.

, Once your base coat is dry, apply a single coat of the nude polish. It’s best to use fast, light strokes to ensure that the polish is evenly distributed across the nails. After all of your nails are painted, let the polish dry completely.








For the smoothest coat when you’re painting your nails, hold the brush at the midway point on the cap. If you hold it at the end of the cap, you’ll have less control as you paint., When the first coat is dry, check your nails in natural light. If you’re happy with the finish, you can leave your nails alone. If the layer is too sheer or streaky, add a second coat of polish to even out the coat and make it more opaque.








If you decide to apply a second coat of nude polish, make sure to allow it to dry fully before moving onto a topcoat.

, When your nude polish is completely dry, it’s time to add a clear topcoat. It helps add extra shine to the polish and prevent chipping so your manicure lasts longer. Apply a single layer of the topcoat to all of your nails, and let it dry completely.








You can find quick-drying topcoats that dry more quickly than regular polishes, so you don’t have to wait as long for your nude manicure to dry.

This will provide a smooth bed for the actual nail polish and help your manicure last longer. You can also use a protective or strengthening base coat to keep your nails healthy and strong.


Apply a thin coat to each nail, just enough to cover it without any excess. Let it dry completely before you move on to the next step.;
, Use any color you like, but bright, vibrant colors tend to work particularly well. Apply one coat of this nail polish, being careful not to use too much, and let it dry before moving on.

, You'll need a tool to use to add the polka dots. Toothpicks work perfectly, but pencils, skewers, or anything similarly round and thin will also work well. If you're using a toothpick or something that tapers to a sharp point, this could poke holes in your nail polish or make the polka dots too small. To avoid this, rub it against a flat surface to dull it down and give it a round, flat base that will make for better polka dots.

, Choose a nail polish in a color that complements the base you used. For instance, a bright blue or pink base goes perfectly with white polka dots. Pour out a little bit of this nail polish onto a small sheet of saran wrap - this will give you more control over exactly how much you use. Dip your flattened toothpick or other dotting implement into the polish and then dot it onto your nails. Use approximately the same number of dots for each nail, and put some dots halfway off your nail for a cute effect.


Use minimal amounts of polish when dotting to keep your polka dots small and uniformly sized.

, This will cover the whole nail in a protective layer to keep your polka dots looking bright and fresh for much longer. However, make sure to do this only when all your nail polish is completely dry - otherwise, you risk smearing your polka dots and mixing colors unpleasantly.

This method is great if you want a handwritten font, such as cursive.;
, You will paint one letter on each nail. If you are using a 4-letter word, you can paint a simple image, like a heart, on one of your nails.

, If this is your first time doing nail art like this, consider practicing first on a sheet of paper. For best results, use a color that contrasts with your background color. For example, if you painted your nails pink, white or black letters would look great on it! If you painted you nails a metallic color, consider making the letters a non-metallic color.









Do the letters one stroke at a time.

, Once you have your letters painted, take a close look at them. Are there any uneven areas? If there are, you can fill them in using your striper/thin brush and letter color. If there are any jagged or rough edges, you can paint over them using a striper/thin brush and your background nail polish color.

, Let your nails dry completely before showing them off. You can do this by sitting in front of a fan for about 20 minutes, or by dipping them in icy-cold water for 2 to 3 minutes.

This method is great if you want a specific type of font, such as block letters.

, You will be using these letters as a stencil, so the color does not matter. You can use any font you want, but the letters need to be small enough to fit onto your fingernails., If your sheet of paper is small enough, you can even tuck it inside the bag.








, This will give the nail polish something to stick to. You will be peeling this off the plastic bag, so the thicker the top coat layer, the better.







, You can use a striper brush or a very thin, pointed paintbrush. These letters will be going directly onto your nails, so try to be as precise as possible; use the printed letters under the bag as a guide.







, Grip the letters by the top coat, then carefully peel them away from the plastic bag.Carefully trim away any excess top coat with a pair of scissors. Use the tweezers to hold the letters while you cut them.








, It might be a good idea to do this one nail and letter at a time so that the top coat does not dry out too fast. The top coat will ""glue"" the letter to the nail.







, Paint over the letters again using your striper brush or thin paintbrush to make the letters more opaque. Use the background color (what you painted your nails with) to clean up any uneven edges.

Clean up your nails.",How to Do Galaxy Nail Art1," The best nail art is accomplished on a clean slate, so prepare your nails in such a way to make them easy to paint. Clip or file them to your preferred shape, and then buff off the tops to create a smooth base. Add a clear base polish to seal the nail and prevent yellowing.


;
, Ideas of outer space conjure up images of swelling darkness full of stars. Recreate this deep and layered backdrop by painting the base-most layer of polish black. You can use shiny polish, but for an interesting effect try using matte nail polish.





, To make your nails look like a realistic starscape, you need to give the illusion of distance. Create the appearance of distant stars by adding a layer of clear polish with very small silver glitter flecks in it over the top of the black base. Do not use polish with large glitter flecks, because things far away should appear smaller while things close up appear larger.



, We’ve all seen them - the swirling clouds of colorful nebulae captured by the Hubble space telescope. Galaxies come in nearly every color, so choose 2-3 of your favorite complimenting shades to recreate on your nails. If you aren’t quite sure, find an image of a galaxy you like and pick out 2-3 of the primary colors in it.






Popular hues to use are bright blue, green, purple, and pink.
Choose colors that are solid (don’t have any glitter) and completely opaque.

, To add layers of color, you will be using a sponge rather than the brush that comes with the nail polish. Grab a makeup sponge and rip of a piece small enough to fit over the center of your nail without touching your cuticles. To keep your fingers polish-free in the painting process, you can use a pair of tweezers to hold the sponge.





, Choose any of your galaxy colors, and use the bottle’s brush to dab some of the polish onto the sponge. Aim for a very small amount, otherwise the polish will be too gloppy and completely obscure the backdrop you already created. Dab the sponge over different areas of each nail to create a cloudy blotch of color.




, Use the same sponge and a different color to add layers and texture to your galaxy background. You can do as many layers as you want, but be careful not to blot out too much of the black background. In this case, less may be more.




, As a result of using the sponge, you likely have dabs of color along your cuticles and the skin around your fingers. Use a q-tip dipped in nail polish remover to get rid of any color on your skin and to add a finished look to the background color.

Use a small glitter overlay.,
Add larger glitter chunks.,

",How to Do Galaxy Nail Art2," One option for making the stars on your nails is to find a clear polish with small glitter. If you wanted, you could use the same color that you initially painted over the black. Using this small glitter may not add as much depth, but it is easier than using 5-6 different polishes.




, In addition to or instead of using small glitter, a clear polish with large pieces of silver glitter or confetti is a good option. Do a single coat of this over the top of your galaxy base for a finishing touch.





, Use white nail polish and a dotting tool or pen to add small white dots to represent stars. Vary their size to mimic the appearance of stars in real life, and to add the illusion of distance.




, Use white nail polish with a dotting tool to draw on small stars. Rather than trying to create a classic hand-drawn star shape, make small “x” marks to represent the glowing balls of gas. Similar to the dots, make every star a different size to add realism to your galaxy painting.

Therefore, your nails should be clear going into the process. If you have any nail polish or nail polish residue, remove it with nail polish remover before you begin., You can buy one millimeter and two millimeter stripping tips online or at a craft store. Starting with the two millimeter strip, place one strip across your pinky nail. Place it at the halfway point in a horizontal line.Stripping tape may initially be a little wrinkled, so you should smooth it down with your thumb. Make sure there are no uneven portions or air bubbles in the tape., Then, take a one millimeter strip. Place this just a little below the first strip. There is no strict spacing requirements, but remember the strips will create a stripe effect when you're done. The space between the strips should be as big as you want your line to be.Remember to smooth over the stripping tape with your thumb after applying it., Paint your nail as you normally would. Use black nail polish and carefully coat the nail with paint, covering the stripping tape in the process. Go slowly to avoid smudging the nail polish and use two coats if the polish looks thin.If you dislike black polish, you can use any other darker color you prefer.

, Wait only a minute or two to remove the strips. It's important to remove them before the nail polish dries. Pull them off slowly to create distinct, even lines.It's usually easier to remove stripping tape with a pair of tweezers. Your fingers may be too large to grab the stripping tape effectively.You should be left with a black nail with two clear stripes running along the nail horizontally.

, If you don't want the same pattern on each nail, you can switch it up. Some nails can have vertical stripes, for example. You can only add one piece of stripping tape if you only want one line. You can also simply have some nails be a solid color, without any lines."

Place it on the lower part of your nail, so it's covering up some of that space.If necessary, add another coat.

, You will again use the thin tipped nail brush. Select a different color. It should be different than your original color, distinct enough to stand out. For example, you can do black and white, orange and pink, blue and pink, and so on. Paint a line just below the first line you painted, going slowly to keep the line straight and even.When you're done, the tip of your nail should be painted and there should be one stripe of a different color below the painted tip.

Apply a topcoat.",How to Do Easy Nail Art with a Toothpick for Beginners," Dip a cotton ball in acetone nail polish remover and place it directly on any nails that have old nail polish. Wait a few seconds and rub off the remaining polish.









Make sure to get all of the old coat off before you begin applying a clear base coat or base color. Old nail polish can prevent these new coats of base or paint from properly sticking to your nails.;
, Take the time to cut and trim your nails before you begin painting. Remember to file the nails so that they're completely smooth. Avoid filing your nails after you've painted them because this can cause the paint to peel.








Longer nails will be easier to work with since you'll have more space for designs. If your nails are shorter, choose simple designs that won't take up too much nail space.

, A base coat will protect your nails from becoming stained by dark nail polishes. It will also even out the ridges in your nails. This will help the nail polish go on smoother and more evenly.








Many base coats are designed for specific nail types. For example, you might choose a strengthening base coat or a base coat for dry or brittle nails.

, Decide what color you'd like to paint over the entire nail. Don't limit yourself to basic nail colors like reds and pinks. For a striking look, you could start with a white base and add a variety of bright colors. Or, you could work with a black base coat and use light colored dots that really stand out. Many stylists recommend applying two coats of color, waiting 2 minutes in between applications.








Consider what colors you'd like to use for your dot design. Make sure you select colors that will show up against the base color your painted. For example, it may be hard to see dark red dots against a burgundy base.

, You can purchase a dotting tool at a beauty supply store. Look for a short toothpick-like tool that has one sharp end and one blunt end. Or, you can use a toothpick. Just cut off one end with a pair of scissors so that the end becomes blunt. Take care not to cut yourself.









If you don't have a toothpick or dotting tool, you can use a bobby pin. Bend the bobby pin open so that you can easily use the ends as dotting tools.

, Paint your nails a nude color and let them dry completely. Take the blunt end of your toothpick and dip it in white nail polish. Instead of painting the tips of your nails white, use the toothpick to make many white dots along the tips of your nails.









You can play around with the size of the dots, as well as the colors of the manicure. Try using a bold color for the base or use dark polish for the dot tips.

, If you want to practice making dots using your toothpick, practice by covering your nails with polka dots. Dip the blunt end of your dotting tool into your nail polish and immediately dot it onto your nail. Don't wipe the side of the toothpick against the nail polish bottle or the dot will come out unevenly. Try to apply the polka dots evenly around your nails.









If you're having trouble with detail, you can apply the dots randomly. Have fun using different colors and making different sized dots.

, Dip the blunt end of your dotting tool into your design color. Create four or five dots in a close circle on your nail. Don't wipe the sides of the dotting tool or you'll end up with uneven dots. If you like, you can place a dot in the center (and use a different color for extra style).








Keep in mind that the color your choose will end up being your flower color.

, Use the sharp end of your toothpick and drag from the middle of a dot towards the center. Repeat this for each dot so that you end up with swirled flower petals.









You can also take the sharp end of your dotting tool and dip it in a green, brown, or black. Draw a vine or stem coming off of each flower.

, After you've applied a base color and allowed it to dry, apply another coat of color. This time, use a different color that will contrast with the base color. Before the new coat of paint dries, take the sharp end of your toothpick and drag it through the paint. Create swirls and a design that shows the paint color underneath.








For example, paint a base of black and apply a silver coat over that. While most of the nail will appear silver, the swirls you create will appear black.

, Use a clear top coat to seal in your nail polish design. Not only will a topcoat extend the life of your design, it will also keep the paint from chipping off. A topcoat will also keep your nails looking shiny and glossy.








You can find topcoats that are quick drying. These can help your designs set quickly so they don't smudge.

Paint your nails.",How to Do Holly Nail Art1," Before you start your manicure, you’ll want to smooth and shape the edges. Use a nail file to gently shape the tips of your nails, and remove any uneven or jagged edges. This nail art looks great with rounded or square tips, so file them however you prefer. , A base coat should be the foundation of every single manicure you do. A base coat creates a sticky base for your polish, helping your manicure to last as long as possible. It can also even out imperfections to create an even, smooth base. Finally, a base coat ensures that your polish won’t stain your nails. Apply your base coat to every nail, and allow it to dry fully before moving on.







, You’ll need to paint your nails a solid color before starting on the holly nail design. The design will be green and red, so choose another festive polish that will let your designs stand out. White and gold are both excellent choices, and the holly design will stand out against either color.









The best method for painting your nail is the trusty three-stroke method. Apply a stripe of your polish down the center of your nail. Then, apply two more stripes on either side. Your entire nail should be covered in polish, without using too much or too little."

Put a bead of green polish on a flat surface.,
Create your holly leaves using the thin nail art brush.,
Put a bead of red polish on the flat surface.,
Use your dotting tool to add the holly berries.,
Apply a topcoat.",How to Do Holly Nail Art2," The green polish you picked out for this nail art probably comes with your standard polish brush. Because the holly leaves are so small, you will need a smaller nail art brush to create them. Pick up a bit of green polish from the bottle using the normal polish brush, and put a little bead, or droplet of polish, onto a smooth surface.








A nonporous surface like glass or metal is best for this, because it will not absorb your polish.

, Dip your small nail art brush into the green polish. Then, carefully create one stripe widthwise at the base of your nail. This stripe will be the body of the first leaf. Using your brush, carefully create spikes coming out of this leaf, slowly forming it into the shape of a holly leaf. It might not look perfect, but as long as you get the general shape, that’s all that matters!








After you’ve created one leaf along the base of your nail, create another leaf going in the opposite direction down the side of your nail. The two leaves will end up forming an L shape.
While you’re creating this leaf, it might be helpful to Google pictures of holly leaves. That will give you an idea of what yours should look like.

, Your holly berries, like the leaves, are much too small to create with a standard polish brush. Instead, use your brush to put a drop of polish on your surface. You will be using a dotting tool to create your berries.







, Dip your dotting tool into the droplet of red polish. Then, carefully dot it between the two leaves you’ve created on your nail. You can add as many “berries” as you like using this technique. Just make sure they are touching the leaves that you’ve created.







, This step is crucial to protect your carefully created design. Once your holly has dried completely, apply a clear topcoat over the entire nail. Not only will this create a beautiful shine on your nail, but it will help keep your polish from chipping.








If you notice your manicure start to lose its shine, you can always apply another coat of topcoat to bring it back to life!

Apply your base coat of choice.,
Wrap a piece of lace around your finger.,
Dab on the color for your lace with a makeup sponge.,
Lift the lace straight upwards off the nail.,
Apply a topcoat and clean up any excess coverage.",How to Do Lace Nails1," You can use a clear base coat, or any color you like. Just make sure there is a least some contrast between the base coat color and the shade you’ll use to paint the lace pattern. Allow the polish to fully dry.









For example, you may want to use a clear base coat if you’re doing a white lace pattern over a French manicure.
To use lace as a template, you’ll need to hold it tightly around your nail, so it’s important that your base coat is fully dry first. Otherwise, the lace can smudge or dent your base coat.;
, Choose lace with holes that aren’t too big or small. With the hand of the nail you’ll be painting, hold the lace pinched behind that finger, so that the front of the nail is covered in lace. Hold the lace tightly and securely, so that the fabric pattern blocks polish from seeping underneath.








A piece of lace that will fit a dozen – or slightly more – holes from the pattern on each nail should work well.
You can buy lace in the ribbon section at local craft stores and some discount department stores.

, Use the nail polish brush to apply some color to a makeup sponge – this will be the color of the “lace” pattern on your nails. Alternately, you can pour a bit of nail polish on a disposable plate and dab the sponge into it. Apply the color by dabbing the sponge on top of the fabric.








The sponge should have color on it, but not be overly-saturated. It shouldn’t drip or have a buildup of polish, so use a light coating of paint.
If you have an airbrush machine for nails, you can use that over the lace instead of a makeup sponge.

, If you dab the paint on thinly, you should be able to remove the lace right away without affecting the design. However, you can secure the lace around your fingertip with a bit of tape, if desired, and let it sit until dry. Use a new piece of lace for each finger.








, Allow the lace pattern paint to dry first. Once the topcoat is dry, use a nail polish remover pen, or wet a cotton ball with polish remover to clean up any polish that got on the skin around your nails.








"
"
Cut a piece of lace for each nail.,
Apply a base coat in a similar shade to your lace color.,
Brush on a contrasting color to all but the inner edges.,
Apply a clear polish or topcoat.,
Adhere the lace to your sticky topcoat.,
Clean up any overhanging fabric with small scissors.,
Apply two to three topcoats.",How to Do Lace Nails2," Wrap the lace around each finger first to find a bit of pattern you like for that nail. Trim down the lace so that it will fit the width of your nail, and be slightly shorter than the length of your nail.








You can use small fabric scissors or nail scissors to trim down the lace.
You have should cut two bits of lace for each of your five fingernail sizes (thumbnail, pointer finger, middle finger, ring finger, and pinky finger) – ten in total.

, For example, if you’re using black lace, paint a black base coat. This technique will help to visually blend the edges of the fabric you’ll be putting on your nails. Let the polish fully dry.








This shade will only show in the “U” where your nail meets your skin. Aim for even coverage, but don’t worry about applying multiple coats if your nail plate isn’t uniformly concealed by the base coat.

, Leave the base coat showing in a “U” shape. The bottom of the “U” should rim your cuticle, with the sides of the “U” on the edges of your nail wall. Use the contrasting color – not the base color – for the free edge of your nail. Apply a second coat, if more coverage is needed. Allow the polish to fully dry.








For example, if your base coat and lace fabric are black, you may want to use taupe as your top color. That way the lace fabric will really stand out on top of the nail.

, Wait several minutes, so that the topcoat is still tacky but not freshly wet. This time may be shorter if you’re using a quick-dry topcoat.









If you’re doing both hands, you’ll want to completely finish one hand at a time at this stage, so that your topcoat doesn’t dry on one hand while you’re placing the fabric on your other hand.

, Match the round end of the lace cutout to the half-moon of base coat showing near your cuticle. Use scissors or tweezers to press down the lace by dabbing the edges of the fabric lightly.








Small, curved nail scissors work well for pressing down the fabric.

, Let your polish dry first. Then use the point of the scissors to carefully snip off any bits of thread around the edges of your nail.








, A quick-dry topcoat will work best, since you’ll need to let each topcoat dry completely before applying another. Make sure to cover all of the exposed lace with the topcoats.








If you prefer a matte look, finish up with a matte topcoat.

Gel polish is more difficult to remove (and typically longer-lasting) than standard nail lacquer. Taking the time your prep your nails will help you achieve a nice, clean look you can enjoy longer term than typical polish.

, Use a nail cleanser or rubbing alcohol on a lint-free wipe to clean your nails. Depending on the brand of gel polish you’re using, you’ll apply one or more foundation coats – they may be called a bond coat, foundation coat, and/or base coat. Follow the instructions for your brand of polish.








, Use the polish color you want for the lace pattern. This look works well with black polish, but you can use any color or shade you like., Paint the pattern on your nail plate. You can make a pattern of all dots, or create a fishnet pattern with diagonal, criss-crossing stripes to imitate fishnet lace.








If you’re unsure how to create a pattern you’ll like, try looking at the pattern in a real piece of lace, or at lace images online.

, Gel polish needs to be cured with a special LED or UV lamp. Follow the instructions that came with your nail lamp for how long curing time should take.









For example, a UV lamp may take 120 seconds to cure a color polish, whereas an LED lamp may take 60 seconds. Some lamps have a built-in shutoff feature after the appropriate amount of time expires., Mix two drops of clear top coat gel with one drop of the polish color you used for your lace. This will give you a translucent shade to overlay your lace pattern. You can add more drops of clear if you want the overlay to be very sheer.







, You can add a second coat of the diluted color, if desired, and then cure the nails again., Use a clear topcoat made for gel polish. Cure your nails under your nail lamp. If you want a matte look, either use a matte topcoat, or lightly buff the surface of your nails.








You may want to apply cuticle oil around your finished nails to rehydrate the skin. If you buffed your nails, remove any dust first with an alcohol wipe (or wash your hands).

Paint on your petals.,
Add fluff to the ends of the petals.,
Add grass.,
Paint flying petals across the other nails.,
Add new flowers to other nails.",How to Do Dandelion Nails," The color nail polish you pick is up to you, but make sure you choose a lighter color. You want the dandelion shapes you paint on to show up on your nails. Go for something like white or light pastel shades.Make sure the base polish is completely dry before proceeding.;
, Some people like to have a little glitter in their dandelion nails. If you want to add glitter to the background, wait for your light-colored polish to dry. Then, paint on a layer of glitter polish to add some sparkle.If you added sparkled polish, let it dry completely before proceeding.

, You can paint your dandelions using one color or multiple colors. The color or colors you choose are up to you, but here are some common options:Some people like to use a green shade for the stems and either white or yellow for the buds and petals. This makes a realistically colored dandelion.
Some people paint dandelion shapes in black. This shows up very well, especially against a very pale polish like light pink.
If your polish was slightly darker, such as a pastel blue, you can use white nail polish. However, very light dandelions do not always show up as well.

, To start, dip a thin nail art brush in the polish you're using to paint your dandelion's stem. Starting at the base of your thumb nail near the nail bed, draw a line stemming from one corner of the nail bend. Have the line slant diagonally slightly, moving in the direction of your other fingers.There is no strict rule for how long your stem should be, but leave enough space near the top of your thumb so you can create your flower. A line of approximately half a centimeter should work.

, Using your nail art brush, draw a small circle on top of the stem. This will be the bud of your dandelion. Keep it relatively small. Dandelions, unlike things like sunflowers, have fairly tiny buds. A small dot is all you need.You do not need to wait until the stem polish dries before adding the bud.
It's okay if your bud is not perfectly round.You will be drawing a lot of petals stemming from the bud. If it's slightly asymmetrical, this will not be noticeable by the time you're done with the look.

, Moving from the center of the bud outward, paint on your dandelion petals. For this step, take a new, relatively dry brush. Draw thin lines stemming from the bud of your flower. Dandelions have a lot of petals, so draw many lines. When you're done, your flower should begin to resemble a thick dandelion.To add extra volume, make your lines slightly angled and have some criss-cross with one another.

, Dandelions have fluffy petals, especially when they turn white. Use the tip of your nail art brush to add tiny dots to the end of each line. This will make your dandelions look thicker and more realistic.You can also add some dots within the body of the flower itself to thicken out your stems.

, If you want, add grass to the bed of your thumbnail. Using your nail art brush, use quick upward motions stemming from the base of your thumb upward to create blades of grass. Have the lines overlap slightly to create a thick, grassy appearance near the base of your thumb., You do not need to paint a dandelion on every nail. In fact, most people who go for dandelion nails stick to one or two dandelions per hand. Instead, paint small petals floating across each nail, as if wind has blown the dandelions across your fingernails. To do this, paint the same thin lines you painted when creating your flowers petals, Then, add dots to the end of each line.Make sure all your petals flow in same direction. The petals should move towards your other fingers and away from your thumb.

, If you want, you can paint a second flower on another finger. Which finger you choose is up to you. If you do choose another flower, however, make sure it bends in the same direction as the flower on your thumb. This will keep the wind look consistent."

Let your nails dry.",How to Do Cable Knit Nails," The cable knit nail design works best on longer nails, where you have space to create more of the design. This isn’t a necessity, but can make the task a bit easier. Without taking much length off your nails, file the ends so that they are all uniform. You can file them straight across so that they have a square tip, or round the corners for an oval tip. This is a matter of personal preference – both tips work for this design.


If you have super short nails, you can purchase plain, glue-on nails at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store. You can shape these just as you would natural nails.;
, Your cuticles are those bits of skin at the base of your nail bed. It’s important to push these back before starting your manicure so you can expose the full nail to the nail polish. You can purchase a cuticle pusher at a pharmacy for cheap, and the process is not a difficult one.Apply a dab of hair conditioner to the cuticles. Just like conditioner makes your hair smooth and soft, it will make your cuticles easy to work with.
Soak your hand in warm water. This will make your cuticles even softer, making them super easy to push back.
Dry your hand with a towel and carefully push back the cuticles.

, This is an important step of prepping your nails. A clear basecoat will help your manicure last longer, which is great when you are taking the time to create a beautiful design. It gives the polish something to really stick to, preventing chipping and peeling. These basecoats can also moisturize the nails, cover up uneven areas, and prevent the polish from leaving a stain., The unique thing about cable knit nails is that the design will be the same color as the background color, so you will be using this color polish for every step. Apply it to the entire nail in smooth, even strokes. Start with one stroke down the center of the nail, and then one stroke on either side of that.If you get a bit of polish on the skin, you can clean it up later with nail polish remover, or simply allow it to come off naturally with some hand washing.


To choose a color, think about colors of warm, winter sweaters. Grays, soft pinks, mellow blues, and cream all work well for this. Of course, you can choose any color you like!

, It’s important that your polish is completely opaque so that the design can show up well. If you are using a lighter color polish, you may need to apply a second coat. Let the first coat dry completely, and then repeat the process once more. Make sure there are no uneven areas or patches, and that all of your nails are opaque.

, You can find mattifying topcoats at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store. These topcoats will give any polish a matte, muted finish. This step is very important. Because you will be creating the cable knit design in the same color, you want to create a contrast in another way. By covering the foundation color with a matte topcoat, the shiny finish of the cable knit design will be more vibrant and visible.


Apply your topcoat to every nail, and allow it to dry completely. Make sure that your nails are completely matte, without any missed spots.

, Before you start applying polish right to your nail, you should plan your design. A quick Google image search of “cable knit nails” will give you plenty of inspiration. Choose a design that you like, and one that seems doable depending on your level of expertise. Some cable knit designs have intricate loops and weaving, while others are more basic.

, Dip your dotting tool into the same polish that you’ve been using. Then, carefully start creating loops down the center of your nail, from cuticle to tip. To create this design, create an oval at the bottom of your nail, in the center. After you've created that first oval, create another one in the direction of the tip of your nail, edge to edge with the first oval.Continue making ovals until you have a chain of ovals down the length of your nail.
These ovals will look like interlocked cables of the cable knit pattern.

, After you've created your row of ovals, you will need to add details on either side of them. First, add a vertical row of dots down one side of these loops. Use the dotting tool and the same nail polish you've been using. Finish the pattern by adding long vertical stripes on the other side of the ovals. The stripes should run from your nail bed to the tip of your nail. Add as many stripes and as many dots as can fit on your nail – don't worry if it's only a few! This mimics the pattern of a cable knit sweater.A dotting tool is imperative for this technique, and if you’re into nail art, you will certainly get your money’s worth.
You can purchase these at many pharmacies and most beauty supply stores.

, If you apply your design thickly with the dotting tool, you may only need one coat. However, you may need to go over the design once more to give it the 3D effect that will make it stand out from the background. Follow the first design you’ve created, being careful to apply the second coat directly on top of the first.

, While you typically would finish your manicure with a topcoat, you will skip that this time. A topcoat would give your background color and the cable knit design the exact same finish. You want your background color to have the matte finish you created with the matte topcoat, and allow your design to dry with it’s natural, glossy finish."

Create two oval shapes.,
Bend the shapes in half.,
Make a central dot.,
Finish the bow with a central ribbon piece.,
Place the bow on your nail.,
Decorate the bow as desired.",How to Do 3D Nail Art1," Dip your brush into the acrylic liquid first and then into the acrylic powder to form an acrylic ball. Place the ball on the nail or on a nonstick sheet of plastic or on a piece of aluminum foil.Use the brush to shape the ball into an oval. Then, use the brush to form the rounded edges into two pointed ends.








Repeat this process so that you have two ovals with pointed ends.;
, Next, you will need to turn the oval shapes into bow ends. After you have created two oval shapes with pointed ends, use the brush to fold the shapes in half so that the two pointed ends are matched up. Slide the brush under the pointed edge of one of the bows and use the brush to lift the pointed edge and bring it over to the other pointed edge.








You can create two or four bow ends for your bow. Two bow ends will form a more basic bow, while four ends will result in a more elaborate, fancy bow.
You may want to allow the oval shapes to dry partially before you start bending them, but do not wait too long or you may not be able to bend them. Just wait a few seconds after forming the shapes.
When you are finished bending both shapes, move the pieces closer together. Place the two bow ends so that their points are aligned and facing each other.

, To connect the ends of the bow, you will need to make the bow’s central dot. This dot will go on top of the points of the two bow end pieces to connect them. Dip your brush into the acrylic liquid and then into the acrylic powder. Then, place the dot between the two bow ends so that it is covering up their points.








Shape the dot as desired.

, To finish your bow, you will need to create a rectangular shaped central piece that looks like a small rectangle. Dip your brush into the acrylic liquid and then into the acrylic powder to form a ball. Then, place the ball on a non-stick plastic work surface and begin to shape it into a rectangle.








As you shape the rectangle, try to make an indentation in the center part of the rectangle so that the long edges are a little raised up. You can do this by pressing down in the center and pushing in the long edges with the brush.
Place the rectangular piece over the central dot so that the indented side is facing up and the raised long edges are aligned with the bow end pieces. Tuck the short edges of the rectangular piece under the central dot.

, If you did not create the bow on a nail already, then you will need to transfer it to a nail when you are ready to apply it. Allow the bow to dry for a few seconds before you transfer it.








Dip your brush in the acrylic liquid and then the acrylic powder and just get a small amount of each on the brush. Place this acrylic dot on the nail.
Use your fingers to pick up the bow and transfer it to the nail. Press down gently on the bow to secure it in place. Then allow the acrylic to dry for a few minutes.
If you are worried about the bow not sticking, then you can also add a little more acrylic under the bows of the nail to make it extra secure.

, You can wear the bow as is or you can use nail polish to decorate the bow. For example, you can paint the bow with nail polish or use nail polish to add a design, such as polka dots.








Make sure that you allow the nail polish to dry completely before touching the bow.

, Start by applying the base coat to just the tips of your nails, then apply more base coat over your entire nail.

, This will help the gradient layer show up better.If you can't find any white polish, find the lightest color from your gradient, and use that instead.


If you do not wish to have a gradient butterfly wing, apply a coat of bright polish, then click here to learn how to do the details., The next few steps will get very messy. Covering the skin around your nails will make cleaning up easier. Simply apply some petroleum jelly, white school glue, or liquid latex to the skin around your nails. If you are using glue or latex, be sure to let it dry before moving on.

, Get one of those triangle-shaped sponges you use to apply foundation with. Choose two to three colors of nail polish. Paint one stripe of each color onto the sponge. Make sure that they are all touching. Most people use flat polish, but you can try metallic or pearlescent instead.


Choose different shades of the same color for an ombre effect.

, Orient the stripes horizontally, then press the sponge against your nail. Gently roll it across your nail. Don't worry if you get polish on your skin., This will help soften the lines between the colors and blend them together., Allow the polish to dry for about 1 minute first, then reapply the polish to the sponge.

This will give your butterfly wings extra sparkle., Find a thin, pointed, stripper brush and dip it into flat, black polish. Paint a line going from the bottom center of your nail up to center side.It does not matter if you angle the line towards the left or right side of your nail. It needs to be the same on each nail, however.
The line can be straight or slightly curved., Using the same striper brush, outline your entire nail using black polish. Try to get as close to your cuticle as you can. Once again, don't worry if the polish gets onto your skin.For a twist, paint only above the line that you drew in the previous step. Leave the nail below the line unpainted., Start from the angled line that you grew and finish at the tip/edge of your nail. Try to space these lines as evenly as you can. The lines will be a little slanted.Because of how small your pinky is, consider doing only 2 to 3 lines.
For a more realistic wing, make the curved lines thicker at the top of your nail and thinner on the sides.

, Starting on the leftmost outline of you nail, draw a small, upward-curved line towards the first vertical line. Draw another small curve towards the next line, and the next. Think of it like connecting the spokes on a web.Try to make these curves follow the same angle as your horizontal line.
Don't worry if there are gaps between the curves and the top outline of your nail.

, You may have some gaps between the top outline of you nail and the connecting lines. Carefully fill these gaps in with more black polish., You can use a toothpick, a dotter, or a clean striper brush to do this. The dots can all be the same size or they can be different sizes., Because of how long this polish takes, you can work on you other nails as well, just be careful not to accidentally bump or smudge your hard work!

, If you used white school glue or liquid latex, simply peel it off!

, Take a look at your manicure. If there is any unevenness, fix it now. If you ended up getting any nail onto your skin (especially in the crease between your nail and cuticle), wipe it away with a thin brush dipped in nail polish remover.

, You can use a regular top coat or a matte one. If you used glitter polish earlier, use regular, glossy polish. If you use matte, you will dull down the glitter.

Press out the drop to form a flower petal.,
Place a bead in the center of the petals.,
Apply the flower to your nail.",How to Do 3D Nail Art2," You will need to make a bead of acrylic to form the flower’s petals. To make a bead, dip your brush into the acrylic liquid first and then into the acrylic powder. This will create an acrylic bead on the brush. Place the acrylic bead onto the nail or onto a non-stick work surface, such as a piece of aluminum foil.








Use a thin brush to create small flowers. This will allow you to get a smaller dot of acrylic on the brush and create finer details.Allow the bead to dry for a few seconds before you begin to shape it. The bead should look matte and not shiny before you begin to work with it.
You can use plain white acrylic powder or use color acrylic powder to create your flower. You can also use two different colors to form a gradient design. To do this, start by dipping your brush into acrylic liquid, then dip it into one color of acrylic powder and then another.Just try to get a small amount of the second color on the brush so that the second color will highlight the first one.

, Use the brush to press the bead into the form of a flower petal. Press the top of the bead, flatten it out, and then use the brush to push in the sides as desired until you have created a flower petal shape.








Shape one end of the petal so that it comes to a point. This will serve as the center part of the petal, which will meet up with the other petals you create.
Make at least three petals in the same fashion. If possible, create these additional petals alongside the first one so that you do not have to move them later.
Keep some paper towels handy to dry your brush between petals.This will help to ensure that the beads you form do not have too much liquid in them.

, Dip your brush in the acrylic liquid and then into the acrylic powder to create a bead. This will form the center part of the flower. Place the bead in the center of your petals to complete the flower.








Allow the bead to dry for a few seconds and then press the bead down a little to secure it in place.

, After you have placed the central bead, your flower is complete. You can apply it to your nail if you did not create it on the nail already. Dip your brush in acrylic liquid and then into acrylic powder. Place this dot on your nail and then place the flower you created on top of the dot and press down gently.Make sure that the flower has dried before you transfer it. This should only take a few minutes.

Form a rose petal with some acrylic powder.,
Apply the first two rose petals to your nail.,
Make and add more rose petals.,
Form the central bud.",How to Do 3D Nail Art3," Dip your brush into the acrylic liquid and then into the acrylic powder to create a bead. An oval brush is best for creating roses. Try using an oval size 6 Kolinsky brush if possible.Place the acrylic bead on a non-stick work surface, such as on a piece of aluminum foil.Press out the bead until it forms a rose petal.








To create a rose petal shape, press and shape the bead into a half-moon shape with a bit of a curve to the center part (the inner part of the petal). As you press and shape the petal, try to make the central part of the petal a little thinner than the outer part.
Make a second rose petal in the same fashion.

, The first two petals will form the outer edges of the rose. After you have made two petals, you can begin to assemble them on your nail. Pick up one of the petals and place it on the nail. Make sure that you shape the petal so that it is curving at the center and the outer edge is raised slightly.








Use a little acrylic liquid and powder on the inner part of the petal to help make it stick.
Apply the second petal in the same way, but make sure that the petals overlap slightly. You will continue to layer petals onto the nail in this way to create the rose shape.

, Keep making rose petals and layering them onto the nail until your rose is complete. As you layer more petals into the center of the rose, you will need to make the petals a little smaller so that they fit properly. Try to decrease the size of the petals a little bit with every layer until they are about half of the size of the petals you started with.








Create and add more rose petals one or two at a time. This will prevent them from drying completely and make it possible to shape them on the nail. If it takes you a while to create one petal, then only make and apply one at a time to prevent the petals from drying out.
Use a little acrylic liquid and powder to help make the petals stick to the nail.

, To finish your rose, you will need to create a central bud. This will be the last piece that you create and add to the design. Dip your brush into the acrylic liquid and then into the acrylic powder to create a bead. Then place the bead on your non-stick surface and flatten it into a long strip.








This piece will need to be thinner on one edge and thicker on the other edge, but it will not be in the shape of a half-moon like the other petals.
After you have formed the strip, begin to roll it up to form the rose bud. Use the brush to lift up one of the short edges of the strip and then roll the strip inwards to create a spiral or bud shape.
Add a little acrylic liquid and powder to the center of the rose before you apply the rose bud. Then, pick up the rose bud and place it in the center of the rose.

Don’t worry if the shape is imperfect. You can always go over it later to touch it up.

, To create the arms of the star, paint a line through the center of the “A” shape horizontally. There should be two arms extending from either side of the “A” shape.Try to ensure that the arms are about the same length as the legs and head of the star. Don’t make them too long.

, To fill in the remaining areas and complete the star, paint a line from the tip of one arm to the tip of the opposite leg. Then repeat on the other side. These two lines will cross each other and finish the star’s legs and arms.This will complete your first star. Make as many others as you like on the same nail and on other nails.

, After you complete the first star, let it dry completely before doing anything else to it. Then, if necessary, you can fill in any gaps or make corrections to the star.For example, if there are any spots with less nail polish than others, you could go over them.

Do a couple of coats to ensure an even finish and allow the nail polish to dry completely.Be sure to consider the color(s) you plan to use for the stars. It is best to choose a contrasting color so that the stars will be visible. For example, you could do black nails with white stars, red nails with light blue stars, or purple nails with yellow stars.

, You will need to create a thick layer of nail polish to ensure that the star shapes will hold up when you peel them away from the paper. Do three coats and allow the paint to completely dry after each coat.To ensure that the nail polish is completely dry, you might want to let it sit overnight, or at least for a few hours.

, Once the paint has dried, use the decorative hole punch to punch out some stars. Punch out as many as you want to apply to your nails.Before you apply the stars to your nails, you will need to peel them away from the waxed paper. Do this carefully to avoid ripping the nail polish shape. If the stars seem flimsy, then you might need to use more nail polish layers next time.

, To apply the stars, paint over your nails with a layer of clear topcoat. Then, gently press the star onto your nail where you want it to go. After you finish applying all of the stars, paint over your nails with another layer of clear topcoat and let them dry completely."

Add glitter.,
Create different sized stars.,
Draw a shooting star.,
Place a star on the edge or corner of your nails.",How to Create Star Nail Art3," Adding a touch of glitter to your stars can also help to enhance them. Try painting some glitter nail polish over a finished star shape, or apply glitter nail polish over your entire nail.

Choose a glitter that will go well with your nail polish. For example, silver might look good with blue nails and white stars, or gold glitter might look nice with green nails with gold stars.

, Drawing a few different sized stars on each nail is another way to add interest to your star nail art. Try drawing one large star and two smaller ones or vice versa.You can vary the stars between nails as well. For example, you could do a large star on each of your ring fingers and then do smaller stars on the rest of your fingers.

, You can transform a star into a shooting star by adding a few swoops of nail polish behind it. Try using a couple of different colors or a glittery nail polish to get a shooting star effect.

To turn a regular star into a shooting star, use the paint brush to paint on a few arching lines extending from one side of the star. This will look best with a smaller star that has some room next to it for the arching lines.

, Your stars do not need to be completely visible on your nails either. You can start a star near the edge or corner of your nail and just draw as much of it as you can.Drawing stars this way works best for larger sized stars. Try painting two larger sized stars on one side of your nail, or cut a star shape in half and place it near the edge or tip of your nail.

Apply a base coat and nail polish.,
Cut the tattoos with small scissors to fit on your nails.,
Wet the tattoo face-down on your nail.,
Hold the damp cloth against your nail for 30 seconds.,
Remove any excess, if needed.",How to Apply Nail Tattoos1," Brush on a clear base coat. Once it’s fully dry, brush on at least one to two coats of nail polish – allowing it to dry between coats – until you achieve satisfactory coverage.


Because the edges of temporary tattoos often have a translucent, filmy border, opt for white or light-colored polish. This will also make a canvas for good contrast with your tattoos.
Some water slide tattoos made for nails can be used with any color.;
, Try using sewing scissors or nail scissors; a curved blade will work well. Pick the pieces of the tattoos you like best, and make sure each piece will fit on one of your nails without any overlap. At least part of your nail plate should show around each tattoo piece.








Choose tattoos with dark or colored shades and/or details, to contrast with your nail lacquer.
You don’t need to cut perfectly around the tattoo: you can cut small squares that fit onto your nails.Wait until your nails are fully dried before doing this step, so that you don’t accidentally smudge your polish.

, Remove the plastic sheet from the tattoo. Place the tattoo so that it touches your nail only, not your skin. Use a wet cotton swab, paper towel, or cloth to dampen the back of the tattoo.








It’s fine for the tattoo to hang over the free edge of your nail.
Some water slide tattoos for nails require you to soak them first for five to ten seconds each. You can remove tattoos from a bowl of water with tweezers, after soaking them., Press down firmly and evenly. If the tattoo has instructions that recommend holding the moist tattoo for a longer amount of time, follow those instructions.Avoid dabbing or moving the tattoo while it sets., If the tattoo overlaps the edge of your nail, snip it off with scissors. For a look that lasts longer, apply a topcoat.








If you’re applying a topcoat, try dabbing a tiny bit of top coat onto one of the tattoos first, to make sure it doesn’t smudge.

Apply the nail sticker.,
Use a blow dryer on the nail for several seconds.,
File off any excess decal.,
Maintain your nail tattoos.",How to Apply Nail Tattoos2," Use a cotton pad with nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol to clean on and around your nails. Don’t apply a base coat for this look – it can prevent nail stickers from properly adhering.







, Find a sticker that is the closest match to the size of your nail. If you can’t find a sticker that matches the size of a nail well, choose a sticker that’s larger than your nail. Then trim it down with small scissors to fit the nail. Rub the sticker in your hands to warm it up a bit – this can improve its flexibility and longevity., Remove the backing from the strip. Place the sticker on your nail plate, close to – but not overlapping – your cuticle. Smooth the sticker down from your nail bed to the tip.







, Use the warm setting on your blow dryer. If your blow dryer runs quite hot at close range, hold it back far enough that it doesn’t hurt your skin.








Heat helps nail stickers smoothly adhere to the nails.

, Hold a large-grit file perpendicular to the nail. File the nail downward to detach excess strip from the free edge of your nail. Start out with a rough file, and finish up with a finer grit.








Try using a glass file to smooth the edges once you’ve removed excess stickers.

, You can add a top coat for gloss, if desired, but it isn’t needed for longevity. Treat your nails gently, avoiding pressure and moisture. Avoid using lotion or oil-based products on your nails, which can cause separation of the stickers. Keep your nails away from heat, unless a decal starts to come off. If so, use a blow drier on your nail as you smooth the sticker back down.








For example, wear gloves to protect your nails when doing dishes or other wet or messy tasks.

Avoid hot water.,

Moisturize your hands.,
Protect your hands.,
Use your hands carefully.",How to Care for Nail Art," Since your fingernails are the canvas for your nail art, you want to start with a healthy surface. Strong nails will allow your nail art to look great and last for a long time. To improve your nail health, start with your diet. Make sure you are getting enough biotin, Vitamin E, and omega 3s. If you need help getting these nutrients, try taking a supplement. Protein rich foods will also help your nails grow, so be sure to eat beans, fish and nuts.Additionally, keeping your hands and nails moisturized and protecting them from harmful elements, such as harsh weather or cleaning chemicals, will go a long way.;
, This will allow the polish to adhere to your nails. It is important to remove any lotion, dust, or water on your nails right before you begin. These elements create a slick surface that hinders the nail art from adhering and will lessen the nail art’s longevity. Starting with a clean surface also helps nail polish to dry quicker and prevents smudging.To fully remove any oils that might be on your nails, try using nail polish remover before you start, even if you’re not wearing nail polish. Apply any kind of nail polish remover to a cotton round and brush over each nail to start with a clean surface., Avoid ingredients like formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), which raise health concerns and have been shows to be allergens. Also, try not to use quick drying nail polish, which can dry out your nails, or hardening nail polish, which can result in your nails breaking or cracking. Instead find nail polishes that are labeled “three-free” to show that they do not include harmful ingredients. This will allow you to wear your nail polish for an extended period of time without it adversely affecting your health., Besides protecting your nails from stains, a good base coat gives the polish an ideal surface to adhere to. It creates a sticky surface that the polish will grab onto so that it lasts longer. A good base coat also creates an even surface for your nail art and certain formulas can moisturize your nails. Just make sure to use a quality base coat or it can end up doing more harm than good.Give your nails two thin coats of base. It acts as double-sided tape for the polish and creates a barrier between your nail and the polish.
Never use top coat as base coat. Top coat is much thicker and has different chemical properties than base coat. It also dries much slower and doesn’t have the sticky power of base coat. Not all clear nail polishes are created equally!, This is of vital importance in creating quality nail art that will last. Besides allowing the initial layers of paint to fully dry, as you add nail art, each additional element needs to dry. For example, if you are painting flowers on your fingers with multicolored petals, allow each color to fully dry before adding the next. This will prevent the paint from running or smudging so that your nail art lasts for a long time. Taking the time to allow paint to fully dry each time you use a new polish is one of the most important things you can do to make long-lasting nail art.


If your design is the same on each nail, it is best to apply one part of the design to each nail and then do the next part of the design on each nail, as opposed to fully painting one nail at a time. This ensures adequate time to allow each element to dry before adding the next part.

, A top coat adds great protection to your nail art. Consider adding two thin coats of top coat to your finished nail art for extra protection, letting it dry in between coats. Be sure to let your top coat fully dry before you do anything else. Top coat acts as a sealant for the polish, protects it from chipping and fading, and gives it a nice sheen.


Use a quick drying top coat. This is excellent for when you don’t want to wait 20 minutes for your nails to completely dry on their own. Since the top coat isn’t directly touching your nails, but rather is touching the other paint, you don’t need to worry about it drying out your nails. It will protect your nails and speed along the process to avoid smudging.Avoid using base coat as a top coat. Base coat is tacky for the purpose of adhesion and could harm your nail art rather than protect it. It is also pliable which makes it prone to indentations, which would distort your nail art. Top coat, on the other hand, creates a hard outer cover of protection.
Consider applying an additional top coat every few days. This will help your nails to look freshly polished and stay nick free.

, This is the only way to allow your hands to dry without damaging your nail art. To fully allow nail polish to dry, wait at least a half hour before using your hands. It is tempting to check your phone or write a quick note, but forgoing these tasks for a half hour will ensure that no harm comes to your nail art.


Play some music or turn the TV on before painting your nails so you'll have something to listen to or watch as your nails dry.

, This will help your nail art dry effectively and efficiently by helping them to set. Hold your nails in front of a fan for 5-10 minutes. Just don't use too high of a setting or it could cause your nail polish to ripple.

, These work by absorbing solvents in the polish to speed up the drying process. Simply apply a few drops or lightly mist your spray on each finger, and your nails will dry about 10-15 minutes faster., To use this method, fill a bowl with cold water and several ice cubes. Place your partially dry nails in ice water for about a minute. This will harden and dry your nails much faster than letting them air dry. Just make sure you don’t hit your nail on the ice, which can mess up your nail art. Also make sure your nails are at least partially dry before submerging them so that the polish doesn't run.Alternately, you could even stick your hands in the freezer for a few minutes. The cold air will help the polish to set and the circulating air will help the solvent to evaporate.

, For several hours after your manicure, try to keep your hands out of hot water. You might normally wash your hands under hot water without even questioning it. But hot water will fade the color and weaken the layers of your polish. Be mindful of the temperature of water while washing your hair or hands.Wear gloves when you wash the dishes.

, When your nails are complete, applying cuticle oil can add protection. Apply generously not only on your cuticles but also on top of your nails. The slick surface of the oil will help deflect any nicks and will act as a barrier so that if you hit your nail on something, the cuticle oil is affected rather than the polish.Apply the oil after your nail art has dried, and refrain from using your hands for a few minutes.

, In case you do end up with a small smudge, you don't need to completely redo your nails. Instead, fix that one area by repainting it and then when it dries, follow with a layer of top coat. The same is true if one of your nail art elements comes undone. Simply reapply another sticker or gemstone as needed.

, Apply moisturizer to keep your hands and nails healthy. Consider using one with sunscreen to protect from UV damage. Pay attention to the ingredients of your moisturizer and try to find one with healthy oils, such as almond oil or avocado oil. These will lock in moisture without exposing your hands to any harmful chemicals., Wear gloves or mittens when your hands are exposed to cold weather. This will prevent them from drying out or getting chapped. When cleaning your house, gardening, or exposing your hands to chemicals, wear rubber, vinyl, or plastic gloves. This will prevent any harm to your hands and allow your nail art to stay on for much longer., Try to pay attention to what you are doing with your hands. You need to take special care of them after your manicure. To protect your nails, many things that are second nature to you need to be approached much more carefully.


Be gentle when picking things up and try not to hit your nails against anything.
Gently lift any items you might drop and avoid rough surfaces.
Be careful while typing. If possible, avoid typing until your nails are dry, and type as little as you can if you want to preserve your nail art.

, When you are done with your nails, all you have to do is simply wipe the petroleum jelly away, along with any mistakes. You can also use white school glue instead, but be sure to let the glue dry first.


If you have a steady hand, or if you are experienced at creating nail art, you can skip this step.

, This will not only protect your nails against potential staining, but also help the manicure last longer.

, For best results, choose something that is light and neutral, such as beige, tan, white, cream, or ivory.If you want to create Halloween-themed nails, however, you could try black instead.


You don't have to do this nail art on every nail. You can use it as an accent by painting your nails a solid color, and then doing the nail art on your ring fingers.
If you decide to keep this nail art as an accent, consider painting your other nails a matching, but contrasting color, such as sparkling/shimmering orange.

, If the polish you are using is very sheer, you may need to apply a second coat.


The half-circles should be just a little bit narrower than your nail.
The half-circles should be no more than a third of your nail's length.

, Make the center stripe straight down the middle of your pumpkin. Let the other two stripes angle inward at the top of the pumpkin, and outward towards the edges of your nails. This will make your pumpkin look more like a pumpkin.If you can't find a light orange nail polish, try a dark orange one instead. The idea here is to create contrast.

, Make the stem using a few strokes so that is it not too thin. Remember to keep the stem short, however; the overall nail art should not go more than halfway up each nail.


If you only have one thin brush or striper brush, be sure to clean it first using nail polish remover. Blot the brush dry on a piece of paper towel before dipping it into the brown nail polish.

, This will make the ""vine"" part of the pumpkin. If you'd like, you can also add a small, star-shaped leaf as well.


Again, if you are going to use the same brush, remember to clean it first!

, The top coat will help protect your work, and help it last longer.

, If you used any petroleum jelly or white school glue in the cuticle area, simply wipe or peel it away. Next, use a thin brush or Q-tip and some nail polish remover to clean up the cuticle area.

, This is a must, even if you plan on using light-colored nail polish. The base coat will not only protect your nails against potential staining, but also help the manicure last longer.

, Choose a neutral color, such as brown, beige, or tan. This way, your background won't be competing with the glitter or the leaves. Alternatively, you can also use white, black, ivory, or cream., For best results, choose glitter nail polish with finger grains, rather than chunky ones. Warm colors, such as gold or copper, would work best for this method.

, Start by tapping the glitter onto the top fourth of each nail, then the top third, and finally the top half. This will create a gradient or ombre effect, with the glitter being thickest on the tips of your nails, and fading towards the middle., This will help smooth down the glitter layer, and make painting the leaves in the next step a lot easier.

, Choose fall colors, such as red, orange, or yellow. For now, just paint 1 or 2 short, straight lines on each nail. These lines will eventually become your leaves.Don't let the lines go past the glitter area. You can have some of the lines touch the edge of your nails, however.
Try different angles for the lines. This will give your leaves more movement.
Clean your brush with nail polish remover and blot it dry on a paper towel before dipping it into a new color.

, Using the same brush and colors as before, paint the rest of the leaves. Use short, angled strokes radiating from the straight lines you painted earlier. By now, your leaves should start looking a little like maple or oak leaves.Remember to clean your brush before dipping it into a new color!

, At this point, you can draw some veins using a darker shade of the same color. You can also add splotches of another color to each leaf. Try to use the same fall colors as before, however.

Use a Band-Aide after base coat is dry.",How to Make a Dotting Tool for Your Nails," These can be found at almost any store and come in many differently sized tops. Pull bobby pin open, then dip one end in the nail polish. Apply as required.


If the small plastic coating falls off, use another bobby pin. It's this part that forms the neat dot shape.;
, Hold carefully to avoid shake and apply as required.


Grab a small piece of paper and nail polish to test-drive the dotter. Before you apply polish to the nail, you’ll want to make sure you achieve a clean dot. After you dip the straight pinhead into the polish, press it onto the paper first to remove excess polish and to ensure you're going to get the look you want.
Consider using straight pins that have a variety of heads. Make different sized dots using tiny heads to larger straight pinheads.

, While you could just use the head of the straight pin to make small dots on your nails, joining the pin to a pencil with an eraser end will provide you with better leverage and balance. Insert straight pin into the pencil eraser head. You may need to put a little bit of muscle into this action in the event that the pin doesn’t easily penetrate the eraser.


Hold the pin on a flat surface, sharp side upward. Hold the pin at the bottom to so you can join the pencil eraser with the pin.
Grasp the pencil in your other hand (while holding the pin on the flat surface), eraser side downward, and press the eraser into the sharp side of the pin.
Drive the eraser into the pin until at least half of the pin has punctured the eraser.

, Once you're ready to use the dotter, dip the end into your favorite bottle of polish.


Apply the painted nail polish pin tip to your piece of paper and then to your nail. Repeat this process on the paper until you have painted on enough nail polish and have achieved look you want to achieve.

, Just flip the brush over and use the end of it. Easy!

, It would be a good idea to find one that is out of ink, but it will still work fine if you don't. Simply dip the end into the polish and apply as needed.

, You're thinking that the dot will be small, and that's correct. But if you hold down the toothpick long enough and use enough nail polish, the size of the dot will grow.

, This creates tidy little polka dots.

Put the Band-Aide on your nail and paint over it with the colour you want the polka dots to be! Once it dries, remove the band-aide.

Skipping this step can lead to chipped nails early on., Using a bright red polish, brush three thin layers of red nail polish onto each nail so that the color looks opaque. Avoid painting thick coats as they will dry very slowly. Wait until each layer of nail polish dries before starting on a new coat.You can also use other bright colors as the base coat if you don't like the classic ladybug red.

, Use either a nail art pen or a thin brush to paint a long stripe across the center of your fingernails.

Then, carefully apply the polish in between these lines with your nail art pen or brush, and pull off the nail tape while the paint is still wet., Place the guides at the ends of your nail so the curve points down and the end of your nail is visible above the guide. Do not do this until your nails have completely dried, as it could tear the polish underneath.

, Keep the tip guide on as you paint so when you remove it, you will have an even line. Remove the tip guide while the black polish is still wet to ensure that it doesn't stick to your nail.

Apply the basecoat color. Allow it to dry completely.
Dip a small brush, toothpick or pin into the polish you chose for the dots and lightly tap the implement on your nail. Continue doing this until your nail has as many dots as you want. For other effects, you can create dots of varying sizes by using thinner or thicker-tipped implements. To make fading or trailing dots, dip the implement in the paint once and apply several dots without reapplying paint. You can also use your fine-tipped implement to drag the paint out from the wet dot to create rays, swirls and other designs.
When the dots are dry, finish with a clear top coat.

, An arrangement of dots can be made to look like a flower. Choose three colors: a base coat color, a color for the center of the flowers, and a color for the petals.









Apply the basecoat. Allow it to dry completely.

, For this look choose two colors: a light and a dark. Try fuschia or orange and black.









Use the lighter color to make splotches on your nails. The shapes don't have to be uniform, just as leopard's spots aren't uniform.
When the splotches dry, draw ""C"" or ""U"" shapes around the outsides of the blobs using the darker color.

Apply a clear topcoat to seal in the base coat, and allow it to dry.
Apply a dot of the first swirl color using a toothpick.
Use a clean toothpick to apply a dot of the second swirl color on top of the first dot while the first dot is still wet.
Drag the colors outward together and create swirls using a clean toothpick, a striper brush or other implement. You can also create a marble effect by randomly placing several dots of the first swirl color on the nail, then placing several dots of the second swirl color around and on top of the first set of dots. Swirl the dots around and together by moving your implement in a criss-cross, S-shaped or figure-8 pattern.

, Ombre looks best with colors in the same color family, like purples and blues. For this look, you'll need three colors: a dark color, a medium color, and a light one.









Apply a coat of the darkest color to your nails and allow it to dry.
Dip a makeup sponge into a dark colored polish (only a dab of polish is needed on the sponge) and apply the medium color to the tips of your nails, starting at the tip and moving down to create a fading effect.
With a clean makeup sponge, dab the lightest color onto your nails in the same fashion, starting from the tip and fading downward toward the base of your nails. The resulting look should be bright-tipped nails that fade downward toward the darkest base coat color.
Apply a clear top coat while the polishes are still wet to more completely smear the colors together.

, In this case you'll need two or more colors: white, and another color or two of your choice.









Apply the white polish as the base coat.
Before the base coat dries, use a toothpick or other implement to place dots in another color or two on top of the base coat.
Dip a large brush in acetone and dab it onto the drops of polish. Use the acetone and the brush to thin and smear the dots over the white base coat. If you're successful, you'll have an impressionistic Monet-inspired design.
When the watercolor design is dry, apply a clear top coat.

, To simulate the look of acid-washed jeans, use blue and white polishes.


Use the blue color for the base coat. Allow it to dry and apply a clear topcoat.

, Continue adding drops in the same way, at the center of the circle of color, alternating the colors until you see a bulls-eye shape.








, Insert it in the water and drag it through the bulls-eye of color to create patterns. Spiderweb designs are popular, as are flower designs and geometric shapes. Don't go too far with the toothpick; if you blend the colors too much they won't be distinct from one another. If you create something with the toothpick and you don't like it, simply discard your first attempt and start over from the beginning.








, Spread petroleum jelly on the skin around your nails and onto your fingers. Carefully place your nails against the design that you created and then submerge them slightly. Remove water from the nails. Blow off any water droplets and use a cotton swab or cotton ball (coated with acetone if necessary) to clean up the edges and remove polish from your fingers.

, With ombré nails, your base color is usually a white polish or the lightest color you plan to use for the ombré effect. A white polish will help colors seem more vibrant, but using the lightest of your planned ombré polishes will give a softer, more subtle ombré effect.Paint this background color on all of your nails.


For an opaque base, paint two coats of your base color. Allow the first coat to dry completely before adding the second coat.
To help your nails dry faster, it’s better to paint two thin coats of polish rather than one, thick and heavy coat of polish.

, Paint your ombré colors in straight, horizontal lines side-by-side across a small makeup sponge.The area of the sponge you paint should relatively be the same width as your nail. Start by painting a line across the width of the sponge with the lightest color of nail polish. Then paint with the next darkest color underneath the first color. Finally, paint the darkest color of polish underneath the second line of polish. Be sure that all the colors are painted right next to each other with no exposed sponge between the colors.Paint a couple coats of polish onto the sponge for each color so the polish is wet enough to stamp onto your nail.

Normally, two or three colors are used to create the ombré effect, but you can experiment with different colors and combinations to see what you like best.
It may help to dip the makeup sponge in water first before painting on the colors. Dip the makeup sponge into water. Wring out the sponge until approximately 80% of the water is removed.Then paint on the nail polish colors.
Dipping the sponge in water will prevent the sponge from absorbing too much polish and having the polish dry up too quickly on the sponge., Stamp the polish onto your nail by pressing the sponge (with the polish side down) on top of you nail repeatedly, lifting the sponge away every couple of stamps to check and see if the ombré is dark enough and to your liking./images/thumb/f/f8/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-5-Version-3.jpg

To prevent this you can edge the skin around your nails with a thin layer of petroleum jelly or place tape on the skin surrounding your nails.Otherwise; you can use nail polish remover to clean the sides of your nails later.
There is a lot of freedom with how you transfer the paint to your nail. You can adjust the placement of the sponge (stamping vertically on the length of your nail, tilting the sponge to specifically stamp on a certain color) to make your ombré effect unique and original., When you have finished the ombré effect on one nail, reload the polish onto the sponge, so the ombré colors remain wet and vibrant. Paint the nail polish colors in the same fashion as before, lining the sponge with the lightest color and moving down to the darkest. Make sure all the polish colors are side-by-side touching each other./images/thumb/6/6d/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-7-Version-3.jpg

Keep in mind, if you try to ombré you nails with a sponge that isn’t damp enough with polish, the dry sponge can actually pull off your base color coat and ruin your polish.If you stamp or roll your nails quickly, you most likely only need to add polish to the sponge for every other nail., Once you have given all of your nails adequate time to dry (about 10-15 minutes), add a top coat of clear polish to your nails. You might want to consider doing two coats of a top coat to smooth out your nails, since the sponging makes the surface of your nail a little stippled and bumpy./images/thumb/8/82/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-8-Version-3.jpg

, Use a small paintbrush or Q-Tip dipped in nail polish remover to swipe along the edges and cuticles of your nails./images/thumb/6/6b/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-9-Version-3.jpg

Consider pushing back your cuticles with a manicure stick to expose a bit more of your nail bed.You can also use your thumbnail from your other hand to push back your cuticles if you don’t have a manicure stick.

, Paint on a clear base coat to protect your nails from being stained by the color in colored nail polishes.A clear base helps to extend your manicure by making chips in the polish less prevalent.

Allow your clear base coat to dry about 5-10 minutes before applying any more nail polish.

, Paint all of your nails with your base color. Your base color can be whatever color you want; it’s really up to you. To get a solid base, consider painting on two lighter coats of polish as opposed to one, thick and heavy coat.Wait a few minutes in between coats (about 5-10 minutes), so the polish has a chance to dry completely.

/images/thumb/8/80/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg

Two light coats of polish will increase the opacity of the color without making the layers of polish gooey.

, Unscrew the brush from the bottle, and wipe the sides of the brush on the inside neck of the bottle to remove most of the glitter polish. You want tiny glitter on the brush for your first coat of glitter.Paint over your entire nail, making sure that the top portion of your nail near your cuticle is barely speckled with glitter. The bottom portion of your nail can have a bit more glitter since it will be layered with glitter anyhow./images/thumb/6/67/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/6/67/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg









Allow this first layer of glitter to dry for at least five minutes.

, Wipe off the brush a little less this time, so there is a little more glitter on the brush. Paint the lower half of your nail, focusing on applying more glitter toward the end tip of your nail.Allow your nails at least ten minutes to dry completely.


Obviously, you can make the bottom half of your nail as glittery as you would like. Just be sure the ombré glitter gradient transitions from thin to thick, smoothly.
You can always add another coat of glitter to the bottom 1/3 or 1/4 of your nail, but then you run the risk of having a very wet nail (full of layers of polish). A wet nail heavy with polish will take a long time to dry.
Experiment to see what you think looks best and works well regarding drying time.

, Paint on a clear topcoat to seal your nails and smooth out your nail surface./images/thumb/2/2c/Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-502px-Do-Ombre-Nails-Step-11-Version-2.jpg

You may consider adding two thin coats of your top coat, only because the glitter can make the surface of your nail quite bumpy. You want all the glitter to be covered, so the glitter doesn’t get caught on any clothing or scratches your skin.

, Your fingers are going to get messy, so make sure the nail polish won't stick to them. You can cover them with petroleum jelly, Elmer's glue, cuticle oil, or scotch tape.Cover your fingers at least up to the first joint, and the underside of your nail as well.








, A shot glass or a mini paper cup are about the right size. There's a chance this is permanently stained, so pick something you can throw away or keep as a permanent ""nail polish cup.""


Nail polish is toxic, but small quantities are not extremely dangerous.If you use a glass bowl and wash it thoroughly afterward, it's probably safe to use for other purposes.

, Cover your table with newspaper to catch spilled polish. This gets messier than nail painting.

, This should keep the nail polish together without making it set too quickly. You might need to try a couple times, with water slightly warm or cool.









Keep it about 3/4 full, to prevent spilling.
Filtered water seems to slow the drying of the nail polish, giving you more time., Choose at least two colors that stand out from each other. Have a few backup bottles in different brands just in case, since not all polish works as marbling. The marble effect uses a lot of nail polish, so stay on the cheaper side.


Use relatively new polish if you can. Old polish tends to set too quickly.
Unscrew all your lids and leave them loose, so you can do the next steps quickly., Hold the wand over the water surface and wait until a single drop falls. It should spread out a little across the surface. If it stays clumped in the center, rotate the glass until it thins slightly.









Some nail polishes sink. You might have to try a couple before you get a nice, floating circle.

, Pick up a second color and drop a new drop right in the center of the first circle. You can stop here, or keep going with more drops. Three or four drops is usually a good amount, but you can use up to 12.









If you only have two colors, use your first color again for the third drop.

, Carefully place a toothpick tip in the center of the inner ring.Drag it through the colors to create patterns. Don't take too long: you'll need to dip your nail in before it dries.









For a simple but beautiful pattern, draw lines outward from the same point, like sun rays.
For a tie dye look, move the toothpick in a spiral pattern.

, Slowly lower your nail onto the pattern on the water surface. Set it down straight on top. Hold it there long enough for the nail polish to stick. This can take a few seconds, or up to a full minute — you might have to experiment.








, Make sure you don't drag your nail through the polish on the way back up. The pattern should be on your nail.









If the nail polish around your finger has solidified, use a toothpick to break it apart before lifting your finger.

, Too much water can leave bubbles or gaps on your nail. Flick away the water droplets onto your newspaper.







, Wipe away the polish around your nail using a cotton swab. If you coated your finger thoroughly at the beginning, it shouldn't be too hard to clean. If the polish sticks to your skin, dip the swab in nail polish remover.









If you used tape, leave it on until the polish dries.
If you're not satisfied with the design, wipe it off and try again. You'll get better with practice.

, Spin a toothpick in the water and the nail polish will move to the edge of the cup, leaving you space to start on your next design. Repeat for as many nails as you like.









If there are still flecks of color on the water surface, add another drop of polish. Spread it out with your toothpick, let it dry for a few seconds, then pull it up. It should drag the flecks away with it., Seal it in to prevent chipping, and enjoy the beautiful patterns.

",How to Do Dip Dye Nails," This technique looks best on freshly groomed nails. Start by using a nail polish remover to take off the old polish.






;
, Shape your nails to make them uniform and neat. Since you're going to be using more than one color on each nail, try not to trim them too short. It's better to have a larger surface to work with.








, Base coats protect your nails from being stained or damaged by paint and glitter you apply. They are usually clear or clear blue, and you can buy them wherever you buy nail polish. Paint one layer of base polish and allow it to dry before you start the dip dye process.








, The ombre effect can be created with two, three or even more than three colors. Think of a rainbow that blends from one color to the next. Your only limitation is the size and the nail length.









Consider using acrylic nails if you want to add more colors. You can buy a longer length and add as many shades as you want.
Short nails look best with just two colors. If you try to add more, you risk having all the colors blend too much, and they might turn out looking smudged.

, The dip dye style looks great with a combination of dark and light colors. Pick a light or neutral base color and a darker color the lighter color will fade into. Consider the following color combinations:









White to pink to red. This sweet combination is easy to pull off and looks beautiful any time of year.
Silver to black. Give yourself an edgy look with a little sparkle by fading silver into black, purple or another dark color.
Your favorite team colors. Show that you're a fan by choosing your team's colors. You can dress them up with a little glitter after the dip dye is done.
Complementary colors. Have you ever heard of the color wheel? Artists use it to figure out which colors look best together. Colors opposite one another on the wheel, like purple and yellow or orange and blue, are more appealing to the eye.

, Choose the lightest or darkest color you want to create. Let the coat dry.









If you want the gradient to fade from dark at the bottom of your nails to light at the tips, use the darkest color as your base paint.
If you want the gradient to fade from light at the bottom of your nails to dark at the tips, use the lightest color as your base paint.

, It's important to get it a little wet so it doesn't absorb the nail polish too quickly. Wet it under the faucet and then squeeze it out well, so it's not holding too much water.









Choose a dense makeup sponge with a triangular shape. They're available at most drug stores.
If you don't have a makeup sponge, you can try using a kitchen sponge. Try to find one that doesn't have large holes, since you'll need an even surface.

, You'll be using the sponge as a stamp on the surface of your nail, so think about what order the colors should flow.









If your base paint is dark and you intend for the tips of your nails to be light, paint a stripe of your lightest nail color at the tip of the sponge. Paint the second-lightest color right below the lightest color. If you have more colors, continue painting stripes from light to dark.
If your base paint is light and you intend for the tips of your nails to be dark, paint a stripe of your darkest nail color at the tip of the sponge. Paint the second darkest color right below the darkest color. If you have more colors, continue painting strips from dark to light.

, Press the sponge lightly against a piece of paper or another flat surface. Dab the sponge in the same place a few times so the colors blend and you can see the ombre effect. Do you like the way the colors look?









Take care not to smear the stripes together too much. They should blend a little, but you should still be able to see the distinct colors.
If you're not happy with the colors, now is the time to change them. Wash out the sponge and paint the colors you want to use on your nails.

, Reapply the paint stripes on the sponge. Line up the tip of your sponge with the tip of your first nail, so the end of the top stripe is aligned with the end of your nail. Press the sponge against your nail to transfer the colors. Smudge the sponge up and down just a bit to blend the colors.









Make sure the sponge is lined up straight when you apply it, so the ombre effect does not end up looking crooked.













Continue stamping each nail this way, reapplying more nail polish to the sponge as needed.

, Use a cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover to carefully remove the nail polish from your fingers around your nails. If you're happy with the way your nails turned out, allow them to dry.








, Finish it off with a coat of clear polish to help your ombre look last longer. You could also add a layer of clear glitter polish for a striking effect.

If you have a moisturizing agent, such as lotion or oil, on your nail, the polish will not stick properly. Make sure that you’ve created a perfect canvas for your French manicure.





;
, For a classic French manicure, the base coat should be a nude or light pink color. The white tip is the star of the show, so the base coat is simply a neutral backdrop.To create a smooth base, paint your nails in three thick strokes. Do a stroke down the middle, and a stroke on either side.








If your base coat is very sheer, apply two coats. Allow your nails to dry completely between each coat.

, Be patient, and don’t rush this step. Because you will be applying adhesive tape to your nails, the polish needs to be absolutely dry. Watch TV, chat with a friend, or listen to music while you wait for the polish to dry. Check the status of your nails by very gently tapping the nail with the tip of your finger. If you aren’t sure if they’re dry, wait a bit longer. If you try to hurry your manicure, the tape will peel bits of the base coat right off.


If you're crunched for time, try blow drying your nails. Just make sure you use the cool setting on your dryer.
Drug stores sell nail polish drying sprays, so you can invest in one of those if you know you don't have the time to let your nails dry naturally. If you don't want to buy a spray specifically for your nails, regular old cooking spray can do the trick as well! Just make sure you wash your hands well afterwards, so your white polish is able to adhere properly to the nail., You can use any type of adhesive tape for this step, but Scotch tape will be most gentle on your base coat. Carefully place the tape so that about ¾ of your nail is covered, and make sure that the exposed tip is the proper width. Push the tape down firmly, so that it is a completely sealed barrier between the tip and the rest of the nail.







, Because the tape is in place, you don’t need to worry about perfectly staying in the lines. Paint in strokes going upwards to the tip of the nail. This will help make sure that white polish doesn’t leak under the strip of tape, ruining the crisp border you are trying to achieve.








, Again, this step is extremely important and should not be rushed. Your nails will look a bit funny covered in tape and messy white polish, but it is well worth the wait. If you try to remove the tape too early, you can peel off some of the white polish, creating sloppy, jagged borders. Distract yourself while you let the polish dry completely.

, Remove the tape very gently, so you don’t risk messing up any of your base coat or white tip. As you pull away the tip, you should expose a sharp, crisp border between the base coat and the tip of your nail. To seal in your beautiful manicure, apply a sheer top coat to the entire nail.







, The cuticle is the little piece of skin that connects your nail to your finger, and it is visible at the base of the nail. In order to give your polish a smooth, beautiful surface, you need to push back the cuticles so that they aren’t visible. You should do this step when your cuticles are soft and damp, such as right after the shower. You can also soak your fingers in a cuticle oil, or simply warm water, to make it much easier to push them back.








Don’t cut your cuticles. They serve as a barrier and protection against germs, and cutting them can lead to nasty nail issues.

, French manicures work well on nails that have a little bit of length, because the white tips will extend further from the fingers. However, you can create a French manicure on any length of nail. The key, however, is to make sure all of your nails are the same length. Your manicure will look a bit strange if your pointer finger nail is twice as long as your ring finger.


Trim cautiously, and be careful not to cut too short. When you file them later, they will get a bit shorter.
Don’t worry about trimming them into the perfect shape— that comes next. Just make sure that you have cut them all to the same length.

, Gently use a nail file to smooth and even out the ends of your nails. With the file, you can shape them into a rounded or more squared off tip.French manicures work on either shape, so just go with the one you find most aesthetically appealing.









Continuously examine your work to ensure that your nails are the same length and shape across the board.

Apply fresh top coat every couple days.",How to Give Yourself a Manicure Using Salon Techniques," Before you can apply a fresh color, you need to give yourself a blank canvas. When you choose a nail polish remover, look for one that is non-acetone. Acetone removers can be drying to your nails, and can potential cause flaking and damage. Using a durable paper towel or cotton pad, rub the nail polish remover into your nail until all of the polish is removed.Avoid using tissues or toilet paper, as they’re less durable than paper towel. They can shred and make a mess on your nails.;
, Depending on how much length you want to take off your nails, you may need a nail clipper and a file or simply a file. If you want to shorten your nails drastically, use the nail clippers to cut them down to the approximate length you desire. If you only want to shorten them a bit, just file them down a bit until you're happy with the length.

, Once your nails are the length that you prefer, use the nail file to gently create the shape you want. First, decide if you want your nails to have a squared edge or a more rounded shape. Using short strokes, carefully file the middle and sides of the nails until you’ve created the shape you want. Be careful to go slowly and gently so that you don’t accidentally file your nails shorter than you like., First, soak your hands in warm water for about ten minutes. For best results, mix a couple spoonfuls of cuticle oil, baby oil, lotion, or mild facial cleanser into the water.After you’ve finished soaking your nails, you're ready to push your cuticles. Grab a cuticle pushing tool, which can be found at your local drug store. Push back your cuticles from your nail. Do not cut or lift your cuticle, only push.The cuticle helps protect your nails from harmful bacteria, so be careful not to over-do this.

, If any of the oils are left on your nails, the nail polish won’t adhere to the nail as well. Use soap and water to make sure that your nails are completely free of residue, and then towel dry. If you want to ensure that your nails are completely clean, you can run a tissue with nail polish remover over each nail again., As the name implies, a base coat creates a smooth canvas for your colored polish to go on. Look for clear nail polishes at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store that are specifically labeled ""basecoat."" It also gives the color something to stick to, ensuring that your color lasts for as long as possible. Make sure you let the basecoat dry thoroughly before moving on.The basecoat can be especially helpful if you are going to use a dark polish. Dark polishes can stain your nails, but the basecoat will prevent this.

, When your basecoat is dry, it’s time for the fun part. The goal is to apply your nail polish in three smooth strokes. First, paint the center of your nail by sweeping the polish from the base of the nail to the tip. Then, do the same on both sides of your nail.Don’t overload the polish onto your brush. You want to apply thin strokes so that the polish doesn’t dry clumpy or overly thick.
If your nail polish is a light color, you may need to apply a second coat. Let your first coat dry thoroughly before applying your second.

, While solid color nails can be beautiful, salons often offer more intricate styles. The most common style you'll see in a salon is the French manicure. This can be a bit trickier to do at home, but certainly not impossible! You can learn everything you need to know about creating an at-home French manicure here.

, This step is entirely optional, but can take a manicure from ordinary to eye-catching. If you feel comfortable creating a design with your brush, go ahead! Otherwise, look for thin nail polish pens or polishes with special, thin brushes, sold at many pharmacies and beauty supply stores. These products are created for nail designs, and will allow you to draw designs carefully onto your nail.


If you don't have a nail polish pen, try creating a simple dot flower. Find something with a flat tip, like the rod of a Q-tip, a bobby pin, or even your polish brush, if it's small enough. Create one dot in the center of your nail, and then surround it with five other dots, or the ""petals.""

, Wait until your color has completely dried before applying. Think of your topcoat as a barrier over the colored polish. It will help keep it from chipping, thus keeping your manicure looking beautiful for longer.Apply the topcoat just as you applied the colored polish, with three smooth strokes.


A topcoat also helps keep your nails healthy by protecting them against the elements.

, Sometimes, this can be the trickiest part. You need to let your nails dry completely before you attempt to use your hands. If you don’t have a lot of extra time, choose quick-drying nail polishes to decrease this waiting period. You can also speed up drying time by using a blow dryer to blast your nails with air.Make sure that your blow dryer is set on “cool.” Hot air will actually keep the polish from solidifying, and can cause unsightly bubbles.
If you're in a time crunch, look for special nail polish drying sprays, sold at many pharmacies and beauty supply stores.

, Once your nails are completely dry, you can touch up any chips or mistakes you notice. You need to wait until you are certain that they are dry, however, or you will end up smudging and distorting your polish and making the situation worse. Lightly dip your brush into the polish and fix any little imperfections carefully., This is an easy tip to keep your nails looking glossy and fresh. Instead of completely removing your polish and starting from scratch when your nail polish starts to look dull, simply brush on a quick coat of topcoat. This will add the shine back into your nails and extend the life of your manicure."

You may also want to get a nude nail polish as the base color for your nails if you would like the cheetah print to pop. Leaving your nails bare and then applying the print is always an option but the nude will make the print stand out more.;

If you are using a base color, make sure you brush the color from the cuticle to the top of your nail. Always apply the polish from the middle of your nail to the outer sides.
Let your nails dry after the first coat. Then, apply the second coat. Try not to let the nail polish get cakey or thick on your nails, as you want a nice, even base coat.

, You should allow the base coat to dry completely before proceeding with the cheetah print. You may let your nails sit under a fan for 20-30 minutes so they are completely dry and ready for the cheetah print.You may decide to add one layer of quick dry top coat to smooth out the base coat and speed up the drying time. Only add a thin layer of top coat, as you do not want the base coat to get thick or clumpy.

, You will need to set up a palette of colors for the cheetah print so they are easy to access. Use the nail polish brush to put a small amount of the brown color on the piece of scrap paper. Then, put a small amount of the black color on the other end of the scrap paper. Make sure the two colors do not mix on the palette./images/thumb/f/f1/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-7-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/f/f1/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-7-Version-5.jpg









Start with a small amount of each color and then add more nail polish to the palette as you go. This will ensure the nail polish does not start to dry or get clumpy as you create the cheetah print on each nail.
If you are using bronze, gold, or another color for the brown part of the cheetah spots, pour out that color on the palette so it is ready to go.

, Take your dipping tool, such as a toothpick, and dab it into the brown color. Then, use the tool to add small dots of brown polish to your nail. The dots should be fairly wide, forming spots. You want to ensure there is enough space between the dots for the black semi-circles so leave a little room between each dot./images/thumb/e/e6/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-8-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-8-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e6/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-8-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-8-Version-5.jpg









Add small brown spots to all of your nails, using more brown color on your palette as necessary. Don’t worry about the dots appearing too perfect and round. They should look like spots, not polkadots.

, Once the brown spots have been added to your nails, you will need to add semi-circles in black around the spots. Clean the dipping tool with water and a paper towel or use a new toothpick. Dab your dipping tool into the black polish and draw a small “C” or semi-circle around the edge of the brown dot. You want the semi-circle to be thin and flush to the brown dot./images/thumb/8/8b/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-9-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/8/8b/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-9-Version-4.jpg









Add semi-circles to all the brown dots on your nails, making sure they appear as small “C”s that are thin and flush to the brown dot. Check that the semi-circles do not touch each other, as you do not want the cheetah spots to blend together. There should be a small amount of space between each semi-circle on your nail.

, Now that you have your cheetah spots, you can add smaller dots in the empty spaces around the black circles to fill them. You can use black polish or brown polish to fill in the spaces. Clean off the dipping tool with water and add your chosen color to your palette. Then, use the dipping tool to add smaller dots around the cheetah spots./images/thumb/9/94/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-10-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/9/94/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-10-Version-3.jpg









Do this for all of your nails. Do not worry about the dots appearing perfectly round or the same size. They can be small dabs or dots, as long as they fill up the empty spaces between the spots.

, Let the cheetah spots dry under a fan for 20 to 30 minutes. Then, seal in the cheetah print with a clear top coat./images/thumb/d/dd/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-11-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/d/dd/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-11-Version-3.jpg









You can touch up your cheetah print nails if they start to chip using the dipping tool and more brown and black polish. These nails should look good for a few days, with minimal wear and tear on your hands.

Remove all existing nail polish from your nails.,
Choose three contrasting nail polish colors.,
Paint your nails with the lightest color.",How to Color Block Your Nails1," Use a little nail polish remover on a cotton round to wipe any existing nail polish from your nails. If necessary, clip and file your nails to achieve the desired shape. Then, paint all of your nails with a clear base coat.









The base coat will provide a smooth surface for the polish and will also protect your nails from becoming stained by the strong colors.













A quick dry base coat that will also double up as a top coat is a good option.;
, The bolder the color choices, the more your nails will pop! You will also want to make sure that at least two of the nail polishes are fairly heavy, so when you're layering the colors you won't see the base coat underneath.









If you really want to add wow factor, think about incorporating a shimmering silver or gold polish into the mix.
Good color combos include: pink, silver and red; pink, yellow and blue; gold, green and red; or white, red and purple. But it's really a matter of personal preference!

, It's important that you always apply the lightest color of the three first. Firstly, a lighter color won't work as well on top of a darker one, and secondly, the light base will allow the other colors to really stand out. Depending on the nail polish, you may need to apply more than one layer of this base color to achieve the desired effect. Once the nail polish is dry, you can apply a layer of clear top coat to add shine to your base color.









When painting your nails, try to follow the three stripe rule: first paint a vertical line down the center of your nail, then paint two more lines on either side of the central stripe. If you use broad strokes, this should be enough to cover your whole nail.
Remember that it's always better to apply multiple thin layers than one thick layer of polish. This is because the thin coats dry much faster and are less prone to smudging than thick layers.

Choose which color blocking method you want to use.,
Make your first block.,
Fill in the second color.,
Make the second block.,
Fill in the third color.,
Clean up.,
Finish off with a top coat.,
Experiment with different colors and shapes.",How to Color Block Your Nails2," There are two main ways to color block your nails:

The first involves using sticky tape to create clean lines on the nails. This is a very easy method, but it's very important that your base color is completely dry before you apply the tape, otherwise you might ruin the polish.













The second method involves painting the color blocks yourself using a very thin art store paint brush (or the nail polish brush itself). This involves less effort than the sticky tape method but requires a very steady hand!














, Now it's time to do your first color block! If you're using sticky tape, tear off a piece approximately an inch long and place the tape on your nail diagonally, sectioning off a part of your nail. If you're using a brush, dip the brush in the second color and carefully paint a diagonal line across your nail, in whatever direction you like. Make this line as straight as you possibly can, otherwise the color blocking will look messy.









Do the same thing for each of your nails, whichever method you choose. The diagonal lines should be going in a different direction on each nail -- they shouldn't be uniform. Remember that they will eventually form triangles.
If you're using the sticky tape, a good tip is to dab the sticky side against the back of your hand a couple of times before you attach it to your nail. This will remove the excess stickiness and prevent the tape from ripping off your polish.

, Once you have your outline, you can fill in that section of your nail with the second color. If you're using the tape, fill in the exposed space on your nail, allowing the polish to overlap on the paint slightly. This will give you a really clean line. If you're using the brush, fill in the color below (or above) the line you painted in the previous step, being very careful not to go over the line.









Make sure the tape is lying flat against your fingernail, otherwise some polish could creep in underneath and ruin your clean line. Once you have filled in the color, allow the polish to set for 30 seconds before pulling the tape off. Then allow the polish to dry completely.
When the second color has dried completely, you can apply another layer of top coat to set the polish and add shine.














, Once your nails are completely dry, you can begin working on your second block. If using the tape, follow the same method as before, this time sectioning off a different part of the nail. If using a brush, dip it in your third color and draw another diagonal line, going in the opposite direction from the first line.








, Fill in your third and final color using the same method as outlined above. If using the tape, allow the paint to dry for 30 seconds before you pull off the tape. If using the brush, make sure to fill in your last color block very carefully to avoid going outside the lines.








, It's inevitable that you'll get at least some nail polish on your fingers when painting your nails, so take some time to clean it up before you show off your nails.









All you need to do is dip a q-tip (preferably one with a pointed end) into some nail polish remover and carefully go around the edges of your finger nails to remove any excess polish.
Try to do this as slowly and carefully as possible - you don't want to ruin all of your hard work by accidentally removing the polish on your nails!

, Once the last color has dried completely, finish off with a final layer of clear top coat to add strength and shine. Your color blocked nails are now ready to show off!








, Color blocking may take a little practice to get perfect, so while you're at it, why not experiment with lots of different color combinations and patterns?

For example, instead of creating triangles on your nails, try making squares! Simply paint your base color, then place the tape (or paint a line) vertically down the middle of each nail. Fill in the second color on the empty side, wait for it to dry, then place another piece of tape (or paint another line) horizontally across the nail. Carefully fill in one half of the exposed nail with a third color, to form two squares on one side of the nail and a rectangle on the other.













Another option, which is less time consuming, is to simply paint the tips of your nails a different color from the rest of the nails. Paint your base color as normal, then place a piece of tape near the top of each nail, only leaving the top exposed. Use a darker, contrasting color to fill in the tip, then remove the tape. Like a French manicure -- but with a funky twist!

Add glitter.",How to Give Yourself a Beach Inspired Manicure," This manicure is a beach scene. You’ll need polishes for sand and water. Use a tan or nude color for the sand, and then you will be blending the two blues (or even a green) together to create dimensional water. Feel free to use whichever shades you desire!;
, To create the background, you’ll be painting the polishes onto the sponge. Then, you’ll press the sponge onto your nail like a stamp. You can purchase wedge makeup sponges at your local pharmacy for very cheap. The square edge of a wedge sponge works perfectly for this technique.

, The sponge technique creates a beautiful effect, but it is likely to get nail polish all over the skin surrounding the nail. A peel-off latex product can be painted onto the skin around your nail to act as a barrier between the skin and polish. After stamping your nail, you can simply peel off the latex to expose clean skin.


If you don’t want to buy a new product and already have nail polish remover and a small brush or Q-tip, this can work as well.

, After you’ve created the beach scene, you can add beachy details. Invest in some nail art pens to make this easy – unless you’re skilled with a standard nail polish brush. Grab colors depending on the designs you want to create.


Colors like gold, coral, and brown can make starfish designs. Browns and greens can create palm trees. Grab a yellow or orange to make a sunshine. Get creative!

, The key to any good manicure is a good foundation. The base coat will help your manicure lasts for as long as possible. It helps the polish stick to your nail by creating a more adhesive surface for it. Paint it onto each of your nails, and allow it to dry thoroughly before moving on to the next step., This will be the canvas for your beach scene. The sponge gradient technique is not opaque, so you absolutely need the white background to achieve this look. Paint each nail, letting it dry thoroughly. You will apply a topcoat after you create the gradient, so don’t worry about that now., On the square tip of your makeup sponge, paint horizontal lines of polish. Paint a few strips of blue, and then a few strips of the tan color right above it. This stamp method is also used when doing an ombre manicure. It doesn’t have to be perfect – just make sure that when you stamp it onto your nail, you will have created a section of sand and a section of water.Paint your lighter blue color first, and then paint on a bit of your dark blue or green water accents over those strips.

, Carefully line the sponge up to your nail so that both blue and tan sections are pressing into it. Slowly remove the sponge. You may need to apply more polish to the sponge and press it onto the nail again, depending on how dark the polishes transfer. Continue doing this until you like how it looks.This beach-inspired manicure looks great with an accent nail, so feel free to skip the gradient on one of the nails and save that for your accent nail.

, Once you’ve sponge painted all your nails, allow them to dry fully. Then, paint them with a clear, no chip topcoat. This will prolong the life of your manicure by preventing it from chipping. It will also make your various gradient colors blend together even more seamlessly., Carefully remove the latex you painted on your skin around your nail. This will remove any of the gradient paint that got onto your skin. If you are choosing to use nail polish remover and a brush, carefully brush the paint off of your skin., While the gradient is beautiful by itself, it isn’t a complete beach scene. Using the nail art pens, start adding the special details. Create a small star in the sand to look like a starfish. Draw a palm tree along one side of your nail, creating palm leaves stretching over the top of your nail.You can add tiny fish in the water, or the reflection of the sun.


If you want to really define the sand and water, it can help to add a bit of “sea foam” where the tan and blue meet. On a piece of paper or another disposable surface, mix a bit of your blue and white nail polish. Don’t blend them completely – you want a tie dye effect. Then, paint the mixed colors where the “sand” and “water” meet on your nail, so it looks like waves crashing into the sand. Don’t paint it in a straight line, it should look messy and fluid!
There are plenty of different ways you can get creative with your nails, and endless inspiration on Pinterest.

, Accent nails are just what they sound like – one nail that looks different from the rest, a distinct little accent. These look great with your beachy manicure. For this nail, make sure to do something that goes along with the beach theme. For example, dark blue nail with a bright yellow sunshine, or a gold nail with a pink seahorse. These sound extremely difficult, but the nail art pens make it much easier to create designs. If you can draw a design with a pen, you can draw it with a nail art pen.


If you can’t manage to use the nail art pens or simply don’t want to spend the time, look for nail tattoos at your local beauty supply store. You can certainly find some great, beach inspired designs there!

, To add a bit more interest and glitz to your manicure, try stroking on a thin layer of glitter. If you apply it on the water, it will look like the sunlight hitting the water. Glitter can also add a bit of dimension to the sand. Either way, it’ll add some sparkle to your beautiful beach inspired manicure!

No getting up and sloshing around, no running around trying to time everything just rights – it's all just right there. Be sure to grab:


Your base coat, nail polish, and top coat
Nail polish remover
Cotton swabs
A small tray with warm water and soap
Moisturizer
Nail scissors
Nail file
Cuticle pusher or cuticle remover;
, Take a couple cotton balls, or a washcloth and dip it into a nail polish remover. Gently wipe away the nail polish, being sure to get into the nooks and crannies. Then, wash your hands real quick, just to get rid of the smell.


It's best to use 100% acetone. It'll smell and leave your friend's hands a little gray, but that comes off easily with soap and water (which you'll do next). 100% acetone makes the job go much, much quicker.Alternatively, you could use a dip-it tub of acetone. It's full of pink, rubbery bristles that do the job for you. Hard-to-get-off nail polish can even be gone in a couple of minutes with this kind of tub.

, Take a small tray and fill it with warm water (make sure it's not too hot). Add in a gentle soap that smells good and moisturizes the skin. This will help with the acetone odor and graying effect and loosen up the dead skin on the nails and cuticles.


If you'd like and have one available, consider using a scrubbing brush with the warm soap and water. This exfoliates the skin and leaves it bright and glowing.A mild face cleanser can work as your soap, too. Even a mild dish detergent can do the job.

, Most manicure trays are only for one hand at a time. So while one hand is soaking, you can massage and moisturize the other. Use a scented lotion or massage oil and rub the hand for a few minutes to give the other adequate time to soak.


After a few minutes, switch hands, placing the newly-moisturized hand into the tray of water. Spend a few minutes massaging the second hand, and then move onto the next step.

, Use a special nail trimmer to trim the skin around the cuticle. But be careful – too rough and you'll cause the cuticle to bleed. You could also use a cuticle remover gel. This is a liquid that should just be left on the skin for a few seconds. It eats away at the dead skin, making it easier to come off. It's good for callouses, too.


Be sure to time this right. You don't want to go so fast that you cut their skin and cause injury, but you don't want to go slow the other hand starts wrinkling. After a few minutes you may wish to take the other hand out of the water, pat it dry, and go back to finishing the first hand.

, Use a rubber cuticle pusher and gently push the cuticles back. This will make the nails appear longer and cleaner. Make sure all the loose skin is removed and give both hands a once-over.


Some people like to moisturize the cuticles after this stage. If you do this, just be sure you wipe off any residue with nail polish remover before you begin painting the nails.

, File the nails how your friend would like them. Curved? Square? Somewhere in between? Make sure they're uniform in length, too. Ask your friend what they like and go from there.


Be sure to file in one direction to keep the nail as strong as possible.Be sure to take your time; get too hasty and you'll end up making it shorter than intended – and then you'll have to shorten the rest, too.
An emery board (a nail file) with a grit of 240 is a good place to start if you're unsure., It's important to start off with a clear base coat applied thinly, smoothly, and carefully. Some base coats act as adhesives that help to retain the nail color and make it last longer, preventing chipping. Others are nail thickeners, which brittle nails sorely need. Talk to your friend – which is more up their alley?


Just one layer is plenty. Base coats also don't take that long to dry, so don't feel the need to take a break. By the time you hit the tenth nail, the first nail should be ready for color.

, Ask your friend which color they would like and begin applying two coats evenly on each nail. Make the layers thin – thin layers look better than one gloopy one. Start on the same finger as you did with the base coat and work your way over. Take your time, applying evenly and thoroughly. One swipe down the center, and one on the left and right for each finger.If you wind up getting color on the skin, take a small cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover and very carefully wipe it off, not touching the nail.
Alternatively, take your own nail to lightly scrape off the not-yet-dried nail polish as soon as it hits the wrong place.
Has your friend requested a French manicure? You can read about it here.

, The wide world of nail polish is getting wider and wider. If you have gems, tape, and other nail art equipment, why not try it out on your friend? You could also take a toothpick and make fancy designs. After all, the only way to improve is to practice.


If your friend isn't sure if they want nail art, suggest just doing it on one finger. They can try it out, and the one-finger look is actually super trendy if they wish to keep it that way.
Need ideas? Try reading wikiHow's article on how to do nail art.

, To seal in the color and prevent chipping, add on a topcoat. This also makes it super shiny and eye-catching. Keep this layer thin, however; another gloopy layer shiny though it may be won't make the nails look any better.


Your friend should reapply a topcoat every day or so if they want the color to last longer.

, If you're fancy, put your friend's nails under a small lamp, like a manicure lamp. Put on some music and come back to check their nails in about ten minutes. It's always better to spend a little longer in the heat than not enough time and have them smudge on the way out.

, Nothing is worse than going through all of the trouble to make beautiful nails, then having them destroyed a minute later. So if you can, put a fan in front of your nails and keep them there for about 20 minutes.


Blow dryers go a little bit faster if you're pressed for time. Turn the heat on medium and move the blow dryer back and forth, making sure the hot bursts of air reach every nail. After about five minutes, check the nails, and keep going if necessary.

, Are you killing time at a sleepover? As long as the person can sit still for 20 to 30 minutes, that'll be fine. Don't let her do much – pop in a movie, grab her a drink, and keep her away from the popcorn if need be. You've put way too much work in for them to be ruined on the spot!


Once dry, you may wish to moisturize a bit more, especially if you didn't do so after the cuticle stage.Use a nice scented lotion lightly over the fingers and into the cuticles, keeping them hydrated and healthy.

Peel or scrape the polish off once it’s time to remove it.",How to Remove Glitter Nail Polish," Get some nail polish remover, a cotton ball, and aluminum foil. If you don’t have aluminum foil, a rubber band or hair elastic will do the trick just as nicely. What you really want is something that will hold the cotton ball in place against your fingernail., Acetone is an extremely powerful solvent that can remove all types of nail polish. Use acetone-based remover in order to remove your glitter polish more effectively. While it’s powerful, it’s also harsh on your nails, so try to use it as infrequently as possible.







, Tear off a couple sheets of foil and tear each sheet into several pieces. Each piece should be about as big as your palm and in the shape of a rectangle.








You can also substitute the aluminum foil for ten small rubber bands or hair elastics.

, Press the cotton ball, saturated side down, onto your nail.







, Put the aluminum foil strip over the top of your finger so that it’s wider horizontally, and then wrap it firmly around your fingertip so that it won’t fall off. Putting the foil on will help to keep the cotton ball in place. Fold down any aluminum that’s extending past your nail.








If you’re using bands instead of foil, wrap a band around the cotton ball and your finger. If it is a large band, wrap it around multiple times until it is firmly against your finger so that the cotton ball won’t fall off.

, Let the polish sit for at least 5 minutes so that the remover can slowly loosen the glitter’s grip on your nail. This will help you to remove the polish later more effortlessly.If you’re in a rush, sit in the sunlight while you let your nails soak. The heat will slightly speed up the process, allowing you to remove the foil and cotton balls in 3-5 minutes., While applying a bit of pressure, drag the foil-wrapped cotton ball across and off your nail in one swift movement. This should take most if not all of the glitter polish off of your nails.







, If there is still a bit of glitter polish on your nails at this point, heavily saturate a couple more cotton balls in an acetone-based nail polish remover.








You can also use an exfoliating cotton makeup wipe. These wipes have ridges that make it possible to create more friction., Press down hard and rub your nail with the cotton ball wherever glitter polish remains. If one side of your cotton ball gets covered in glitter, flip to the other side and continue to scrub. Repeat this process for each nail, throwing away used cotton balls and soaking new ones as you go.








, If at this point some of your glitter polish still won’t come off, fill a small bowl that you can fit five fingers in at once with about two inches of non-acetone remover. Submerge all five fingertips on one of your hands in the liquid, and keep them there for 2 minutes. Remove your fingers and try using a cotton ball to rub off remaining polish.


If you still aren’t having any luck, submerge your fingertips for another 30 seconds. Repeat this process on your other hand., Before you put on glitter polish, track down an old, empty bottle of nail polish. Fill the bottle with nail polish remover and swirl it around, and then rinse it out thoroughly with hot water until it’s clean., Once it’s clean, fill the empty bottle up about ⅓ of the way with liquid school glue, such as Elmer’s. Add a little water to the glue and shake it up, so that it’s spreadable.







, Apply your glue base coat just like you would apply a regular base coat. Make sure you wait a solid 5 minutes for the glue to dry completely before you put your glitter polish on.









If the mixture looks particularly streaky while you’re applying it, you may need to add a little more glue, shake up the bottle, and try to apply it again.Regular showering and hand washing may break the glue down quickly. Use less glue in your mixture if you want your polish to stay on longer., Days later when you’re ready to remove your polish, you should be able to by simply peeling it off. If this doesn’t work, try scraping is off with a wooden nail stick.

A Q-Tip can help with hard-to-reach edges.
When choosing nail polish remover, be aware that those with acetone are more effective, but also more likely to damage your hands. Non-acetone nail polish removers are less strong, but also less harmful.There are also alternate options for nail polish remover.

Moisturize your hands to counteract the drying effects of the nail polish remover.;
, Use nail clippers to cut your nails straight across -- this is the healthiest way to clip, and you'll shape your nails later. A recommended length is to the edge of your toe., Get your nails to the desired shape. Be careful not to leave jagged edges, as they can uncomfortably scrape against shoes and socks.


Make sure your nail file is in good condition and hasn’t become dull.
The best filing technique is not to move your nail back and forth over the file, but to scrape the file in a single motion across the tip of your nail and repeat until you’ve finished., The nails on your toes are usually rougher than those on your fingers since they're always rubbing against socks and shoes. Use a nail buffer to smooth down ridges and grooves. Buffing helps remove any residuals left by your old pedicure and primes the nail to soak up the base coat., Wash with soap and water to get rid of the nail polish remover smell. Be sure to dry your feet before painting - water will dilute nail polish and ruin your pedicure., Choose a color you’ll love looking at - whether it’s your favorite color or something that matches your clothes.

, If toes touch each other, they can disturb wet nail polish - separating them will help you avoid this.

, Base coat makes your pedicure last longer, since it helps the colored polish adhere to your nails. It also keeps colored polish from leaving stains on your nails after removal..

, Transfer a bead of polish from the brush to your nail. Gently guide the polish to every part of your nail - you shouldn’t need more than three strokes.Be sure to use thin coats - thick coats can form air bubbles, and dry much slower.

, Using the same strategy, apply additional thin coats until your polish is as opaque as you would like.

Use a quick hot water rinse.,
Use a longer hot water soak.,
Use rubber bands for additional grip.,
Use nail polish remover to loosen dried polish.,
For extra-stuck bottles, use tools.,
Use polish remover to prevent sticking in the future.,
Don't bang the lid on a table.,
Don't force the lid open.,
Don't leave bottles open.",How to Open Stuck Nail Polish," This is a good first step when dealing with a stuck bottle of polish. It may not open all bottles, but it's quick and easy, so you can move on to something else if it doesn't work. To do this:


Run hot water from the tap — ideally, as hot as it will go.
Hold the lid of the stuck bottle under the water for 30 seconds, turning it slowly. Try not to let much of the water touch the bottle itself.
Dry the lid with a towel and try to twist it off. The heat from the water will expand the lid and soften dried nail polish, making it slightly easier to remove.;
, If a little hot water doesn't work, try using more time. Fill a cup with hot water, put it somewhere it's not likely to spill, and grab a timer. Follow these steps:Position the bottle upside down so that the lid (but not the rest of the bottle) is submerged in the water. If you need to, you can balance the bottle between two popsicle sticks laid across the top of the glass.
Let the bottle soak for five minutes.
Remove the bottle, dry with a towel, and try to twist the lid off.

, Sometimes, the problem isn't that you're not twisting hard enough, but that you can't get a good grip on the lid. One way to fix this is to wrap a rubber band or two around the lid. Get the bands as tight as possible — you can put a twist in them each time you wrap them around to get them extra tight. The gummy rubber texture of the bands should make it easier to get traction between your hands and the lid.








, If there is dry, caked-on polish at the base of the lid, you can use polish remover to dissolve it and loosen the lid. To do this:









Dip a Q-tip in nail polish remover (or, if you have it, pure acetone).
Turn the stuck bottle upside down. Use the Q-tip to apply polish remover in the gap between the cap and the bottle.
Give the polish remover a minute or two to dissolve the polish, then try removing the lid. Repeat as needed.

, If you're still having a hard time getting the lid off, you may need to use tools to help get a firm enough grip. Use caution here — heavy-duty metal tools can easily break the bottle and cause a spill if you use too much force. There are many possibilities — just a few ideas are below:









Use a nutcracker to grip the lid and twist.
Squeeze the lid in the jaws of an adjustable wrench, then use the wrench as a lever as you turn the lid.
Hold the bottle upside down and grab the lid in a vice. Turn the bottle itself, but be sure to remove it as soon as you feel the resistance give way to prevent a spill.

, Once you do get the lid off, this trick can keep you from having problems in the future. See below:








Set the open bottle in front of you.
Wet a tissue with a small amount of polish remover. Gently wipe the outside of the bottle neck with the tissue. Take care not to get any polish remover in the bottle.
Wipe with a dry part of the tissue to remove the dissolved polish. Repeat until the threads on the bottle neck are completely clean.

, This is a common tactic for stuck lids on glass jars with wide metal lids (like pickle jars, etc.), but it's a bad idea here. Nail polish bottles usually have lids made of plastic, so they won't deform the same way metal will if you bang them on a hard surface. If you do bang them hard enough to change the shape of the lid, you stand a good chance of breaking it, which will cause a spill.








, A bottle of polish that seems like it's impossible to open can be seriously aggravating, but losing your patience is a bad idea. Ripping or tearing the lid off with pliers, for instance, is a recipe for disaster — you'll likely break the lid and cause a spill. Trying to pry the lid off with a screwdriver or cut it off with sharp implements will usually lead to the same result. As a general rule, trying to get the lid off in any way other than twisting it the way it was meant to be twisted is a risky bet.







, Once you get the lid off, you may be tempted to leave it off (or leave it slightly unscrewed) so that it won't get stuck in the future. This is a bad idea. The lid is crucial for keeping the polish from coming in contact with air. If you let air into the bottle, the polish can dry up, making the polish useless. Instead, to prevent sticking, clean the bottle neck with polish remover and close it moderately tightly.

Choose a nail polish in the color of your choice.,
Pick a place to paint.,
Gather the necessary supplies.,
Take off any excess nail polish.,
Cut and/or file your nails.,
Push back your cuticles.,
Rub the bottle between your hands to warm the nail polish for about 25-30 seconds.",How to Paint Your Nails1,"


Choose a color that reflects your mood or matches what you're wearing that day. Remember that darker colors like purple, black or dark red will make your nails appear longer, so you should only choose these colors if you want your nails to look longer
Choose a nail polish that isn't too old - older nail polishes will become thick and gloopy and you'll find them harder to paint your nails with.
If you really want to salvage an old nail polish that has become thick, try adding a couple of drops of acetone nail polish remover to the bottle, twist the lid back on, and shake to combine. It is also possible to buy specialized nail polish thinners from some of the most popular brands.;
, When choosing a place to paint your nails, go for a clean, stable surface in a well-lit room. A study desk or the kitchen table are good options, just make sure to put some paper towel beneath your hand so you don't get any polish on the surface. The room should also be well ventilated, as fumes from nail polish and nail polish remover are not good for your health.








, Gather some cotton balls or rounds or professional tissues, some q-tips, nail polish remover, nail clippers, a nail file, a cuticle stick and a bottle of clear nail polish. Having all of these items easily at hand will speed up the nail painting process and minimize the chances of you smudging a nail.








, Soak a cotton ball in some nail polish remover and hold it against the nail for ten seconds. Then swipe the cotton ball along the nail to remove the polish. Use a q-tip soaked in nail polish remover to get rid of any polish trapped around the edges.It is recommended to use professional tissue instead of cotton balls as the tiny cotton pieces may get onto your nail if your nails have not dried.









Even if you don't have any nail polish on, you should still swipe some nail polish remover over your nails before you begin painting, to get rid of any natural oils on your nails. This will allow the polish to go on smoothly and help the color to last longer.

, Use the nail clippers to trim your nails if they are too long or have any uneven edges. You want all of your nails to be approximately the same length. Then use a nail file (glass ones work really well) to smooth and shape the edges of your nails. You can give your nails a rounded or a square finish, depending on your personal preference.









When filing your nails, rub the nail file from the outside of each nail to the center, doing each side of the nail separately. Each stroke should go in the same direction - you should never use a sawing motion when filing, as these may weaken and break the nails.

, Your cuticles are the little pieces of skin at the bottom of each nail. They can make your nail polish application look messy if they are not pushed back before you paint. Cuticles are easier to push back when they have been softened, so try soaking your nails in a small bowl of warm water for a minute or two first. Dry your hands and nails thoroughly, then use a cuticle stick to push the soft skin of each cuticle back to the edge of the nail.








, This helps to mix up the contents of the bottle, stirring up any color that has settled on the bottom. Don't shake it -- rolling the bottle instead will prevent bubbles from forming in the polish and keep your nails smooth.

Apply a base coat of clear nail polish.,
Press your hand firmly on the table.,
Open the bottle of colored polish and remove any excess from the brush.,
Place a drop of paint at the bottom of the nail.,
Use the three stripe rule.,
Allow the first coat of polish to dry before applying a second coat.,
Apply a clear top coat.,
Clean up any mess.",How to Paint Your Nails2," Applying a base coat of clear polish is one of the best things you can do when painting your nails. A base coat will give your chosen polish a smooth surface to stick to, will help the color last longer and will protect your nails from becoming stained by the colored polish. Allow the base coat to become fully dry to the touch before proceeding.









You don't need to be too careful when applying the base coat -- it's okay if some of the clear polish gets on your skin as nobody will be able to tell since there's no color!
There are two different types of specialized base coat polishes available - one is a ridge filler, which smooths the nails and provides an even, matte surface for painting on, the other is a strengthener, which protects the nails and helps them to grow longer and stronger. If you like, you can apply a layer of each!

, Don't just leave your hand resting on the table (as this might allow it to shake or move), actively press your hand down on the surface of the table, spreading your fingers wide apart. Start with your index finger, moving along each finger towards your pinky. Then lift your hand and rest your thumb on the edge of the table to paint your thumbnail.









In terms of whether you paint with your good hand or bad hand first, it doesn't really matter, do whatever you feel most comfortable with. Your bad hand is always going to be shakier to paint with than your good hand - but practice will help.

, Having the perfect amount of nail polish on your brush is one of the keys to perfectly painted nails. To achieve this, wipe the brush on the inner rim of the bottle to remove any excess - knowing exactly how much polish should be on your brush is a skill that comes with time!









Also take a look at the brush to see what shape it is. Most nail polish brushes used to be rounds, but more and more brands are introducing flatter style brushes, which allow for easier application and less mess.

, Position the nail polish brush at the bottom of your nail, just above the cuticle, directly in the center. Allow a drop of paint (enough to cover your whole nail) to fall on this spot and pool slightly at the bottom of the nail.









This is a technique used by professional manicurists, so it might take some practice, but eventually it will allow for the easiest and neatest polish application.

, Manicurists and beauty experts agree that the three stripe method is the easiest and most mess-free way to paint nails. To do it, dip the brush in the drop of paint at the bottom of your nail and draw the brush upwards in a straight line through the center of the nail, all the way to the tip. Return the brush to the paint at the bottom of the nail and follow the curve along the bottom of the nail to the left, before drawing a second line, all the way to the tip. Use the remaining polish to draw a third stripe on the right side of the nail.









You should have enough polish to cover the whole nail in a thin layer of color without having to dip your brush back in the bottle. If you apply too thick of a layer of polish, your nails will take much longer to dry and you will be much more likely to smudge them.
When painting the outer stripes, don't take the polish all the way to the sides of your nails -- leave a tiny gap between the nail and your fingers. The gap will barely be noticeable and you will avoid getting polish all over your hands.

, Nearly all nail polishes will require at least two layers, and some will need three. It is much better to apply several thin layers of polish than one thick one -- the results will be much neater and less inclined to smudge. You must allow the nail polish to dry completely between each application - this should take between five and ten minutes, depending on the brand of polish.









Apply the second layer of polish using the exact same method you used to apply the first. Try to be equally careful -- don't become impatient and try to finish the job quickly, or you might ruin your good work. Allow the second layer of polish to dry completely, then decide if you need to apply a third.
As you can see, painting your nails is time consuming, and you will need to allow yourself 30 minutes to an hour to do the job well. For this reason, it is a good idea to have prepared a snack/ gone to the bathroom/ turned on the TV before you begin painting your nails, so you won't be bored while waiting for your nails to dry.

, Once your second (or third) coat of polish is dry, you can apply a final top coat of clear polish. This will help to prevent the color from chipping and add extra shine. Apply the top coat over the colored paint, all the way to the tips, then go around the top of each nail and apply a little clear polish to the underside. This helps to prevent the color wearing from the top, while providing extra strength and support for long nails.








, Once your nails are painted and fully dry you can set about cleaning up any accidents that might have occurred along the way. To do this, simply dip a q-tip (preferably one with a pointed end) in some nail polish remover, then use it to go around the edges of each nail, removing any unwanted polish.









Make sure to do this slowly and carefully - if you try to do it too quickly the q-tip might slip and you'll end up with a polish-free streak across your perfectly painted nails!
Try to use a fresh q-tip for each nail - otherwise the excess polish on the end of the q-tip will just make more of a mess.

, Another popular nail effect that you can do at home is to ""crystallize"" your nails using glitter or coarse white sugar. While the clear top coating on your nails is still wet, sprinkle the glitter or sugar onto your nails. As the top coat dries, the little ""crystals"" will become attached to your nails and you'll have a really cool effect!








, Nail art encompasses a whole range of designs and techniques, many of which require a steady hand and lots of practice! With nail art you can create polka dot, flower, ladybug and bow designs just by using different colored polishes and a toothpick, or you can get even more creative and try gradient, acid-wash and water-color techniques to produce a unique, eye-catching look.








, Color blocking involves using two, three or more polishes of contrasting colors to create cool geometric shapes on each nail. You may want to use a thin paint brush, rather than the brush supplied with the polish, in order to effectively and neatly color block.








, A French manicure consists of natural-colored pink or peach polish topped off with bright white tips. It is an extremely sophisticated look, which can be achieved at home with a little practice.









Contrary to what you might think, the white tip is actually painted on first, using a special white polish provided in most home manicure kits. These kits may also provide adhesive strips which you can apply to your nails in order to get a perfectly straight white line across the tips. Otherwise you will need a very steady hand!
Once you have done the tips and they have completely dried, you can apply the natural colored polish over the white polish, before finishing your nails off with a clear top coat.

, Once you have the basic method of how to paint your nails, the possibilities are endless! Consider painting the galaxy on your nails, get feline fabulous with leopard print nails or be artsy and express yourself with splatter paint nails.

",How to Paint Your Nails With Shatter Polish," Wet a cotton ball with nail polish remover and remove any traces of polish from your fingernails. Be sure to work the cotton ball into the cuticle of the nail to get stubborn polish out of any creases where the nail meets the skin.






;
, Use a cuticle pusher to gently press the edges of your cuticles back, working from one side of each nail to the other. This lifts any dead skin that lays flat against the nail. Do this to all ten fingers.







, Use a nail file to shape your nails into a square or oval shape as you prefer. Use the coarse side of the board to even out nail length first. Then, using the finer, less coarse side of the board, rub the nail from one side to the other to create the shape you want.







, Use a nail buffer or the finer gritted side of the nail file to rub the top of each nail gently. This creates an etched surface that will help your polish adhere more fully, extending the life of your shatter manicure.







, Apply an even layer of base coat to all your nails using the polish’s built-in brush. Let this dry completely. This will create a good base for your shatter manicure.








A base coat protects your nails from staining that can occur when you apply color to the nail directly.

, Select the polish color you’d like to be the cracks of your shatter manicure. Apply the polish evenly by painting a stripe down the middle of your nail then filling in the gaps on either side. Do this on each nail, and let all your nails dry completely. Apply a second coat for more opacity as desired.








Since shatter polish creates such a busy effect, stick with a smooth, non-glittery solid color for your first experiment with this kind of polish. This will highlight the crackle effect as much as possible.

, The thinner the coat, the more crackled the effect will be. If the coat is thicker, there will be fewer cracks and the effect will be less obvious. Work quickly and avoid painting over areas you’ve already painted. Let the polish dry completely.








You can purchase shatter polish at your local beauty store or online.
The polish will create its signature shatter as it dries.

, Use a clear topcoat to seal your newly painted nails and protect them from chipping. This will extend the life of your manicure. Let the topcoat dry completely.

",How to Paint Nails with Your Nondominant Hand," Soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover, and gently rub the cotton ball on each individual nail to remove the existing nail polish. The cotton ball should be damp to the touch, but not dripping with nail polish remover.


You might have to apply a second round of nail polish remover if some polish or color staining remains after your first round of polish removal.
Dark nail polishes (black, blue, purple, brown) and polishes with red tones (red, dark red, magenta, plum) are notorious for being difficult to remove. These colors often require a couple rounds of nail polish remover to clear the nail completely of nail polish and color stain.;
, Nail polish remover can dry out your skin and nails, so consider using a lotion or moisturizer on your hands after removing your nail polish. Once you have completely rubbed in the moisturizer, use a cotton ball lightly dampened with nail polish remover to run over your nail surfaces, removing natural skin oil and oils from the moisturizer.Only remove the oils from your nail surfaces, as the polish will stick better to an oil-free surface.

, Apply a thin, clear base coat to all of your nails using just enough nail polish to evenly coat the surfaces of your nails. A base coat helps prevent color staining, protects your nails from drying agents within the color coat, gives the color coat a surface to anchor to, and provides a smooth surface to paint over with your color coat.A base coat is a chance to practice painting with your weaker hand, and it leaves no evidence of mess-ups since the base is a clear in color.

, A sparkly or glitter polish requires less accuracy since the base of the polish is mostly clear with flecks of glitter added in. When painting with a glitter polish, the polish that runs onto your skin is most likely going to be clear, or a sheer shade, which makes it less noticeable for mistake.Also, if a fleck of glitter finds its way onto your skin, it is very easy to pick off and fix the mistake.


Compared to solid colored polishes, mistakes with glitter polishes are harder to see, and less messy to clean up.

, Creating a polish barrier for your dominant hand is optional, but it could be very useful to people who are particularly unsteady with their weaker hand. This step is usually taken once your opposite hand has already been painted using your dominant hand. Use a Q-tip to apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly around your cuticle line, and sides of your nail bed.This creates a barrier that will prevent the polish from sticking to your skin if you paint off your nail.


When all of your nails are dry, wipe off the surrounding layer of petroleum jelly and any nail polish color on the jelly, for an even, clean finish.

, Open the nail polish and wipe one side of the flat edge of the brush on the inside of the neck of the bottle. Then, tap the other, opposite flat side of the brush (the side you didn’t wipe) on the neck of the bottle to remove any excess polish that could drip.Your brush should have a small dollop of nail polish on only one side of the brush, and the other side should be relatively free from polish.
The best nail polishing is done with a few light layers of polish rather than one or two gloppy layers. Light layers dry easily are less messy, and give you more control when painting on the nail polish.

, It could be awkward holding the small nail polish brush in your weaker hand, so experiment in finding a position that gives your support and comfort. Rest your elbow on a hard, flat surface to add stability to your hand while painting. Try to use your thumb and pointer finger to hold and grip the brush, using your middle finger for more support if need be.You want to hold the brush firmly but lightly, so your hand doesn’t shake with the pressure from your fingers.

, Place the brush in the center of your nail a few millimeters away from your cuticle. Touch the brush onto the nail, and push the brush up to meet the cuticle. Then pull the brush downward to the end of your nail, coating the entire middle section of your nail with polish. Repeat this process by adding a strip of nail polish on either side of the initial middle strip, to coat the entire nail in polish. Each side stroke will start where the first stroke did (in the middle of the nail), but they will follow the natural curve of the cuticle and sides of the nail.Repeat this painting process with the rest of your nails.


Rather than moving your painting hand (your less coordinated, non-dominant hand) to paint your nails, let your painted hand (your more controlled, dominant hand) do the moving. Try rotating your dominant hand, and tilting your fingers their side to reach all surfaces of the nail with polish.This allows for more control, and less movement with your weaker hand.
All your coats of polish (but especially the first coat) should be thin coats. You can increase the opacity of your nail polish with more coats of polish later on.
If you have applied too much polish to your nail, tap the tip of the brush on the inside neck of the nail polish bottle to the remove excess polish on the brush. Then try to spread out the rest of the polish that’s already on your nail.

, Instead of maneuvering your weaker hand to paint your nails, keep your weaker hand still in one, steady position, holding the brush, and pull your nail underneath the brush to cover it with paint. Have your weak hand resting on a hard surface (like a table) as you hold it still, and paint the your nails by dragging them underneath the brush.


This method requires no movement from your weaker hand, while your dominant hand does all the controlled movement.

, Allow your thumb nails to remain free from any nail polish until the rest of your nails are painted. Your thumb nails can be used to help clean up the rest of your nail edges by swiping and scraping along the sides of your cuticles and nail beds, precisely removing any excess polish.If you have wide thumbs, you may need to add more paint to the brush while painting, in order to coat the entire nail. Remember, you want thin coats of polish, so even if you have to dip the brush into the nail polish again, only add a little bit of polish.

, A top coat seals your polish, and gives a shiny smooth finish. You only need to do one top coat layer, but make it a good one by covering all areas of your nail, including the sides.


To help your polish last longer, try swiping the top coat over the front tip of you nail. This helps prevent the tips of your nail from chipping.
Again, just the like the base coat, the top coat clear in color. Any mistakes you make painting the top coat with your weaker hand, are less visible.

, If there is any remaining polish on the skin on the sides of your nail or on your cuticles and above, use a Q-Tip or a synthetic brush with a tapered edge to clean off the excess polish.Dip the Q-Tip or synthetic brush in the nail polish remover so it’s soaked, and then tap it on a paper towel. This ensures that the Q-Tip or synthetic brush is saturated with remover, but not dripping. Slowly run the Q-Tip or synthetic brush’s edge along the side or top of your nail to take off any unwanted nail polish. Wait for the remover to quickly dry.


A synthetic brush with a taped edge is useful for getting into the nooks and crannies along the sides of your nails.
It is very important to make sure there isn’t too much remover on the Q-Tip or synthetic brush, or else it will take off more polish than you want.

, Use the nail file to gently rub off and “file” away dried nail polish on the sides of your nail. The friction from the file will gently remove the nail polish remaining on your skin.


Be very careful when using this method. The file can brush up against your actual nail, and mess up your polish.

, With practice, holding the nail polish brush and painting with your non-dominant hand will get easier and easier.You can even try writing with your non-dominant hand in your free time to get more comfortable using that hand.

The key is to get comfortable with the pressure and stability needed to create precise, even strokes while painting your nails.,"

Pick the right polish.,
File your nails.,
Care for your cuticles.,
Clean and buffer your nails.,
Mix the polish.",How to Paint Nails Like a Pro in Minutes1," Not all polishes are created equal. Some have potentially harmful chemicals, and others just look downright bad. There are a number of things to keep in mind.


Use a B3F, or “3 free” nail polish and base/top coat. These polishes contain no formaldehyde, DBP, or toluene, and are becoming a standard in the industry. They are safer than polishes that contain these chemicals.Glittery polish lasts longer.When looking for white nail polish, find one that is thick and creamy, not opaque.
Quick-dry nail polish can be convenient, but it tends to dry out your nails.;
, Position the file between your skin and your nail, and move it in short, sharp strokes in one direction. Never file back and forth., Push them down with a wooden cuticle pusher, but never cut your cuticles.Soften them with cuticle cream or olive oil. Apply petroleum jelly to your cuticles and the skin around your nails to protect them from polish.

, Use a buffer to buff your nails gently in one direction, in small strokes. Work from cuticle to tip. Use a nail cleaner to remove any dirt from under your nails, and wash them with soap and warm water., Roll the nail polish container between your hands to mix the contents together. Do not shake it, as this creates bubbles that make application a challenge."

Clean off a polish brush.,
Paint your nails.",How to Mix Nail Polish1," Choose the two shades of nail polish you wish to mix. Mixing only two polish colors is recommended, because mixing more than two colors can make the mixture appear muddy. Normally, using nail polishes with the same base type (glitter, sheer, opaque, matte, etc.) makes for an overall better polish mixture.


Mixing primary colors is a good rule of thumb to follow when mixing colors.For example, to make a purple polish, mix together a red and blue polish. To make a green polish, mix together a yellow and blue polish.
Like colors tend to mix well too. For example, to make a hot orange, mix together a darker orange with a yellow. To make a lighter shade of pink, mix together a deeper pink with white polish.
Nail polishes of the same brand tend to blend together the best.That’s because every brand uses their own polish formula, and polishes of the same brand will most likely accept each other and combine well.;
, A plastic paint palette is one of the easiest surfaces to use and clean, but you can use any surface that is clean, flat, and you don't mind staining. Paper plates, wax paper sheets, and tin foil are all common surfaces used for mixing nail polish.Do not use a styrofoam surface for mixing. The nail polish will destroy the styrofoam and produce holes in the material.
You may want to put down a layer of newspaper underneath your workspace, in case of nail polish spills.

, Open one of the nail polishes you plan to mix, and without wiping the sides of the brush on the inside of the bottle, dab a drop of paint on your mixing surface. Repeat this until you have about five to 10 drops on the mixing surface. Then, open up the other bottle of nail polish, and again, without wiping the sides of the brush on the inside of the nail polish bottle, dab about five to 10 drops near the first pool of the nail polish.


Start out with only a few drops of each nail polish color so you don't waste polish if you don’t like the mixture., Use a toothpick to drag a little bit of both colors into the middle area between them, and gradually mix the two colors together.Mix in a little bit at a time until you get the color you want.


If you want a swirl of color, stop mixing before they're completely combined.
Once you’re satisfied with the mixture, consider writing down how much of each color you used so you can make it again later.

, This step is optional, but you can make your nail polish lighter or darker by adding a drop at a time of either the lighter color used to make the mixture, or the darker color.Consider adding a drop of white nail polish to make the mixture even lighter. However, avoid adding a drop of black nail polish to make the mixture darker, since the black will make the entire mixture have a black shading once it’s mixed in.
For a more sheer appearance, mix in a drop or two of clear nail polish.

, Remove the nail polish brush from the darker polish used to make the mixture. Wipe the sides of the brush on the inside of the nail polish bottom to remove any excess nail polish from the brush. Soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover. Fold the cotton ball over the brush and rub the cotton ball to remove the nail polish from the brush.


Once most of the nail polish is removed from the brush, inspect the bristles of the brush and pull off any cotton fibers. You don’t want stringy fibers getting stuck on your nails as you paint them.
Use the darker color’s nail polish brush to apply the mixed nail polish onto your nails. When you put the brush back into the bottle the mixed polish is less likely to contaminate the color of the darker polish than the lighter polish.

, Once you've achieved the color you want, paint your nails as usual with polish mixture. Once the polish is dried on your nails, apply a top coat of clear nail polish to protect your nails and make the polish last longer.If your mixing surface was disposable like a paper plate or a sheet of wax paper, throw it out in the garbage can.
If you used something like a plastic palette, use nail polish remover and a cotton ball to take off the nail polish, and wash the palette with soap and water.

Apply the polish in three coats.,
Use the 3-stroke application technique.,
Make sure your nails are dry before applying each new coat.",How to Paint Nails Like a Pro in Minutes2," Most of the time you will want a base coat, one layer of colored polish, and a topcoat. Sometimes very thin polishes will require a second coat of color before you apply the topcoat, but it is important to avoid using too much.If you are painting your nails a neon color, use a white base coat to make the color pop.You can use a clear polish with glitter as your topcoat for a little extra glitz. Glittery polishes also have the advantage of lasting longer., This is the technique that many professionals use. Done well, it makes the process of applying nail polish efficient and neat.Put a drop of polish at the base of the nail, slightly above the cuticle.
Push the drop back a bit with your brush until it is almost touching your cuticle, then pull it in a smooth, straight stroke to the tip of your nail.
Move the brush back to where you started, just above your cuticle. In another smooth stroke, swipe it over the curve of the left side of your nail.
Repeat the same process on the right side of your nail.
Erase any mistakes you make with a small brush (an old lip brush, for example) dipped in nail polish remover., Soak your fingertips in ice water to help your nails dry faster. Let them air dry for a couple minutes, then submerge them in ice water for a couple more. The cold will sting a bit, but your nails will dry much faster, enabling you to apply the next coat sooner. Dry them gently but thoroughly before applying a new coat."
"
Let your nails dry.,
Fix any smudges.,
Protect your polish.",How to Paint Nails Like a Pro in Minutes3," No matter what you do to try to speed the process up, nail polish needs some time to dry. Exposing them to too much wear and tear before they’re ready never ends well. There are a couple things you can do to speed things up.


Spray your nails with cooking oil to help the polish set faster, and protect against accidental smudging.Don’t use a fan. It may seem like a clever way to dry your nails quickly, but it can cause bubbles in your nail polish., It’s hard to be patient, and while soaking your nails in ice water does make the drying process faster, it always takes a while for freshly painted nails to truly set. Most people smudge their nails at some point in the drying process. If it happens to you, just wet a fingertip with your tongue, and gently smooth over the smudge. The moisture on your finger will help it slide easily, without leaving fingerprints., Painting new layers of topcoat onto your nails as time goes on can help protect them. Apply more a couple times a week to make your nail polish last longer without chipping.A quick-dry top coat is especially good for this."
"
Sponge paint your nails.,
Tape and paint your nails.,
Draw patterns on your nails.,
Marble your nails.",How to Mix Nail Polish2," Instead of mixing a new color of polish, you can paint the polish colors (or multiple colors) on a small makeup sponge, then place the sponge onto your nails and roll it to the sides of your nail, transferring the polish pattern.Use a Q-Tip dipped in nail polish remover to clean up the sides and edges of your nails.

, Paint a base coat of one color of nail polish, and let it dry completely. Then apply thin strips of tape onto your nails, and create a design with the tape (nail striping tape works best).Paint the space between each tape strip, using one color, or alternating between two or three.


While the nail polish is still relatively wet, remove the tape. Apply a base coat to protect your nails and help the design last longer., Paint your nails a solid color and let them dry. Use a second color of nail polish to dab on as a dot, or draw a thin line. Quickly take a toothpick and drag it through the wet polish, creating the design you want.This technique can use many different colors of polish depending on the design you are trying to make.

, Layer nail polish in a bottle. Take an empty bottle of nail polish and pour in several colors, one after the other. Do not shake the bottle. Dip the brush in, apply as usual, and you'll get a marbled effect.


The colors tend to be mix together fairly well with this method. If you want a more distinct marbling effect, try this technique using water.

You can keep your nails long, if desired, but dried polish is less likely to crack when applied to short, healthy nails. Ideally, you should only leave roughly 1/8 inch (3 mm) of the natural white nail tip.
File away any jagged edges using a nail file, as well. You can also use the file to help define the shape of each nail.
Apply the polish remover to your nails even if you don't have any polish on them. Doing so will strip away any oils, making it easier for the fresh polish to stick.;
, Carefully push back the cuticles around each nail using a cuticle pusher.


Use the rounded end of the pusher to work on the cuticle around the nail surface. Tilt it at an approximate 45-degree angle, then gently press the pusher into the cuticle and toward the edge of the nail.
Use the sharp end of the pusher to work into the cuticle around the corners of each nail, pushing them back from a 45-degree angle.
If the cuticles are too hard to push back, you may need to apply cuticle oil beforehand. Soaking your fingers in a bowl of warm water for three minutes should also help.

, Brush a clear base coat over each nail. Allow the base coat to completely dry before continuing.


Ideally, you should use an actual base coat formula instead of using clear or white nail polish. Base coats smooth out the surface of the nail more effectively than plain polishes do. Clear base coats are the easiest to paint over, but white base coats will also work.
Unless the product specifies otherwise, you must allow the base coat to finish drying before you add any normal polish over it.

, Select a main color for your gradient, then pour this nail polish into five separate wells of a small paint palette.


You only need to pour a small puddle of polish into each well. Each puddle should contain enough polish to cover two full nails.
When using standard polish formulas, you should be able to blend all of the polish gradient colors before applying them to your nails. If you opt for quick-drying formulas, however, it might be best to apply each gradient color set immediately after mixing the two involved shades. In that case, you should only work with two wells of color at any particular time.

, Use separate toothpicks to blend small amounts of black nail polish into three of the filled wells.Each of these wells should contain progressively darker shades when you finish.
Add one bead of black polish to the first of these wells, two beads of black polish to the second well, and three beads of black to the third well. Blend these wells thoroughly, making sure that no streaks of color remain visible when done. If the change in color is not as dark as you'd like, gradually add more black and mix again.
This tutorial uses three dark shades and two light shades, but if you'd prefer to use three light shades and only two dark shades, you'll only need to mix black into two of the filled wells. When the time comes, mix white into the remaining three wells instead of mixing it into only two.

, Use separate toothpicks to blend small amounts of white nail polish into the other two filled wells.


One of these wells should contain a color one shade lighter than the color in the other well.
Only add the white to the untouched wells of your original polish color. Add one bead of white to the first well and two beads to the second well. Mix each well thoroughly until no streaks remain. If the change in color is not as light as you'd like, gradually add more white to each well and mix again.

, Use scissors to carefully cut a clean cosmetic sponge into five pieces. Each piece should be roughly the same size as your nail, if not a little bigger.


You must use a plain cosmetic sponge. Other sponges can be too porous to hold the color correctly.
The five separate pieces will correspond to the five fingers of your hand, but each piece will cover the same finger of both hands. In other words, you'll use one piece for both thumbs, another piece for both index fingers, and so on.

, Dunk each piece of sponge into a small cup of water. Remove the sponges and squeeze out as much excess as possible.Only 20-percent of the water should remain after you squeeze out the sponges. Each piece of sponge needs to be moist, but it should not be dripping wet.
By using wet sponges, you'll prevent the sponge material from soaking up the nail polish too quickly. As a result, you can apply more color directly to the nail instead of losing it to the sponge.

, Apply a stripe of your darkest shade toward the edge of one sponge piece. Paint a stripe of the second darkest shade onto the same sponge, placing it directly next to the first stripe.


Note that this gradient will run in vertical stripes across your nails, so the stripes should be vertical instead of horizontal.
Use clean, separate nail polish brushes to paint both stripes to avoid contaminating the blended colors. If you need to use the same brush, thoroughly clean it with polish remover before dipping it into the second color, but do not get any remover into the polish itself.
Apply two coats of polish over each stripe. Doing so will make it easier for the polish to transfer over to your nail.

, Carefully dab the painted sponge onto a piece of scrap paper, continuing until the shared edge blends together.


You'll need to ""bounce"" the sponge up and down in the same spot to help blend the line. Only blend the colors well enough to blur the shared edge, though; both shades should ultimately remain separate and visible.

, Position the sponge color-side down over your first nail, then carefully press it directly onto that nail.Make sure that the color stripes run vertically. The blurred center line between both shades should roughly correspond to the vertical center of your nail, and the darker shade should point to the outside of your hand.
Give the sponge a relatively firm press to ensure even color transfer over the entire nail. Bounce it up and down, keeping it in the same general position each time, to help transfer the polish even more thoroughly.

, Working quickly, press the same sponge onto the same nail of your other hand, applying the gradient in the same manner.


By applying the first gradient set to both hands before progressing to the next set, it should be easier to maintain the same progression of color. If the polish in your paint palette were to dry before you can complete the nails on each hand, you may not be able to remix the same exact shade, and your gradient wouldn't match from hand to hand.

, Paint gradient stripes on each of the remaining four sponges and apply those stripes to your remaining nails. Work with one sponge at a time.If you started with your thumb nail, the progression should go as follows:

Thumb: darkest shade and second darkest shade
Index: second darkest shade and third darkest shade
Middle: third darkest shade and original color
Ring: original color and second lightest shade
Pinky: second lightest shade and lightest shade


If you started with your pinky nail, reverse the above progression.
Make sure that first color of each nail matches the second color of the previous nail. The progression of shades should look natural across the entire hand.

, Dip a clean nail polish brush or cotton swab into acetone nail polish remover. Carefully apply the remover to the skin around the nail.


This process is usually very messy, so even if you apply the gradient carefully, you'll probably get plenty of polish onto the surrounding skin.
Working while the polish is wet can make it easier to strip away the excess from your skin, but if you're nervous about cleaning up while the nails are still drying, you can save this step for last.

, Wait for the polish on all your nails to dry before continuing further.


The polish must be completely dry. If you continue while it still feels tacky, the polish could still smudge or smear.

, Evenly brush a clear top coat over each nail.


Ideally, you should use an actual top coat instead of using standard clear polish. The top coat can smooth out the surface and protect the color more effectively than ordinary polish does.
In addition to protecting your nails, the right top coat can also make the gradient appear smoother and more blended.

, Once the top coat dries, your manicure is finished and ready to show off.

Some finishes will draw more attention to your polish than others, so consider the type of statement that you want to make with your manicure.Creme nail polish is usually the standard option. It provides solid, shiny color that is ideal for both formal and casual occasions.
Metallic nail polish has a rich, shiny finish that resembles metal. It can be very striking, but metallic polishes have a tendency to streak so take your time when applying them.
Matte nail polish offers no shine, so the color has a natural appearance. It can be very chic, but also provides a low-key look that is ideal if you don’t want your polish to stand out too much.
Glitter nail polish provides large, eye-catching chunks of glitter than are usually suspended in a clear base. It offers an extremely striking look and can be layered over colored polish for a bolder look. The drawback to glitter polish, however, is that it can be extremely difficult to remove.

, While you can simply paint the polish over your nails as a solid color, you may want to add some flair to your look. Consider adding polka dots, stripes, or other patterns to your nails. You can also use nail gems and rhinestones to add some bling to your manicure.


You can add a pattern to all of your nails or to just a select few, such as the ring finger on each hand.
Nail polish pens often make it easier to add dots, stripes, and other designs to your nails. You can find them in a variety of shades to match any look.
To add polka dots to your nails, it helps to have a dotting tool that you dip in polish and press onto your nails. If you don’t have one, you can use a toothpick to carefully add dots to your nails.
For clean, even lines, it helps to use striping or medical tape, which won’t leave residue behind, to mark off your nails.
If you want to do nail artwork, such as paint shapes like hearts, stars, or flowers, purchase nail art brushes. They have fine tips, so you can be as precise as you need.
If you aren’t particularly artistic, you can buy nail stickers that often have fun shapes and designs that you can add to polished nails.

, In order for the polish to go on smoothly, your nails must be clean. Use nail polish remover to take off any old polish that may be on your nails. If your nails are bare, wash your hands to ensure that there is no dirt, oil, or other residue on your nails.Acetone-free polish remover is less drying on your nails and skin, so it’s usually a better choice. However, if you’re removing glitter or other difficult to take off polish, remover with acetone can take it off more easily.

, Once your nails are clean, you want to make sure that they’re in a flattering shape. Clip them if necessary, or use a crystal nail file or gentle emery board to file them into a flattering shape and to the length that you prefer.A slightly rounded shape is the most classic option. It helps elongate short or wide fingers, but it’s flattering on most people.
An oval shape works well if you have long nails or wide nail beds.
A square shape is most flattering on short nails or nails with wide beds.
A ""squoval"" shape, or a combination of the oval and square shapes, has a minimal look that is flattering on all hand and nail types.
The almond and stiletto nail shapes are more dramatic and tend to look best on long, slim fingers.

, When your nails are an appropriate shape and length, use a metal cuticle pusher from a manicure kit to carefully push back back the cuticle, or the thin band of skin at the bottom of the nail. Be careful not to push the cuticle too roughly, though, or it may affect nail growth.If you don’t have a metal cuticle pusher from a manicure kit, you can use an orange stick. It is made of wood and available at most drugstores and beauty supply stores.

, Even if your nails are in good shape, a base coat is an essential step in making your polish look great. It smooths the surface of your nails and provides a base for the polish to stick to. Paint a single layer of base coat on your nails before your polish and allow it to dry for 2 to 3 minutes.A base coat can also help your polish last longer on your nails and prevent dark polishes from staining your nails.

, Nail polish can sometimes separate when it sits in storage, so you should make sure it's mixed before applying it. Roll the bottle back and forth between your two hands to gently mix it.Never shake a bottle of nail polish to mix it. That can add air bubbles that lead to bumps when you paint on the polish.

, When you’re ready to paint your nails, pull the brush out of the bottle. Make sure that there is a decent size bead of polish on the brush so it will easily spread out once you touch the brush to your nail. Guide the bead so it applies near the base of your nail.To get the right amount of polish, pull the brush out of the bottle and wipe it off on the inside of the bottle's opening. Next, redip just the tip of the brush into the polish to get a precise bead that won't run down the brush and flood your cuticles when you apply it.
While you want a decent amount of polish on the brush, be sure that there isn’t too much. If you apply a thick layer of polish, it will be more likely to smudge, chip, or nick.

, When it comes to actually applying the polish, aim to do so in three single stripes. Starting at the base of your nail, apply a stroke on the left of the nail and one to the right. Finally, paint a stripe down the center of the nail so it’s completely covered.Don’t worry if the polish is streaky after you paint the stripes. Applying additional coats will help smooth out the finish.

, In most cases, your polish is going to require additional coats to get the finish or color depth that you want. For the best results, let the first coat of polish dry for 2 to 3 minutes before applying another coat.If you plan to use more than two coats of polish, let it dry for a couple of minutes between each coat.

, If you get any polish on your cuticles or the other skin surrounding the nail, pour a small amount of nail polish remover in the cap of its bottle. Dip a small, angled eyeliner brush into the remover, and run it along the skin to remove any stray bits of polish.Be sure the polish has dried for a couple of minutes before trying to correct mistakes. You may smudge the polish on the nail itself if it's still wet.
Check that your liner brush is clean before you dip in the nail polish remover.
If you don't have an eyeliner brush to use, a pointed cotton swab can also work well.

, Some polishes may apply streaky on the first coat or go on sheer so they require more polishes for opaque color. If your first coat doesn’t provide the coverage and finish that you want, apply a second coat just as you did the first.It’s best not to apply more than 3 coats of nail polish. The more polish that you apply, the more likely your nails are to smudge and chip.

, To ensure that your polish lasts for as long as possible, it’s essential to apply a top coat. The top coat also adds extra shine to your manicure for the most flattering look. After you’ve applied the final coat of polish, paint on a single layer of top coat.Read the top coat’s instructions to see when to apply it. You can apply some to wet polish because they actually help the polish dry faster. Other top coats require waiting for the polish to dry for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before applying them.
If you're wearing a matte polish, skip the top coat. It will add a shiny finish that will spoil the matte finish of the polish.

, You want your polish to dry as quickly as possible to avoid possible smudges and chips. To hurry the process along, dip your fingers in a bowl of cold water after you’ve applied the top coat. That will help the polish harden and dry more quickly.Don’t hold your fingers under cold running water. The force of the water can smudge or damage the polish’s finish.

, While cold water can help dry your polish more quickly, hot water can damage a manicure by causing the polish to bubble or smudge. Wait at least an hour after polishing your nails to take a hot shower., Nail polish typically appears to dry within 30 minutes. However, it can take up to 24 hours for it to set completely so you can damage your manicure if you toss and turn in bed right after you polish. To avoid smudges, try to polish your nails at least 2 to 3 hours before you plan to go to sleep.Setting your polish with cold water can help if you want to go bed shortly after painting your nails.

, Exposing your hands to hot water, harsh dish soaps, and other household cleansers can ruin a manicure. To preserve the look of your nail polish, always wear protective gloves when you’re doing house work, such as washing dishes."

, This is in case the nail polish spills and makes a mess.

, It may be tempting, but this will cause tiny bubbles to form in the nail polish. These bubbles will appear once you put the nail polish on, and they may even cause the manicure to chip sooner.









If you must shake the bottle in order to mix the pigments, do so, but wait 30 minutes before continuing on with your manicure. This will give the bubbles enough time to rise to the surface of the polish., This will warm up the bottle and remove any clumping of the paint. It will also help mix the pigments together. Place the bottle on the flat surface and hold it. You will be less likely to drop the bottle or spill the nail polish inside. Avoid opening the bottle over your lap or in mid-air.

, Try twisting it counter-clockwise first. If it doesn't open, twist it clockwise. If it still doesn't open, then it might be stuck. Click here to find out how to open a stuck nail polish bottle.

Keep the bottle to one side where it you don't accidentally bump it or knock it over while you're painting your nails.

, If the neck of the bottle has nail polish on it when you put the cap on, that nail polish will dry and glue the cap to the bottle. When you are done doing your manicure, check the bottle.

Buff the surface smooth.,
Use nail-polish remover to flatten the surface.,
Dab fresh nail polish over the chipped area.,
Apply a clear topcoat over the entire nail.",How to Fix a Chipped Manicure1," Look closely at the chip and you will see that the remaining polish is slightly raised up from the nailbed. The surface needs to be flattened before you can properly patch the chip. Use a fine-grit nail buffer or nail file to gently smooth out the line between your fingernail and the nail polish.Wash your hands immediately to remove the debris left behind by filing or buffing the nail.
If you paint straight over a chip without resurfacing your nail first, you’ll end up with lumpy-looking polish and an obvious imperfection.;
, Dip the end of a Q-tip into the polish remover and gently place it directly over the chip in your polish. Starting where the chip begins, lightly pull the head of the Q-tip to the end of your nail. This will fade out the edges of the chipped polish and leave you with a flattened surface.If you are sensitive to harsh chemicals, consider using an acetone-free polish remover., Use the same nail color as your original manicure (or as close as you can get). Working carefully, dab a small amount of the polish over the chipped area. You only need to pick up a tiny amount of polish, so wipe the brush off on the rim of the polish bottle before you dab the color on.


Allow the fresh polish to dry for one or two minutes.
Avoid repainting your entire nail with the polish, which can end up looking messy.

, Brush one thin layer of a quick-drying high-gloss topcoat formula onto your nail, starting at the cuticle and swiping out toward the nail tip. The topcoat will seamlessly blend the old and fresh polish together while disguising any visible imperfections.

Avoid using force to open a stuck bottle.,
Don't hit the cap against the counter.,
Wrap a rubber band around a cap.,
Use nail polish thinner to dissolve hardened polish.,
Use hot water to soften stuck nail polish.",How to Open Nail Polish2," If the cap won't twist off, don't force it open with your hands or pliers. This could cause the cap to snap off the bottle. It would also cause the cap to crack.







, Nail polish bottles are made out of glass. Whacking the cap against something might actually cause it to snap off, along with the neck of the bottle., A slippery cap can make a bottle of polish difficult to open, even if it isn't stuck. If you find that your fingers keep slipping, take a rubber band and wrap it around the cap. Place your fingers over the rubber band, and twist the cap. The rubber band will provide friction and give you a better grip.







, When a cap gets stuck onto a bottle, it's usually because nail polish got onto the neck and dried. You can dissolve it with nail polish thinner. Simply lay the bottle down on its side. Place five to six drops of nail polish thinner into the crack between the cap and the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down to get the thinner into the cap, then turn the bottle right-side-up. The cap should be easier to twist off now.








Avoid using acetone or nail polish remover. If acetone or nail polish remover get into the bottle, you could ruin your nail polish.

, Fill a cup or a small bowl with hot water. Hold the nail polish bottle upside down and dip the cap into the water. Wait three to five minutes, then pull the bottle out. The hot water should have softened the hardened polish up. Try opening the bottle now; the cap should twist off easily.








Try to get just the cap under the water, and not the entire bottle.

Snip off the chipped area.,
Conceal the chip with glitter nail polish.,
Use a different polish to create an accent nail.,
Use a black sharpie to fix chipped black nail polish.",How to Fix a Chipped Manicure2," The majority of chipping occurs at the top edge of the nail. In some cases you may be able to carefully snip off the chipped area using nail clippers. Cut as little of the nail length off as possible and then use a nail file to smooth out any rough edges. Apply a clear topcoat to the nail, making sure you run the brush around the sides and tip of the nail – this will seal it.Use the clippers to adjust the length of your other nails to match, if necessary.

, Apply one coat of glitter polish to all of your fingernails. Apply another coat over the chipped area to conceal it. For best results, use a dabbing motion rather than a brushing motion when applying the additional coat. For a slightly more subtle look, apply the glitter polish to the tips only, instead of covering your entire nail.Chunky glitter polish works the best for concealment. The chunkier pieces help to camouflage the chips and create texture.
To create a gradient ombre look, start in the middle of your nail and apply glitter polish from there to the tip.

, Remove the original polish from the chipped nail and then apply a base coat. Choose a metallic, glitter or contrasting color nail polish.. Apply two coats of the new polish to your nail. Finish it off with a quick-drying clear topcoat formula to seal the nail.The distinctive “accent” nail stands out as interesting and fun rather than damaged.

, If you need to fix a chipped black manicure in a pinch and you don’t have the nail polish on you, use a black permanent marker. Simply fill in the chipped areas with the black ink and give it a few seconds to dry completely. Then apply one coat of quick-drying clear top coat to the nail to seal it in."

Add an additional color to create a color-block effect.,
Use several different colors to create an abstract look.,
Apply a reverse French manicure.,
Add nail art elements.",How to Fix a Chipped Manicure3," Place a single piece of Scotch tape over the lower half of each fingernail, leaving the chipped tips exposed. The tape will protect the lower half of your nails from the new color. Choose another shade of polish for the tips. Apply the new shade to the exposed nail tips, which will create a color-block effect.When choosing the new polish, you can stay within the same color family or choose a contrasting hue for a more unique look.
Do not remove the tape until the new polish has dried completely.

, Choose three or four different nail polish colors, mixing and matching the hues in whatever way you see fit. Apply the polishes one at a time by swiping, drizzling, swirling and dabbing them on. Don’t worry about being too neat and tidy with this. The finished effect will resemble the abstract paintings made by Jackson Pollock, which featured splatters of many different colors of paint.If the abstract look isn’t for you, use a new polish color to create polka dots. A pointed cotton swab can help you create consistent-looking polka dots.

, Choose a nail polish in a contrasting hue and carefully paint one thin coat to the very edges of your nails. Do this to all of your nails, not just the chipped ones. Allow the tips to dry and apply a high-gloss topcoat over all of your nails.If you have chips on the sides of your nails rather than the tips, try a side-French manicure instead.


To create a side-French look: Apply an opaque nude nail polish down one side of each of your nails. Use a swift swiping motion for best results., Use superglue or nail glue to affix nail art, such as rhinestones or crystals, to your fingernails. These can completely obscure the chipped areas and other imperfections until you have time for another manicure. Check out nail stickers, too. If you apply nail stickers, don’t forget to top it all off with a quick-drying topcoat polish."

Finish your nails.",How to Do a Pedicure," For a good quality pedicure, you’ll need some basic toe-tampering supplies. Grab a tub and water for soaking, nail clippers, a nail file, a cuticle stick/orange stick, a nail buffer, a pumice stone or scrubbing brush, a clear top and base coat, and a polish color of choice. Optional additional supplies include bath salts for soaking your feet, cuticle trimmers, cuticle oil, and lotion for a massage afterwards., Although it may seem obvious, taking off your old nail polish is an important first step to giving yourself a pedicure. It’ll be hard to add a new color over the top of an old one! Use an acetone remover, making sure to get the bits along your cuticles as well.

, Fill a tub or basin with hot water, and if you’d like, a bit of bath salts or oils. Now it’s time to sit back and relax! Let your feet soak for 10 minutes; the hot water will soften tough calluses and remove the dirt and grime that might have built up. It will also help to soften your nails and cuticles, which is critical when you’re prepping to paint your toes.

, Start by trimming your nails down to size; use a pair of nail clippers to cut your toenails to be just short enough to see a bit of white at the tips. The shape of the nail should be slightly squared, following the natural topline of your toes. Use your nail file to buff down the sharp edges of nail the clippers might have left, and to do any further shaping you would like.


Avoid cutting your nails in a rounded shape, as this can promote ingrown toenails.
If you’re able, try filing your nails in the same direction to avoid splitting the layers and damaging your nails.

, Although this step is optional, it can go a long way in making your toes better prepared for painting. Use your orange stick/cuticle stick to gently push back the cuticle around each nail. If you have cuticle trimmers, gently cut away the excess cuticle skin that builds up over time. Rub on a little cuticle oil when you’re finished to supplement the sensitive skin with a bit of added moisture.

, Use your buffing pad to file down the ridges and rough edges on the tops of your nails. Pay particular attention to the edges that you’ve just trimmed or filed, as this area typically needs to be beveled a bit to create a level plane, so to speak. Use your buffing pad in the same direction and tilt the angle of it to reach the entirety of each toenail.

, Now it’s time to move onto your actual feet. Use your pumice stone to scrub down the calluses on the heel and ball of your foot. You shouldn't scrub too roughly in these areas because too much irritation causes the skin to respond by thickening to protect the delicate tissue underneath, and that becomes an endless cycle so gentle buffing on the surface with little or no pressure is best. When you’ve removed any dried skin or calluses, you can use a scrubbing brush to clean up your entire foot. Use the brush between your toes and all over the bridge of your foot, adding soap if you’d like a bit of an extra clean.


Be sure to rinse off your feet with a bit of water after scrubbing.
Avoid using a ‘cheese grater’ type tool on your calluses, as these have proven to be dangerous and can cause fungal infections.

, Remove your feet from the soaking tub completely and empty it out. Dry your feet off, and if you’d like, massage on a layer of lotion into your skin. If you choose to do this, use a bit of nail polish remover to clean up your nails again (the lotion can keep polish from sticking)., Use a clear nail polish as a protective base coat on all your toenails. This will prevent your nail polish from yellowing your toenails, as well as give your lacquer a solid base to stick to.

, Select a nail polish color, and paint each of your toenails. Start in the center of the nail near the cuticle, and use long brushstrokes towards the tip of each nail to fill in the color. Work from the center outwards until all your nails are filled in, using a fingernail or the edge of an orange stick to wipe off any polish that might have mistakenly gotten on your skin. You may need to add two coats of polish in order to get an opaque layer of color.

, Wait a few minutes for your polish to begin to dry, and add a clear top coat. This will set your polish in place, and help it to last longer without chipping. Then, protect your feet for 10-15 minutes while the polish completely dries. Test the polish with your finger to see if it is still tacky; when it is totally smooth to the touch and doesn’t smear under pressure, you’re finished! Go show off your cute new toes, and relish your soft new feet."

Check your cupboards for epsom salts, nail clippers, an emery board, a cuticle pusher, a file (or pumice stone), cuticle cream, toe separators, nail polish remover and nail polish.Although not all of these tools are absolutely required, having all of them will result in a salon-finish at-home pedicure, rather than an amateur one.;
, If you are lacking any of the above ingredients, visit your local beauty supply store and pick them up. Talk with the store clerks and ask which tools are best for at-home use versus salon use.


Some manicure and pedicure kits are designed for professionals, and will contain tools you will likely not use. Purchase the basic needs for your at-home pedicure, leaving salon-grade tools to the professionals.
Do not assume cheaper means better; although you do not need a set of professional pedicure set, you do not want a set that is flimsy, either. Test the strength of the tools, and make sure the metal is thick enough to resist bending.

, Purchase a clean bucket, if necessary, and some epsom salts for soaking your feet. Although you can use many things in the place of epsom salts, such as magnesium and specialized foot soaks, epsom salts are inexpensive, relaxing, and effective.Ideally, use a bucket that can house both of your feet simultaneously. Although you can soak one foot at a time, soaking both feet at the same time will be more comfortable and will make the process go by more quickly.

, Before you begin your pedicure, lay down a towel or two to catch any stray water, and to dry off your feet after your soak. Have an extra hand towel and old rag at the ready in case of spills or polish mishaps.


If possible, do your pedicure on a hard surface, such as tile or linoleum, as these are water-resistant. If you are working on carpet or wood, clean up any spills quickly.
Choose towels you don’t mind getting dirty or worn down. Although you will want to avoid a spill of any of your ingredients, they do happen, and both nail polish and nail polish remover stain fabric.

, At-home pedicures can involve 10-30 minutes of downtime. Grab a book, turn on some music, or turn on your favorite show to keep your mind engaged while you soak and clean.


If you struggle to multitask, put in some classical music to avoid cutting your nails too short or spilling your ingredients.

, You can use a body brush for this, or a specialized tool, such as a Ped Egg or pumice stone. Keep your foot over the water as you scrub, as some skin may fall to the ground. Pay particular attention to your heels and the edges of your big toes, as these are the most common hiding places for calluses and dead skin.Do not scrub until you feel pain; the idea is to remove dead skin, not still-living tissue. If you begin to feel pain or discomfort, you have removed the dead skin, and should move on to the next area.
While you may prefer to soak your feet first and scrub second, most callus removal tools are designed to be used on dry skin. If you choose to soak first, make sure your feet are completely dry before scrubbing.

, The bucket you use can be a cleaning bucket, or a foot spa specifically designed for soaking your feet--either one will work fine. Fill your bucket with hot water and salts, and allow the salts to dissolve.If you’d like a more relaxing foot bath, you can include a few drops of lavender or cedarwood oil, both of which are used to induce relaxation and may have antibacterial properties.

, Place your feet (or one foot at a time, if space does not permit both feet) into the bucket, and set a timer for 5-10 minutes, according to your preference.If you must do one foot at a time, be sure to complete the soaking and cleaning process entirely on one side before moving to the next.

, Clip your nails straight across to prevent the risk of ingrown toenails. Although you may be tempted to follow the natural curve of your nail, you run the risk of cutting too short, or encouraging nails to grow inward rather than outward.Make sure your clippers are not dull, as using dull clippers can also encourage ingrown toenails. If you find it difficult to cut through your nail, sharpen your clippers.

, Clipping your nails will likely remove some of the dirt and buildup deposited there, but you may still have some grime to remove. Clean your nails with soapy water (or the water from your soaking basin), until you no longer see any dirt or debris, and your nails are clean and light in color., Doing so will also minimize the risk of ingrown nails, and will give a smooth, rounded edge to otherwise-sharp nails. It seems small, but do not skip this step. Sharp, bumpy edges can lead to discomfort, as well as make the application of polish more difficult., Gently dry your feet with a towel, and apply oil or moisturizer to your feet, ankles, and calves. This is not the time for a quick run-over with lotion; instead, take the time to really massage your legs and feet.If your feet are naturally dry, use a thicker lotion or oil, such as olive oil. This will help seal in moisture and ward off calluses and dead skin buildup. If your feet are naturally oily or moist, a thin lotion or lighter oil such as coconut oil will be a better fit.

, Dab cuticle cream into the cuticles of all five of your toes. Start with one foot, then move to the other, and allow the cream to rest for 2-5 minutes, or as indicated by your particular brand’s instructions.Again, this is an important step. Failing to soften your cuticles with cream before pushing them down could result in tearing or otherwise damaging your nail and cuticle. Be sure to properly moisturize before working on your cuticles.

, After the cream has softened your cuticles, take your cuticle pusher and gently begin to press down, bringing your cuticles to the same level as the bottom of your nail., Remove any remaining lotion or cuticle cream, as both will interfere with the application of your polish. If need be, dip a rag into the epsom salt mixture and wipe your nails down first, to give the polish a dry, clean surface to grip.

, Separate your toes using a toe separator or rag to make application easier. Beginning in the middle of your nail, apply long, soft strokes to your nail, gradually moving outward, until all of the nail is covered. Move on to the next nail, allowing nails to dry fully before applying a second coat.Follow this pattern on each of your nails, no matter how small. Using this technique provides an even all-over application, and will prevent streaking and clumping.

, Once you have applied all coats, dry your nails using a specially-designed light, a hair dryer, or the most common method: letting your nails air dry for 10-20 minutes, or until the polish is no longer tacky to the touch.


Letting your nails dry properly will mean the difference between a long-lasting pedicure, and one that flakes or chips within a few days. If you do not let your polish dry completely between coats or before your topcoat, your polish will be prone to smudging and scraping.

, Apply a clear topcoat to keep color from chipping. If your nails are prone to breakage, apply a second layer after the first has dried. Swipe a thin strip over the top of your nail to seal in the tips of your nails and prevent chipping due to your nails striking against your shoes or floors.Choose a thin, clear topcoat. A heavy topcoat will only add bulk and increase the likelihood of smudging. If you do add a second layer of topcoat, keep the brushstrokes thin and long, and wipe any excess off of the brush before applying.

, To keep your pedicure lasting longer, wash and moisturize your feet regularly. Use a gentle cleanser and cleansing tool to avoid chipping polish, and avoid salt soaks until your next pedicure; the salt in the soak can tear at your polish.


If you shower daily, wash your feet daily and follow up with moisturizer. Even if you don’t shower daily, clean and moisturize your feet each night.

Investing in tools and products that will last months or years will definitely save you money in the long run. Have everything in one place before you get to work on your nails. Here's what you need:


Nail polish remover
Cotton balls
Cuticle pusher or orange stick
Nail trimmers
Nail buffer
Nail file
Cuticle oil or hand cream
Base coat
Nail color
Top coat;
, If you're wearing old polish, remove it with some nail polish remover and a cotton ball. If you're wearing acrylics or gels you don't want to keep, you'll need to remove those, too. After removing your polish, wash your nails and dry them completely before you begin the manicure process.









Look for a nail polish remover that doesn't contain acetone, an ingredient that can dry out your nails and make it more difficult to get them in tip-top manicure condition.If you're keeping your nails long, be sure to clean them well with soap and warm water.

, Use nail clippers to trim your nails to the length you want. Longer nails are pretty but difficult to maintain. If you want shorter nails, don't trim them to the quick. The whites of your nails should extend past the tips of your fingers. File your nails by gently dragging the file across the nail to make each nail look evenly shaped.








When you file your nails, be sure not to drag the file back and forth over your nails. Gently drag it in one direction only. This keeps the fibers in your nails from getting weak.
Popular nail shapes include square or oval tips. For square tips, level off the tips of your nails so that they're straight across with rounded edges. For oval tips. file your nails into gently tapered oval shapes that are rounded at the tips.

, Buffing smooths your nails and provides an even surface for your nail polish. Use the side of your buffer with the coarsest sandpaper first. Gently run it across the surface of your nails to smooth out the ridges. Do the same with the medium grade surface. Finish with the finest grade surface.








Don't press too hard or buff too much. You don't want to thin out the surface of your nails.
You can also wait to buff your nails after pushing back your cuticles. This is a good choice if your cuticles extend over a large portion of your nail.

, Soak your nails in a bowl of warm water for five minutes. Add a few drops of soap or scented oil if you'd like. This will soften your cuticles and make them easier to push back. Use the cuticle pusher to gently push your cuticles back toward your skin.








Don't push too hard. Try to keep from tearing your cuticles. You want to keep them intact because they protect your nail beds from getting infected.
Never use a cuticle trimmer. Manicurists often use these in salons, but they leave your fingers prone to infection. They also often cause bleeding. You can still get a beautiful manicure without trimming your cuticles.

, This is a good chance to give yourself a light hand massage, for a classic salon experience. Rub the oil or cream into your hands, fingers and nails. Let it soak in for about five minutes. When you're ready, take a cotton ball or cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover and run it over your nails to remove the extra oil or lotion and allow your nail polish to stick.








, Carefully cover each nail with your clear base coat to provide a good surface for your nail color. The base coat will help ensure that your color looks even and doesn't streak. Let your base coat dry for five minutes before continuing.









Base coat is usually clear, but sometimes it comes in a neutral shade. Either way is fine.
Some base coats dry with a slightly tacky surface. This helps the nail polish adhere to your nail.

, Roll the bottle between your hands for about 10 seconds to blend the color and remove any air bubbles. Open the bottle and paint your nails using a thin, even coat. Dip the brush into the bottle and swirl it against the rim of the opening to remove excess polish. You want to load one small bead of paint on the brush. Paint a vertical line down the middle of your nail. Paint stripes on either side to fill in your nail completely. Continue until your nails are all painted.








Shaking the bottle creates air bubbles, so make sure to roll it instead.
As you paint, hold the brush at a slight angle and press gently to fan out the brush bristles.
Avoid applying a large drop of paint and spreading it around. This will result in an uneven coat of paint.
Keep the finger you're painting steady against a table or work surface.

, The first coat should dry completely before you move on to the second coat. Paint your second coat in the exact same way. Start with one vertical stripe, then fill in the sides. Continue until your nails are all painted. Let the second coat dry completely before moving on.









The second coat will normally take longer to dry than the first one. Be patient at this stage.
You can help it along by holding your nails near (but not right next to) a fan.

, If you accidentally smeared a little nail polish on your skin, dip a cotton swab in some nail polish remover. Carefully rub it over the paint splotches to remove them. Avoid touching the cotton swab to your freshly painted nail.









You can buy touch-up pens that help you do this more precisely.
If you're right-handed and you're trying to use your left hand to touch up your right hand (or vice versa) steady your hand by resting it on a table.

, This is a clear, smooth coat that will help your manicure stay in place for at least a week. Skipping the top coat will result in a paint job that chips much more quickly. Apply the clear top coat to all of your nails. Let it dry completely. Your manicure is now finished.








At this point you can add extras like a stick-on or some gems.
You may want to paint a second top coat over any stick-ons you use.

, This classic style looks pretty for everyday wear or a special occasion. The bases of your nails are painted a neutral color, while the tips are painted white.








, This gorgeous look is not as hard to do as it might seem. Water marbling is a fun technique that incorporates more than one color for a beautiful impressionistic look.








, A painted color fade never goes out of style. It's a subtle way to have fun with your nails without going overboard with designs. Try fading your nails from white to red, yellow to green, or doing a full rainbow.








, Celebrate your favorite seasons and holidays with beautiful nail art. You can go with a simple holiday-themed color scheme, or try something more difficult like one of these designs:









Snowman nails
Easter bunny nails
Beach nails for summer
Spiderweb nails

, Do you adore pandas? Are you a flower child? Show off your personality by painting your nails in a nature-inspired pattern. Here are a few cute, easy designs to try out:

Apply your first color.,
Allow the first color to dry completely.,
Add a second coat.",How to Do a Reverse French Manicure2," You can choose whatever color combination you like for a reverse French manicure. The first layer of nail polish you add will be the color that shows up on the half-moon shapes near your nail bed.Apply one thin layer of this color to every nail. Move slowly to keep your nail polish smooth and even.

, You do not want to paint over your nails until one color has dried completely. If your nail polish is not dry, the band-aids you use later can peel off the polish.

Prep your nails by filing and buffing them.,
Apply a base coat.,
Apply 1 to 2 coats of your favorite nail polish color.You can use any color you want, but mirror powder tends to have the most sparkle when layered over dark colors, such as black.,
Let your nail polish dry or cure.,
Apply a top coat.,
Let the top coat dry or cure.,
Dip the tip of a foam, eyeshadow brush into the mirror powder.,
Gently tap the powder onto your nail, starting from the cuticle and working your way to the tip.,
Gently buff the powder in.,
Brush off the excess with a soft, fluffy, eyeshadow brush.,
Add a no-wipe or water-based top coat and let it cure or dry.,

Wait for the Sharpie to dry.,
Apply a layer of top coat and let it dry or cure.,
Consider adding some more designs, then seal them using more top coat.,
Clean it up.",How to Do a Manicure with Sharpie and Mirror Powder," At this point, you can also brush on some liquid latex or white school glue to the cuticle area around your nails. This way, once you are done with your manicure, all you have to do is peel off the liquid latex or glue off, and all of the excess powder, nail polish, and Sharpie will come right with it.

You can use this Sharpie-on-mirror powder technique on UV gel, non-UV gel, and regular nail polish.;
, This will protect your nails from staining and help the manicure last longer. Some people recommend applying two layers of base coat to further protect your nails from the Sharpie.Use a base coat suitable for the type of nail polish you will be using.

Gel nail polish can be a hassle to remove. If this bugs you, consider using a peel-off base coat.,

If you are new to this, or if you are using a non-UV gel (or regular nail polish), consider painting your nails silver. Nail artists find that mirror powder does not stick very well to these types of nail polish, so a silver base will help conceal any ""bare"" patches.

, If you are using UV gel nail polish, let it cure under a LED lamp, about 30 seconds. If you are using non-UV gel nail polish or regular nail polish, let it dry completely. You can speed up the drying process on regular nail polish by dipping them into icy water—just be sure to dry them off with a tissue afterwards!, The type of top coat you use is very important, because it is what allows the mirror powder to stick to your nails. Here are the recommended types of top coat for mirror powder manicures:

If you are using gel nail polish, apply a no-wipe top coat.If you are using regular nail polish, consider using a gel-like top coat or a quick dry top coat. Plan on doing one or two nails at a time.

, This step is very important, and you must be careful with the timing. If you don't let the top coat cure or dry long enough, it will be sticky, and you'll get a messy finish. If you wait too long, especially with the non-UV gel and regular top coat, the powder may not stick.

If you are using UV gel top coat, let it cure under an LED lamp for 30 to 60 seconds.
If you are using a non-UV gel top coat or a regular top coat, wait until it feels dry to the touch. It needs to feel rubbery, but not tacky or sticky.

, Use silver mirror powder, if you can. Sharpies are translucent, so the colors will show up the best against silver mirror powder (as opposed to other colors)., Manufacturers recommend that you use mirror powder on top of UV gel polish, but it is still possible to use it on top of non-UV and regular polish. It will not stick well at first, and it may smoosh around—just keep tapping it on., Your nail polish will still be wet and squishy underneath, so don't use a lot of pressure, or you may create dents. Every once in a while, stroke the powder downward, from the base to the tip of your nail. This will smooth the powder out and help it to lay flat against your nail.

If you are not using UV gel nail polish, this may take a while.
If the finish is not sparkly enough, apply one more coat of mirror powder using the same technique as before., Take a fluffy eyeshadow brush, and gently sweep it across your nails, from the cuticle to the tip. This will knock off any excess powder; it will also help further smooth the powder out., This will help seal in the mirror powder and protect it during the next step. Be careful with what type of top coat you are using, however; the wrong type of top coat can ruin all your hard work!

If you are using a UV gel nail polish, use a no-wipe top coat.
If you are using a non-UV or regular nail polish, use a water-based top coat and let it dry. Once it dries, brush on a layer of your usual top coat, and let it dry.

, You can use just about anything that is smooth and flat as your palette, such as a: piece of plastic, sheet of wax paper, plastic lid, or a plastic paint tray., You will be blending these colors together, so pick out colors that will blend well together. Avoid contrasting colors, as they may create a muddy effect. Here are some color samples for you:

Warm colors, such as: red, orange, yellow
Cool colors, such as: blue and purple or blue and turquoise
Analogous colors, such as: pink, blue, and purple.

, Keep some space between each color, so that they don't blend together. You will do all blending on the nail itself., You do not need a lot of rubbing alcohol. A single spritz or a drop of rubbing alcohol will be plenty., Again, do not blend the colors together. Simply swirl the brush around in the rubbing alcohol puddle to mix it into the Sharpie color. Think of it as mixing watercolor paints with water.

Keep a small jar of rubbing alcohol handy. Dip your brush into it to clean it between colors.

, You do not need a lot of color; a little bit goes a long way. Remember to clean your brush between colors, so that you don't transfer them., To create a tie dye effect, overlap the edges of the patches slightly.You can also blend and swirl the colors together., Because you used rubbing alcohol, this should not take very long; alcohol evaporates quickly. Avoid blowing on your nails, or your might spread the wet Sharpie ""paint"" around and mess up your design., If you are done with your manicure, be sure to extend the top coat over the tip of your nail. This will seal your manicure in, and prevent it from peeling later on., At this point, your manicure is complete, but you can also add on some extra designs. Your top coat must be dry/cured before you do them. Once you have added your designs, apply one last layer of top coat. Here are some ideas to get your started:

Place a vinyl nail stencil over your nail, then paint over it using nail polish. Peel the stencil off when you are done.Stamp on some designs using a nail stamping kit. Colors that work great include black, white, silver, or gold.Hand draw designs using black, silver, or gold Sharpie. You can also use black, white, silver, or gold nail polish and a striper brush., If you applied some white school glue or liquid latex in the beginning, now is the time to peel it off. If you didn't, use a Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol or acetone to wipe away any stray bits of nail polish or mirror powder.

For a super-neat finish, dip a striper brush into acetone, then trace your nail just inside the cuticle.

",How to Do a French Pedicure," Soak a cotton ball with nail polish remover and gently rub the cotton ball on the surface of the nail. Keep rubbing until you see that the polish is completely removed. You may need to use a bit of pressure to remove the polish entirely., Grab a bowl or plastic container large enough to place both of your feet inside. Fill it with warm water, taking care that it is not too hot that you could burn yourself. Stir in a cup of Epsom salts, which can be obtained at any grocery store in your area. Take a minute to enjoy the warmth of the water on your feet and relax.

, A pumice stone is used to gently slough off rough spots, making your feet nice and soft. Hold it firmly in one hand and use your free hand to hold your foot. Rub the pumice stone gently in one direction over any rough spots or calluses. You can use some pressure but it is not necessary to use a lot; the surface of the stone will take care of removing the rough skin., When finished with the pumice stone, rub your favorite softening lotion into your feet and legs to create soft, silky skin. Squirt a quarter-sized amount of lotion into the palm of your hands, then rub your hands together and begin applying the lotion to your legs. Rub your skin until the lotion has absorbed into the skin.

, Use a cuticle trimmer to cut off hangnails and dead skin around the beds of the nails. A cuticle trimmer will allow you to eliminate the dead skin without damaging the live tissue. Use with caution, as these are very sharp tools.Snip hangnails, which are the bits of dead skin that hang off the area of skin close the bed of the nail. Cut as close to the base of the hangnail as possible without damaging the live skin.
Trim any cuticles that are beginning to lift away from the nail bed. These are generally lighter in color than your natural skin and can be easily noticeable.
Be careful not to cut too deep with the cuticle trimmer, as you could end up bleeding. If this happens, put pressure on the area for a few minutes and and apply a bandage.

, These will prevent the nail polish from smudging against your other toes as you wait for it to dry. Toe separators can be purchased at any drug or beauty supply store near you. If you do not have any toe separators, you can place cotton balls between each toe to achieve the same effect.

, Use a white nail polish, such as OPI T71 “It’s in the Cloud,” and paint the tips of each toenail. It does not matter which polish you use for your French pedicure, as long as it is an opaque white. Let the first coat dry and then apply a second coat so that the color is more pigmented and doesn't look splotchy. Let the second coat dry as well.

, Pour 100% acetone in a small bowl. Dip a makeup concealer brush in the bowl containing the acetone. Blot the excess acetone on a paper towel.


Both of these things can be purchased at a beauty supply store, such as Sally’s or Ulta.

, Use the brush to begin removing excess white nail polish until you create a thin, straight line. The concealer brush is designed to help you create very straight lines. Move the brush slowly along the polished area to create the desired white French tip.

, Rather than using acetone to fix the white nail polish and create a straight line, a nail strip will help you to create a straight line with less fuss. These can be purchased at any drug or beauty supply store.Apply the nail strip a few millimeters away from the tip of your nail. These usually are made to peel off the packaging paper and stick to the surface of the nail.
Apply the nail polish to the portion of the nail above the strip. Don’t worry about mistakes; the strips are there to prevent mistakes and uneven lines.
Let the polish dry completely, then remove the strips.

, Take the large bowl or container that you initially soaked your feet in and fill it with cold water. To speed the drying process, slowly dip your feet in the ice cold water after the polish has hardened a bit. Keep them there for several minutes, or as long as you can bear. Doing this will also set the polish and make it more durable., Dip a concealer brush in acetone or nail polish remover. Tap the brush on some paper towel to remove any excess acetone. Use the brush to carefully clean up any edges or polish that got onto the skin. The concealer brush will allow you to effectively clean any edges without messing up the rest of your pedicure., Use your favorite top coat or a quick-drying top coat to cover the nails in one layer. This will finish off the look for your French-pedicured nails. You can also try a top coat that is slightly pink to go for a softer look. Let the top coat dry completely before putting your shoes on!

, A quick-dry nail spray will help your nail polish dry even faster and allow you to be on your way without worrying about smudging your pedicure. These quick-drying sprays have high levels of solvents that evaporate quickly. Hold the can a few inches away from the surface of the nails and spray over the nails quickly, without getting too much of the product on the nails.

, It is important to make sure that you are working in a well ventilated area when you mix the nail polish.Make sure that you mix the polish in a room that is well-ventilated, such as a garage with the door open or in a room with lots of windows.


Try opening a window and turning on a fan to ventilate a room.
Avoid working in small enclosed places, such as in a bathroom with no window.

, When working with chemicals, it is also important to work safely. To avoid spilling the white base or pigments on your furniture and carpets, place some newspaper or paper towels down before you start working.


You may also want to wear an old t-shirt to avoid staining your clothes.
Wear gloves as well to avoid getting the pigments or polish base on your hands.

, Take two of the stainless steel mixing balls and place them in an empty nail polish bottle. These will help to mix the nail polish ingredients in the nail polish bottle.








If you prefer to mix the nail polish in a separate bottle and then transfer it later, then place the balls in an empty mixing bottle and place two in the empty nail polish bottle as well.

, Place the end of the syringe over the opening of the white base bottle so that it covers it. Then, tip the bottle of white base while keeping the syringe pressed against the bottle. Use the syringe plunger to pull 10 mL of white base into the syringe.








If you do not have a syringe, then you can also measure out the white base with a teaspoon. 10 mL is about the same as two teaspoons.
Transfer the 10 mL of white base to your empty nail polish bottle or mixing bottle. You may want to use the small funnel if you are using teaspoons to measure the white base. If you are using the syringe, then you can just place the opening of the syringe over the opening of the bottle and depress the syringe.

, Next, measure out the thermal pigment and add it to bottle. You will need to add about two teaspoons of the pigment, but you can add a little more or less to adjust the color to your liking.








Use the funnel to make adding the pigment a little easier. Rinse and dry it first if you have already poured white base through it.

, After the white base and pigment are both in the bottle, place the cap on and close it tightly. Then begin mixing the pigment and base together by gently turning the bottle from side to side.








Do not shake the bottle up and down or you may create air bubbles.

, You will need to add a small amount of clear nail polish to the bottle next. This will help to give the nail polish some extra shine. Pour about 2 mL of clear nail polish into the bottle with the white base and pigment. Then mix the ingredients together.








You can use the syringe to pull 2 mL of clear polish and add it to the bottle, or measure out about ½ of a teaspoon of clear nail polish and add it to the bottle.

, After you finish mixing in the clear nail polish, your mood nail polish will be ready to use! Apply two to three coats of the nail polish to your fingernails or toenails. This will help to ensure that the color will be even and the color changes will be the most dramatic.








You can also apply a clear topcoat for a little extra shine. Try using a quick dry topcoat to help set your nail polish and speed up the drying process., Before you try touching your nails or immersing them in water to see the changes, allow the polish to dry completely. This may take up to an hour if you have applied three coats.








Your nails will feel slightly tacky if you run a finger across one of them when they are still wet. The nail polish smell also fades as the nail polish dries, so you can sniff your nails to see if they are dry. If there is no polish smell, then they are probably dry.
Try dipping your nails in ice-cold water for a couple of minutes to help set the nail polish.This will help to prevent damage to the nail polish and you can also see how the polish changes in cold water if you are feeling impatient.

, When the nail polish is dry, you can experiment with the mood nail polish to see how it changes in different temperatures. An easy way to do this is to hold your nails under warm or cold running water. Then pull them out of the stream to see how the color has changed.








Your nails may also change when you are outside on a hot or cold day. Try heading outside to see how the temperature changes your nail color.
You can also touch your nails with your hands or press them to another warm part of your body to change the color. Just make sure that the polish is totally dry first!

Rinse and dry nails.,
Apply gel resin to your nail.,
Dip nails in crystal powder.,
Spray with catalyst spray.,
Try mixing in glitter.,
Attach some jewels.,
Use nails stickers for accents.,
Reapply a layer of top coat every few days.,
Cut nails down as needed.,
Avoid harsh chemicals in cleaning products.,
Watch for when your nails grow out.",How to Do a Diamond Manicure," Before applying anything to your nails, make sure they are completely clean. Take a kitchen sponge or scrubber or a bath rag and buff the tops of your nails. This will help get rid of any dirt or debris that could interfere with the application of the diamond manicure.


This is also a good time to get the dirt out from under your nails. You can use a rag for this, or a nail file if you are finding the dirt hard to reach.;
, After your nails have been cleaned, cut and shape them into the style you want. There are a multitude of different nail shapes like round, square, oval, and stiletto. The style you choose may depend on the length of your natural nail. For example, if you have very short nails, it will be difficult to achieve the look of stiletto nails and you may want to stick with square or round tips.


Make sure the shape and length of your nails are even.
If you have fake nails, you can style them whichever way you like.

, Remove any residue left from filing and clipping your nails. First wipe down each nail with a dry cloth, then run them under warm water. You want to make sure there is no gritty material left to add bumps in the manicure. After you’re sure everything has been cleaned, gently dry your nails with a towel.

, Take a brush-on gel resin like IBD’s 5-second resin and apply it to each of your nails. Make sure to brush off any excess resin from the applicator before you start coating your nails, as it can cause coverage to be uneven. Start at the base of the cuticle and swipe up. Make sure each stroke is even and smooth. You should only need one coat, but feel free to apply a second if you feel your first coat was too thin.You can find resin gel at any beauty supply store like ULTA, Sephora, or Amazon.

, Once your nails have been coated in resin, prepare the diamond powder to dip them. This is an acrylic powder that adds durability and strength to your nails. You can find it online or at any store like ULTA, where beauty products are sold. It should come in a clear powder, however, you can also find diamond powder in different colors. To apply, simply open the four ounce container and dip your nail inside. Make sure to press down with the top of your nail first, lightly. The powder will adhere to the resin immediately and you can remove your finger.You shouldn’t have to dip your nail into the powder more than once, though it can take practice.
Only do one finger at a time.

, This spray will help the resin set. Hold the bottle 16-18 inches away from your nails and press down on the pump to achieve an even spray. If you hold the bottle too close or don’t pump down hard enough, the product can glob onto your nails and cause divots.


Try pumping the spray into a sink or trash can a few times to make sure it’s spraying evenly.
The catalyst spray will help speed up the process of setting your nails. However, you still want to wait two to three minutes for them to set completely before doing anything that could potentially harm your manicure.
If you don’t have a catalyst spray, you can also use a top coat polish. Just make sure that you wait 10-15 minutes for this to dry completely., If you want a simple addition to your diamond manicure, try adding a coat of glittery polish. You can find glitter polish in a myriad of colors from metallic silvers and golds to brightly colored greens, blues, and reds. If you don’t want to paint over the diamond manicure, you can also find powder mixes that contain glitter in them. This will allow you to skip the extra step of applying glitter later on.

, Try adding some fake diamonds to the base or tips of your cuticles for a bit of extra glam. You can also try fake sapphires, rubies, and emeralds. These little gems can be attached with a bit of nail glue and tweezers. Put them on every nail or just one or two for a bit of character.


If you’re feeling adventurous, try coating an entire nail in tiny gems.

, One of the easiest ways to add designs or patterns to your nails is through nail stickers. They come in a multitude of shapes, sizes, and designs, and can be customized to fit your nail size. Try geometric shapes, floral prints, stripes, or polka dots. Sticking with a basic black or white is also a great way to keep the style versatile.

, To prevent chipping, add another layer of a clear top coat every three to four days. This will not only help prevent divots or cracks in your nails, but will also help keep them shiny., If the tips of your nails have chipped, clip them back into an even shape. Use a nail file to smooth out the edges and then apply a top coat to re-seal them.


Even if only one of your nails has chipped, be sure to cut back all of them. Having your nails at uneven lengths when manicured can look sloppy and unprofessional.

, Stick with mild soaps rather than the harsh alcohol content of hand sanitizer. This can dry out your nails and lead to chipping. Try wearing rubber gloves to protect your nails when doing dishes or cleaning around the house.

, As your nails grow, you will notice a gap forming between the base of the manicure and the base of your cuticle. When the gap is big enough to be seen readily by others, it's a good sign that you need a new manicure. However, you can maintain the nail in the meantime by sealing it with top coat.


You can also try something different like adding glitter or a different polish color to the base. This can create an ombre look."

Find an eyeshadow in the colour you want your nail polish.,
Crush the eyeshadow if necessary.,
Make a tiny funnel.,
Open the bottle of clear nail polish.,
Using the funnel, pour in the eyeshadow.,
Shake the bottle until the pigment is evenly distributed.",How to Make Your Own Nail Polish Color1," This can be a store bought one or an old one from home. Certain brands will mix up better than others, but all kinds will work. MAC and Makeup Geek brands mix quite nicely.








You can try to save some eyeshadow, but it's really a lot easier if you just destroy the entire thing. Because of this, pick one that you're not super attached to!;
, If your eyeshadow is a loose powder it is not necessary to crush it, but the solid blocks need to be crushed before they can be used. Put the eyeshadow into a plastic food bag and crush with a rolling pin. Crush until it is a fine powder with no lumps remaining, as any lumps will show up in the final product and make it look messy.









Be diligent with this. If it's not smooth when you dump it into your polish, it won't come out smooth on your fingers. Put the work in now to save yourself some grief later.

, This is a super easy feat -- just snip off a corner of an envelope or curl up a note card. Or if you have a small funnel already, fantastic. Lucky you!









You won't need the funnel ever again. If it's not beautiful, that's fine. Staple, glue, or tape it until it'll do the job.

, Position the funnel over the top. It should be in the neck of the bottle, but not emerged in the polish.









To avoid having your cup overflow, if you will, make sure your clear nail polish isn't entirely full. Half a bottle does well here.

, And if you have some glitter, add that too for a sparkly look. The more eyeshadow you add, the richer the color.









Did you catch that glitter part? Makes for a great addition! A contrasting color to your polish will stick out even more.













Add a couple of small steel ball bearings (if you have them) to the bottle. These make it easier to mix the polish, in addition to increasing the longevity of your polish.

, Then start painting on your masterpiece with a color you can name after yourself. You may need a couple of coats depending on the shade you want.









Some shadows will come out very matte. If that's not your style, just add a clear top coat on your nails to make them shiny.

Go for an 8-free polish.",How to Choose a Non‐Toxic Nail Polish1," Toluene, formaldehyde, and dibutyl phthalate are known as the “toxic trio.” Polishes labeled as 3-free are free of these chemicals, which can irritate your eyes, skin, nose, and throat and cause long-term damage to your body. For example, formaldehyde can cause cancer and toluene can damage your liver and kidneys.Brands including Essie and OPI specialize in 3-free polish.;
, Nail polish that is labeled as 5-free does not contain the “toxic trio,” but goes beyond avoiding these chemicals. Five-free nail polishes are free of formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, formaldehyde resin, and camphor.Bliss, Chanel, Dior, Jinsoon, and Nailing Hollywood make high quality 5-free nail polishes.

, Many companies are going beyond removing the toxic trio from their products. Nail polishes labeled as 7-free do not contain formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, formaldehyde resin, camphor, ethyl tosylamide, or xylene.Companies like Butter and Pacifica make 7-free polish.

, If you want to avoid a wide range of toxic ingredients in your nail polish, opt for an 8-free product. These nail polishes are free from formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, formaldehyde resin, camphor, xylene, ethyl tosylamide, and triphenyl phosphate.Try a polish from Smith & Cult, Butter, or Lakur for a reliable 8-free product.

Repeat the process for your other hand.,
Let your nails dry.",How to Make Matte Nail Polish1," Once you paint your nails, you will have to work quickly, or the polish will dry and become hard to work with. Here is a list of what you will need to have ready:


Basecoat and nail polish
Baking powder
Tightly-woven sifter
Small dish or container
Small, soft makeup brush;
, You will need to break up any clumps that are in the powder, or they will ruin the surface of your manicure. If you still see any clumps, break them up using a toothpick.

, Be sure to apply a basecoat first. Then, choose any nail polish you want, and paint your nails with it. Leave the other hand unpainted for now; this is so that the nail polish does not dry out too quickly.








, Dip the brush into the baking powder, then gently sweep the brush over the wet nail polish. The powder will stick to the polish. Dip the brush into the baking powder each time before you brush your nail with it. If you don't do this, the bristles will get caught in the wet polish and become ruin.








Make sure that your nails are evenly coated with the baking powder. If there are any gaps in the powder, there will be gaps in the matte effect.
Make sure that you are using a soft-bristled makeup brush. If the brush is too stiff, it may cause streaks in the manicure.

, This will be enough time for a thin layer of baking powder to sink into the nail polish, giving it a matte effect.

, Be sure to remove any specks of powder. Your nails should now be matte. If the powder has dried into the polish, dip the brush into some water and try brushing the powder off again. This should help remove the stuck powder.








, Apply a basecoat and some nail polish, then dust your nails with baking powder. Brush the powder off using a clean brush.








, Your nail polish may still look glossy while wet, so it may be a good idea to let it dry completely in order to see the final results. Also, you might want to avoid using a topcoat. Most topcoats are glossy, and will take away the effect. If you can find a matte one, then use that.

Repeat for each nail, including the thumbnails.
Label each tracing, so that you remember which nail strip goes back on which nail, for both right and left hands.

, Take the bag you've just added all the nail tracings to and flip it over the the non-marked side. This is the side you'll be painting on.


You don't have to flip over the bag; however, you may not want the marker showing through the nail polish, so it's recommended that you flip it over.

, Use the color of nail polish you'd like to wear for this set of nail strips. Color neatly within the confines of each nail shape traced onto the plastic bag.

, This is optional but it's here that you can really start to have fun and be very imaginative. For the purposes of this article, a very simple design is created to explain how to do it. However, you can use far more detailed and intricate designs when you get used to the process, depending on how artistic you would like the nails to be.

,


Note: You will need the thin designing brush with the desired nail polish color you want, or you will need a store bought nail polish design bottle.

, For example, a contrasting white. Use this color to paint on two fanning lines, placed in between the black lines you made in the previous step.

, Take silver glitter polish and made several dots along one of the white fanning lines.

,, Twenty four hours is a decent amount of time to allow to pass, just to be sure they're fully dry. You may think they're dry earlier but this amount of nail polish takes at least 24 hours to dry fully. If they're not completely dried before attempting to use them, the nail polish will most likely crumble in your hands and you will have to start all over!

, Make a note of the marker indicator to which each nail relates to, so that you can be sure of adding the right strip to the right nail. You can do this by typing up, then printing out the nail names in a row, then placing each cut-out nail strip under its relevant name along the printed row. You're now ready to apply the nail strips.

,;
, It is best to do one nail at a time, so that the base coat is fresh and acts like glue.

, Press down.

,, The top coat should be applied generously, as it both seals and protects each nail strip.

",How to Make Your Own Nail Polish Color2," Crush it up with the end of a paintbrush, a rolling pin, your shoe, the palm of your hand, a hammer, or some other hard object. Get it powdery. The more powdery the better. You don't want chunks on your fingernails.









The only thing you need be wary of is punching a hole accidentally in the bag. That's equivalent to a DIY Hindenburg.

, If you have a teeny spice jar or empty pigment jar, that's perfect. Or hey, use your old eyeshadow compact!








, Keep to a 1:1 ratio, generally -- but the more polish, the smoother it'll go on (and the more diluted the color). Now you don't have a ruined top coat bottle––excellent.









If a solid color is more your style, use white as your base. You may need the top coat to make it shiny, but it'll be more opaque with white.

, Using a toothpick, paintbrush, or nail polish brush, mix it up till the color is even throughout. Then take your painting tool (again, paintbrush or polish brush) and go to town on your nails. If you run out, you can just make more!









Work quickly. Air will get to your mixture quickly, drying it out. If it is starting to lose moisture, just add a bit more clear polish.
It's a good thing you still have that top coat jar, because you may need it to put over the color if it's too matte for your liking. But both are beautiful!

,, Use the nail polish brush to mix.









Do you like the color that forms? If yes, make more. If not, try a different amount of polish or a different color combination.

Consult the Environmental Working Group’s Cosmetic Database.,
Opt for nail polish with a low or moderate hazard score.,
Exercise caution when using high hazard polish.",How to Choose a Non‐Toxic Nail Polish2," One of the easiest ways to determine if a nail polish is toxic is by consulting the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database at http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/. Enter the polish into the site’s search bar, and it will return a toxicity rating of 1-10 based on the nail polish’s ingredients., After you enter a nail polish into the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, the product will receive a toxicity rating. Aim for nail polishes that receive a low score of 1-2, which are the least toxic. You can also opt for a polish with a moderate hazard score of 3-6, although these polishes are more toxic., If you enter a nail polish into the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database and it returns a score of 7 or above, you should exercise caution when using this product. Nail polishes with a high hazard score of 7 or above can be toxic."

Consider a water-based nail polish.,
Polish your nails in a well-ventilated area.,
Polish less often.",How to Choose a Non‐Toxic Nail Polish3," A water-based polish will not give off fumes. By contrast, solvent-based nail polishes can give off toxic fumes. To reduce your risk of potentially inhaling toxic fumes, choose a water-based polish like those made by Acquarella., If polishing your nails at home, do so near an open window or even outside. This will cut down on the amount of fumes you inhale. Avoid nail salons with inadequate ventilation and make sure you choose a well-ventilated spot when you do visit a salon., You can reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals by polishing your nails less frequently. Try using neutral tones that go with a wide variety of clothing and accessories. This means you won’t feel the need to change your nail polish as frequently."

Nail polish
Cornstarch, matte eyeshadow, mica, or cosmetic pigment powder
Tightly-woven sifter (for cornstarch)
Toothpick (for eyeshadow)
2 inch by 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) square of paper
Nail polish
2 – 3 ball bearings (optional)
Small cup or dish

, Make sure that the bottle you are using is only partly-full. Do not use a full bottle, or the powders you will be using will cause it to overflow.


If you want to make a matte topcoat, you will need clear nail polish and cornstarch/cornflour.You can apply this topcoat over any manicure to make it matte.
If you want to make regular matte nail polish, you will need a solid-colored polish and cornstarch or cornflour.
If you want to make a custom color, you will need a clear nail polish. You will also need matte eyeshadow, skin-safe mica powder, or cosmetic pigment powder into it.Adding some cornstarch will help make the finish even more matte.

, Whatever powder you choose to use, it needs to be very fine. Any clumps in the powder will make your polish lumpy. If you are working with cornstarch or cornflour, pour it through a sifter into a small container. If you are working with eyeshadow, scrape it out of its pan first, and then smash it up using the end of a pencil or brush. Mica powders and pigment powders should already be fine and not have any clumps.


You will need only a few pinches of cornstarch or cornflour.
If you are using eyeshadow, plan on using an entire pan per ½ bottle of polish., Roll the paper into a cone shape. Make sure that the pointy end has an opening in it, so that the powder can pass through., The pointy end should not be touching the polish. If it is, widen the top of the cone so that the point sits higher. If the point gets wet, trim it down, or the powder will get caught in it instead of going into the polish.

, Use a tiny scoop or teaspoon. You can use your fingers, but you may end up wasting some of the powder if it sticks to your skin. Avoid adding in too much powder at one time, or you will make your polish too thick. You can always add more powder later.


If you are using eyeshadow, mica powder, or cosmetic pigment powder, consider adding in a little bit of cornstarch or cornflour. This will help make the polish even more matte, especially if the powder is shimmery or opalescent.

, This will make your polish easier to mix, especially if you are starting out with a clear nail polish base. If you are using a solid-colored nail polish, you probably won't need them, as most solid-colored polishes already have them inside.The diameter of each mixing ball should be about 1/8 inches (3.175 mm). Choose mixing balls made of stainless steel for the best effect.

, Stop shaking once the color is even and uniform. If you are using ball bearings, stop shaking once you can't hear the balls rattling anymore.

, Once the polish is mixed, open the bottle and brush on some of the polish onto your nail or a scrap of paper. Let the nail polish dry so that you can see what it truly looks like. If the polish is too thick, you can try thinning it with a drop or two of nail polish thinner. If the polish is not matte enough, add in some more cornstarch or cornflour. If you are using clear nail polish and it is too sheer, add in some more of the eyeshadow, mica powder, or pigment powder that you were using.

, This will give the pigments and powders you used to dissolve into the polish and make it more smooth and less clumpy., Topcoats are typically glossy, so using one over your matte manicure will take away the effect. Try and see if you can find a matte one to match your polish.

Small cup or dish

, You can use whatever color you want, but it has to be matte. You can also use some cosmetic pigment powder instead. This will already come in powder form, so you won't have to crush the eyeshadow into a powder later one.If you want to make a clear, matte topcoat, then use cornstarch instead., You can use a paper or plastic cup, a small dish, or even a cupcake or muffin liner. Your nails will be whatever color of eyeshadow you used. Plan on using a little more eyeshadow than nail polish., If there are any clumps, break them us using the end of a brush or pencil. Keep crushing the eyeshadow until it is fine and powdery. If you have any clumps in your eyeshadow, your manicure will look grainy.

,, Keep stirring until you get an even color and consistency. If the color too sheer, add some more eyeshadow. Make sure that there are no clumps in the polish. If there are any clumps, break them up with the toothpick. If you don't do this, they will show up on your manicure and make it look lumpy.

, The polish will dry fast. Simply apply a basecoat, then paint your nails as you normally would. If there is extra matte polish afterward, you can pour it into an empty nail polish bottle or another small, glass bottle.

, You won't see the true effect of the eyeshadow until the polish dries. Also, avoid using a topcoat; most topcoats are glossy and will reverse the matte effect. If you can find a matte topcoat, then that is fine.

Water
Pot or saucepan

, Fill a cooking pot or saucepan with water and place it on the stove. Turn the stove on and let the water heat up. You will be using the steam to make the nail polish matte.

, Nail polish won't stick very well to nails that even have the slightest hint of oil on them. Wipe your nails down with some nail polish remover to remove any residue from lotions and creams.

, The basecoat will protect your nails and keep them from getting stained, especially if you plan on using a darker color of nail polish. The basecoat will also give the nail polish something to hold onto.

, It is better to apply one thin coat, let it dry, and then apply a second thin coat. If you apply one thick coat, you will risk the nail polish forming tiny bubbles or chipping later on.

, Be careful not to get the nails themselves wet, however.


The nail polish must be wet, or this will not work.
Be sure to move your hands about and wiggle your fingers from time to time. This will allow the steam to cover every bit of your nails.

, Be sure to let each coat dry before applying the next one. You can use any nail polish color you want, but a solid color may look better than metallic, pearlescent, iridescent, or glittery one., Matte topcoats tend to bring out all imperfections, including streaks and unevenness. Make sure that your manicure is just the way you like it; the matte topcoat won't conceal imperfections like a glossy one might., The bottle must say ""matte"" on it, or else this will not work. Keep in mind that some matte topcoats may lighten or alter the color of your manicure. If the topcoat looks milky or foggy in the bottle, then it will most likely lighten/alter the color of your manicure., Some topcoats can a very long time to dry. Even if the nail polish looks dry to the touch, it may still be wet underneath. Try to be careful with your nails for the next hour or two.Be aware that matte topcoats tend to be more visual than protective. Not all matte topcoats will protect your manicure against chipping."

Consider getting a professional manicure.,
Apply nail polish when your nails are dry.,
Use good quality nail polish.,
Use a base coat.,
Let the polish dry completely between coats.,
Apply several layers of polish.,
Apply a top coat.",How to Keep Nail Polish from Chipping1," Professional nail salons have the right equipment to give you a long lasting coat of polish. If you want a really long-lasting coat that doesn't chip, you can opt for a gel manicure, which uses a super hard setting type of nail polish that acts almost like acrylic nails.


If you are very dedicated to having long nails, you can get acrylic nails, which are fake nails that are attached to your actual nails. These nails are very, very strong but they cost more than a regular manicure and are quite a commitment.;
, Although there is a myth that you should soak your nails before a manicure, water on your nails will actually stop the polish from adhering correctly. This could cause your nail polish to chip off quickly.


You also want to make sure there are no creams or lotions on on your nails right before painting them. This will also stop the polish from attaching correctly., More expensive nail polishes usually contain more pigment, fewer potentially toxic chemicals, and better brushes inside. That said, you don't need to spend $50 to get a quality bottle of nail polish. Balance your budget with your desire for a crisp and smooth manicure.


Also avoid using quick-drying polish if you want to avoid chips. The formula of quick-drying polish, while containing the same ingredients as the regular, has different ratios of ingredients. This difference in ratio makes the polish more likely to chip.

, Don't use a 2-in-1 base and top coat. These will not work as well as a separate base and top coats that are each formulated specifically for their location on your nail.

, Letting each coat dry completely allows it to become hard and tough. Besides the possibility of messing up the previous coat, waiting for each coat to dry is an important, but frustrating, step in creating a lasting manicure.

, You will want to brush on at least 2-3 coats. Remember, you want to let each coat dry before adding on another.

, Begin your top coat by doing a small layer around the tip of the nail. Then, once that is dry, cover the whole nail in top coat. This will give the tip of your nails more strength over the life of your manicure.


Apply a few layers of top coat if you have the time to do it. The top coat should leave a nice, smooth finish that will resist chips and snags.

Keep the cap on the bottle when you're not using the brush.,
Keep the polish in a cool, dark, area, such as a refrigerator.,
Agitate the polish every few days.,
Clean messy cap threads.",How to Keep Nail Polish from Drying Out1," The number one cause of dried out polish is leaving the cap off of the bottle. A good general rule is to keep the cap on the bottle whenever you're not using the brush to apply polish. If you stop using one color or switch to another, don't leave it open on the counter. Take a few seconds to screw the cap back on. Remember — nail polish is made to dry quickly when it comes in contact with air whether or not it's on your nails.


Screwing the cap on tightly is important. A loose seal can let air in or lead to messy cap threads (see below).;
, Heat and light are your enemies when it comes to keeping your polish fresh. Try to store your polish somewhere out of the sun and away from sources of heat to keep the polish lasting longer.


If you have room in your refrigerator, this is a good place to keep your polish. Otherwise, keep it in a closed cabinet (rather than on the counter).

, Polish that is allowed to sit for long periods of time is more likely to start to set. To avoid this, occasionally roll the polish in your hands or turn the bottle over a few times. If you paint your nails regularly, just agitate the polish every time you use it. Otherwise, take a few seconds to agitate each bottle every two to four days,


You can also shake the bottle gently, but shaking vigorously can create bubbles which can make the polish apply unevenly the next time you use it.

, Gunky threads (the spiraling ridges on the mouth of the bottle that the cap screws on to) can affect the cap's seal and even let in air. Luckily, it's not hard to clean the threads once they get clogged with caked-on polish. See below:


Moisten a cotton ball or Q-tip with fingernail polish remover. Try to squeeze most of the remover back into the bottle — you don't need a soaking wet cotton ball.
Gently scrub the cap threads. The dried polish should start to dissolve. If necessary, re-soak your cotton ball or switch to a new one. Finish by wiping the clean cap threads with a tissue.
Try not to let nail polish remover get into the polish itself. This can affect the texture of your polish — it may even ruin the whole bottle if enough gets in.

Consider keeping your nails short.,
Avoid activities that could damage your nails.,
Don't bite your nails.,
Apply touch-ups to any small chips that occur.,
Deal with small chips to the tips of your nails creatively.,
Apply another layer of clear top coat every few days even if you don't have any chips in your polish.It will keep the polish strong and resilient.",How to Keep Nail Polish from Chipping2," Short nails have less of a chance of chipping quickly, as they don't come in contact with as much on a daily basis. For instance, short nails don't come in constant contact with computer keys while typing.

, If you can't avoid an activity that you know might damage your nails, protect them if you can. For example, if you need to wash dishes, be sure to wear dish washing gloves while you do it.

, Biting your nails will destroy your nail polish immediately. While it's hard to break the habit of biting your nails, if you don't you won't have a beautiful coat of nail polish for long.

, The spots where you apply small bits of polish to fill in any chips will not be as smooth or pretty as the rest of your polish, but they will help preserve the rest of your nail polish from chipping off.


This is basically a last ditch effort to save your manicure. If you can, when a coat of polish starts chipping off, simply take it off with remover and start over.

, If you have a small chip on the tip of your nail, simply file your nail down and then apply another layer of top coat, focusing on the tip of your nail.

You can also paint a thin layer of a contrasting color of nail polish all along the edge of your nail, like a thin french manicure.You will need a steady hand but the result will look cute and intentional.

, This will also make your nail polish shiny and beautiful once again without the hassle of totally reapplying it.

Add a few drops of lacquer thinner to the bottle.,
Shake well to combine.,
Alternatively, use clear polish.,
Don't use nail polish remover.",How to Keep Nail Polish from Drying Out2," If you have a bottle of nail polish that has already dried up, you may not need to throw it out just yet. There are a few simple ways to get your polish back in good order. The most straightforward is to add a little lacquer thinner to it. Use an eye dropper to add a few drops at a time — you shouldn't need much.


Be sure to do this somewhere well-ventilated. The fumes from lacquer thinner can be hazardous in tight spaces. If the weather is good, go outside. Otherwise, open a door or window and turn on a fan.
Lacquer thinner is available at most hardware stores for just a few dollars per can. The smallest sizes are normally about a quart, so one purchase will last you a long time.

, Once you've added a small amount of lacquer thinner, screw the cap back on to the nail polish bottle and shake it gently. You can also upend the bottle or use the cap brush to stir the contents. The thinner should gradually loosen up the dried polish, leaving you with liquid polish.


If your polish is still too thick, add more thinner a drop at a time and continue stirring. When your polish is the correct consistency, stop adding thinner.

, If you don't have lacquer thinner handy, you can get a similar effect by adding clear nail polish to bottles of dried up color polish. Just add it a few drops at a time and agitate the bottle as you would with thinner. This tends to work best with polish that isn't completely dried up yet.


Note that this can affect the color and consistency of your polish. It shouldn't outright ruin it, however. You should still be able to use it when it's liquid again.

, Nail polish remover will turn dry polish back into liquid. However, the danger is that it will go too far, turning your entire bottle of polish into a watery mixture that won't stick to your nails very well. It's hard to use nail polish remover correctly this way, so it's generally best to simply stay away from it.

, Nail polish will usually last for 5-10 weeks (depending how often you use them), so don't use old nail polish.

, Putting your nail polish upright will really help. If you really want a fresh manicure, store some bottle of nail polish in the fridge to make it nice and smooth the next time you use it.

Paint the tips of your nails.,
Finish with a top coat.,

Add nail stickers.",How to Do Metallic French Tips," If you are wearing nail polish, make sure you first remove it completely. Take a cotton ball or pad and apply a small amount of nail polish remover. Then rub the pad over your nails until all polish is completely gone. Make sure to clean under your nails, as well. Try using a nail file or manicure tip to remove excess dirt.Wash your hands thoroughly when you are done.;
, It's important to have all your nails relatively the same shape and size. You can have either square, oval, rounded, stiletto, almond, or even lipstick shaped nails. Try going off of your current nail shape or whatever works best for your everyday routine. For example, if you are constantly typing, you may want to avoid a long, stiletto nail as it can make using a keyboard difficult.

Once you cut the nail down with clippers or nail scissors, use a nail file to shape and smooth the edges.
Keep the length close to your regular length as well. Working with longer nails can be difficult to adjust to if you don't usually have them.

, To keep the color lasting longer, apply a base coat before you start painting your nails. This will help prevent chipping, splitting, and peeling in the future as it fortifies the nails. It will also help stop the nail polish from staining your nails and fingers.

Make sure to wait 3-4 minutes for the base coat to dry before you apply your color.

, After your base coat has dried, paint the entirety of your nails one color. Try a soft, opaque pink like Essie’s Fiji or a matte Silver. You can also go for a matte gold or peach nude. These colors work well in contrast to a metallic tip. Start in the middle of your nail and apply the polish in three even strokes. Don't worry if this isn't enough, you can paint over any uneven areas.Wait 5-10 minutes for your nails to dry completely.

, Do you want a thick stripe at the top or a thin one? There is no wrong choice for a French manicure. However, current fashion trends promote a thinner line for the tip. Use the length of your nails to decide. If you have short nails, then a thinner line is better. Longer nails can handle a thicker stripe., Once your nails have dried, take a thin strip of manicure tape or painter’s tape and place it where you want the base of your metallic tip to be. Try to get these lines as straight as possible. You also want to make sure that the space between the tip and the manicure or painter's tape is approximately the same for each nail., Apply your metallic nail polish to the tips of your nails. Try a shimmery, metallic gold or a cool, metallic silver. Don’t worry if there is a bit of overlap onto the tape, as you will be removing it later. However, be careful not to paint over it onto the other side of your nail as this can be difficult to fix.

If you don't want to wait for the tips of your nails to dry, you can also try using metallic foil to coat your tips. Simply apply foil glue to where you would normally paint the nail. Then press the metallic foil to that spot and hold for a few seconds before removing it. The color will stay on the nail.Wait 5-10 minutes for your nails to dry.

, Once you are satisfied with the color and look of your nails, use a top coat to finish them off. Similar to a base coat, a top coat helps set and protect the color. Not only will it add a little bit of durability to your nails, but it will help keep them looking beautiful longer., Just because it's a french manicure doesn't mean you need to be restricted to the one line at the top. Try doubling up! For example, put a gold metallic stripe across your tip and then a matte gold stripe directly beneath it. You can also divide the lines on your tips in half. Try painting one side a metallic silver and the other one bright white.

You can also work with geometric shapes. Directly under the stripe on your tip, paint a line of upside down triangles. You can do this with manicure tape just like you painted the original stripe for the french manicure. Just make sure everything is dry before you put the tape down.

, A small pack of nail beads, jewels, or sequins only cost around five to six dollars on Amazon and last a long time. Simply apply the jewels or sequins with tweezers and nail glue. You can also attempt to place them while the polish is still wet. Try putting a jewel in the center of your nail where the line for your base coat ends and the stripe across your tip begins. You can also add sequins to the base of your nail.

For example, gold and silver sequins or diamond jewels would be a great contrast to the metallic tips on your nails.

, If you aren't confident in your painting skills, try using nail stickers to add designs. These can be cut down to any size you need and only require you to peel and apply them. Try black and white polka dots or gold stripes. You can even use floral designs, leopard prints, camouflage, and plaids.

Be careful not to overdo it with nail stickers, though. You want the metallic tips to shine on their own, so try only applying stickers to one or two fingers on each hand.

Reapply the top coat.,
Add more glitter as needed.,
Keep your cuticles healthy.",How to Do Glitter Cuticles," This is an important step in any manicure, and especially with this glitter cuticles manicure. Because the color on your nails will likely be neutral, it’s particularly important that they are well shaped. If your nails are long, use nail clippers to trim them to the same length. Then, use a file to smooth the edges.You can file straight across from a more square tip, or soften the edges for a more rounded tip.;
, Unlike in normal manicures, do not push your cuticles back. Instead, you'll focus on cleaning them off. You’ll want to give the glitter a clean surface to stick to. Dip a cotton swab into a bit of rubbing alcohol and rub it along each cuticle. This will remove any oil and grime on your cuticles. Unlike glitter on your nails, glitter on your cuticles will not last more than a couple of days. However, cleaning your cuticles before applying any polish will help it last as long as possible., It’s easy to skip this step in your manicure, but it’s important that you don’t! A basecoat gives your nail a good, sticky surface for your colored polish to stick to. It helps to ensure your manicure lasts without chipping or flaking. It also prevents darker hues from staining your nails, and can smooth over imperfections to create an excellent canvas., You can use any color you want for this. If you want to mimic the glitter cuticles spotted on the high fashion runways, however, opt for a soft neutral. A nude or very soft pink polish looks excellent.Gray, tan, black, and white polish all work well too. The key is to let the glitter cuticles steal the show, rather than a bold polish.

, For this effect, you want to choose a finely-milled glitter polish, rather than a polish that has large, chunky pieces of glitter. Because you aren't painting a large surface, you don't want large specks. A finely-milled glitter will work perfectly on your cuticles, creating a shimmery effect.When it comes to choosing color, it's a matter of personal preference!

, To get the precise application of glitter that this manicure demands, you’ll need to use a very thin brush made for nail art. You can purchase these at many pharmacies and all beauty supply stores. They'll be much easier to work with than the brush that comes in the polish., Carefully run your brush along your cuticle, on the skin around your nail. You want to create a thin line of polish, so that the effect is sleek and understated. Simply follow along the outline of your nail., You can alter this manicure slightly and apply it to your actual nail, outlining it where it meets the skin. This is slightly different than the original glitter cuticle manicure, but it will last longer than glitter applied directly to your skin!, Protect your polish by finishing your manicure with a topcoat. A topcoat will help to keep your polish from chipping by providing a protective barrier against wear and tear. Additionally, a glossy topcoat will give your nails a bit of extra shine.If the glitter polish has been applied to the skin, do not cover it with a top coat. This will result in the glitter flaking off much sooner than you want. Let your nails (and cuticles) dry completely and you’re all ready to show them off!


If you're crunched for time, use a quick drying top coat. These typically dry in about a minute, and they're great for anyone on the go.

, If you painted your glitter onto your actual nails, you can help maintain this manicure by reapplying the top coat every two or three days.Because of normal wear and tear, the top coat will start to chip and flake away. By reapplying it regularly, you're ensuring that the glitter is sealed and protected. Additionally, this will add some shine back to your nails and make your manicure look fresh.

, Expect the glitter to start flaking in one to two days if you painted it directly on to your skin. While this is an adorable look, it won't last you for weeks like your favorite shellac manicure. If you intend on wearing your glitter cuticles for several days, you'll need to be prepared for touchups. Whenever a bit chips off, reapply a bit of glitter polish in that spot.

, Don't worry – this manicure won't damage your cuticles. It will look best, and stick longer, on healthy nails and cuticles. Make sure you are extremely gentle on your cuticles. Do not pick at them or cut them. Avoid drying them out by using acetone-free nail polish remover. Give them a bit of extra TLC between manicures by using cuticle oil and sleeping with Vaseline on your cuticles.By keeping your cuticles healthy, your glitter cuticles will look better and last longer.

Gather your supplies.,

Make sure that the nail polish is not all the way full.,
Activate the glow stick by snapping it in half and shaking it.,
Snip one of the ends off the glow stick using a pair of sharp scissors.,
Open the nail polish bottle and carefully pour the glow stick liquid inside.,
Close the nail polish bottle and shake it vigorously.,
Paint your nails as you would with any other nail polish.,
Protect your nail polish with a clear coat.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Nail Polish1," Because you will be using glow sticks, which only glow for a certain amount of time, it is best to have everything on hand and ready. Plan the make this polish just before you need to use it, but be sure to include enough drying time. Here is a list of what you will need:


1 glow stick
1 bottle of nail polish (partly full)
Sharp scissors
Strainer (recommended);
, You can use a clear polish or a colored one. If you choose to use a colored one, however, be sure to match it to the color of the glow stick. For example, if you are using a pink glow stick, then use a pink nail polish.


A clear nail polish base will give you the best glow. It can also be applied over a solid-colored nail polish, just like a top coat.
You can use any color of glow stick with white nail polish.
Consider using a clear nail polish with glitter inside it for a sparkly effect.

, You will be pouring the glow stick fluid into the bottle, which will take up space. Choose a bottle that is one half to two-thirds of the way full. If you are starting out with a full bottle, you may want to pour some of the polish out; not doing so may result in an overflow.

, Hold the glow stick between your fingers and snap it briskly. If you are using a long, slender glow stick, such as a bracelet or necklace, you may need to snap it in several places. Be sure to give the glow stick a good shake.








, You may want to do this over a sink so that you do not get glow stick liquid everywhere.








, Hold the cut end of the glow stick glow to the mouth of the nail polish and carefully tip it over. Be careful not to get any of the glow stick liquid onto your work surface or onto your skin; the liquid can stain certain surfaces and irritate skin. Keep pouring the liquid until you either run out of liquid or the bottle becomes full.


Glow sticks contain glass tubes, which shatter when you snap them. If you are concerned about getting glass into your polish, consider placing a tightly-woven strainer over the mouth of the nail polish bottle before pouring in the glow stick liquid.

, Once you have gotten as much glow stick liquid into the bottle without causing it to overflow, set the glow stick aside and close the nail polish bottle tightly. Shake it to mix the two liquids together.








, The glowing polish may take longer to dry than regular polish, however, so you might want to apply it using thinner coats.








For a dark-colored base, you may need three to four coats of polish. For a light-colored base, you may need two to three coats., Adding a coat of clear nail polish after the glow polish dries will protect the color longer.









Note that the effect produced by this technique will not last for the duration of your polish. In fact, it may only last for a few hours, at most.

Apply a clear top coat.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Nail Polish2," Unlike nail polish made from glow sticks, this polish will never lose its glow. You will, however, have to recharge it by letting it sit in the sunlight or under a bright light for a few minutes. The glow will eventually fade, but it can always be recharged. Here is a list of what you will need:


Glow-in-the-dark pigment powder
Clear nail polish (partly full)
Scrap of paper
2 – 3 small ball bearings

, You may be able to find it in a well-supplied arts and crafts store, otherwise, you will have to purchase it online. Try to get a pigment powder that is non-toxic, skin-safe, or meant for cosmetic use. Many artists' pigment powders, meant for mixing into paints, can be toxic., They will help the pigment mix better into the polish.








, It is very fine, so be careful not to inhale it. You will need abut 1 teaspoon of the powder.The more powder you use, the more opaque the polish will be; the less powder you use, the more sheer the polish will be. There are several ways in which you can pour it into the bottle:









Make a small funnel by rolling a scrap of paper into a cone. Sticky the pointy end down the neck of the nail polish bottle, and pour the powder into the bottle.
If the powder comes in a bag, and you already know how much the bag contains, you can snip one of the corners off the bag. Stick the cut corner into the mouth of the bottle and jiggle the bag until the powder is inside the bottle.

, Keep shaking it for a few minutes until the powder is mixed throughout the polish and there are no streaks. You may hear the ball bearings rattle inside; they are helping the polish and pigment mix together.








, You can paint them using just the glow-in-the-dark nail polish, or you can paint them with a regular polish first, and use the glowing one as a top coat.








, This will protect your nail polish against chips.

Box cutter or Xacto knife (optional)

, You may be able to find it in a well-stocked beauty shop or at a costume store. You can also purchase it online. Make sure that it is the powdered kind, as a cream-based eye shadow will not work.


You can also use some UV-reactive or black light makeup pigment, if you can find it.

, If the eye shadow is the only color in the case, leave it. If there are multiple colors in the case, you will have to take it out. Take a box cutter or an Xacto knife and stick the blade between the metal dish and the plastic wall. Gently wiggle the blade to loosen the metal dish from the eye shadow case. It will eventually pop out.Don't worry about being too neat; you will be crushing the eye shadow later.









If you cannot remove the eye shadow, and there are multiple colors, try scooping the eye shadow out using a spoon or an Xacto blade. Don't worry if the eye shadow crumbles; you will crush it in a later step.

, Any kind of Ziploc bag will do, but a heavy-duty kind might survive the following steps longer.








, You can use the blunt end of a pencil or paintbrush. Keep smashing the eye shadow until it is a fine powder. Make sure that there are no chunks left; a grainy pigment may result in a grainy nail polish.








, You can the eye shadow case, or you can save it for a DIY project, such has homemade blush or lipstick.








, They will help the crushed eye shadow mix better into the polish.








, This will make it easier to pour the powdered eye shadow into the bottle. Be careful not to spill any of the powder.








, Carefully wedge the cut corner into the mouth of the nail polish bottle and jiggle the bag until all of the eye shadow falls into the polish.








, Keep shaking it until the eye shadow is completely mixed into it and there are no more streaks.








, Use thin coats to help it dry faster.








, Acrylic paint chips even more easily than nail polish, so a top coat will help prevent premature damage.

, Nail polish and remover can damage many surfaces such as cloth, wood finish and plastic. Wear an expendable t-shirt and no valuable accessories, sit at a desk or table, and protect it with scrap paper (not newsprint, which smudges). Make sure the table itself and anything near it is not particularly valuable or important to keep perfect because there might be a spatter or spill soaking through. You might not want to work near a computer, for instance.

, Use nail polish remover and cotton balls or swabs. Some kinds of nail polish remover may dry the areas on your nails and around them. You may wish to find one that doesn't do this as much, but do not be concerned unless you have a severe allergic reaction.









If you have and wish to keep fake nails, such as acrylic, choose a polish that will not remove them, and don't let it soak much.
Unless you use it once a month or less, don't use a nail polish remover with acetone in it. Though acetone will make removing the nail polish easier, it can damage the nails themselves.

, Use nail clippers and trim your nails. Don't cut them too short; you should be able to see at least a little of the white tip still, all the way across. Using a nail file, file the nail and create a smooth and clean shape. Gently drag the file across the nail, rather than pushing it. Excessive force or sawing back and forth will weaken the nails and cause them to break. Pivot the hand with the file through each stroke to make a smooth curve rather than angles. Do not file them too short: just clean up any points or roughness left by the clippers.









If you want to remove fake nails, perhaps because they look odd from having grown out too far, here's how to do that.
Do not round the corners down into the sides of the nail bed. This can cause the nail to become ingrown. Be particularly careful with the big toe, which, perhaps due to shoes, is more prone to ingrowing.

, Using a white block of a stick-type nail buffer, or a pad-type nail buffer and buffing powder, buff the surface of the nail a little bit to even out the surface and to smooth out ridges. Remember not to buff too much; thinning it too much will weaken it. Perfect edge-to-edge flatness is not practical or necessary. A soft, flexible buffer will more easily buff the sides of the nail along with the middle.









You may wish to buff your nails after pushing back the cuticles if there is some residue where the cuticles used to cover, in order to scrape or grind it off in the process. Being thin, soft, and not firmly attached, it should come off easily.

, Get a bowl or stopper the sink and fill it with warm (not hot!) water and a few drops of soap. Soak your hands only for a few minutes. The water and soap will help to loosen dirt, dead skin, and any dust left over from filing and buffing, and soften cuticles. Use a nail brush to gently clean your nails and the skin around them. Gently scrape under your nails if necessary to remove dirt. If you want your nails and cuticles really manageable, you can soak them in Dawn dishwasher soap.


If you have dry skin or fragile nails you should not soak them; just rinse them.
Don't go overboard with scraping, since you can damage your nails if you remove the white powdery substance that is actually part of your nails.

, Dry your nails and apply a cuticle cream. Using a cuticle pusher, also called an orange stick, gently push back the cuticle. Do not force them back, and never cut your cuticles. Even if the equipment is sterile, removing the cuticle can cause infection and leaves the then-less-protected margin of the skin vulnerable. Wipe off the excess cream with a tissue or towel in the direction that you pushed.









A small binder clip is great for pushing back cuticles. Make sure it's clean and well-formed, without sharp edges. Fold the wire grips to lay flat against each other. Hold the clip between the thumb and forefinger or middle finger by the flat metal sides, with the grips passing between in the direction of the little finger tip; the flat back piece extending past the thumb and forefinger. Now you're ready to push back the cuticles on the other hand (switch later to do the one currently holding the clip).

, Take a lotion or hand cream and massage it into your hands. If you have very dry skin use an intensive lotion, if not, any lotion will do. Be sure to rub it into and around your nails and let it soak in for 30 minutes or longer.









This is as well done after painting the nails and allowing them to dry thoroughly as before painting. For very dry skin, apply some greasy lotion and sleep with cheap cotton gloves over your hands to allow it to remain on and work for a long time without keeping you from productive activities.
Nail polish/lacquer will not stick to nails with moisturizer on them, so take a Q-tip dipped in nail polish remover and quickly wipe the nails to remove the lotion. Wipe excess remover off promptly to mitigate nail damage.

, Cover the nail with a clear base coat or nail hardener. This will even out and ridges and unevenness that may still be on the nail, serve as a primer for the polish, help the polish to last longer, and keep the color from staining your nails.









This is the point at which you'd apply fake nails if you like.
Let the coat completely dry before proceeding.

, Pick a nail polish that you really like. Roll the nail polish bottle between your hands for about 10 seconds. Shaking the bottle causes air bubbles in the polish and makes harder for the polish to stick to your nails. Begin painting nails using a thin coat. Dip the brush into the bottle of polish and as you remove it, gently swirl the brush around the inside rim of the bottle to remove excess polish. Slowly paint a vertical stripe down the center of your nail, followed by another stripe on either side of the first. Try to paint all the way to the edge, but it's better to leave a small margin than paint the skin on the side.









Angle the brush a little forward, press gently so the bristles spread out a little into a neat curve, and drag it gently and smoothly across the nail to paint it. Do not apply a blob of paint to the nail and spread it around. Blobs or runs mean too much paint or painting too slowly; subtle ridges should smooth themselves out under gravity (self-level) but very-thin spots mean too little paint or too much pressure.
Fancy designs can be difficult, so stick with simple if it's important to get a good result the first time.
If there is a little bit of nail polish on your fingers or around you nail you can use a toothpick (flat, not round and pointy, is generally best) to get it off if it's still wet. If it's already dry, dip a Q-tip in nail polish remover and wipe it away, or use a nail touch up pen, sold at most drugstores. Be careful not to touch the actual nail with the Q-tip or touch up pen, or you will have to redo that nail.

, Try not to move your nails too much or the polish may smudge. Wait 10 to 15 minutes for the polish to dry. If you apply a second coat too soon, it will only smudge the first coat. You may be able to speed drying with a fan, but don't be overly optimistic. By blowing the fumes away, the fan will remove one reminder of continuing wetness.


After the first coat has dried, apply a second coat if you'd like. This ensures the color looks rich and even.
After the color coats have dried, you may add designs, by brush, airbrush, mask or stencil, decal, rhinestones, or otherwise.
Skipping the base coat, or even applying only one color coat (depending on the kind of polish and application technique; some give or appear to give more even color with uneven thickness than others), will often give acceptable results. However, extra layers add a little extra to initial surface quality.

, Finish with a clear top coat for a hard, smooth, scratch-absorbing, chip and flake-resistant shield particularly important for designs that don't cover the entire nail, as well as adding shine. Let it dry completely Have fun and enjoy your newly beautiful nails!

Try using white-out.",How to Do a French Manicure," Dip a cotton swab into some nail polish remover and remove all of your old nail polish, even if it's clear. Be sure to remove traces of polish from all the corners and cracks, since you'll be able to see other colors through the pale French mani polish.









If you're wearing acrylics and wish to do the French manicure on top, use appropriate polish remover and don't let it soak into your nails for too long.
Note that acetone nail polish remover can dry and damage your nails, so you may want to choose a remover that doesn't contain this chemical.;
, Make sure all of them are even. Use nail clippers to trim uneven spots and make sure all your nails are the same length.









If you want to apply acrylic nails, you can trim them down to your fingertips first. After your nails are trimmed, apply the acrylic glue and nails according to the instructions on the package.

, Use a nail file to finish shaping your nails so that they each have a smooth, crescent-shaped edge. You can file your nails into a square or round shape, depending on your preference. Use a nail buffer to buff the surface of your nails.









When you file your nails, don't push down, as this can damage them. You want to gently drag the file across your nails.

, Place your hands in a warm bowl of water, whole milk or olive oil. This softens your cuticles and makes them easier to push back. Soak for about three minutes, then dry your hands with a towel.

, Use an orange stick or cuticle pusher to push your cuticles back. Clip off any hangnails or bits of dead skin with a cuticle cutter or small nail scissors. You may also massage some cuticle oil into your nails at this time. After applying cuticle oil you could put a few drops of rubbing alcohol on your nails. Make sure not to put on too much or it can cause your nails to turn brittle.








, The base coat of a French manicure is usually pale pink, cream, or clear. Start by painting a stripe down the center of your first nail, then two more stripes on either side. Paint from the cuticle to the tip, with the brush angled forward. Fill in the entire nail using smooth, even strokes. Continue painting the base coat on each nail of both hands.









You can buy French manicure kits that come with a classic base coat color, a tip color, and other equipment you can use to create a perfect manicure.
If you want to stray from the classic French mani, choose a base color that isn't pink or cream. You could go with red, purple, blue, green, or any other color you like. For the tips, you can use white nail polish or another contrasting color.
Allow the base to dry thoroughly and apply a second coat. Make sure the base is completely dry before proceeding.

, Making sure your hand is steady, paint white crescents on your nail tips. The white polish should stop right where the whites of your nails stop. Allow the tips to completely dry, then apply another coat if you wish.









If you have a French manicure kit, you can use the crescent-shaped nail guides to make sure your tip paint goes on neatly. You can also create your own nail guides by cutting them out of painter's tape.Using other kinds of tape might ruin the base coat, so stick to either painter's tape or the nail guides that come in a kit.
Use white nail polish to paint a tip on the nails. Then use a nail polish remover pen to carefully touch up or shape the area. If you don't have a pen you could also use a Q-tip.

, Using a top coat will help the manicure last longer, too.








,, If you're not so great at painting a straight line, you can make your job a bit easier by using scotch tape. Once your nails are completely ready and are just missing the white tips, put a strip of scotch tape across the top of each of your nails. The tape will block off the majority of your nail, leaving just a small strip at the end exposed. Paint this with your white polish; if you make a mistake, it won't matter since it will just get on the scotch tape instead. When your nails are dry, peel off the scotch tape to reveal your finished manicure.








, You know the little round moleskin pads you might use for blisters on your feet? Well, they happen to work perfectly for getting rounded white tips without wiggly edges. When you've finished your nail color (the light pink or tan, whichever you prefer), and the color has dried, put a moleskin pad at the top of the nail, so that only a small portion of the tip is exposed. Paint your white polish over the top of this, and when the paint is dry, peel the pads off. Your white tips should be perfectly rounded, and any mistakes you made will peel off with the moleskin.








, It may sound strange, but if you're having difficulty painting with a white nail polish, white-out (for pen mistakes) might be the perfect solution. Because the application sponge for white-out is square, it makes it easy to dab the white color in a perfect line across your nail tip. Just use white-out instead of white nail polish, and finish it off with a top coat. Nobody will know the difference, and you'll have saved yourself loads of time!, and there you go,you are ready to show off your beautiful french manicure."

Care for your hands and nails- once a week cut nails if they are getting to long or collecting dirt underneath, short square shaped nails look most natural.,
Manicures are when you do the nails on your hands, Pedicures are when you do your feet.,
Now you know the basic manicure, here are some classy and casual nail looks, and a few nail art designs which are all relatively easy to achieve.,
Sassy at school- Most schools prefer it if you don't wear nail color but clear and sheer shades are normally allowed.,
Shades to try- clear,soft sparkly brown, sheer brown or pale pink.

,
Stepping into spring- bright colors and stand out shades are the way to go for this look!,
Shades to try- Bright blue, pink and purple,soft coral and rich red.

Strawberry- paint your nails are dark red shade and leave to dry.,
Stripes- Paint your nails with a clear polish and leave to dry ( so your next shades still have something to cling onto).",How to Care for Hands and Apply Nail Polish for Springtime/Summer Looks," Use an emery board if necessary to file off any broken pieces and for daily nourishment, always wash and moisturise with a rich hand cream.;
, Only bother with Pedicures if you are going to maybe be barefoot or feel like it as nail polish on your toes can sometimes be forgotten and chipped nail polish,anywhere, never looks good. You could try having an indulgent manicure once a week. Start by washing and moisturizing hands with soap or cream. Cut nails and file, but be careful not to trim to deep or cut your fingers, as they can feel sore the next day. If you are going to be wearing very dark or bright nail polish, try to use a base coat ( clear nail polish- you can use for top coat if needed too) and leave to dry. Remember to sit still! Now paint on your chosen color (if added) and wait to dry again.

, For smudge free nails, sit still for at least 10 minutes and always remove polish with nail varnish remover as soon as the paint starts to chip. -

, Just keep your hands nice if nail polish isn't allowed. Wash, moisturise and trim ( long nails get in the way of your busy day and class schedule) then paint on your nail polish by doing one thick stripe in the middle and two thinner ones at the side. Do one hand, wait to dry than the next. This look is really subtle but still really pretty.

,, Cutting nails is very important for this as long oval nails can take away the effect and small splashes of color. Use the same nail painting technique as before and leave to dry.

,, Both of these looks are just paint effects.

, Using a green nail polish, do some soft zigzags round the top of nail and leave to dry. Next, very carefully ( maybe using a cotton bud or cuticle stick, depending on the thickness), dot white spots over the red but still so its more of the shade underneath. This is the fruit, the leaves and the seeds. Repeat all.

, Take one color and paint one thick stripe through the middle of the nail. Now with two different shades, do two thin stripes down the side. Repeat all.

Use clear beads on top of a colored manicure.",How to Give Yourself a Caviar Manicure," Wipe off any old nail polish with nail polish remover, then buff and shape your nails, if needed. If you don't have a steady hand, consider coating the skin around your nails with petroleum jelly; this will make cleaning up any mistakes easier later on.







;
, Unfortunately, caviar manicures are short-lived, and only last 2 to 3 days. Nonetheless, it is still important to apply a base coat. Not only will this help your manicure last a little bit longer, but it will also protect your nail from stains.









, If you are using colored microbeads, consider using a matching nail polish color; this will help conceal any potential gaps. Don't apply your second coat just yet, however; you will be painting and coating your nails with the microbeads one nail at a time.










For best results, consider a thinner formula with a flat finish rather than a shimmery one., Again, resist the urge to paint all of your nails at once. If you paint all of your nails now, the nail polish will dry too quickly, and the beads won't stick.







, Alternatively, you can fill a small bowl or dish with the microbeads, then dip your nail into it.If the microbeads are not sticking, wait 10 seconds for the nail polish to get tacky, then try again.







, This will press the microbeads into the polish and help them stick. It will also help the microbeads lay smoother and flatter against your nail without piling up.









, This helps fill in any potential gaps and give you a neater finish.If your nail was neatly filled the first time around, then you can skip this step.

, Carefully run a manicure stick, an orange stick, or a toothpick around your nail cuticle. This will get rid of any stray beads that got onto the skin around your nail. and give you a neater finish.If you used any petroleum jelly around your nail, you can wipe it off with a q-tip at this point. If you didn't, you can use a thin brush dipped in nail polish remover to wipe away any stray bits of nail polish.

, Paint your next nail with a thick coat of nail polish. Dip this nail into the microbeads, then pat it gently. Coat the nail with more microbeads, if needed, then pat it one last time. Keep repeating this step until you have finished all of your nails. Remember to work on just one nail at a time.

,, Do not brush the clear coat on, as this might cause the color to wear off or the beads to loosen.It may also cause the beads to loosen and fall off. Also, avoid applying the top coat over the entire nail, as this might cause the color to run or wear off. It will also change the texture of the manicure.







, This could take up to an hour. Remember, just because nail polish is dry to the touch does not mean that it is dry underneath. Avoid speeding up the process by spraying your nails with a ""quick dry"" spray. These types of sprays are only intended for nail polish, and they can ruin the microbeads by causing the colors to dissolve or bleed.

, Rather than doing a caviar manicure on all of your nails, do it on just one nail—preferably on your ring finger. You can paint the rest of your nails a matching color or a contrasting one.


Alternatively, you can do a caviar manicure on all of your nails, but use beads in a contrasting color on your ring fingernail.

, Instead of using just one color of microbeads on your nails, consider using a mix of several different colors. Mix 2 to 3 differently-colored microbeads in a small bottle, then apply them to your nails following the method above. To prevent clashing, choose microbeads that are a similar color, such as cool colors or warm colors.

, Start out with a base coat, then apply a French tip. Use white polish if you want to be traditional, or a different color if you want to be dramatic. Cover your entire nail with a clear top coat, let it dry, then paint just the French tip with more clear top coat. Apply the microbeads onto the tip of your nail as described in the method above. When you are done, seal the very edge of your nail with a final layer of top coat.


Because of their chunky size, consider doing a thicker French tip than usual.

, Do your base coat, nail polish coat, and top coat as usual, then let everything dry. Next, paint a shape using a nail art pen or a striper brush. Sprinkle the microbeads onto the wet polish, then gently pat them flat. Use a manicure stick, an orange stick, or a toothpick to shift any stray microbeads into place.As always, work on one nail at a time.


For a more precise application: wet the tip of an orange stick, then use it to pick up microbeads one by one as you press them into the wet polish.Start with simple shapes, such as hearts, bows, or stripes.

, Start with a base coat, then apply your manicure however you want (ie: stripes, marbled, ombre, etc.). Seal with a thin layer of top coat, and wait for everything to dry. Apply a second, thick layer of top coat, then cover your nails with clear microbeads as described in the method above. The original design of your manicure will show through.

,,, Your nails should be neatly trimmed and filed.;
, Try using crayola markers, they do make good fake nail polish! Try to have them be washable, in case you don't want it and want to wash it off. Also, although the fat markers make it messier to paint nails, use them because they won't run out of ink as quickly as thinner ones. Watercolor paints work well too, as they wash off better.

, You should wear something that matches. If you are wearing a purple dress or shirt, put on purple! Always make sure that it matches -- otherwise you'll look really odd (and your parents will find out!).

,, Don't mind about messing up -- the ink can be removed.

Pick a good spot to decorate your nails.,
Clean your nails.,
Clip and file your nails.,
Push back your cuticles.,
Roll the nail polish bottle between your palms for about 25-30 seconds.,
Paint your nails.,
Apply a top coat.",How to Decorate Your Nails1," You’ll want a flat, stable surface with plenty of space to spread out your materials in a well-lit and well-ventilated room. If possible, try not to pick an area in a room with rugs, as paint will be more difficult to remove from carpet than wood or tile.
, Begin by washing your hands. Then, using a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover, remove any previous polish from your nails. Hold the cotton ball against your nail for about ten seconds, and then swipe in a side-to-side motion. Use a Q-tip and nail polish remover to clean the edges of your nail.

It’s a good idea to use nail polish remover even if you don’t have any polish on. This will remove natural oils that might prevent the paint from properly adhering to your nail.

, You’ll want your nails to match, so they should all be the same length. Start by cutting them down, and then use a file to smooth out the rough edges. You can also use your file to shape your nails into either a rounded or squared edge, depending on your preference.


Be sure to file in one direction, from the outside toward the center of the nail, rather than in a back-and-forth motion. This will prevent your nails from breaking.

, Your cuticles are the little strips of skin at the base of each of your nails. When you push this skin down, you get a cleaner looking manicure and a broader area of your nail for painting and decorating! Use a cuticle stick to gently move this skin down to the very bottom of your nail bed.You may want to soak your fingers in hot water for a few minutes before you push back your cuticles. The water will soften the skin and make the process easier.

, Do this instead of shaking the bottle, as this motion will warm and mix the polish without creating bubbles. Avoiding bubbles results in a smoother manicure., Start with a base coat, and then let it dry for about five to ten minutes. Next, apply two coats of your chosen color, allowing each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. Finish it off with your choice of nail art.

, Once your nail art is dry, apply your final coat of clear polish. This will prevent the nail polish from cracking or chipping, and it will add some extra shine to your nails. Be sure to apply a swipe of polish on the underside of your nail for added protection."

Use a toothpick or a bobby pin to make dots on your nail.,
Use tape to color block your nails.,
Crumple plastic wrap for a stone effect.,
Make designs with permanent markers.,
Place paper hole reinforcement stickers on the bottom of your nail.,
Cut up an old shower loofa for a fishnet look.",How to Decorate Your Nails2," This basic method provides you with several decorating options, including:

Simple polka dots. Use your bobby pin to evenly disperse dots over one or multiple nails. For extra color, use different colors for different dots, making sure to have a separate bobby pin for each color.
Flowers. Drop five small dots of the same color in the middle of your nail, making a circle with one dot in the middle. While the polish is still wet, use a toothpick or small decorating brush to pull the outer dots toward the side of your nail. This will form the petals.Paw prints. Use the bobby pin to make either one or two larger dots (depending on if you want one or two prints) on your nail. Then use the toothpick to place three smaller dots over each larger one.

, Once your base color is completely dry, apply a piece of tape to your nail so that you can easily add a second color to the nail.

The easiest blocking pattern to do is a simple diagonal. Place the tape so that your nail is separated into two triangles, and then paint two coats of your second color on the untaped half. Allow time for each coat to dry, then add a top coat.

, Apply two or three coats of a light-colored base coat, such as pale blue or turquoise. Once these coats are completely dry, paint your crumpled plastic wrap with gold polish, and then quickly sponge the polish onto your nail with the plastic wrap., Permanent markers, such as Sharpies, come in many different colors, including silver and gold. These markers are much easier to control than polish brushes, allowing you to draw a variety of dots, lines, zigzags, or even hearts on top of your base coat. You can also experiment with different size marker tips.If you make a mistake with a Sharpie, the design can be easily removed with rubbing alcohol, a material that won’t strip your base coat. Once you’ve got a design you love, add a top coat for full protection.

, These stickers will allow you to leave the base of your nail unpainted. The circular shape of the sticker placed at the bottom of your nail results in a reverse french manicure or half-moon effect.

Place the sticker at the bottom of your unpainted nail. Then, paint two coats of your chosen color, removing the sticker once the second coat has set for a few minutes. Use a Q-tip dipped in nail polish remover for any necessary touchups., After your base coat is dry, cut out a square of the loofa and place it over your nail. Keep the loofa in place by putting small squares of tape on the edges. With an old makeup sponge, dab a second color over your nail and the square of loofa, which will act as the perfect stencil."

Apply rhinestones or gems.,
Add glitter to your nails.,
Use nail stickers for an alternative manicure.",How to Decorate Your Nails3," These fun embellishments can add a sparkle to your nail. Use a toothpick or a bobby pin to place a small dot of nail glue on top of your dried base coat. Then, place your gem on top of the glue with a pair of tweezers, and hold it in place for a few minutes so the glue can dry. Finish it off with a top coat., Glitter is a great and easy way to make your nails colorful and sparkly. This can be a messy process, however, so be prepared for a little clean up. You can apply glitter in one of two ways:

Blend glitter with clear nail polish or a top coat and apply the mixture to your nails. Add a normal layer of top coat once the glittered coat has dried.
Sprinkle glitter on top of a wet base coat, and allow it to dry. Finish with a top coat.

, Nail stickers come in a variety of colors, patterns, and effects. They provide a different option to those who just can’t seem to paint their nails.Apply stickers to clean and unpolished nails by pressing them down close to the cuticle and smoothing them out toward the top of your nails.
File your stickers to make them perfectly match your nails. Use a normal nail file to gently and carefully file off the excess sticker. Next, “iron” the sticker with your thumb in a gentle up-and-down motion across your nail. There’s no need for top coats over stickers.

Shake the can well.,
Paint a top coat.,
Remove the excess paint.,
Spray a second coat of polish.,
Apply a long lasting top coat.,

Make sure to remove all of the polish. Once the polish is removed, clean your nails with warm water and soap. Then, dry them thoroughly with a towel., The base coat is what helps the polish stick to your nails. Apply it like regular fingernail polish. When applying the base coat, make sure that you do not get any on your cuticles or skin. If you do, remove it from your cuticles and skin with regular nail polish remover.








The base coat is sold separately. You can purchase it online, or at your local beauty supply store.Nails, Inc. recommends that you use their 2 in 1 base and top coat polish, but any formula will work., Use a large piece of construction paper or newspaper to protect the surface you are spraying over. Then place your hand flat on the paper. You want to make sure your hand is flat so the polish sprays evenly., Hold the can four to five inches (10 to 13 centimeters) away from your nails. Then, in a slight zigzag motion, spray a quick coat over your nails. The formula is very pigmented, so you only need one coat.








It is ok if the color gets on your skin as long as you remembered to remove any base coat from your skin.

, Before painting the top coat, let the polish dry for a minute or two. Then proceed to apply the top coat. Again, make sure that you do not get any top coat on your cuticles or skin. Let the top coat dry for a minute, as well.







, Once the top coat is dry, proceed to the nearest sink. Use warm, soapy water to remove any excess paint from your skin. Rub or scrub the polish to remove it from your skin.








Do not wait too long before removing the excess polish because the longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove.
Repeat steps one through three on your second hand.

, If you really want the polish to stick, spray a second coat of polish. Spray the second coat a minute or two after the first coat has dried. Then, apply the top coat and proceed to wash off the excess polish after the top coat has dried.








Use nail polish remover to remove stubborn traces of the excess polish from your fingers.

, Although Nails Inc. recommends that you use their 2-in-1 base and top coat, the coat runs a little thin. Therefore, extend the wear of your manicure by topping it off with another layer of a long-lasting top coat.








Try Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Anti-Chip, OPI Rapid Dry, Deborah Lippman Addicted to Speed, Revlon Extra Life No Chip, or your favorite top coat for the best results., This way you can avoid chipping and smudging your nails after you apply the polish. Additionally, apply the nail polish at the end of your beauty routine. In other words, it should be the last thing you do before you step out the door (yes, apply the polish even after you have put your shoes on)."

Trim and buff your nails.,
Choose a strip that matches your nail size.,
Heat the strip slightly with a hair dryer.,
Apply the strip to your nails.",How to Apply Nail Wraps1," It is important to remove any old nail polish before you apply your nail wraps. Use some nail polish remover to take off your old nail polish. Even if you do not have any nail polish on, you might want to swipe each of your nails with a little nail polish remover to ensure that they are totally clean.You can also wash your hands and nails to ensure that they are free of grease and dirt.;
, Next, you will need to trim your nails to your desired length. If they are already at the length that you’d like them to be, then just take a minute to even them out by shaping them with a nail file. Buff the tops of your nails with a nail buffer as well to ensure that they are smooth and even.








It is important to get the surface of your nails really smooth or they may not look right.If you have dry, brittle nails, then you might also want to apply a layer or two of strengthening top coat before you apply the wraps. Otherwise, the adhesive might damage your nails.

, Hold the strips up next to your nails to determine where the best placement for each strip would be. Try to select a strip for each nail that will fully cover the nail and line up with the cuticle. It may not be possible to find a perfect fit for every nail, but do the best you can.








Don’t worry about choosing the strip that is meant for a specific finger. Just go with the one that fits your finger best., Some nail wraps are heat activated, so you will need to heat them up using a hair dryer. Turn on your hair dryer and set it to warm. Then, pick up one of your nail wraps and aim the hair dryer at it. Heat the nail wrap for about three to five seconds.








Not all nail wraps require heat to work. You might be able to just apply the wrap directly to your nail and smooth it out. Check the package instructions to be sure.

, Use a cuticle pusher to apply the nail wrap and smooth it out on your nail. Make sure that there are no bumps and that the nail strip goes all the way to the edges of your nails. They should be lined up with your cuticles on all sides.








Try not to touch the adhesive layer with your fingertips as you apply it or some if it may come off.

It will also give you a chance to smooth out any bumps in the nail wraps. Hold each nail under the hair dryer for about three to five seconds.








Use a cotton swab or an orange tipped cuticle pusher to smooth out any bumps after you apply heat for a few seconds.

, The nail wraps are quite long, so most people will have some excess material at the ends. Use some nail scissors or a nail clipper to cut this excess material off.You do not have to cut it right along the nail, there can be a small amount of nail wrap material hanging over because you will be filing the ends as well.
If you have really short nails, then you might even find it easier to cut off some of the excess strip material before you apply the strips., Next, use a glass file or emery board to file away the edges of the remaining excess nail strip material. File your nails from underneath the nail, not the top of the nail. This will help to prevent jagged edges.







, Finish off your nail wrap manicure by applying a coat of clear nail polish over the top of the nail wraps. You might even want to apply a couple of coats for an extra glossy look.








You can skip the clear nail polish if you like, but the nail wraps may have more of a matte look to them if you skip it.

Go with a small design for shorter nails.,
Try using a few different designs.,
Make sure that you read the package instructions.",How to Apply Nail Wraps3," You can use any design you like, but shorter nails may not show a larger design as well. Therefore, you might want to stick with a small design or something that has a repetitive pattern on it, such as polka dots or stripes.Try holding different designs up to your nails to get an idea of how much of your nails the strips will cover.

, Nail wraps often come in prints and intricate designs. However, if you want to create an even more interesting look, then you could pick out a few different patterns in coordinating colors.


For example, you could use pick a few different black and white designs and alternate the designs so you have a different one on each nail. Or, for a holiday look, you could pick out some red nail wraps and some green ones and alternate those.

, Different nail wrap brands have different specifications for application and removal. Always check the package instructions before applying or removing your nail wraps.


For example, some nail wraps can be removed by peeling them off with a cuticle pusher, while others require some acetone nail polish remover.
Ensure that you have everything you need to use the strips you purchase. For example, you might need a hairdryer, nail polish remover, and an orange tipped cuticle pusher to use some strips.

The bright light can make painting your nails easier to see, making a different when you apply the nail polish. You may want to set up the lamp on a table and paint your nails there so the lamp can hold itself. , Scrub your nails with a pumice stone or soft scrubbing brush, warm water, and soap. Every week you should scrub your nails with lemon juice to keep them white and healthy. Having clean nails makes it easier to polish them.

You may want to clean your nails right before you apply the nail polish. Try washing your nails thoroughly with soap and warm water. Using an orange stick can also help clean your fingertips. , Have your nail polish color out ahead of time so you'll be prepared to apply it on your nails. If you're using multiple colors on your nails, prepare both colors and leave them in a spot where you won't lose them, until you're ready to begin applying your nails with nail polish.

, Allow the nail polish to stay cool by placing it for several hours in the fridge. Using slightly cool nail polish makes it less complicated to apply it on your nails, because you're able to feel the coolness on your fingertips. You're less likely to avoid applying the polish on your nails if you allow it to chill in the fridge for a couple hours before using. , A nail polish pen is similar to a felt pen and is a lot easier than normal nail polish brush. The pen is simple to grasp and can prevent you from accidentally brushing on your skin. You may also find a nail polish pen easier to use when adding designs and decorations on your nails, if desired. These pens come in different colors so you may wish to use it instead of a normal bottle of nail polish.

, Prepare your area with plenty of newspapers to prevent any furniture from getting stained with nail polish. Sometimes accidents do happen when you apply nail polish, so leaving a few sheets of newspaper on your surface will keep the furniture protected and safe. , File, trim, and push the cuticle down gently using cuticle cream and a manicure tool. Preparing and cleaning your nails will make them easier to brush and apply polish, as the nails are smoother and cleaner. Consider buffing your nails before applying the nail polish for a glossy look, if desired. , Ensure you hold on to the nail polish brush well.

Doing this technique will allow you to grasp the brush easily, allowing you to apply the nail polish on your nails with ease. , Brush the polish using smooth strokes from the base of the nail to the tip. Try to reach the corners as best as you can, but refrain from over-applying. Using a nail bed protector with an open cover will ensure you only brush your nail rather than your skin. While you apply the polish, use one hand for applying the nail polish and the other hand to feel you skin so you don't mistakenly paint the your fingers. Try only applying three large strokes onto each nail, making one stroke in the middle of the nail and the other two strokes on the left and right of the nail. , It takes usually about 5-15 minutes for nail polish to dry, but an hour for it to completely dry.

Trimming them to the length that you want them and smoothing out the edges with a nail file will help you achieve a prettier, polished look, and will prevent your nails from chipping as quickly.


When you file your nails, make sure to move the nail file in one direction. You don't want to saw your nails back and forth, as this can create jagged edges and lead to splitting, breaking, and pealing. Focus on moving the file from left to right, gently swiping the edge of your nail as you go across it.;
, To achieve a polished look on your nails and remove any ridges in your nails, use a four-way buffer. Make sure to move the buffer in an X pattern, and don't over-buff your nails as this can create too much friction, which will build up heat, resulting in weak nails.









Make sure when you buff your nails that you lift the buffer between strokes, so that excess friction is not created on your nails.A four-way buffer is essentially a buffer block, with four different sides that range from a course surface to a very fine surface. Start by buffing your nails with the coarse surface to shape and define nails, then move to the fine grain surface to smooth and refine nails. Next, use the super fine grain surface to even out the ridges in your nails and finally use the ultra-smooth surface to give nails a glossy shine., When you visit a nail salon, many nail artists will cut your cuticles because it can create a nicer appearance on your nails. Unless you are a trained nail technician, don't mess with your cuticles as you can risk damaging them. Cuticles are there to provide a protective barrier on your nail, so instead of cutting them, try applying a cuticle oil that will moisturize and soften dry cuticles., Before you apply your nail polish, it's important that you nails are free of any dirt, moisture, or old nail polish that will cause a new coat of nail polish to chip easier because it won't be able to cling to your nails as well. Wash your hands with soap and water, and consider swiping nails with a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover to remove any excess oils.








Make sure that you dry your hands after you clean them to remove any excess moisture on your nails. Nail polish won't go on smoothly if your nails have water droplets on them.

, The type of nail polish you use is key to achieving a well manicured look that lasts a long time. Forego those cheap nail polishes you can find for a dollar or two and consider splurging on a more high quality nail polish. It may be more expensive but it will last longer on your nails and won't dry out as quickly in the bottle.


Essie, OPI, RGB, M.A.C. Studio, Butter London, Orly, and Rescue Beauty Lounge are some top rated nail polishes that have been tested to last longer and provide an even coating.
Wet and Wild Megalast has also been ranked as a top nail polish, and even though it's cheap, users feel it lasts just as long as some expensive nail polish colors. So if you are looking for a more budget friendly brand, try out this one.It may also be good to avoid nail polishes that have the three chemicals -- formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate -- in them as these can cause negative health effects over a long period of time. However, using nail polishes with these chemicals in them every once in a while won't cause much harm. If you wear nail polish non-stop, though, it could be good to invest in some polishes without the typical chemicals. Essie and Butter London are safe polishes to use for an extended period of time., After you have prepped your nails, you'll want to put a base coat on your nails to make your nail polish last longer and cling better to your nails. Use a base coat that is a good quality, like the nail polish brands listed above, and apply a thin layer with about three swipes of polish. Let the base coat dry before you apply your nail polish.









Base coat not only helps the nail polish cling to your nails (it's usually sticky, which helps the nail polish stay on your nails so don't be alarmed) but it also prevents darker colors from staining your nails.

, After you have applied a base coat to your nails you can start applying the actual nail polish. Taking your nail polish brush, dip it in the polish just so you have enough polish on your brush to create a thin layer. Then, swipe on the nail polish with three, thin strokes with one in the middle and two on the sides. Let your nail polish dry for two minutes before applying the second coat.







, After your nail polish has dried, you can apply your second layer of polish, using the same technique as the first layer with three, even strokes of polish. Let your polish dry and proceed to the third coat if you want a darker color. If you are going for a lighter color, the second layer can be your last layer.








, Once you have finished applying the color to your nails, you'll need to apply a top coat to help the nail polish last longer and to keep it from chipping. Make sure your nails are dry before you apply the top coat -- they shouldn't feel sticky. Then, apply a layer of top coat with three swipes in one direction across your nails. Let the top coat dry before you do anything else with your hands to keep your nails from chipping or smudging.









If you aren't sure if your nails are dry and you don't want to touch them to risk messing up your nail polish, you can swipe a thin layer of top coat across your nail. If the brush on the top coat polish shows any color, then your nail polish isn't dry yet and you need to wait a few more minutes before applying the last coat.
To help you nails dry faster you can dip them in ice water or very cold running water. Unless you are in a hurry, though, it's best to apply a top coat that works slowly, as it will leave a more protective finish., As you were painting your nails you might have noticed that you were getting the nail polish on your fingers and not just your nails, which can create a sloppy look. But it's fairly easy to touch up your nails -- just use a cotton swab and dip it in nail polish remover. Then, gently rub off the excess nail polish around your nails until your nails look very neat.









It can beneficial to wait and do this until after you nails have dried. You can do it while you are painting your nails, but you risk smudging or rubbing off some of the nail polish that you have just painted. Nail polish that has had a top coat and dried will take a little extra force to get off with nail polish remover, so if you accidentally bump it while you are trying to touch up your nails, it should do little harm.

, When exposed to bright lights or heat, nail polish can experiences changes in its thickness and color, so it's best to store your polish in a cool dark area. You can store nail polish in your fridge to help it last longer and keep it from clumping, making it easier to apply."

This will leave you with a solid coating of glitter, rather than the spotty coat you get when you use the nail polish brush.Add more polish to the makeup sponge as you go.

Run over each nail with a slightly abrasive buffer to even out the surface of your nails., Once your nails are clipped, shaped, and buffed, take a moment to relax and pamper yourself.

After soaking your hands, your cuticles will be soft and easier to push back., Cuticles are a part of your skin. They protect your nail matrix, the portion of the nail that grows, from infection. Cutting your cuticles leaves your nail matrix open to infections. It can also cause deformities in the nail, such as ridges and discoloration.

Condition your hands first.,
To start any nail work you do, soak hands in warm water with some oil or wash in them.,
Just adding color to nails takes a shorter time ( only 10-15 minutes) that nail art (at least half an hour), so set it around the time you do have so that they do not get smudged and so possibly ruined.","How to Apply Nail Polish for Subtly Sweet, Bright Bold and Funky Nail Art Designs"," Hands should be in good condition and washed first. As always, they should be washed with a gentle soap or hand wash to get rid of germs and be clean. Short nails usually look better than long and are less high-maintenance, so quickly cut with nail scissors/clippers once a week s they surprisingly grow quickly. Nourish tired,dry hands with a rich cream.;
, Dry thoroughly,cut and rub on some cream. Carefully file of any rough edge but only push back cuticles if you need to, you don't want to cause pain or rip the delicate skin there. First of all you need to paint on a base coat (or just clear polish) which can be used as a top coat too (helps keep your polish fresh for longer). You will need good hand wash, cream, nail cutters and some lovely polishes of your choice.

, Here are some classy, simple and fun looks to try ( you may need to use other tools other than the nail polish brush but it can be an efficient painter too)-

Subtle. Choose a soft baby pink, creamy white or glossy clear as your shade. Unlike other use in nail polish, you can skip the base coat because your basically wearing it alone anyway, but still used two coats. Paint one thick stroke down the middle and two thinner ones down the side. Repeat and leave to dry. This is the best polish for school as it is noticeable but not obvious, also the shades are soft and sweet and out shopping.






Bright and Beautiful. Let your true colors shine! Some colors suit some while they don't others but there are always a few which look amazing on you. Test your skin tone. Fair skins suit fair too, like baby blue, pale pink, light green, pastels and tanned dark, like fuchsia, black, and rich red. Medium green,blue and coral/salmon pinks can suit nearly everyone. Use the same nail painting technique as before but go a little more slowly as color shows any uneven streaks more than a barley there one does. This is a good look for the weekends or just casually chilling.






Spots and Stripes. A really fun look. Choose a base color, let it dry than dab on the pattern on top and let dry as well. Contrasts really stand out here ( such as pink and white polka dots or black and purple stripes). Even though it can look really original, you might want to avoid using a whole crazy ranges of patterns as colors, this can look a little over the top. Great for parties or special occasions.






Strawberries. Specially sweet! Paint the nails first in either a light or dark red. This is the flesh of the fruit. Using some white or orange/yellow polish, dab random little dots all over the nails. These are the seeds. When everything else is dry, add a splash of green at the top to be the stalks. Try these in the summer.






Floral flowers. Elegant and pretty. Paint the base color something plain like white or blue, then take your time to paint loads of flowers in different shapes and shades all over the nails. Nice for celebrations or just when you feel like having a florist shop at your fingertips!






Music Notes. Music fans will love this. To make the nails look like some pages of written music, paint the nails a rich cream and after wards, do some simple lines across ( where the notes are placed) and add some little notes ( use a black or dark blue polish for this). This can be difficult, so only go for the notes when you try the first time. In the name, paint them like this when going to see a concert or local gig.






Super Stars. Unique and optimistic. Just paint a clear coat on nails, you only want color in the patterns. Use as many colors as you like to draw loads of little stars or sparkles on the nails.

Finish with cuticle oil.",How to Apply Gel Nails," To get the ultimate look from your at-home gel nails, start with the ultimate blank nail. Take the time to cut, file, and shape your nails. Before you cut them, decide what shape you want. Cut the basic shape and then file the tips. Finally, finish shaping by rounding the surface of your nails with a buffer.








You can create round, square, pointy, almond, or oval nails.
Because gel nails are based off of your nails, this is when you shape your nails. It is not like applying acrylic nails that can be shaped during/after application.;
, Once you have the basic shape to your nail, apply a cuticle remover around the base of your nails. Use a cuticle stick to push back any skin off of your nail plate. Remove any remaining oil or debris from your nail with a cotton ball that’s been dipped in acetone.








, Apply a very thin layer of your basecoat to your nails. For gel, you use a much thinner layer than you would with standard nail polish. Be careful when applying your base layer: you don’t want to get the gel on your fingers. Let your base layer dry for twice as long as recommended.







, Once your base layer has dried completely, apply another extremely thin layer. This will be your color gel. It will probably look streaky, but that is normal for the first layer. Make sure to use these colored layers to paint over the tip of your nail as well as over the surface. This will keep the gel from curling back off your nail.









Cure each layer under a UV lamp for 2-3 minutes.

, Coat your nails completely in your top gel. Paint over the tip, like you did with your color gel. Once again, cure the gel polish under a UV light for 2-3 minutes.








, Some gel methods leave a tacky, sticky layer on and around your nails after curing the top gel. If this is the case, simply take a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol and wipe over the tacky. Finish off your gel manicure by rubbing a cuticle oil into the skin around the base of your nail.

, Take one of you cotton balls and place it on your nail, covering your entire nail. With the cotton ball in place, wrap the nail and the tip of your finger with tin foil. Do this over the rest of your nails.








It is recommended to do this one hand at a time. It is very difficult to use foil-covered fingers to wrap the second hand.

, Let the foil stay wrapped for 15 minutes. Don’t try pulling it open to check if it’s working—keep it shut. After 15 minutes, remove the wrapping one nail at a time. The gel will have started to peel back. Use a cuticle stick to push the gel off your nail.









If there is gel stuck that you can’t remove with the cuticle stick, re-wrap your nails with another acetone soaked cotton ball and foil. Let sit for another 15 minutes and try again.

, Once again, you want to finish with cuticle oil. Massage cuticle oil into the skin around the base of your nail.

Protect the skin around your nails with petroleum jelly.,
Wrap your nails in acetone.,
Remove the foil and cotton balls.,
Condition your nails.",How to Remove Gel Nails1," Acetone is a chemical that reacts with the gel nail to loosen its adhesive and free it from your natural nail. Acetone is a common ingredient in nail polish remover, but in order to remove gels, you need a concentrated amount of pure acetone.









Cover the bowl of acetone with plastic wrap or foil. Use a rubber band to hold the cover in place.
Place the acetone in a larger bowl of warm water, so the acetone warms up. Let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes. Then remove the acetone from the outer bowl to prevent overheating. Be careful with this process, because acetone is flammable. Keep the acetone away from any direct heat sources, and warm only gently and with care.;
, Acetone can dry out and damage your skin, so its important to protect it with a layer of jelly. If you don't have plain petroleum jelly, use a lotion or balm that lists it as an ingredient.









Dip a cotton swab in the petroleum jelly and use it to apply the petroleum jelly around the edges of your nails. Cover the skin on your fingers down just below your top knuckles.
Don't get too much jelly on your nails, since the acetone needs to be able to dissolve the gel.

, Dip a cotton ball in acetone to completely saturate it, then hold it against your nail and wrap it in a strip of aluminum foil to fix it in place. Repeat with your remaining nails. Let your nails soak in acetone for 30 minutes.









If acetone doesn't irritate your skin, you can dip your nails straight into the bowl instead of using cotton balls and aluminum foil. Make sure not to soak them like this for more than 30 minutes.

, Remove the foil and cotton ball from one nail first. The gel should come right off when you swipe it with the cotton ball. If it does, repeat the process with your remaining nails.









You may have to help the gel come off by peeling it back a bit.
If the gel on your test nail is still firmly in place, replace the acetone-soaked cotton ball, wrap it up in foil, and let your nails sit for another 10 minutes before trying again, continuing until the adhesive is softened and the nails can be removed. If this method doesn't work within one hour, the adhesive is probably resistant to acetone and another method should be employed.

, Rinse off the acetone and then shape your natural nails with a nail file. Buff them with a nail buffer to remove rough edges. Moisturize your nails and hands with lotion or cosmetic oil.









File only in one direction, so you don't damage your nails. Avoid using a sawing motion.
The acetone may have dried out your nails. Treat them gently for the next few days. You might want to wait a week or so before applying another set of gels.

The same way ice water works to freeze your nail polish dry, sticking your hands in the freezer will dry your polish completely as well. When you finish painting your nails, stick your hands in the freezer for a few minutes.








, Your blow dryer is great for drying your hair, so why wouldn't it also work on your nails? Adjust your dryer to the coolest setting, and blast your nails with the cold air. Using warm or hot air will soften the polish and keep it from drying.








, The squeeze bulb air-dusters that people use to clean out the nooks and crannies of keyboards are great for drying your nails too. Blow your nails with the air duster for around 5 minutes to dry the polish. Be sure to hold the spout far enough away from your hands and squeeze gently: The pressure of the duster could cause your nail polish to run.








, Although it may sound strange, a can of cooking spray in your kitchen cupboard works great for drying nail polish quickly. As soon as your nails have a top coat, spray them completely with your cooking spray. Let it sit for a minute or two, and then wash your hands of the oil.

Look for signs that you are close to the natural nail.,
File the remaining gel with a finer-grit file.,
Condition your nails.",How to Remove Gel Nails2," Use a nail clipper to clip off the part of the nail that extends past your finger. Trim them as short as possible. If they are too thick to cut with a nail clipper, use a course file to file them down.








, Use a coarse-grit file between 150 and 180 grit. File gently and in crosshatches to keep the work even, moving the file to different areas so that you don’t feel a burning sensation in one place.









The filing process might take a long time. Resist the urge to work quickly or unevenly, which can damage the natural nail underneath.
Wipe dust away frequently. This will allow you to clearly see how much more gel there is to go before you hit natural nail.

, You don't want to keep filing once you get down to the natural nail, since you could damage it. Signs that you're close to the natural nail include the following:


A big reduction in dust that is produced from filing the gel.
Visibility of the natural ridges in your nails.

, Work slowly and gently to make sure you don't file the surface of your natural nail. Though damage is hard to avoid when working with regular gel nails, working gently will minimize it. Continue until the gels have been completely filed away.








, Use a buffer to smooth the surfaces of your nails, which may have become scratched from the filing process. Moisturize your nails and hands with lotion or oil, and keep them away from chemicals and other harsh substances for a few days. Wait a week before applying another set of gels.

Wait until the nails are mostly chipped away.,
Insert a cuticle stick under the surface of a gel.,
Peel off the gel.,
Condition your nails.",How to Remove Gel Nails3," Gels tend to chip off after a week or two, and its best to wait until they're mostly gone to start peeling them yourself, so you reduce damage to the surface of your nail.

, Work it gently under the gel until the gel is slightly raised around the edge. Don't dig too hard under the gel, or you may damage your natural nail.








, Use your fingers or a pair of tweezers to grasp the edge of the gel and peel it back. Repeat with each finger until the gels have been completely removed.









Don't rip off the gels. A layer of your natural nail will come up with them.
If the gels are tough to peel, consider using another removal method.

, Use a file to smooth out the edges, and use a nail buffer to smooth out the rough spots on the surface of your nails. Rub lotion or oil on your nails and hands. Wait a week before applying another set of gels.

Reduce the length first.,
Thin out the nail.,
Use a nail file for fine tuning the edges.",How to Shape Acrylic Nails1," It is important to cut down the nail to your desired length before you begin to shape it. Otherwise you might shape your nails and then realize they are too long. You can either use a grinder to cut down the nail or use a file to reduce the length manually.Don’t worry about the shape just yet. Just focus on getting the nail’s length to where you want it to be.;
, Your nail may be somewhat thick after you file it down and this can look unattractive. To improve the appearance of your nails, you can thin them out by grinding or filing away some of the nail’s surface.








You will need either a motorized nail grinder to slowly grind away some of the nail or a file to manually file away some of the nail. File or grind along the top of the acrylic, not underneath it.
Use a curving motion as you file or grind away at the nail.
Make sure that you only grind along the free edge of the nail. Do not try to grind the acrylic nail over the edge where the nail is attached to your natural nail. This will weaken the nail and increase the chances that it will break.

, After you have finished thinning the nail, you can use a nail file to fine tune the edges of your nails. For example if you notice any rough spots along the surface or the edges of the nail, then use a fine grit nail file to gently smooth them out.









A metal file or emery board works best for filing acrylic nails.

Splurge a bit on essentials.,
Get yourself in the right mindset.,
Decide what kind of polish fanatic you are.,
Keep an open mind.,
Look for duplicates.,
Look for deals.,
Take advantage of store-specific discount cards and clubs.,
Store your nail polish well to make it last as long as possible.",How to Buy Nail Polish on a Budget," While it is true, to an extent, that more expensive polishes look better and have better staying power, there are always exceptions, and any polish can be made to look good and last awhile with a good top coat and base coat combo. Do some research to decide what products you'd like to buy. With top coats, you can choose between glossy or matte finishes and you'll probably want to consider drying time as a factor, and there are base coats designed to strengthen, fortify, or help grow your nails that would be worth the investment. Online reviews and forums can be a valuable resource in making this decision, and you could also ask around at local cosmetics stores. Even if the price tag on your final choice has you cringing a bit, don't worry about it... the money you save on the actual nail polish will more than make up for it.;
, If you're going to be a smart nail polish shopper, there are some deadly mind traps that you'll have to teach yourself to avoid.


Brand Loyalty: Even if you start off with a certain brand of polish and find that you like most of the colors you own from that particular brand, don't box yourself in. No nail polish brand has every color known to man, and every brand, no matter how expensive, will have a few colors that just aren't as good as they look in the bottle. Especially if you've already become loyal to a more expensive brand, open your eyes and look around. Do you want to spend ten dollars to get a color in ""your"" brand, or get a color that's almost identical for two dollars?







Brand Names: If you're carrying a Coach purse, everyone who knows anything about purses can tell that it's Coach and that it's real, and it makes you look rich and trendy. The same goes for clothes and other accessories. However, despite what you may be led to believe, it does not matter with nail polish. Most people aren't going to be looking at your nails closely enough to realize that you're wearing a 99 cent duplicate (""dupe"" in nail polish lingo) of a twenty dollar designer polish. If the look you're going for is ""big chunks of colorful glitter"", get something with big chunks of colorful glitter in it. You know what look you want, and you shouldn't let saving up for labels and brand names get in the way of your goal.






Impulse Buys: As with anything else you may run across while shopping, there's always the potential that you could go into a store looking for one color of nail polish, leave with twenty, and never use ten of those. Even if you see something that looks cool and different, before buying, you should think to make sure you don't already have a similar polish and that you will actually use this one if you buy it. If you're not sure, don't worry. It'll be there for you to come back for later.







Nail Polish Blogs: The internet is full of blogs devoted to nothing but pictures (""swatches"" in nail polish lingo) of different colors of nail polish. It's easy to get to reading these and end up with a list of polishes you want that's as long as your arm. However, as you begin to search for them, you are likely to discover that they are expensive, discontinued (and selling for three figures on eBay), or from companies that don't look entirely trustworthy. No matter how pretty a polish is, just remember that if you feel uncomfortable giving the seller your credit card info or if it costs more than you feel comfortable spending, it's not worth it. Look for a dupe, or just resign yourself to not paying $130 for a bottle of the much sought-after Clarins 230 on eBay.







Fads: As with anything else in fashion, there are fads and trends in nail polish that come and go. Some recent ones include shatter polish and magnetic nail polish. No matter how cool something looks, think twice before you run out and buy it in every color. Try buying just one and see if you like it first, and even then, don't get too many, because you probably won't finish a bottle before another fad pops up.







, Some people are into wearing the current trends, no matter how bizarre they may be. Some like to create designs and pictures on their nails (and thus use nail polish more like paint). Some people just like to paint solid colors, while others like glitter, duochromes, flakies, or layering different polishes. Once you know what you like to wear, it's easier to narrow down what you'll actually use and what would just be an impulse buy.

, Even if your friends claim that a certain brand of polish is no good, try a couple before you agree with them. Cheaper brands tend to be a bit hit-and-miss in terms of formula and quality (this is where reading reviews can come in handy before buying), but almost all brands have a few hidden gems that you will really appreciate if you manage to find them. If you assume a certain brand is ""no good"", you could be missing out on a great deal.

, A simple Google search can save you a lot of time shopping around. For instance, Deborah Lippmann's Happy Birthday polish is very popular, but there are many duplicates out there (one of the cheapest is Wet n' Wild's Party of Five Glitters, which can be found for as little as a dollar, if you know where to look). With basic colors, just try to go for the cheaper brands as a general rule... for the most part, red is red, no matter if it costs two dollars or thirty.

, Especially with drugstore brands, if you take the time to thumb through the ads you get in the mail, you can often find polishes that are already cheap on sale for half off, buy one get one free, et cetera. This is when you make a quick list of colors you've been looking for and run to the store to stock up.
, If you tend to buy your nail polish at a couple of specific stores, it can help a lot to sign up for their rewards club to get special deals and lower prices. Even if you have to pay a small fee to become a member, it should pay for itself quickly.

, You should always make sure the lids are closed tightly and the bottles are stored upright. If you notice your polishes thickening up over time, splurge a little bit on a bottle of nail polish thinner (available at most cosmetics stores and online) instead of just buying a new bottle. If you buy your polishes at the cheapest price you can find them for and care for them well, you'll definitely be proud of yourself when you see the end result.

File down the tips for square nails.,
Create coffin shaped nails.,
Soften square edges for squround or squoval nails.,
Go for round or oval nails.,
Give yourself almond-shaped nails.,
Try stiletto nails.",How to Shape Acrylic Nails2," Square nails are good starting point for most nail shapes, but they might not look good on everyone. If you have short and








To get square tips, simple file the ends of your nails only. Keep filing until your acrylics are in a square shape. Then, round out the corners slightly so that you eliminate the sharp corners while keeping the square shape.
You can use a grinder or nail file to achieve this shape.

, Coffin shaped nails are long with a flat tip and tapered edges, similar to a coffin. If you want this shape, then start by getting your nails to your desired length and then file down the tips of your nails until they are flat and even.Use a file or a grinder to get a straight flat edge at the end of each of your nails. Doing this will create a square shape, but you can taper the edges to turn the squares into coffins.
Then, use a grinder or nail file to create the tapered edges and file away the sharp points at the corners of your nails.

, Nails that are called squround or squoval are simply square nails that have slightly rounded edges. It is up to you how much you want to round out the edges for this type of nail.To get squround or squoval nails, start with square tipped nails and then begin to round out the corners of your nail tips. File towards the center of the end of your nail using a round motion.
Do not file too close to the stress point of your nails. This is the area where the nail connects to your natural nail. This may increase the chances of breakage. Instead, just file along the free edge of the acrylics.You can use a grinder or a nail file to get this shape.

, If you like the rounded shape of squround or squoval nails, then you might even consider rounding out the tips a little more to create rounded or oval tips. Round tip nails have a shape that is similar to a half-circle, while oval nails have a tip that is similar to an egg.


Round nails are the most conservative and they look best if you keep them somewhat short.For round nails, use a circular or arc-like filing motion to make your nail tips resemble a half-circle. Keep filing in this way until your nail tips are round and even.
Oval nails are slightly more feminine, but still conservative.For oval nails, use a circular motion, but try to taper in the edges of your nails slightly as you do so. You can do this by applying a little more pressure on the outer edges of your nails as you file them.
Use a nail file or a grinder to achieve a round or oval look.

, Almond-shaped nails are elegant and rounded with slight points at the tips. This is a great look if you have short or heavy fingers and you want to elongate them. It is also a really feminine look.To get almond-shaped nails, begin by marking the center point of the tips of your nails with a small dot of nail polish. This will make it easier to get even almond shaped nails.
File towards the center point of your nails using a round motion. Do not file straight across. Try to move the file in a curved fashion.
Repeat the same filing motion on both sides of your nails until you have achieved the almond-shape.
You can use a nail file or grinder to do this.

, Stiletto nails are daring, but they have become a popular look. These pointy, claw-like nails are sexy and ultra-feminine, but they are also not your everyday nail look. If you are considering trying out the stiletto nail shape, then start by marking the center points of each of your nails with a small dot of nail polish.Start filing towards the center point. File straight towards the center point of your nail to create claw-like tips. Do this one both sides of your nail until you have a pointy tip.
Then, round out the tips slightly to eliminate the sharp edge. The tips should still be pointed, but not so sharp that you could scratch yourself or someone else with them.

Check your lanula.,
Consider your fingers.,
Look at pictures.,
Try it out.",How to Shape Acrylic Nails3," The natural shape of your lanula can help you to determine what type of nails would look good on you. The lanula, or moon, is the white area of the nail that is just above your cuticle. Choosing a shape that mirrors the lanula or moon will help to ensure that it complements your nails.Look at your lanula to determine what nail shape would look best on you.
For example, if you have rounded cuticles, then a round shape would look best. However, if your cuticles are somewhat square, then a square or squround shape would look best.

, Slim fingers will look good with almost any type of nail, but some nail shapes will complement wider fingers better while some shapes will make wider fingers appear even wider. Consider the length and width of your fingers to determine what type of nails might look best on you.


For example, square nails might make wider fingers look even heavier. Squround, squoval, oval, or round nails will look good on just about anyone. Almond shaped or stiletto nail can make your fingers look longer and slimmer.

, Checking out photos of nail shapes that you like may also help you to decide on what shape is right for you. Browse pictures of different nail shapes and lengths to get an idea of what you like and don’t like.


Try creating the Pinterest board of nail shapes that you like. This can help you decide what shapes are the most appealing to you.

, It is hard to know what will look good on you until you have tried it. If you are not sure what type of nail shape you want, then try starting with one that you can easily change into a different shape.


For example, you could start with square shaped nails and then transition to round nails if you don’t like the way the square shaped nails look.
Avoid starting with a look that would be difficult to adjust to another shape. For example, it would be hard to change almond-shaped or stiletto nails into a different shape because of how much nail you will need to file away to get these shapes.

Pick a clear, shiny tape.,
Put a piece of tape over your nail.,
Cover the underside of the tape in nail polish.,
Buff the nail at the tape end (optional).,
Use nail polish if you have it.,
Try the splatter nail polish method.,
Decorate with other methods.",How to Make Fake Nails Out of Tape," Ordinary, single-sided Scotch tape is the easiest to use on nails.It can be completely clear or a little clouded, depending on what you like.


Scotch tape is a transparent tape, called Sellotape or sticky tape in some areas.;
, Tear off a strip of tape about two times longer than your whole fingernail. Put the tape on your finger so it covers the entire nail and extends past it, so the whole nail looks glossy. Press the sides of the tape down firmly, so the tape bends like a regular long nail would.


If the tape is too wide, have an adult trim the tape with a pair of scissors.

, Brush the sticky underside of the tape with nail polish. This will make the nails last longer and stop them sticking to things – but make sure not to touch anything while you wait for the polish to dry., If you have a nail buffer, use sides 3 or 4 to rub the bottom of the nail gently. Do this over the lower edge of the tape, and it will wear the tape down, making the line less visible., You can use nail polish just like you would for a normal nail.There are countless designs you can create, and you don't need to bother with a base coat when you're using tape. Pick your favorite colors and start decorating.


Always wait for one color to dry before you add another color on top of it.
A clear polish after everything is dry will make it look glossy.

, Since you already have tape, why not try a decoration method that uses it? You'll also need a small, plastic straw and a layer of newspaper to work over, since this method is messy. This works best with several colors of nail polish.Surround the fingers around your nail with more tape to protect them from the polish. Be careful not to overlap the tape with your fake nail, or you could tear it off.
Dip a thin straw in nail polish and blow through it while it's just above the nail. This will splatter the polish over the fake nail.
Repeat with other colors. Since the tip of the straw has polish on it, you'll want to put the next color on a plastic plate or bit of newspaper, then dip the straw in that instead of directly in the nail polish bottle.
When you're done, let it dry, then remove the tape protecting your fingers.

, If you don't have nail polish, you can decorate the tape with small stickers. You can try writing on it with a permanent marker, but it will most likely smudge unless you very carefully put a second layer of tape over the drawing.

Kits contain everything you need to get started and come with detailed instructions to help you achieve the look you want. Make sure you read the ingredients so the monomer does NOT contain MMA. MMA (Methyl methacrylate) is a dental acrylic and is too hard for the natural nail. Look for EMA - Ethyl Methacrylate, that is what you want on your nails. Look for brands professional uses or google for something a lot of people recommend.;
, For greater control over the appearance of your acrylics, you may want to buy the supplies separately. This way you'll also be prepared when it's time to reapply acrylic after your nails grow out. Go to a beauty supply store and buy the following supplies:


Acrylic nail tips and nail tip glue. The tips are usually quite long, which allows you to trim and file them down to the shape and size you want.






Acrylic nail clippers and files. Regular clippers and files aren't as effective on acrylic nails.180, 240, 1000 & 4000 grit should be enough. You might need an even coarser file than the 180 grit if the end result is very clumpy.






Acrylic liquid and acrylic powder. These substances are mixed together to create acrylic nails. As said before, stay away from MMA monomers, go for the EMA (always read what ingredients is used!).






Acrylic bowl and acrylic brush. You need these supplies to mix up the acrylic and apply it. Somewhere between size #8-12 might be a good choice.
Training fingers or a training hand. I know you are very eager to do your first nails on your own hands - or on someone else. But before that you should, and probably need, to practice on something that won't harm you or anyone else. Remember these are strong chemicals which may cause allergies if you aren't careful. Do your first (at least) 10 tries on a training finger or hand. When you are good enough so the material does not go outside of the practice nail, do a few more and then you can start to think about doing it on a real hand. Allergies are for life, if you are unsure, don't do it on anyone else than on yourself.







, Acrylic should be applied to clean nails, so remove your old polish before getting started. Use an acetone-based, oil-free nail polish remover to take it off. If you have old acrylic nails or gels to remove, soak them in pure acetone to remove them. Do NOT peel them off; soak them until it can be pushed away with ease. Peeling it off will damage your own nail, making it a lot thinner.

, To provide a good base for the acrylic, use a nail scissors or nail clippers to trim your natural nails to a short, even, manageable length. A few millimeters is good to have so you can glue the tips at the end where your natural smile line is. Use a nail file to even them out.








, Use a soft nail file to make the surface of your nails slightly rougher and less shiny. This provides a better surface for the acrylic to stick to.








, You want the acrylic to be adhered to your natural nails, not your skin. Push back your cuticles or trim them to keep them out of the way while you give yourself a manicure.









Use a wooden cuticle pusher to push back your cuticles. Metal pushers can be used, but wooden are better for your nails. If you don't have a cuticle pusher, a wooden popsicle stick can be substituted.






It's easier to push back cuticles when they're soft and wet, rather than dry. Soak your fingers in warm water for a few minutes before using the cuticle pusher, and preferable work on them days before so they are extra fine for your treatment.







, This removes the remaining moisture and oils from your nails to get them ready for the acrylic. This step is one of the most important for best adhesion. If oil remains on your nails, the acrylic won't stick.


Use a cotton ball or preferably a lint-free paper towel to carefully rub the surface of your nails with acetone.






Nail primer with acid is made with an methacrylic acid, which can burn. Be careful not to use too much or get it on your skin. There are acid-free primers if you are unsure of the acid ones.







, Find the right size tips for your nail. If the tip doesn't fit your nail perfectly, file it down to size. A little too small can sometimes look better than a little too big. Place a dab of glue on the tip from side to side and apply it to your natural nail so that the bottom edge of the acrylic tip is centered halfway down the surface of your nail. Hold it in place for five seconds to allow the glue to dry. Do that on all 10 nails, then cut the nails to preferred length.









If you accidentally apply the nail tip crooked, soak it in water for a few minutes to remove it, they dry your nail and reapply the nail tip.






Make sure the glue doesn't flow onto your skin.







, Pour the liquid acrylic into the acrylic dish, and pour some powder into a separate dish. Acrylic is a strong chemical that produces fumes that can be toxic, so make sure you're working in a well-ventilated area.








, Dip the brush into the acrylic dish. Push it all the way down and make sure all the bubbles goes away. Then brush it against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid. Run the brush through the acrylic powder so that a small, moist ball collects on the end of the brush.









You may have to practice a few times to achieve the correct ratio of liquid to powdered acrylic. The small ball of acrylic mixture should be moist and spreadable, but not too wet. The acrylic should stray on the brush, not drip off of the brush.






Have paper towels handy in case you need to brush off extra moisture and to wipe the brush between strokes so the acrylic doesn't stick to the brush.







, Start at the ""smile line,"" the bottom edge of the acrylic tip. Flatten the acrylic ball over the line and brush it down to the tip. Spread it quickly and smoothly so that the transition between your natural nail and the acrylic tip is smooth. Take a second ball of acrylic and place it near your cuticle, but not too close. With small circular movements, try to get the acrylic closer to the cuticle, without touching it, and then brush the acrylic down to make a smooth transition. Repeat the procedure with all ten nails.









Remember to wipe your brush on a paper towel between every stroke. When you get a hang of it you won't need to do it as often. This is so the acrylic won't stick to your brush. If i'ts still on the brush you could dip the brush in the liquid while the acrylic is still wet on the brush, and then wipe it off again.
Less is more! If you have too much acrylic on the nails you'll have to file for what feels like an eternity. Working with small beads is easier in the beginning.






If you apply the acrylic correctly, there should be a gentle curve, rather than a harsh line, where the acrylic tip meets your natural nail. You may need to use more than one ball of acrylic per nail to achieve this.






Don't apply the acrylic to your cuticle. It should start a few millimeters above your cuticle so that it adheres to your nail, not your skin.







, It should only take about ten minutes before the acrylic is completely set. Test it by tapping the surface of your nail with the handle of your acrylic brush. If it makes a clicking sound, it's ready for the next step.

, Now that the acrylic has set, use a course nail file (180 grit for example) to shape the tips and file them to the length you want. Use a buffer to buff the surface of the nails, the 240 grit file takes away the scratches from the 180 grit file. Finish with an 1000 grit and after that the 4000 grit for the extra shine. With the 4000 it can be as shiny as a top coat if done correctly!








, You can use a coat of clear polish or choose to paint them with colored nail polish. Apply the polish to the entire nail to create a smooth, even surface.








, After about two weeks, your nails have grown out. Choose to either reapply acrylic or remove the acrylic from your nails.


If your nails are green or yellow or in any other way looks unhealthy, DO NOT apply acrylic on your nails. Fungus and other nail conditions won't go away and need treatment! It will get worse if you apply acrylic nails on it. Nail fungus is highly contagious so don't use un-disinfected tools on you or anybody else.

, This is the fun part. Decorate your nails with whatever design you want. You may also choose not to decorate it if you already like the design that your straw has. Make sure to decorate it using a marker that will dry and not rub easily off.

, Make sure not to cover the whole back of the nail, just some and leaving the top empty. Make sure to put the tape on the bottom of the nail, as not to ruin the design.

, These are temporary, and you can choose to use nail glue. Make one for every nail!"

Acrylic powder
Setting spray
Nails
Cuticle stick
Nail file;
, If you purchase a kit, then it is important to read and follow the instructions that are included with it. Make sure that you work in a well-ventilated area as well and follow any other safety precautions that are included with your product., Use the buffing edge of a nail file or nail buffer to smooth out the top of the nail you want to repair. This will help to make the surface even for when you apply the new nail. Then, use the file to even out the end of the nail and smooth out any rough or jagged edges. Make sure that you brush away any dust from the nail after you finish buffing and filing.








You can also trim the nail if it is really uneven or if it has a tear in it.
If the acrylic is still partly on, then you will need to remove it the rest of the way before you can buff and file the nail. If it is loose enough, then you might be able to just pull it off. If the nail is still attached, you can soak the nail in pure acetone to loosen it.Try soaking a cotton ball in acetone and pressing it against the broken nail.
It is also best to apply acrylics to nails that are somewhat short, so you may need to trim down the natural nail if it is long., Sort through the acrylic nail tips to find one that is similar to your natural nail. Try to choose a nail tip that fits well over your natural nail and that is not too wide or too narrow.








Clear acrylic nail tips will look more natural than white tips.

, Apply a line of acrylic brush-on gel to the inside of the nail tip. Only apply the gel to the area that fits over your natural nail. Then, place the nail tip over your natural nail and press it into place.








Apply firm pressure for about five seconds to ensure that the nail tip is secured in place., After the nail is secured, use scissors or nail clippers to trim it down to the same length as your other nails. Try to cut the nail straight across, but don’t worry if it is not perfectly even at the end.








Next, file the nail into the same shape as your other nails.
Buff the top of the fake nail as well to make it more even with your natural nail.

, After you have filed the nail into the same shape as your other nails, apply a coat of the brush on gel over your natural nail and over the acrylic nail tip. This will help to keep the nail in place.








You can apply the brush on gel just like a coat of nail polish. Start near the cuticle and brush the gel out towards the nail tip. Do this a few times to cover the whole nail.

, While the acrylic gel is still wet, dip your nail into the acrylic powder. Make sure that you dip your entire nail into the powder. This powder will bond with the nail and harden it even more.








It is okay if you get a little powder on your skin. You can just brush it off with your other fingers.

, After you have coated your entire nail in the acrylic powder, you will need to scrape away the excess gel and powder from the edges of your nail. Use the cuticle stick to clean around the edges of your nail.








You can also smooth away some of the excess powder on the nail with your fingertip.

, To ensure that your acrylic will stay in place, you will need to repeat the process of applying gel and dipping the nail in powder two to three times. Make sure that you clean around the nail with the cuticle stick after each application of the powder.Two to three coats of gel and powder should be plenty. Too much gel and powder could cause the nail to seem unnaturally thick.

, To set the acrylic powder and gel, spray on two sprays of the gel activator. This will set the nail within a few seconds. After your use the spray on activator, the nail will be dry and hard.








Spray the gel onto your whole nail, not just on the acrylic. Make sure that the spray covers all of the areas where you applied the gel and powder.

, After your nail is set, you can begin filing and shaping it again. This will allow you to smooth away any rough edges caused by the acrylic gel and powder. Use a fine edged file to smooth you the edges of your nail.Make sure that you buff the top of the nail where the acrylic tip meets with your natural nail. There will be a slight ridge, so buffing the nail is important to ensure that the nail looks natural.

, After you finish filing and buffing the nail, apply the nail polish of your choice to complete the repair. Choose a nail polish in the same color as the rest of your nails and apply two to three coats for even coverage.








Allow the nail polish to dry completely before you touch anything.

nail file
cuticle pusher
acrylic liquid
pink and white acrylic powders
acrylic nail brush
acrylic nail forms
clear topcoat
paper towels;
, Before you start doing a pink and white manicure, make sure that the nails are ready to go. To prepare your nails for a pink and white manicure, you will need to:








Wash your hands.
Remove any old nail polish.
File and buff the nails.
Push back the cuticles.

, Nail forms fit over the finger tip and natural nails. The forms make it possible to easily create natural looking nail tips with the acrylic powder and liquid. Place a nail form on each of the nails before you get started.








The open portions of the nail forms go over the tops of the nails.
The nail forms have adhesive that will help to hold them in place.

, To create your nail tips, you will need to create small balls made up of acrylic liquid and powder. Start by taking your brush and dipping it into the acrylic liquid. Then, dip the brush into the acrylic powder.








You should now have a small ball of acrylic on your brush. Take the ball and place it on your nail form near the tip
Wipe your brush on a paper towel after you place the ball on the nail form.

, Use your brush to start shaping the ball of acrylic into a nail tip on the nail form. Create a rounded line where the nail tip will meet with the natural nail and round out the tip of the nail as well. This rounded area is known as the smile line and it is crucial for a quality pink and white manicure.








Start shaping the smile line so that the edge of it begins at about the middle of the nail bed.The center of the smile line should be further away from the cuticle and closer to the tip of the nail.
You can use the natural nail as your guide. Follow the curve of the nail to help you create the smile line. The nail form can also help you to get the right shape.
After you finish shaping the smile line, straighten out the sides of the tip. These are known as the sidewalls.They should appear to extend straight out from the nail bed.
Finish shaping the nail tip by creating a flat edge along the tip of the nail.

, Next, you will need to use the acrylic liquid and pink acrylic powder to make the pink part of the pink and white nails. Dip your brush into the acrylic liquid and then dip it into the pink acrylic powder. Then, take this pink acrylic ball and place it right next to the edge of the white acrylic nail tip you have created.








Place the pink ball in the area that will overlap the natural nail. The pink acrylic should be flush against the smile line of the white acrylic.
You may need to create multiple pink acrylic balls to fill in the area that will overlap the natural nail.

, After you have finished creating all of the pink and white nails and they have had a chance to dry, you can remove the nail forms. The acrylic dries quickly, so most of the nails should be dry by the time you finish your set.








You can remove the nail forms by sliding each one forward and sliding the nail through the opening on the top of each form.

, Next, you will need to file the tips to make them all uniform. Start by filing along one edge of each of the nails. File so that the sidewalls are extending straight out from the natural nail.Then, repeat this for each of the nails on the other side. After that you can begin to shape the nails.








Remember to check the nail bed to determine what type of nail shape will look best. If the nail bed is curved along the cuticle, then an oval tip might look best. If the nail bed is square along the cuticle, then a square tipped nail might look best.

, After you have filed the nails into a pleasing shape, you can apply a clear topcoat to each of the nails. This will help to protect the nails and give them a pleasing shine. Apply two or three layers for maximum shine and protection.







, People who have dry brittle nails may want to wait a while before getting acrylics done. If you have dry, brittle nails or if the person who you are giving acrylics to has dry brittle nails, then waiting until the nails improve might be a good idea.Try waiting a few days for the nails to repair themselves. During this time, do not apply any polish to the nails. Allow them to breath and grow.

, Acrylic nails require regular upkeep to continue looking great and to keep your nails healthy. Try not to go too long without getting a fill or you may end up with separated nails or even an infection.




For best results, go for a fill once every two to three weeks.

, Acrylic nails can get dirty more easily than short nails, so you will need to make sure that you clean them daily. Wash your hands with a nails brush once per day or any time they get dirty.To use a nail brush, apply a bit of soap and warm water to your hands. Then, use the nail brush to clean around the edges of your nails and under the tips.
Dry your hands and nails thoroughly after you wash them.Inspect all of the nails daily as well to check for any signs of infection, such as redness, warmth or puffiness.

, Whenever you have to do something that might damage your nails or expose them to excess water or dirt, put on a pair of vinyl or latex gloves. This will help to protect the nails from damage."
"
Wear gloves when doing household chores.,
Carry a small nail brush with you.,
Wash hands frequently.,
Moisturize nails and cuticles.,
Apply topcoat every few days.,
Change acrylic nails frequently.,
Refill your nails every two weeks.",How to Clean Acrylic Nails2," To protect your acrylic nails, wear gloves while doing any household chores (e.g. washing dishes, cleaning countertops). Choose a glove size slightly larger than your hands to accommodate your acrylic nails. If you have a latex allergy and cannot wear regular rubber gloves, opt for vinyl or nitrile gloves instead., Make sure that your nails stay clean by carrying a small nail brush with you during the day. Remove any food, dirt, or other debris that might get stuck under your nails right away to avoid buildup. Before washing your hands (e.g. before eating), take the opportunity to give your nails a quick brush to clean away any small particles under your nails., Be sure to wash your hands frequently during the day to keep your acrylic nails clean. Use an antibacterial soap to remove germs that can build up and cause the growth of fungus under your nails. Dry nails thoroughly after washing your hands.







, To keep your acrylic nails looking clean and healthy, keep them properly moisturized. Lotions and oils can help add flexibility to acrylic nails to avoid breakage or damage. Some good moisturizer options include:Lotion with vitamin E
Rapeseed oil
Jojoba oil
Coconut oil

, To keep nails looking clean, apply a clear top coat every two to three days. The top coat will prevent chips and cracks in your nails, and keep them looking fresh. Purchase topcoat at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store.







, To keep your acrylic nails healthy, avoid leaving them on for more than three months at a time. Over a prolonged period, bacteria may accumulate under nails and allow for the growth of fungus. Replace your nails regularly and give your natural nails at least a few days to recuperate in between., When you are at the salon getting acrylic nails put on, make an appointment for refills ahead of time so you don’t forget. If you apply your own acrylic nails at home, write a note on your calendar or set an alarm on your phone to alert you in two weeks time that it is time to refill them."

File the surface of your nails.,
Even out the bottom of your nails.,
Dust off your nails.,
Apply a top coat.",How to Clean Acrylic Nails3," After a few weeks, your acrylic nails will likely show signs of wear or discoloration. Using a regular emery board, lightly filing the surface of your nails to remove any marks or yellowish tint that might have developed on them. Make small, circular strokes and take your time to buff the surface of each nail evenly.







, While you are buffing your nails clean, even out the visible gap between your acrylic nail and your natural nail underneath. Lightly buff the bottom edge of the acrylic nail with an emery board until it merges seamlessly with your natural nail. Do not file down too hard as it might damage your cuticles or natural nail, which is likely sensitive from the application of the acrylics.







, After filing and buffing, use a dusting brush to remove acrylic dust from your nails. If you do not have a dusting brush (available online or at beauty supply stores), use an old makeup brush. To avoid a buildup of acrylic dust, brush off your nails frequently during the buffing process.







, After dusting off your nails, apply a clear top coat to them. Apply topcoat in a thin layer as opposed to a thick one, then reapply after drying if you want more coverage. Use a lip brush to remove any polish that falls outside the lines of your nails.








After your top coat dries, apply a coat of polish in the color of your choice, if desired.

Apply the acetone to your nails.,
Remove the foil and cotton balls from your fingertips.,
Scrape off the leftover acrylic with the nail buffer.,
Shape your natural nails.,
Restore the moisture to your hands.",How to Remove Acrylic Nails1," Use a nail clipper to trim the tips of your acrylic nails short. Cut off as much of the acrylic as possible. If cutting is difficult due to the thickness of the nails, use a coarse nail file to file them. But make sure you don't cut any of your nail bed because it will bleed.;
, Use a fine-grade buffer to file off the paint and remove as much of the acrylic as possible. Use long strokes that run the length of the nail.

, Fill a medium glass bowl halfway with acetone. Some people like to place the bowl in a larger bowl filled with warm water, to warm the acetone. Do not microwave the acetone or use it near any source of heat. Acetone is extremely flammable.


Make sure the room is well ventilated, since acetone has strong fumes.
Do not light a cigarette near acetone.

, Acetone dissolves plastic and is also hard on skin, so it's important to protect yourself. This step will prevent your skin from becoming irritated by the acetone, particularly if you have hangnails.


Take care not to get too much petroleum jelly on your nails, since the acetone should be able to reach it and dissolve it.
Use a cotton-tipped wooden applicator if you need help applying the petroleum jelly more precisely.

, Saturate one cotton ball per nail in the warmed acetone, then place the cotton balls on the tips of your fingers. Wrap them tightly against the acrylic nails using strips of aluminum foil. Let your nails soak in the acetone for 30 minutes.


You can use a non-plastic tape to fasten the cotton balls if you don't have aluminum foil.
You can also simply soak your nails in the bowl of acetone if you know that acetone doesn't irritate your skin.

, The cotton ball and the nail should come off easily.









If you soaked your acrylic nails in the bowl of acetone, gently pry the nails off using an orange wood stick.
If the acrylic nails are still firmly stuck, repeat the process for another 20 minutes and attempt to remove them again.

, The acrylic should be soft from the acetone bath, so take the opportunity to buff the rest of it away. If the acrylic begins to harden again while you're buffing, use a cotton ball soaked in acetone to dampen it.

, Use nail clippers and a nail file to smooth the edges. Buff your nails lightly with a fine-grade nail buffer, moving from the base of the nail to the tip.


To avoid damaging your nails, file in one direction only, and avoid using a sawing motion.
The top few layers of your nails may have been removed with the acrylic. Be careful not to tear or damage them further when file and buff them.

, Acetone causes skin to become extremely dry. Rinse off the remaining traces with soap and water. Dry your hands and rub them with body oil, olive oil or a moisturizing lotion.

Clip your nails.,
File your nails.,
Use a cuticle stick to pry up the edge of an acrylic nail.,
Buff your nails.",How to Remove Acrylic Nails2," Use a nail clipper to trim the tips of your acrylic nails short. Cut off as much of the acrylic as possible. If cutting is difficult due to the thickness of the nails, use a course nail file to file them.

, Use the course side of a buffing tool to file down each acrylic nail. Work on one nail at a time, filing away the acrylic until it has become a thin layer overlaying your natural nail. Continue until you've filed away as much of the acrylic from each nail as possible.


You may have been able to file away enough of the acrylic that your nails look almost acrylic-free. If you're worried about nail damage, now is the time to stop. Removing the rest of the nail will necessarily involve taking off a few layers of your natural nail, which can cause long-term damage.
If you'd rather remove all traces of the acrylic, continue to the next step.

, Once you've lifted the edge, place the tip of a cuticle scissors under it and use the scissors to start clipping away the acrylic. Continue lifting the edge and clipping the acrylic until all of the acrylic has been removed.


Repeat this process for every nail until the acrylic is completely gone.
Resist prying more than a little of the acrylic at a time from your natural nail. If you pry off too much at once, it will rip off layers of your natural nail.

, Use a nail buffer to remove the last traces of acrylic. Shape your natural nails with a nail clipper and file. Apply cuticle cream and moisturizer.

Buff your nails.,
Finished.",How to Remove Acrylic Nails3," This removal method requires a second person to work, since two hands are needed to pull the dental floss under the nails. If your nails are already very damaged, or if you are worried about damaging your nails, this method probably is not the best option, as it often takes layers off of the natural nail as the acrylic is pried off.

, Use a cuticle stick to gently pry up the entire bottom edge.

, He or she should face you, slip the dental floss under the bottom edge of the nail, and hold the two ends of the dental floss in either hand.

, Tell him or her to slide the floss back and forth and pull it up, so that the nail begins to come loose. Continue this sawing motion until the acrylic nail is free from the natural nail.









Make sure your partner doesn't yank the floss upward too quickly; you don't want your natural nail getting torn off with the acrylic.
Repeat the process with every nail until they're all removed.

, Use a buffer to clean up your natural nails, which may be a little torn from the process. Apply cuticle cream and moisturizer.








, Your nails should be acrylic free.

Apply lotion to hands and in between fingers to prevent dryness.,
Oil your nails once or twice per day to maintain the flexibility of the nail.Nails that aren't cared for have a greater chance of becoming rigid and, eventually, broken.",How to Care for Acrylic Nails," You don't want your acrylic overlays lifting, which is exactly what happens if your hands and nails are constantly wet. To keep your overlays from lifting, try:









Drying your hands thoroughly with a cloth or paper towel whenever you wash your hands, step out of the shower, or go swimming.
Wearing rubber or latex gloves whenever you're doing the dishes.
Dusting your hands with a bit of baby powder if you have naturally moist hands. The baby powder helps wick away any moisture.;
, Bacteria can attack your natural nails quite easily, leading to damage and infection.Make sure to wash your hands, or alternate washing your hands, with an antibacterial soap to cut down on the possibility of bacterial infection.








, If you chip a section of your nail, go back to the salon and have a beautician take a look at it. Many salons will fix nails that break a few days after your initial appointment, and if not, they should charge less for a quick fix than they would normally.








, Touch your acrylics up by applying clear nail polish, letting dry, and filing. You'll preserve the clean look of your nails and help the acrylic paint last longer.









Every two weeks, go to the salon and have your nails refilled.Refilling will help bond the acrylic nail to your natural nail plate, reduce the risk of infection, and help your nails shine.

, If you do decide to take off paint, don't reach for any old remover. Acetone can make acrylic deteriorate, making it a bad go-to for acrylic nails. Instead, look for nail polish remover that conditions your nails and cuticles while it wipes away the paint.








, Look for dryness, redness, or peeling of the skin around your acrylics. This may be a sign of contact dermatitis, a sign that your skin does not react well to acrylic.If your skin does not respond well to acrylics, that might be a sign to discontinue use.








, Overly dry hands could ruin the look of the acrylic. On the other hand, bacteria and fungi breed in damp places, so try not to allow your hands to stay moist for long periods of time.








, Oil your nails with a neutral oil such as rapeseed oil.

, If you’re heading to a more laid back club, loosen up your collar or opt for jeans instead of slacks. But if you’re heading to a more upscale club, dress more formally. When in doubt, do an online search of the club to read up on their expected dress code. Outfit ideas include:


A nice, well tailored button down collared shirt. Avoid golf shirts or generic corporate looking shirts (blue stripes, checks, ‘boardroom blue’).And don’t forget to tuck in your shirt!Jeans that fit. Baggy jeans are so 90s, and not in a good way. Opt for a nice pair of jeans that fit you well and hug, rather than hang, on you.
A pair of loafers or oxfords. Look for shoes made of polished leather, but avoid pointy toes or square toed shoes, as these styles aren’t considered stylish.Avoid athletic wear or athletic shoes. Though not all clubs have very formal dress codes, most clubs will not allow anyone wearing athletic shoes or athletic wear to get past the doormen. So, leave the gym wear at home.

, Though black is usually seen as the safe and sophisticated option, clubs are usually covered in black light bulbs that can show off dandruff, lint, etc on black.Blue and dark gray are good alternatives to black, and hide sweat lines well.

, It’s a good idea to wear a coat that can survive the hot atmosphere of the club, like a lightweight blazer or a thin leather jacket, so you can skip the long coat check line."

Purchase dance shoes if you swing dance frequently.",How to Dress for Swing Dancing," If you're just going to practice or class, there's no reason to dress up. Dressy clothes can be stuffy and limit movement, so they're best saved for formal occasions. At practice or class, you do not want to limit your mobility. You want to be able to move as much as possible to get the moves down., Keep the blouse light, as lighter materials will gather less sweat. Opt for shorts or pants that are also made out of lighter materials. High-waisted shorts and pants have a vintage feel that allow you to encapsulate the traditional feel of swing dancing without sacrificing comfort during practice.Comfort is the most important thing, so choose shorts and pants that fit you well and that you can move around in.
If you don't want to wear a blouse, a light t-shirt can also work.

, With men, it's considered traditional to wear full-length pants to swing dancing. If you prefer shorts, that should be okay for practice, but comfortable pants are considered more in adherence with tradition. You should pair your pants with a light shirt that you can move around in.Pick pants that fit you well and are comfortable. This is important for swing dancing practice.

, You will get a little sweaty during swing dancing practice. It's a good idea to bring some extra clothes. Have an extra shirt on hand going into swing dancing lessons., A vintage dress is a classic swing dancing look that works great for more formal swing dancing events. Swing dancing was prominent in the 1940's and '50s, so try to pick a dress fitting with this era.In the '40s, dresses usually had fitted tops and collars with an a-line skirt. Button-down dresses were particularly popular, as were colors like black and navy blue.
In the '50s, full, long skirts were often paired with tighter tops. Tops usually had a halter neck and skirts ended around mid-shin. Dresses were more colorful and often had prints like flowers.
You can look for a vintage dress online or at a local secondhand or thrift store. You can also buy a new dress that's cut in a vintage style.

, If you decide to wear a skirt and blouse for swing dancing, this can be an acceptable look. However, make sure the skirt you choose is not constricting. Remember, movement is key for successful swing dancing.Skirts should usually be knee length or longer and loose-fitting. Skirts that cling to the body will be constrictive for swing dancing.
If you want to wear a more fitted skirt, watch the fabric. If you wear something like a pencil skirt, make sure the fabric has a good stretch so you can move around.

, Layers can add a touch of formality and fits with the swing dancing style. If you want to wear layers, try some of the following combinations:Wear a vest over a dress shirt, with a tie, and then throw on a jacket. This look works well for cooler months.
For warmer months, you could stick to a vest, tie, and undershirt but lose the jacket.
If it's very warm out, you can still layer for formality. Hold up a pair of dress pants with suspenders and wear an undershirt and tie.

, If you want to go very formal, wear a suit. Traditionally, a double-breasted suit in worn for swing-dancing. This can work great for very formal occasions, such as a date night or a formal swing dance competition. Go for a suit with a slightly old fashioned, vintage feel.Wear a suit jacket with broad shoulders.
Opt for wider neckties or bow-ties.
The pants you wear with your suit should be high waisted.

, Above anything else, select shoes that are comfortable to wear. This is particularly important if you are selecting shoes for practice. Simple sneakers work best for both men and women who are just starting out swing dancing., Leather soles are important for grip and comfort on the dance floor. When selecting dance shoes, opt for shoes with leather soles either built in or added.Find things like boots, dress shoes, and loafers with leather soles for menswear.
For women's wear, it may be difficult to find heels with leather soles. However, you can try flats, tennis shoes, or boots with leather soles.

, Heels can be a great formal touch for dressier events. A mild heel is fine for dancing if you're experienced. Once you get comfortable swing dancing, it's okay to wear heels. However, until you feel like you have control when dancing, hold off on the heels.If you're unsure when it's safe for you to wear heels, talk it over with your dance instructor.

, If you're serious about swing dancing, find a dance store in your area and talk to a worker about purchasing dance shoes. A professional should be able to help you find shoes catered for your specific feet, style, and goals as a dancer. If you're going to be swing dancing frequently, dance shoes will hold up longer than regular shoes."

Maybe you have a go to hairstyle like a high ponytail or loose curls, or want to change it up and try a new hairstyle like a messy braid or straightened hair.Whatever you decide to do, make sure you hair looks healthy, shiny and put together.
Don’t forget to apply anti frizz product to your hair to prepare your hair for the humidity of a packed club and ensure you look good throughout the night.

, Focus on enhancing the aspects of your look that you love, and bringing out your best features. But avoid putting on too much make up as this can hide your true beauty, rather than emphasize it.


Begin with foundation and concealer. Depending on how much foundation you usually use, decide if you want to apply a bit more on for your night out, and dab concealer on anything on your face you want to cover up or mask. Blush and bronzer are also a great way to add some depth and color once you’ve applied your foundation.Next, focus on your eyes. Decide if you’re going for a certain look, like cat eye or smoky eye, or if you’re more into a natural, simple look with minimal eyeliner and mascara. Don’t forget to apply waterproof mascara so you don’t end up with makeup on your face while you’re dancing with your girls.There are several eye makeup tutorials online for almost any look you can think of.Move on to your lips. Choose a bold shade if you kept your eye make up simple or go for a more subtle shade if your eye makeup is already bold or bright. Use lip liner or a lip pencil to keep your lipstick in place, or opt for a shiny lip gloss.Though it may be tempting to match your makeup with the rest of your outfit, this can end up looking too matchy matchy and tacky. When in doubt, go a makeup look that compliments, rather than matches, your outfit.

, If you are going to a venue that is known for its cool downtown crowd, skip the business suit and very formal get up. But if you’re going to a venue known for a more upscale crowd, maybe a more dressy outfit is a good idea.Tailor your look to the venue, as this will ensure the doorman lets you in and you feel confident walking into the venue.

, Think about the parts of the body you like or feel proud of and don’t mind showing off. Choose an outfit based on the parts of your body you aren’t afraid to flaunt and show some skin based on your comfort level. Remember ladies, you are dressing for yourself, before anyone else.Outfit ideas include:A crop top or blouse and a skirt
A form fitting dress
A pair of nice dress pants and a dressy top
Jeans can be uncomfortable if you tend to sweat in the club, so avoid them.If you have a hard time walking in sky high heels, wear your favorite pair of heeled boots or low heels instead. As well, it’s best to avoid running shoes as they usually aren’t considered formal enough for entry into most clubs., Keep your looks classy with a pair of hoops or silver studs, or a statement necklace. Try to avoid layering on too many necklaces or bracelets as this can make your outfit look like more of a costume., Most clubs tend to be crowded and packed, so avoid bringing a gigantic bag full of all your makeup, shoes, etc. Instead, go for a small purse that can fit your wallet, phone and lipstick or gloss.

, Depending on your climate, this can be a challenge, as you don't want to have to stand in the dreaded coat check line, but you also don't want to freeze your butt off. If you live in a warmer climate, this won't be an issue. But if you live in a colder climate, go for a leather jacket you won't sweat too much in or layer up your coat with a thin sweater.


You can also get creative and choose an outfit that will keep you warm, but also ensure you look good, also known as ""sexy winter clubwear""."

Dress your children in a similar fashion to each other, or even to yourself (optional).",How to Dress for a Tea Party2," Many children's tea parties will have a specific costume theme, such as princesses or storybook characters. To make sure your child doesn't feel left out, try to get a firm grasp on the dress code. If the invitation doesn't list one, call the host/hostess and find out what's recommended.

, Most children's tea parties are centered on a dress-up theme. Here are a few ways to gather items for your child to wear:


Search your own closet. Do you have anything that you wouldn't be heartbroken to lose? Common items you might use include ties, long slips, blouses, belts and scarves.
Look around consignment or thrift stores. Thrift stores can be prime locations to find outrageous hats, coats and shoes for your child to dress up in.
Check out party supply shops. If you're looking for items such as feather boas, plastic tiaras, wands, capes, or fairy wings, visit your local party supply store or check out one online. Most sell dress-up staples like these.

, Long strings of pearls, gaudy clip-on earrings, and fake rings can be fun accessories to add to a child's tea party outfit. Raid your own jewelry box for inexpensive pieces, or check out a party supply store.

, Because the tea party is a special occasion, it might be fun to style your child's hair accordingly. Boys could have their hair slicked back or spiked with pomade, while girls could have ringlets, intricate braids, or grown-up looking up-dos.

, If it's an adult and child tea party, consider matching outfits for fun. Solid color dresses are easy to match up using accessories.

Having old polish on your nails will make it harder for the fake nails to stick. They'll end up falling off in a day or two unless you take this necessary step.









If you're already wearing fake nails, either acrylics or gels, go ahead and remove them. You can use acetone or another method to do the job.
Wash your hands after using acetone or another polish remover. The chemicals used in nail polish remover can dry out your nails.;
, Giving yourself a quick manicure prep before applying fake nails will keep your nails healthy and ensure the fake nails stay on for as long as possible. Start by soaking them in warm water for about five minutes, until they're nice and soft. Dry your hands and nails with a cloth.


You can add some body wash or hand soap to the water if you want, but don't soak your hands in a solution that contains oil. While a good oil soak is a great way to moisturize your hands, having traces of oil on your nails before you apply fake nails will make it harder for them to stick.

, Use a nail clipper or nail scissors to trim your nails so that they're all even. Trim them short, but not to the quick; you want a bit of an edge to give the fake nails more to hold onto. Use a nail file to give your nails a good smooth edge.








, While your nail beds are still soft from the soak, use an orange stick or cuticle pusher to gently push back your cuticles. This way you can make sure you're gluing the fake nails to your nails, not your skin.


Don't trim your cuticles, just push them back. Your cuticles protect your nail beds from getting infected, and trimming them increases the risk that dirt or germs could accumulate there.

, Use a nail buffer to buff your nails well. This will create a slightly rough surface, making it easier for the fake nails to adhere. Wipe off the dust when you're finished.








, Open up the package and lay all the nails out in the order you will be placing them on your nails. The largest fake nails will go on your thumbs, and the smallest will go on your littlest fingers. Make sure the nails fit comfortably over your real nail, and use a file to shape the bottom edges if necessary.


The easiest fake nails to apply require a simple application using nail glue. Your kit should come with a nail for each finger and a little bottle of adhesive.
If you have a kit for applying acrylics, the process is more complicated. See How to Apply Acrylics for instructions.
If you have a kit for applying gels, see How to Apply Gel Nails.

, Swirl a dab of glue on your real nail, and another dab of glue on the part of the fake nail that will be attached to you (not the part that will be sticking up). Carefully place the fake nail directly over your real nail so that the bottom curve lines up perfectly with your cuticle. Press it down and hold for 10 seconds to let it set.









Make sure the nail is set firmly against your real nail, with no gaps.
Don't use too much glue. You don't want it to squirt out the sides. A few dabs will be sufficient. If glue does squirt out, use a cotton swab to gently wipe it away.
Be very careful not to put the nail on crooked. The glue dries fast.
Start applying nails to your dominant hand first.

, One by one, glue each nail on using a dab of glue. Remember to press each nail for 10 seconds to make sure they are sealed tight against your real nails.








, You can use a regular nail file to file them into the classic square or oval shape, or any shape you like. If you're happy with the shape of the nails straight from the package, no need to file!

, Some fake nails come with designs on them, but if yours are blank, you might want to add some extra flair. If you're going for a classic look, there's nothing like a few coats of pretty paint. In addition to a monotone style, consider the following designs:


Ombre nails
Flower nails
Galaxy nails
Ladybug nails
Marbled nails

, You can add a coat of glitter polish to any color, but if you want your nails to really stand out, get a package of small rhinestones to glue on. You can create a dazzling look by applying several to each nail, or use them as tasteful accents that are part of a painted design.

, This is a natural, pretty style that looks great on fake nails. If you want your fake nails to have a realistic touch, a French manicure is the way to go. You can buy a French manicure kit or pick up your own pink, clear and white nail polish to do the job.





, These come in all kind of colors and make it easy to create the designs you want without the messiness of a nail polish brush. Try a polka-dotted look, or do something more complicated, like a panda or strawberry.

, Bright colours and bold patterns are a good start towards building your brazilian wardrobe. Avoid dull and neutral colours as much as possible.

, Your shoes should always be very clean. Flip-flops (chinelas) are appropriate in certain circumstances only. In Rio, they can be worn most of the time. In other cities, avoid flip flops unless you are heading to the beach. It will be obvious that you are a tourist.


Women should carry a pair of colorful sandals with fun details such as bows or flowers in their luggage, while men should invest in a good quality pair of leather sandals.
Toenails and fingernails must be scrupulously clean. It is normal for women to paint their nails, and men often manicure too.

Nail adhesive gel
Nail clipper
Nail file;
, Your nail tips and nail adhesive should come with some instructions for proper use and safety. Read these instructions carefully and follow any safety precautions for the product.For example, some nail products recommend working in a well-ventilated area.

, Look through the nail tips and find one that matches each of your nails. The nail tips should be wide enough to cover your nail, but not so wide that they are overlapping the edges of your nails.Hold up multiple tips to each nail to find the best fit and then lay them out in the order that you will need them.

, Nail adhesive can wreck your nails, but applying a top coat before you apply the nail tips may help to protect them.However, keep in mind that the nail tips may not bond as tightly with your natural nails.









If you are concerned about the health of your natural nails, apply a layer or two of clear topcoat before you apply the nails.

, Most nail tip sets include some adhesive gel with the nails, but if you can also buy nail adhesive separately. Pick up one of the nail tips by the end and apply a line of adhesive gel to the indented area of the tip.








If the nail does not have an indented area, then just apply the adhesive gel along the curved edge of the nail. This is the edge that will need to overlap the end of your natural nail.
Keep in mind that nail adhesive gel bonds quickly and it is quite strong. Make sure that you have the right nail before you press it onto your finger.
If you make a mistake, apply some nail polish remover that contains acetone to the edge of the nail tip.This will help loosen it so that you can remove the nail tip and start over.

, Press the nail tip against your natural nail to ensure that the adhesive bonds tightly with your nail. If the nail tip has an indent in it, then you will need to push the nail back so that the edge meets up with the end of your natural nail. If there is no indentation, then just apply the nail tip about ¼ inch from the end of your nail.








Press on the nail for about five seconds to give the adhesive gel a chance to bond.Repeat this for all of your nails.

, Nail tips are quite long, so you will probably want to trim them down a little before you shape them. Use clippers or a pair of nail scissors to trim the nail down to your desired length.Make sure that you cut straight across. This is especially important if you want square tipped nails.
If you want almond or stiletto tipped nails, then you can also cut off part of the sides of the nails.
Try cutting a little less than you think you will need to cut. Filing your nails will also shorten them slightly, so you may end up with shorter nails than you’d like if you cut too much.

, The nail tips may be a bit stiff and straight looking, which can look unnatural. To give them more curve and enhance their appearance, you can press gently on the edges of the nails as if you are trying to bend the sides of the nails together.








Place your index finger and thumb on either side of a nail and squeeze gently a few times.
Repeat this for all of the nail tips.

, After you are finished trimming and bending the nails into a pleasing curve, you will need to shape your nail tips. Use a file to shape your nails into your desired shape. Some popular nail shapes include:








Square
Almond
Oval
Round
Stiletto

, When you have achieve the shape that you want, you can paint your nails as desired. Choose your color or colors and any special designs you want to add.For example, you could try doing a French manicure, tie dye nails, or a try 3D design.

Press the glitter nails firmly into the coat on your own nails and let them all dry in place completely.,
Apply a tough top coat to your nails.,
Finished.

",How to Create Fake Nails out of Glitter," You'll find the items needed listed below.;
, For best results, choose two different pieces of colored paper and tape them together at the edges. Having these pieces of paper will help you keep your surface clean and will allow you to reuse any glitter than you don't use the first time. Make sure the papers are big enough to fit your entire hand on top of and that they aren't torn or textured.

, Open the clear nail polish and the glitter and set them on one of the pieces of paper. If the glitter is not in a round tub, pour a small pile of it to the side. Because the rest of the steps must be done in quick succession, setting up and opening the materials in advance will allow you to move faster and keeps the nail polish from drying out before you apply the glitter.

, Drip the nail polish carefully onto the second piece of paper. You can use the corner of the brush or a toothpick to spread the nail polish out and create a nail-shaped drop of nail polish that is the same size or larger than your nails. It doesn't matter if it's bigger, you can cut it to the shape of your nail after applying.


For a fun touch, you can use neon nail polish. In this method, sprinkle the glitter more lightly to allow the neon color to be seen through it.

, Use a small spoon to apply loose glitter to the entire surface of the wet nail polish. Make sure that the entire surface has been covered. Sprinkle slowly and lightly to make sure that the weight of the glitter doesn't mess up the form of the nail shaped polish.

, Make sure that you let the paint dry completely before touching it. Because the paint is so much thicker than when you apply a single coat to your nails, it will take a much longer time to dry completely. Once you're absolutely sure the polish is completely dry, tip the paper on its side and shake the excess glitter onto the first piece of paper.

, Pay attention to the shape of each nail as you shape it so that it fits like a custom nail to the shape of your nails. Do not create ten polish nails and then apply the glitter. Do the glitter as soon as you finish shaping each individual nail, so that the surface of the polish doesn't become too hard to absorb the glitter.

, Once you have let the polish dry completely, the polish and the glitter will have bonded together and will form a thick, hard, nail-shaped blob on the paper. Let the nails dry completely before touching them. You can gently poke them after at least three minutes with a toothpick, to see if they're hard yet. If they give at all, give them another three minutes before trying again.

, Slide the edge of the toothpick under the edge of the nail to remove it from the paper. Do not pick it up. Leave all the nails on the paper.

, This coat is going to act as a binder for your new glitter nails. Make sure you don't let it dry completely before completing the next step, and consider applying a slightly thicker coat.

, If you do this correctly, the glitter nail should stick onto the layer of polish you have applied to your nails and not fall off, providing that you do not use your nails for any purpose until they have dried completely.

, Because each individual piece of glitter is so small, they may come off easily. Prevent this by applying a tough, long lasting top coat on top of your nails to seal in your design and give it a nice shine.

Viewing these images will inform you of the basics of what you may be looking for if you're going for a more archaic Celtic look and will give you ideas if you're simply looking to put a Celtic spin on regular modern clothing.;
, Figure out if there is a particular nation out of these you want to incorporate into your wardrobe. For example, Scottish tartan is easy to incorporate into everyday clothing and kilts are excellent for the more daring men. Here is a picture of a Scottish tartan fashioned into a heart.

, Celtic-based jewelry is very, very common these days and should be easy to find, particularly online. If you are Christian, the Celtic cross is an iconic and beautiful symbol of Medieval Celtic culture. If you are not Christian, or do not wish to wear a cross, there are many other Celtic symbols such as the trisilekon.


The most authentic piece of Celtic jewelry is an item actually worn by hundreds of thousands of Iron Age Celts––the torque. The torque is a decorated metal band which is worn around the neck but does not connect at the ends, unlike a necklace. Look it up on Wikipedia to find out its history and significance and on image sites to see what they look like. They often feature animal heads at the two ends, usually animals which live in Western Europe and had a special significance in Celtic culture.
Recommended animals include wolves and boars, which both featured heavily in Celtic myths and legends, the latter of which was sacred in the Celtic culture of Gaul.

, Shirts bearing the Celtic trisilekon symbol are available on sites such as an Amazon, Etsy, etc., for purchase and are of excellent quality for a low price.


There are also many tee-shirts, sweaters, scarves, hats and whatever else which features names and designs of all the Celtic nations. For example, there are many tee-shirts and sweaters which say ""Ireland"" and have Celtic knot designs and/or crosses, as well as Scottish shirts featuring the cross of St. Andrew or the Lion Rampant.

, The three most important sports in the Celtic nations are football (soccer), Gaelic football, and rugby. Football is played universally and Ireland and Scotland each have their own national teams, as well as smaller clubs for different areas of each nation.


Gaelic football is mainly present in the Republic of Ireland, and is an example of a very uniquely Celtic sport. The most important event in rugby is the Six Nations Rugby competition, which features six nations competing (England, France, Italy, Ireland, Scotland and Wales), the last three of which are Celtic nations.
Sportswear is not only important to modern Celtic culture but it often features much older symbolism, for example Scottish football jerseys will usually feature the cross of Saint Andrew and Welsh rugby shirts feature the Welsh Dragon, a symbol which dates back thousands of years and is a symbol of Celtic strength, pride and resistance.

, There is also a large Celtic music scene which exists with bands and musicians such as Loreena McKennitt, Flogging Molly, the Dropkick Murphys, the Pogues, the Dubliners, Crasdant, Na Fili, Enya, Celtic Woman, Celtic Thunder, Gaelic Storm and Albannach, along with many, many more. Many of these groups have tee-shirts, sweaters, scarves and other accessories related to them and these items can be considered to be part of the modern Celtic culture, with many of them featuring older Celtic artwork.


Creating a Pandora account and making a Celtic radio station is a good way to discover a lot of different Celtic bands, from all over the Celtic Nations as well as the United States and the Canadian maritime region such as Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.

, Though it is often left unsaid, King Arthur was in fact a Celtic king who fought for the native Brittonic peoples against the invading Anglo-Saxons who went on to become the English. Believed to have lived in northern Wales (Gwynedd) or possibly Cornwall, King Arthur is one of the very last great Celtic monarchs. King Arthur and his knights (and ladies) are therefore an excellent inspiration for developing your own early medieval Celtic style.

, Men, try to acquire a pair of plaid or tartan trousers (pants), particularly black watch or green in color. Women, do not wear trousers. Iron Age Celts, Medieval Celts, and most modern Celts up to very, very recently wore skirts and dresses, and a woman who wears trousers fails to live up to this tradition. Long skirts, green or brown in color are particularly advisable, though shorter skirts may work for an Irish river dancer look. As for tops, dress modestly with a traditional look. Wool clothing is particularly advised. A green, brown or black waistcoat (vest) buttoned up over a collared shirt is another excellent idea.

, For example, flannel shirts (practically synonymous with 19th and 20th century lumberjacks in America today) originated from Wales, and cardigans are named after the Welsh town of Cardigan. In Scotland, collared shirts are traditionally loose, free and white, and wool hats called tam o' shantys are part of the traditional highland dress.

, Medieval-looking boots are best for those trying to achieve a very authentic look, while for others merely trying to have fun a pair of green chuck taylors would work just as well. For women, riverdancing shoes or ballet flats, especially green, red, black or brown ones would be great.

, There are dozens of Celtic symbols out there, such as the Celtic knot or cross, Ogham writing, the trisilekon, shamrocks, dragons, the triquetra, trees, ravens or words from any of the Celtic languages written in beautiful, medieval-style lettering. Any of these may be drawn, painted or tattooed onto the skin.


Many of the ancient Celts of Britannia were known for dyeing their skin blue with an early natural dye known as woad, which contained small amounts of indigo, and thus blue is a recommended color for these symbols, followed by red and green.
Women, wear little or no makeup unless you are trying to mix the Celtic look with a more goth look, as Celtic women tended not to use cosmetics like their southern neighbors did.
If you want to dye your hair, natural-looking red (ginger) hair color is a good idea, as it occurs more frequently among Celtic peoples than any other peoples on Earth, and is particularly well-known to be a common Irish and Scottish trait.

, Loving the culture and having fun is the most important thing of all.

Think modest and conservative when picking out your outfit.,
Do not wear anything that rises above the knee.,
Refrain from wearing anything transparent.Wearing darker, non-lace tops can prevent you from wearing something that’s see through.

,
Wear black pants if you don’t like dresses.,
Wear heels or flats when attending service.,
Be aware of specific traditions in certain faiths.",How to Dress For Church Services1," While church is a social gathering, it’s not a party or a night out with your friends. Families of all different ages attend church and many churches are still conservative, so make sure to dress appropriately. You should eliminate backless or low-cut dresses, spaghetti straps, tank tops, or anything that shows your midriff.Just because it has to be modest, does not mean it can’t be fashionable. Just make sure to not leave a lot of your skin exposed.
Overly glitzy jewelry or expensive accessories should also be avoided.;
, When picking out a dress, consider one that’s a bit longer. Although, dresses do not have to be down to the ankle like they were expected to be in times past.


While there is not any exact measurement that’s appropriate, make sure to avoid showing too much of your body or dressing in a way that would send signals that go against your tenets of the faith.,, While it is expected in certain faiths that women wear dresses, a pair of dark pants will typically also work.You can pair your black pants with a dark top and blazer to stay stylish but conservative.
Avoid wearing stretch pants/leggings or jeans.

, Sneakers are not appropriate shoes for Sunday morning services. Pick out your best pair of heels when going to church, just make sure the heel is lower than 3 inches (not high stilettos-type). Pumps compliment pencil skirts or pants.If heels aren’t your thing, flats are also appropriate.


Coordinate your shoe color with your outfit, but avoid loud colors like a deep red or bright pinks and greens. The focus should not be on you, but on the Lord.

, Some denominations or sects have specific traditions and customs that women must follow when attending service. For instance, in the Apostolic Church, women are required to wear hats while they are in church.While it may not get you kicked out of the church, violating these customs can be disrespectful to the people who practice that faith.
Research the denomination online or on your church’s website if you are unsure on what the appropriate attire is.

,, Knee-high boots, low-ankle boots, mid-calf boots, all in different colors such as brown, black, white, gray and pale, pastel shades of others. They can be suede fabric (like Uggs), riding or combat boot styles. Have fun with them!

, You can have waves, french braids, micro-braids or twists and fishtail braids. If you can't tell, braids are really in during the autumn season.

, Try tones like burgundy, burnt orange, beige, chocolate brown and black.

For a dressed up event, any woman will tell you that their 'little black dress' is a staple. To wear the dress for other occasions, interchange dressy pumps for simple black flats. For men, it's important to own a classic black suit and quality dress shoes.
Some classic tops include a knit sweater or cardigan in a light color, a white shirt with a scooped neckline, and a white long-sleeve button down shirt.Classic bottoms include black slacks or pants, along with dark-wash denim.;
, Quality material and well thought-out design will go much further in a simple wardrobe than discount or cheaply made clothing. You will be able to create multiple outfits from fewer items when the clothing fits you well and lasts a long time.


Be sure to take your time finding and purchasing the classic clothes you decide to invest in.
If you want to dress up your look, a statement necklace, earrings, or other piece of jewelry will go a long way.

, Jeans are a staple you can always rely on for a simple look. Choose jeans that are are a solid, neutral color, and don't have a large amount of detail, rips, or other decorations and seam-work on them.They'll go with everything.


Dark wash jeans are the best option since they compliment just about any top and look slimming.
For the same reasons, black denim, yoga, or cotton pants are also a great staple for your wardrobe.Dark pants go well with a wide variety of other colors, and can be dressed up or down, so the options for tops and shoes are endless.

, To keep the simple look, choose a white or gray top. Avoid bold patterned shirts and bright colors.


If you have a lighter pair of jeans or pants, a black top can also look nice.
Choose tops in any type of material, from cotton jersey to silk or satin.

, If you need to dress up an outfit you'll want classic solid color dress shoes for men, or black pumps or flats for ladies. Depending on the weather, you may want to wear classic sneakers (such as solid color tennis shoes), flats, or sandals. Wear shoes that feel comfortable, aren't flashy or trendy (less is more), and match the rest of your outfit.


Be smart about your style. For instance, if you live in an area that gets a lot of rain you will likely need to pair your outfit with rain boots.
For simplicity's sake, you may plan to have one pair of simple walking shoes for each season: sandals for summer, flats for fall, ankle boots for winter, and so on.

, Because your outfit is pleasantly simple, it allows for something else like tattoos, big hair, or a statement necklace to really take the stage. If you have something uniquely you, play that up as your main attraction.


Wear clothes that leave tattoos exposed to show them off.
You can focus on an item, such as a bright colored scarf, by wearing it with a contrasting white top.

, To start fresh and with a clean slate you'll want to rinse your face with cold water. If you have dry skin, apply a moisturizer. For some, this is the only step you'll need if you choose not to apply makeup.


A great oil facial oil that suites almost any skin-type is jojoba oil, because it neutralizes and accommodates to oily or dry skin.Coconut oil as a face moisturizer works well used the night before you're going for a simple look. It is oily to leave on during the day but soaks into your skin overnight., Toner will cleanse your pores more deeply than just washing your face with water.It will also make pores shrink, which will give your skin a smoother look. Put a few drops on a cotton ball and dab it all over your face, being careful around your eyes.


Toner is a good option for men, too. It smells fresh and can help you avoid pimples or bumps from shaving. Just be sure not to use toner directly after you shave, as it may contain alcohol and burn.

, Shape your brows to look cleaned up and attractive, even if you do nothing else. You can also use an eyebrow pencil to help fill in sparse areas and give definition. To figure out how to shape your brows,


Look in the mirror and visualize a line from the corner of your nose straight up until it reaches your eyebrow; that should be the place where your brow begins.
Identify the peak of your arch by drawing an imaginary angled line from the corner of your nose through your pupil.
Identify the spot where your brow should stop by making another line from the corner of your nose angled to the outer corner of your eye.Pluck the hairs that fall outside the areas you identified.

, To further smooth out your skin tone while keeping things simple, you might want to use foundation and concealer. It's a good way to cover blemishes without going over the top.


Use your fingers or a makeup brush to apply foundation evenly on your face.It is helpful to dab dots around your face and then blend it in so there aren't uneven areas.
Use concealer to cover dark spots, acne, and especially under your eyes to hide dark circles.
You can brush powder over your face after using concealer to further give the appearance of smooth skin and 'set' your makeup.If you want to take it one step further, apply a light blush. Smile and use a brush to sweep blush onto the raised area of your cheeks. The strokes should go from the center and out.

, Look for pallets that have browns, pinks or a bronze hue depending on what may match your skin tone. Use a makeup brush to blend a light shadow from your eyebrows down to your eye lid crease.


For more definition, use black eyeliner on upper and/or lower lids. Crimp your lashes and apply mascara.
For a basic winged look, apply a line of eyeliner to the top of your eye with a light and short curve up at the outer corners of your eyes.Another simple option for eyeliner is a line following the bottom inner corner of your eye to the outer corner. Again, this should not be thick or stand out, but just enough to add attention to your eyes.
Use pencil eyeliners rather than liquid eyeliners for a more natural and blended look.

, For both men and women, part your hair in a different way to give yourself an easy, new style. There is the middle part, a side part, and even the zig-zag part to try, where sections of hair slightly cross over each other toward the front of the head.


If you have a square face, the side part is most attractive, while the center part is better left for those with round faces., If you want to give the look of more volume, gather sections of your hair and use a comb to lightly brush about an inch away from your scalp back toward your roots. This can be helpful if you want a messy bun or ponytail look without your hair hugging tight to your head.


Men, this will work for you as well. If you have long enough hair you can try teasing sections to give yourself texture. Avoid doing this all over, especially not close to the face on the sides of the head and over the ears. Instead, try limiting it to the section above your temples and further back.

, Men can pull off looking classic by cutting the hair on the sides of their head and keeping the top section longer. This is called a fade haircut. You can use gel and brush the section back, or finger comb gel in if you choose to style it in the morning.Overall this hairstyle is easy to maintain and there are many variations in length and tapering which you and/or your barber can try out.

, It doesn't actually get much simpler than this unless you get a buzzcut. There is little maintenance here and it keeps your hair from taking over your style. Good grooming and clean cut lines will take this look to the next level.

, If your hair is long enough, one of the most basic and simple hair styles is a ponytail. Tie your hair up around the higher 3rd of the back of your head. If you have a bob that fits into a smaller ponytail, that works as well.

, Another simple hairstyle is the bun. Twist your ponytail around and secure a knot with another hair tie, or use bobby pins if your hair slips out.


For a stylish hairdo, men can pull their hair back into a man-bun and add an under-shave cut to take it a step further.
Pull a couple pieces of hair loose from above your temples for a more relaxed look.

, Gather hair from above your ears back toward the mid-top area of your scalp and secure with a hair tie or clip. You can also gather smaller sections away from your face and secure back. Use a head band to create another style that keeps hair out of your face without pulling it all back.

, A simple, single braid down the back can be a great way to pull off a simple yet attractive design. A french braid is even more attractive and can be made into two for a whole different look. You could also form two small braids from sections off the sides of your temples and tie them back for a nice style.


Fishtail braids are also beautiful and easy to learn by watching a YouTube video or two, or asking a friend who knows how.

Pick a theme.,
Alter your shape.,
Say hello to the girls.,
Curves ahead.,
Contour your face.,
Do your hair up.,
Dress the part.,
Pay attention to the smaller details.,
Get the attitude.",How to Crossdress1," Women come in all shapes and sizes, so successfully pulling off a male-to-female gender transformation will depend on your body type and your target body type.


Pick a role model to emulate, somebody who has the same general body type as you—tall, short, thick, or thin. If you start from the same basic place as your role model, you'll do well. By using a role model, you will also have a pattern for walking, moving, dressing, and speaking.
;
, Our first impression of somebody's gender is based largely on their shape, to the point where it's almost instinctive. Guys generally have smaller hips and butts than women. Not only that, there's not much going on up front, either. So the first thing to do is fix those bits.

, Nothing says ""female"" more than having lady lumps. Entire industries, from garments to cosmetic surgery to publishing empires, have been built on the foundation of our fascination for breasts. For convincing cross dressing, this will be help bring you where you want to be, both physically and emotionally.


One way to do this is to purchase a bra and stuff it with either tissue paper or socks. If you're not interested in showing cleavage, this will work well. If you want cleavage as well as natural-looking bounce, weight, feel, and movement, you can purchase a breast form, which is a prosthesis you wear inside the bra or attached to your body.
If you're going for a natural look, don't exaggerate the size of your breasts—make them proportional to your body size, or even a little smaller.


, You want to look the part, but naturally, guys just don't have the curves that women have. It's nature, but mother nature can be fooled!


To achieve a more feminine look, you can use waist-cinching undergarments or corsets to achieve a more hourglass figure. You can also add padded panties, or silicon butt pads to bump the badonkadonk.
Tuck and tape the boys. While there is expensive underwear that can disappear your package faster than a fly-by-night delivery service, you an also do this easily and cheaply with a pair of panty hose and some tape (medical tape, not duct tape—please, for your own sake!) Visit this wikiHow article on How to Tuck and Tape for more information.


, Your facial features say a lot about your gender, and there are measurable physical differences between the two. You will want to imply higher cheekbones and a smaller chin, and of course, you will want to shave very closely.


As women throughout the ages have discovered, the right kind of contouring makeup can create an entirely different facial look. You can create illusions that make features looks smaller or more pronounced and you can even draw focus to certain feminine or masculine traits.
Feminine face: To get those higher cheek bones, larger eyes, smaller noses, and bigger lips that are strong gender cues, use contouring powder and highlighter.
Add makeup to mask or modify your features to appear more feminine. Apply false lashes, mascara, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner and lipstick to create the ultimate feminine look.


, While you can grow out your hair to naturally get the look of the opposite sex, you can also take advantage of wigs to create that look temporarily, and try out different looks and colors to find one that suits you. Look online at celebrities to find the right hairdo for your new features.

, Get the right fit by trying on your clothes that match your figure. You don't want to buy a dress only to find out it doesn't fit with your new cleavage. Take your measurements to determine your needs:


Your chest is measured with the tape snug under your arms and above the cups of your bra.
Measure your bust across the fullest part of your bra cups. Don't pull the tape too tight—you don't want to squish things down unnaturally here.
Measure your waist at the narrowest part, between the top of the hipbone and the bottom of your rib cage.
Your hips are measured at the largest part of your butt and hips.
A rule of thumb when buying a dress is to use the largest of the measurements for your dress size.


, It's more than just how a man dresses or a woman does her make up that makes them identifiable with that gender. There are dozens of little differences, red flags that signal that you are a cross dresser. If you are looking for the obvious cross-dressing look, you can skip pass these tips. If you want to look like a woman down to the smallest details, read on!


Exposed body hair: Men and women expose body hair differently. Waxing, using panty hose or shaving can turn a man into a more realistic woman. Eyebrows are key as well, and sculpted eyebrows will go a long way towards a convincing look. It will also be one of the more noticeable features when you're not cross-dressed, which might be a concern.
Nails: This is an obvious, but a sometimes overlooked detail. Give yourself a manicure to achieve the look you want.
Accessories: Belts, necklaces and earrings aren't unisex. Keep your accessory shopping to the women's departments.


, Being a cross dresser may be all about the aesthetics to you. If so, the following tips may not mean much. But if you want to pull off the entire gender persona, its important to have the right act down.


Develop the personality. In reality, women have all sorts of behavior patterns--but certain ones are emphasized in females. Women are taught to be less aggressive, for example. They are also allowed to be more emotional than male counterparts.
For example, a woman would be more likely at a restaurant to say, ""I would like a salad, please,"" instead of ""I want the salad.""
Women tend to show more emotion. Men are generally taught to avoid a lot of visible emotion, while a woman tends to be allowed to.
Alter your voice. For starters, you can bring the pitch of your voice up higher to convey a feminine voice. It's also important to also adopt the vocabulary associated with the fairer sex. Note that speaking in a falsetto voice will not be convincing for long. Learn to speak in a softer, more sing-song way, varying your pitch and volume more than you do when speaking as a man.
Walk the walk. Men and women often walk differently, and a lot of it is taught by culture. Your movement is ingrained, and you've learned to ""walk like a man"" since you were a boy. Women have to learn to walk in a feminine way, which emphasizes grace rather than power. As a man, you have to switch gears.
Practice walking in heels. Nothing looks less feminine than tottering on high heels. Even if you do not go out in public in heels high heels teach balance, smaller stride, walking softly, and a feminine gait. Practice going up and down stairs especially. Being fully proficient with heels means being able to not only walk, but dance in this type of footwear.
Women often walk faster and use their arms more, so try picking up the pace, and engaging your arms. Arms are soft, not hard and stiff.
As the song says, ""hips don't lie,"" so sway your hips subtly, but don't do it to the point of exaggeration.
Be careful to walk with gentleness. Men are allowed to clomp down the hall and pound down stairs in a way that women are not. Women are taught to walk more carefully with a grace. Walk up and down stairs with a skirt, and keep in mind a woman cannot bring her knees up very high.
As with all things in cross-dressing, over- exaggeration will not make you look more feminine, it will just make you look more like a guy wearing a dress.

Learn to be comfortable dressing boldly.,
Find your style.,
Take into consideration what you already have.,
Go through your wardrobe.,
Pair things up.,
Take color into consideration.,
Take patterns into consideration.,
Try out different fabric types.,
Avoid conflicting pieces.,
Use accessories to bring it all together.,
Rock your look!",How to Dress Boldly,"  In order to dress boldly, you have to be okay with the attention that a bold style garners.  People stare at those who look different and bold clothing is a way that people look different.  Once you are okay with the idea of people staring at you then you can begin your journey of dressing boldly. It takes time to feel confident in how you look to the point of where you feel fine of people stare at you. Don't rush it; take it slow. You'll get there!
, When dressing boldly, you will want to have an idea of what your unique style is. Everyone has their own unique style. Whether it is a preference for dresses or pants, blue or green, or sneakers versus sandals, everyone has an idea of what they like to wear, and figuring that out is a good way to start dressing boldly!

Remember that dressing boldly doesn't necessarily mean dressing crazily or wearing things you'd never want to wear. It means having confidence and being courageous when picking outfits and when wearing different looks.

, A lot of the time, people think you have to either go out and buy a whole new wardrobe or make new things in order to dress boldly. This however, is not the case. You can dress boldly using what you already have at home. Mixing different patterns and colors together is an easy way to dress boldly. For example, if you happen to own a bright purple shirt, instead of matching it with a basic pair of dark colored jeans, try opting instead for that pair of bright green pants that you threw in the back of your closet for a more bold, out of the ordinary look., Pick a day that you have some time and go through your closet. Try on all your clothes so you know what fits and what doesn't. Pick out the pieces that don't fit and separate those into a pile that you will get rid of. For the clothing that does fit, separate those into piles based on the type of clothing. Have a pants pile, a dress pile, a dress shirt pile, a T-shirt pile, etc. Separating these pieces will make it easier for you to know everything that you own already, so pairing things up will be easier later on., An important step in dressing boldly and getting away with it is to pair things up that are bold but still work together. Anyone can mix random colors and patterns and create an outfit, but doing it well to the point where it looks good is a whole other story. When putting together an outfit, take into consideration what colors, patterns, and fabrics work well together., Colors such as blue and orange, green and red, and purple and yellow, are just a few color combinations that work well together.

A color wheel can also be helpful in determining good color combos. You can find one online easily and check out colors using that. Check out primary and secondary colors and the differences in different color shades.

, Patterns are a great way to stand out, but only if they're paired together correctly! For example, plaid and stripes usually don't look great together. Plaid and polka dots usually go together very well! There are tons of different patterns in the world so don't be afraid to experiment. Cool patterns include plaid, stripes, polka-dots, and houndstooth., Leather is super fun to work with and can come in many cool colors. Silks, cloth materials, cotton, cashmere, wool, pleather, and angora are a few great textures that help dress up a look!, Usually different colors put together don't clash very much so you can get away with wearing them. However, as mentioned above, some patterns do not go well together. An easy step in preventing clashing is to limit outfits to no more than 2-3 patterns at a time. Too many patterns can cause things to get a little crazy-looking, so limiting them will give you less to worry about and will keep things more toned down and natural looking.

Be sure to consider the colors of your patterns carefully as well. Use your color knowledge match patterns with colors that work well. That helps to prevent clashing and will make the outfit look more put together.

, Things such as belts (either neutral colored or in bright, fun patterns and colors), jewelry, cool socks in unusual patterns, out-of-the-ordinary sunglasses, and even ties in different patterns, colors, or styles can help make an outfit look really bold and put together. Pick what accessories you like and make it your own!, The most important step in dressing boldly is rocking your look. When you walk confidently and feel comfortable in what you are wearing, you'll look bolder to others. Stand up tall, be proud, and smile! You look great!"

Choose your best clothes and make sure they are clean.,
Wear a button-down shirt that has been pressed.,
Wear wrinkle-free slacks.,
Wear leather loafers, oxfords, or slip on dress shoes.,
Be aware of specific traditions and customs in certain faiths.",How to Dress For Church Services2," While standards on clothing for church have become more lax over time, it is still usually expected that you dress in your nicest garments when attending Sunday morning worship service.Having nice clothes does not mean you have to spend a lot of money on them. Just make sure that they are clean and presentable.
Avoid drawing attention to yourself or wearing things that would stand out., While many men prefer to wear a suit and tie, if you don’t have one, a button-down shirt will suffice. Make sure it is free of stains or wrinkles and remember to tuck it into your pants.

, Black dress pants are the best option for a person attending a church service. If you don’t have a pair, you can wear clean and wrinkle free casual slacks or khakis as an alternative.Avoid shorts. Even if it’s hot, you should refrain from wearing shorts. Jeans are too casual for Sunday morning service. And you do wear jeans, do not wear ones with patches or holes.Avoid things that have a drawstring or too many zippers or clips.
Remember to wear a black or brown belt with your pants, at least when not wearing a sport coat or blazer.

, Wear your best pair of dress shoes when attending service to show respect to the God and his church.Avoid sneakers or sandals in church. Black or brown colored shoes are preferred. But, again, if you can't afford dress shoes, wear the best that you have.


Avoid wearing white socks because they don’t match with many outfits and can be tacky., In times past, in Western culture, wearing a hat indoors was a sign of disrespect, but even today it applies to church services.In 1 Corinthians 11:7 the apostle Paul says, “man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God.”Members of the military are allowed to wear hats as part of their uniform in some religions like Christianity.

Go to your church’s website to see if they have a dress code.,
Stay conservative your first time, but examine how others dress.,
Talk to others in your congregation about appropriate dress.,
Call the church and ask them about appropriate dress code.",How to Dress For Church Services3," Many contemporary churches now have websites that will display the dress code for church goers to read.Before you attend service, make sure to research the church online and see if you have clothes that meet the dress-code.


Many churches will have photos of service on their site. If people in the photos are dressed casually, there’s a good chance that the church has a loose dress code.

, There are many contemporary churches that encourage their congregation to “come as you are” or “dress how you choose.” Dress up the first time you attend a new church and determine how you should dress based on the majority of people around you.


In some contemporary churches, dressing casually is completely acceptable, although some may still frown upon it.Dressing casually the first time you go to a new church could mean that you stand out and look silly among the rest of the dressed-up church goers.

, If you attend church with your family, you can try to get their opinion on the dress code for your specific church. If not, then you can ask other people, after service is over, to get a better feeling for how your specific church expects its members to dress.


Try to meet new people by opening up conversation. Try to work the questions about dress code into the conversation.
If you have friends who go to the same church, you can ask them via text or give them a call on the phone.

, The best source of information about about dress codes is someone that works in the church. Your clergy leader will be able to tell you what they think appropriate dress is.


Many churches will list their phone number on their website.If you have the opportunity, try to speak to your faith leader before or after service.

Find a role model.,
Square it up.,
Tuck in the twins.,
Flatten out the curves.,
Contour your facial features.,
Get a haircut.,
Dress the part.,
Pay attention to the smaller details.,
Be the man.,
Put it all together.",How to Crossdress2," Find a male archetype or two to get your cues from. Using archetypes will help you with style cues, movement, attitude, and that all-important swagger.


Choose guys with features that are roughly similar to yours, or you'll have a hard time making the switch convincing.


, Whether big or small, tiny or tall, we all have a ""look"" that cues others to our gender. For guys, it's generally blocky and rectangular, so that's what you'll need to shoot for for the most masculine look.

, Everybody loves breasts, as a single night of TV viewing will quickly evidence. Unfortunately, as prized as breasts are in our culture, they're a sure giveaway if you're trying to look like a man (unless you're going for the whole man-boob look which isn't recommended). If you want to be convincing, the girls have got to go under cover.


Usually this can be achieved by wearing form-reducing underclothes that can smooth out the look. A sports bra that is two sizes too small for you, or a control top made from a cut up pair of panty hose; can give you a flatter and smoother look. NOTE: binding too tight or for too long can cause serious health problems and/or trouble breathing.


, Guys tend to have broader shoulders, and more of a straight line between the rib cage and hips—with narrower hips in general. The goal here is to add padding to both the shoulders and waist, and to visually de-emphasize the hips.


Wear looser clothing to help de-emphasize curves, in general.
Going to the gym can create a more masculine figure by targeting specific muscle groups. Build your chest, arms and legs to create more ""bulk"" on the body.
Padding at the waist can be done to look realistic by adding bulk with extra fabric. There are prosthetic devices available as well. It doesn't take much, just enough to reduce the appearance of wider hips.


, Women's faces tend to be smaller and rounder, with less-prominent chins and noses. You can use makeup to help mask a feminine face, but it will be more about attitude than look, if you want to be convincing.


Men have smaller lips, larger noses, bigger eyebrows, lower cheek bones and a more pronounced jaw line. Use contouring powder to create heavier looking features. Don't use any additional make up to add color to the face. Adding ""facial hair"" can make a large difference in your look, but be cautious—it won't stand up to close scrutiny. Consider adding a high-quality mustache or goatee for a more convincing look. Even men with naturally sparse facial hair can often grow those. Just don't make it look like an overgrown bush, or it will look fake.

Build the perfect package. If you think about a roll of quarters, you'll have the average size about right—though you will want to adjust the proportions depending on your own physical attributes. However, while a roll of quarters might give you the right dimensions, but you will look like you're permanently ready for action. Consider stuffing with a sock, or even considering a prosthetic penis. If you use a wool sock, you may inadvertently set yourself up for a typical guy cue: scratching the itch.


, Short hair on women is generally OK in 21st century culture, especially in locations where cross-dressing is acceptable, so there shouldn't be a big issue with trimming your locks.


Consider keeping enough length so that you can give your hair a soft look when you're out of character, and then slick it up and back when you're in character.

If for whatever reason you want to keep your hair, use a short haired wig.

, Men's jeans are a sure way to de-emphasize your female shape. By keeping it looser in the butt, you'll also minimize recognition from behind. In general, a looser fit in your clothes will work to your advantage. However, if you want to look more sophisticated and tailored, make sure the clothes are cut to fit a man's shape—then back-fill with padding and minimizing to achieve the right look.

, While first impressions go a long way to establishing your identity, a lasting impression will work only if you fine-tune the details.


Exposed body hair. Let your leg and underarm hair grow naturally. With the exception of Olympic swimmers and competitive cyclists, guys don't shave there.
Trim your nails. This is an obvious, but a sometimes-overlooked detail. Give yourself a manicure to achieve the look you want. Keeping your fingernails trimmed down so that a sliver of white shows will help. Don't trim into the quick or you'll look like a nervous wreck.
Accessories: While lots of guys wear necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, most guys don't. Since the goal is to avoid being taken for a woman, avoid such trappings. If you do decide to go with jewelry, shop in the men's department.

, If you want to pull off the entire gender persona, its important to have the right ""act"" down.


Develop the personality. Think of what kind of man you want to be. Based on that, you may want to alter some of your basic personality traits. Try being more aggressive, and being direct when you want something instead of being nice. For example, to quench your thirst when dining out, say ""Excuse me, we'd like some water here, please."" instead of ""Hi! Yes, may I please have a glass of water? Thank you so much!"" For a man, it's not a question, even when framed as a question.
Alter the voice. Bring down your voice to become more like a man. Also speak more like a man speaks—louder, more flat-toned, and more clipped. Guys also tend to slur their words, saying ""I gotta have that car,"" where a woman would more likely say ""I must have those shoes!"" It's also important to adopt the vocabulary associated with the opposite sex. Nothing is ever ""fabulous,"" ""adorable,"" or ""precious."" It also helps if you have a prominent Adam's apple.

Talking the talk? Now walk the walk. Slow it down. Men swing their arms less and walk slower, and keep their hips from swaying. Take longer strides, and exude confidence. Have a 'I know where I'm going' rather than a 'time to check the map again' attitude in the little things you do.


, Talk the talk, walk the walk, dress the part, play the role, and be the man!

Build an outfit using one piece as inspiration.,
Have a several outfits on standby.,
Choose a color scheme.,
Plan your outfit the night before.,
Dress for your body type.,
Get a second opinion.",How to Decide What to Wear1," If you have a new piece of clothing you’ve been dying to wear, consider anchoring your outfit around that one piece. If it’s a nice shirt, find pants and shoes that complement that shirt. If your inspiration piece is a new dress, add a statement necklace to take the dress to the next level.You can also use shoes or an accessory as your base piece. If you have a cool new hat, you might want to choose a more subdued outfit so your hat can take center stage.
Try the entire outfit on in front of a full-length mirror (including the shoes). Shoes can make or break an outfit, so it’s important to see what the outfit looks like with all the pieces.;
, If you’re running late, you may not have the time to put together an entirely new outfit. Think back on outfits you’ve worn in the past and gotten compliments on. Save these outfits and wear them when you find yourself in a hurry or style rut.Take pictures of your standby outfits and save them on your phone. This will help you remember what you wore the last time you wore the outfit.
To change the outfit up slightly, substitute new shoes and accessories.

, A color scheme should consist of two main colors, with the option to add in additional colors as accents. If you’re dressing yourself in the fall, combine mustard yellow and gray. If you’re planning an outfit in spring, try pairing two different pastel shades.Your color scheme should serve as a jumping off point. Don’t feel like you have to restrict your entire outfit to only two colors.
Instead of choosing a color scheme, choose a printed piece of clothing and track down clothing pieces that pair well with that print.

, If you constantly find yourself struggling to pick out an outfit in the morning, consider selecting your outfit the night before. You’ll have more time, so you won’t feel as stressed, plus, picking out a fun outfit to wear will give you something to look forward to in the morning.Try your outfit on in front of a mirror to make sure you like it and all the pieces work together.
Make sure to check the weather before planning your outfit; there’s nothing worse than picking out the right outfit for the wrong weather.

, Everyone is shaped differently and sometimes, if you don’t like your outfit, it might be because of the way it fits. On days where you feel uncomfortable in your own skin, reach for pieces that you know show your body off to its fullest potential.If you have an hourglass figure, select a dress with a belt to show off your small waist.
If you carry weight around your middle, try a high-waisted skirt to draw the eye to the smallest part of your torso.
If you carry weight around your hips, wear boot cut jeans to make your lower half look more proportional.
Make sure your figure enhancing pieces are comfortable. You’re not going to reach for them if they’re too tight or restricting.

, When all else fails, ask someone to weigh in on your outfit choice. Take pictures of one or two outfits you’re considering and send them to someone you trust, like your best friend or mother.


If you can’t reach anyone and you need to make a decision quickly, you can also utilize apps like StyleIt to help plan your outfit.Invest in a full-length, tri-fold mirror. A mirror like this will allow you to see your outfit from all angles and will aid in the decision making process.

Be yourself.",How to Create Your Own Dress Style," Go through what you already own and decide what you like. Pieces that you keep should have a fit that's flattering to your body, as well as an overall look that blends with your shape. Throw out or donate anything that fits poorly or that you're hesitant to wear out of the house. A good rule of the thumb is that if you haven't worn it for 6 months (barring seasonal items such as sweaters for winter or swimsuits for summer), get rid of it.;
, On the clothes that you do keep, evaluate what exactly it is that makes you like to wear them - such as the cut, the sleeves, the embellishments, or the color. Write down a list of these elements and take it shopping with you later.

, One way to foster and develop your own style is to find out what looks good on other people. Leaf through magazines or watch TV for trends that catch your eye. If people often compliment you on looking like a certain celebrity, search their name online and see what they wear to compliment their coloring and size. Alternatively, visit crowded places such as malls or downtown sidewalks. Observe what people are wearing, and take note of fashions you like.


Consider incorporating elements of subculture fashion into your wardrobe. Some subcultures promote unique fashions that reflect a certain lifestyle. You don't have to go all-out and adopt an extravagant, outlandish look based on a specific subculture, but you can look to them for inspiration. For instance, perhaps you like the bell-shaped skirts that gothic lolitas wear, or the flight jackets favored by skinheads. When you see something you like, small ways to bring some element of it into your wardrobe.

, If you're having a hard time finding inspiration, or you worry about having bad taste, ask for an outside opinion. Contact a close friend or family member whose sense of style you admire, and ask him or her what might look good on you. Or, visit a department store or boutique that carries fashions you like and ask a salesperson to help you assemble a stylish look that's right for you.


Don't be afraid! It can be difficult to ask for help. Remember that most of your friends and family members will want you to feel as good as you can in your clothing. Also, most people who work at clothing stores love to help people find the right look and will be eager to help you.

, A new pair of shoes can add a different flair to your look. Look for something you can wear often and that fits with the general look you're trying to achieve.

, When you've decided what you like, start shopping. You don't have to replenish your wardrobe all in one go - instead, consider shopping at small intervals, such as every few weeks, until you've assembled a closet you like. Visit thrift or consignment stores, malls, outlets, boutiques or department stores, or shop online.


Shop with a friend who is not afraid to offer gentle (but constructive) criticism with you while you shop. This way you, will get an honest opinion of your style.
Shop off-season. Ease some of the strain on your budget by shopping off-season. For instance, buy shorts and swimsuits in the fall, or sweaters in the spring.

, Clothing sizes are designed to fit the masses, and therefore might not fit you as well as you'd like. If you find a piece you love but the fit is lacking, take it to a tailor or seamstress for alterations. Most everyday-wear fabrics can be altered fairly cheaply, and the price will be worth the confidence boost that comes with wearing clothes that fit well.

, Punch up your regular look by adding a few interesting accessories. This can be as simple as buying clean laces for your shoes, or wearing a muted belt. If you really want to alter your look, try adding jewelry, scarves, hats or hair pieces.


Embellish what you already own. With a little sewing skill, you can add ribbons, beads, embroidery, clasps, appliqué or other notions to your clothes. Visit your local craft store for ideas and supplies.

, Try pairing different pieces for a compelling, unique look. For instance, even if you didn't think your new tank would look good with your capris, try it out. Maybe all you need to pull the whole outfit together is that belt you haven't worn since last summer.

, True, your hairstyle isn't part of your clothing, but it can drastically alter how your clothing looks. Try styling your hair a different way in the morning, or see if a new shampoo or product helps it look better. If you're going to try a radically different cut or color, consult a stylist as to what might look best on you. Find images in magazines or online for inspiration, and take them to your appointment.

, The most important thing about your new look should be that it makes you feel great. Creating a personal style is really just wearing what you want. Think more positively and be more constructive and expressive with your ideas and abilities.

Organize your wardrobe.,
Know your body type.,
Take a good look in the mirror.",How to Dress Fashionably1," Get out all your clothes and decide which ones you want and don't want. Donate, sell, and a top tip you could host your own boot sale, with anything that you haven't worn in a year, doesn't fit or isn't your style.


If you haven't worn it in a year, you won't miss it. Thinking, ""I could need this one day!"" will leave you thinking you have nothing to wear for most. Clean it out. Someone else could second-love your things.
If you have loads of items that don't fit anymore, don't keep them all to be hopeful. Keep a few of your favorites, but pitch the rest. A closet full of clothes that don't fit can be very de-motivating.;
, And dress for it. The most fashionable items in the world right now won't look good on you if you don't have the right body type for it. It does not mean you're too fat, too thin, too tall, or too short. You just don't have the optimal shape for that cut.

Dispose of everything that doesn't fit you right. And you'll know. If your silhouette isn't quite what it could be, odds are you don't wear it.
When you go shopping, keep your body type in mind. For most women, it's ideal to draw in at the waist and elongate the leg. If you get stuck, you can always ask a sales professional; it's their job to help you look good.

, Try to look at yourself as objectively as possible. Pick things about your physical appearance that you like and dislike. What do you want to disguise? What do you want to emphasize? What's your coloring?


It's important to figure out the answers to these questions before you go shopping so you know what to buy! If you haven't a clue, shopping for a new wardrobe can be very intimidating.

Select an outfit for a wedding.,
Select an outfit for a job interview.,
Select an outfit for school.,
Select an outfit for work.",How to Decide What to Wear2," Dressing for a wedding is tricky because it varies depending on time of year and wedding location. The one constant rule for weddings is don’t wear white. Other than that, take your fashion cues from the invitation.If the wedding explicitly states black tie, plan to wear a tux or evening gown.
If the wedding takes place during the day or outside, wear a more casual dress or suit. Men may be able to get away with slacks and a button down shirt.
If the ceremony takes place in a house of worship, bring a sweater to cover any exposed shoulders.

, Once upon a time, the only appropriate clothing to wear to a job interview was a suit. Now, times have changed, and depending on where you’re interviewing, a suit may be a little too much.If you’re interviewing for a job in finance, business or law, men and women alike should expect to wear a suit.
If you’re interviewing for a startup company or for a more creative field, try wearing a dress and cardigan or a pencil skirt with a cropped jacket. Men should wear slacks and a nice button down shirt.

, Since you’ll be in class all day, you’ll want to pick an outfit that is comfortable, while still expressing your sense of style and personality. Make sure to pick an outfit that fits within your school dress code, otherwise you may be asked to go home and change.For girls who like to be comfortable, wear a pair of jeans with a graphic tee and add a zip up hoodie for warmth. Give your outfit an added boost with a pair of patterned sneakers.
For girls who like to dress up, wear a skirt and blouse, with patterned leggings tucked into boots.
Most guys prefer some variation on jeans, t-shirts and sweatshirts. On days where you’d like to look nicer, swap out the hoodie for a pullover sweater.

, Your work outfit will be dictated by your company culture and it may take a few weeks of working in an office to figure out the rules. And while some offices allow you to wear jeans to work, you can never go wrong with business casual.Look at what the most powerful person in your office wears and take your cues from them.
Very few workplaces are cool with employees wearing shorts or flip flops. Avoid both of these clothing items at all costs.
Lots of corporate offices tend to run cold, so wear light layers to keep yourself warm.

Dress for humidity.,
Dress for the freezing cold.,
Dress for fluctuating temperatures.",How to Decide What to Wear3," Humidity causes you to sweat more than you would normally, and it’s important to consider this if you want your clothing to remain sweat free. When dressing for humidity, choose outfits that fall away from your body and touch your skin as little as possible.Avoid synthetic fabrics at all costs.
Swap out jeans and t-shirts in favor of long, flowy dresses.

, It’s very hard to look fashionable when you’re also trying not to freeze to death, but it can be done. Pick warm fabrics like wool, fleece, cashmere, down and flannel and avoid cotton.Dress in heavy layers and don’t skimp on the outerwear. You can always take it off inside.
Do not leave any exposed skin. Exposed skin leaves you vulnerable to frostbite. If you’re concerned about wearing the wrong shoes, bring a cuter pair of shoes to change into once you’re inside.

, Some areas of the world experience extreme temperature fluctuations – even within the course of just one day. Dress for the unexpected by wearing extra layers and packing additional layers to wear when your light layers just don’t cut it.In addition to wearing a light cardigan, pack an anorak or fleece for when the sun goes down.
If a simple pair of tights is not sufficient, double up on tights, or swap out regular tights in favor of fleece lined leggings.
If you’re carrying a purse or bag, throw in an extra pair of socks, along with some mittens and a warm hat.

Know your style.,
Consider context.",How to Dress Fashionably2," What do you like? Do you want to incorporate trendy items into your wardrobe, or do you prefer a classic look? Do you have hipster tendencies? Want to be a professional? Being fashionable does not mean adhering to a specific look. It means finding what you're comfortable in and running with it.


Spend time flipping through catalogs or surfing websites that feature and sell clothes. There are tons of different pieces that will look phenomenal on you--it's just a matter of finding them.
Find out what other people are wearing. You don't a have to necessarily be a fashion clone to be pretty. Maybe you could see what 'she's' wearing and transform it into your style.
Ultimately, clothes that you love and feel good in will be worn more confidently by you. It has less to do with today's fashion and more to do with how you present yourself, though both are intertwined.

, Where you live, where you go and what you do are major factors in dressing fashionably. If you wear a ballgown to the office, that is not fashionable; if you wear a business suit to the prom, likewise. Think about what kind of clothing is appropriate for the things you're going to be doing.


Fashion varies area to area. What's popular on a runway in Milan may not have made it to the streets of Chicago. Whatever fashion you're aiming for, tap into its sources. Finding what you love and what looks good on you is imperative, regardless of where it's from or who originated it.

Start shopping.,
Shop more.,
Ask someone else to go shopping with you.",How to Dress Fashionably3," The best thing to do is to buy long-lasting pieces that will retain their class throughout the seasons. Fashion changes extremely quickly! Don't fill your wardrobe with things that won't be appropriate the same time next year; you'll just regret buying it. Every women needs half a dozen items that are staples in her wardrobe. Find yours.


In the context of what flatters your body, find a handful of your favorite, variable pieces. A classic white button-down, a favorite pair of flatteringly-cut jeans, boots, cinched-waist skirt and a sweater, for starters. You can mix and match these items all you want for dozens of different looks.

, Now that you've got the basics, it's time to have fun! Buy some great shoes, cute accessories and get a haircut! Bright purple leather trench looks too tacky? A handbag in the same style will be fantastic.


After all, the devil's in the details. Accessories and hairstyles are the parts that show your sassy side the easiest. So cut out that celeb 'do from that magazine and head on over to the salon. Might as well get your nails done while you're at it.
Note the ol' adage, ""Put on your accessories, then take off one before leaving."" And it rings true: accessories are great--but a necklace, bracelet, earrings, rings, watch, sunglasses, and hat are a bit much. Pair a couple of accessories with each outfit; don't go overboard.

, It's always good to have an outsider's perspective, especially a friend to make the time pass by more quickly. Bring along someone who can give you well-formulated critiques regarding your clothes. The image we see in the mirror isn't always how we really look!


Take everyone's perspective with a grain of salt. Her style is her style, not yours. But if she absolutely adores something on you and you don't see it, take a moment to look. Wait a minute to see if you can find what she sees. Your mind may open up to a brand new style.

What if you don't have a look?,

Be daring and creative.",How to Create a Signature Look," Are you goth? You probably wear a lot of darker make-up and darker clothing. Are you preppy? Three words: Ralph Lauren Polo. Are you athletic? Sweats and a hoodie is the perfect outfit for you. Or are you a girly flirt? You may love skirts, smiles, and flower patterns.Maybe you are a ""smart chic"", pretty glasses, straight hair, and <3 for dresses!? Whatever you are, no matter how embarrassing you think it is, you can make it work. Read some fashion magazines. Stores like Hollister, Abercrombie, Aeropostale, American Eagle, Wet Seal, Forever 21, and H&M are really in style, although beware of looking like an advertisement. But don't think it has to be limited to those stores. Kohls, JCPenney's, Target, and even Walmart can have some cute clothing and shoes.If you are a little younger, try maybe Justice and even Sears!;
, If you're a bit heavy, don't go for two sizes too small. But if you're skinny, don't go for bigger sizes. If you're a size 5, buy a 6. Clothing can shrink. Also, different brands have different sizes. A size 3 might not fit you in some sizes. Be comfortable with your weight and size.

, Layering is very popular. Try a tank top under a shirt and then let the bottom of the tank top stick out. Target and Walmart are great for cheap tank tops.

, If all you have in your closet is a shirt and some jeans, add some stuff in. A cute belt, some funky earrings, and an awesome necklace are great to make your outfit look perfect.

, Don't wear 10 belts and three necklaces, plus 3 shirts and shorts over jeans. It's too much! Simple and stylish is what you're aiming for.

, Just because everyone at your school wears t-shirts and jeans, doesn't mean you have to.

, If you are into the goth look, get used to what you are wearing. If all else fails, change your look. You can still wear black, but go a bit easier on the make-up.

, So, you aren't preppy, but you aren't goth. You aren't into athletics, but you aren't a couch potato. That's fine! Wear what you think is cute and like it. Don't take insults personally. The people who insult you are most likely jealous that they don't (or can't!) wear what you're wearing.

, Wearing a halter top and short-shorts to school might be cute, but isn't allowed. Know what you can wear and create a look off of it. By the way, wearing a white shirt and black bra or white pants and a black thong isn't cool. It's lame.

, Who wants to have ripped, worn panties or ugly, unsupportive bras? You need to know that under all those clothing, you still look good. Have the right size panties and bra so you can be comfortable and look clean, stylish, and appropriate.

, Don't be afraid to mix two or three random colors, or wear a cute tank top with sweats that look good. If you mess up, it's only one day of clothing.

Stay neutral.,
Make a bland outfit pop with a bright shoe color.,
Tone down a bright outfit with a neutral shoe.,
When in doubt, go nude.,
Mix shades.,
Match your shoes with an understated color already found in your outfit.",How to Complement Your Outfit With the Right Shoes1," Some neutral tone outfits look appropriate when matched with neutral tone shoes. For instance, a little black dress can look stunning with the right pair of black heels. If you plan on wearing the same color from head to toe, however, you should be prepared to accessorize with jewelry that adds a bit of color or sparkle to your outfit to avoid looking too drab.;
, Sometimes, too many neutral tones can make an outfit look dull. A bright shoe is a quick way to remedy the situation. Try a bright red pump with a white blouse and black pencil skirt, or a spring green pump with brown slacks and a beige top.

, If your clothes are already loud enough to do the talking, avoid shoes that will compete for attention. The next time you slip on a royal blue sundress, match it with a pair of white sandals instead of going for more blue.

, More accurately, go with a nude colored shoe. A nude shoe is a neutral because it blends into your skin tone. Because it mimics the tone of your skin, it is also relatively easy to pair with other neutrals and colors.

, If you like the monochromatic look, you can still pull it off as long as the shades vary from one another. Try wearing a rose-colored pump the next time you wear a light pink t-shirt and jeans, or a chocolate brown boot with a light brown sweater dress.

, If you have a top, bottom, or dress with a pattern on it, pick one color from the pattern and find shoes that match. For instance, if you have a skirt with a geometric pattern that includes navy, sky blue, and teal, try wearing it with a teal flat or a navy wedge heel.

Pair with intricate fabrics.,
Choose a classic color for your velvet skirt.,
Pair velvet with classic pieces.,
Add a feminine touch with lace.,
Pair velvet and silk.,
Make a statement with your jewelry.,
Play up your ensemble with heels.,
Choose a skirt that is knee-length or longer.",How to Wear a Velvet Skirt1," When wearing a velvet skirt for a formal occasion, try to stick to intricate fabrics and patterns, rather than a solid color. This will keep your ensemble formal, but visually interesting.More masculine or androgynous pieces will pare the velvet down, so if you choose an androgynous top, use your shoes or jewelry to add elegance.
Try to match at least one color in your shirt’s pattern with the color of your skirt to tie everything in.;
, A bright, bubble-gum pink is going to be harder to style formally than, say, a rich red, or a clean navy blue. When purchasing your silk skirt, opt for classic colors, such as red, black, white, and navy.


If you want to be more daring with your ensemble, you can enlist the help of jewel tones or a warm yellow.
Try to avoid neons, as these appear to be more relaxed or laid back by default.

, To keep the richness of your velvet anchored and formal, pair it with a classic piece, such as a fitted button-down, a fitted blazer, or a camel trench. Each of these will keep your outfit classic and formal without sacrificing style or taste.Classic pieces are particularly useful for formal work attire. A simple button down will keep your outfit formal, but not too dressy for the workplace.

, If you want to have a bit more of a feminine taste to your velvet, pair your velvet skirt with a lace blouse or lace tights. Lace will play up the plushness of the velvet while keeping your outfit feminine and flattering.


Lace can be an intimidating item to wear. If you are nervous about a lace blouse or tights, opt instead for a pair of shoes with lace details, or a lace hair accessory.

, For a look as decadent as chocolate mousse, pair a velvet skirt with a simple silk blouse. Although this look is a bit more sultry in nature, it can be made more demure with a straight blazer, or emphasized with a pair of stiletto heels.Many fashion runways use this pairing in their velvet collections, so runway shows can be a great source of inspiration for how to pair velvet and silk.
Pay attention to the cut of your skirt when pairing with silk. If your skirt is loose, use a tight silk top, but if your skirt is tight (say, a pencil skirt), pair it with a flowing silk blouse.

, Emphasize your velvet with your jewelry. Using jewelry, you can lend either a formal, classic look to your skirt, or you can create a more vintage vibe.Pairing your velvet with pearls will instantly create a classic, elegant appearance.
Vintage accessories create more of a boho air to your outfit.

, Shoes make all the difference in creating an outfit, particularly when you are trying to cross the line from casual to formal. Pumps automatically lend a sense of formality to an outfit, so try to pair your velvet with at least a small heel.Stiletto heels are statement shoes and can range from sexy shoes to classic shoes.

, A velvet mini is not going to scream “formal,” while a velvet maxi skirt offers a heavy, luxurious appearance. When you are working toward creating a more classic, formal silhouette, opt for knee-length or lower skirts, as these are taken more seriously and create a hint of mystery."

Know where to draw the line between sexy and trashy.",How to Complement Your Outfit With the Right Shoes2," Stick with sandals, pumps, and thin heels the next time you wear a breezy sundress or venture out in a sleeveless blouse and capri pants. Heavy shoes, like boots and platform heels, often look clunky and out of proportion when paired with lighter fabrics and airy styles.

, Slip on a pair of boots or a thick heel with your warm winter sweaters and tweed jackets. If both the material and structure of a garment look heavy, a thick, solid shoe will compliment that garment better than a notably thin, tiny shoe would.

, Shoes come with a variety of textures, patterns, and embellishments. A quick way to add a little visual interest to a plain outfit is by finding a shoe with a little extra pizzazz to act as a focal point. A leopard print flat can add a wild twist to a plain jeans and tank top combination, and a wedge heel with a ruffled front can give an air of playfulness to a simple sundress.

, If your outfit already includes a busy pattern, like polka dots or paisley print, do not wear shoes that will compete with it. Instead, opt for a shoe in a solid color and gravitate toward styles without extra embellishments.

, A little matching looks coordinated and well put together, but too much can quickly become overkill. For example, a blue pump coordinates nicely with a blue purse, but you should resist the urge to add on a blue belt, heavy blue jewelry, and a blue hat. Similarly, you can wear rose post earrings if your shoes have a rose embellishment on them, but you may want to think twice about adding a purse, hat, and large ring with the same rose decoration.

, If your outfit already shows a considerable amount of skin, you may want to tone the shoe down and opt for something moderately sultry instead of something overtly so. You might be pushing it if you wear three-inch strappy stilettos with a strapless mini-dress, but the same mini-dress can look appropriately sexy with a half-inch peep-toe.

Boots are worn best in fall and winter, with some crossover into spring. They do not work well for summer, however.






Sandals look best during the spring and summer. You may be able to get away with wearing them during a warm early autumn, but you should put them into storage once winter weather makes an appearance.







, Tall, thin heels and strappy styles are usually considered sexy and do not work for professional settings. Closed toes, low heels, flats, and boots are better options.

, If you have a versatile outfit, like a little black dress, and you decide to wear it to a reception or other formal event, make sure your shoes can dress it up. Avoid casual shoes, like flats with cutesy embellishments, and opt for more mature shoes, like a black or silver pump.

, You must also avoid wearing an overly fancy shoe with a versatile outfit if you plan on wearing it in a casual setting. For instance, if you want to dress down a brown pencil skirt, look for a simple sandal or flat instead of a fancy stiletto.

Employ colors that match your everyday style.,
Pair your skirt with basic knits.,
Wear flats or sneakers.,
Bring leather into the mix.,
Wear dainty jewelry.",How to Wear a Velvet Skirt2," To dress your velvet down, use casual staples, such as a chambray shirt, a simple tee, or a jean jacket. Basic closet items will lend a simple edge to your skirt, and will automatically remove the formal air from the ensemble., To keep your velvet skirt casual, match its tones to tones you already have in your closet. If you use a lot of jewel tones in your closet, choose a jewel tone skirt. If you are partial to neutrals, purchase a neutral skirt.Matching your skirt to your everyday closet will make mixing and matching your clothing faster and easier.

, A simple cotton tee tucked into your velvet skirt will immediately make the richness of the velvet seem more casual. Topping it off with a pair of Converse sneakers will complete the casual effect.A fisherman’s sweater is another great way to pare down your velvet skirt in cooler weather.

, To dress velvet up, you need to pair it with stilettos or pumps. In a similar vein, to make velvet casual, you’ll need to wear sandals, sneakers, or simple flats.Converse sneakers are great for keeping a velvet skirt simple.
Streamlined ballet flats are also a great source of simplicity where velvet is concerned.

Leather will bring your velvet down from formal wear to fitting for an evening of sushi with your friends.If you do not have a leather belt or jacket, you can add leather to your outfit with a leather choker, leather bracelet, or a pair of leather sandals.

, Instead of donning your pearls or stones, wear a simple gold chain, a statement ring, or pair of basic gold hoops. All of these will keep the outfit low-key instead of fancy or overwhelming.


One of the most important parts of keeping jewelry simple is choosing a single piece to emphasize. Choose between a statement ring, a necklace, or a pair of earrings--not all three.

Keep the shoes simple.,
Add other accessories with care.",How to Wear a Tux," Whether for a wedding, prom, or formal event, the tuxedo is a classic look that exudes style. The tux in its most basic form sports simple lines similar to a normal man's suit, but with the addition of silk bands on the outside hem of each trouser leg. The lapels on the jacket are also often fashioned with silk, helping to provide a more formal look.


In the contemporary US, tuxedos are usually considered the “gold standard” for formal wear.
It might surprise you, however, that tuxes – called black tie attire for the black bowtie – are neither the most formal in men’s dress wear nor always appropriate for important occasions.;
, Historically, there is a sort of hierarchy of menswear. Tuxedos actually grew out of was, for the time, relaxed evening wear as an alternative to the tailed frock coat. “Black tie,” then, is only one kind of “formal wear,” the other being the even more formal “white tie,” a similar outfit with white bowtie, tails, and often tophat.White tie attire is usually reserved for the most fancy or formal events, like debutante balls, state dinners, and galas.
Keep in mind that black tie is also not “day wear.” According to tradition, events that occur during the evening call for either white or black tie, while daytime events call for day wear like morning dress or a man’s business suit.Morning suits are worn more often in Britain and feature a black or grey cutaway or morning coat, non-matching grey trousers—sometimes striped, buff waistcoat, tie, and often tophat.Morning suits also come in a hierarchy, from formal morning dress to less formal morning suit and even the semi-formal “stroller,” which has no tails.

, When will your upcoming event occur? In general if your event is during the daytime, you should go with day wear like a morning suit. If it is after dark, you are safe to go with black or white tie formal evening wear.


The rule governing the proper forms of dress has to do with when the event ends. So, for example, if you are attending a wedding that starts during the day but ends after sundown, you can choose evening wear., Often event invitations will give instructions on dress. Pay close attention to the wording so that you can determine whether or not you will need a tuxedo. Parsing the language can sometimes take a bit of effort.


For instance, an invitation calling for “formal wear” does not necessarily mean a tux. Formal wear refers to a complete suit – tie, cuff links, and the works – but, as noted, can also include white tie or morning wear.
A black tie event means that you will be expected to wear a tux, so get ready for fittings. Showing up in anything else would be a faux pas.
“Black tie optional” means just that – if you’d like, you can wear a tuxedo.
“Semi-formal” is a notch down from formal, and means that tuxedos are not required. Here, you’d be better to settle on a dark suit for evening events.

, When selecting a tuxedo, keep in mind that your physical build will have a big influence on what suit to choose. Getting a tux that fits you well is the most difficult and important part of looking great; an ill-fitting tux can make you look sloppy or crumpled.


For instance, a double-breasted jacket will look better on men that are slim and somewhat tall, as the design adds some substance to his appearance.
For men who are shorter or wider in the chest and stomach areas, a single-breasted tuxedo is usually a better option.
A jacket design that includes peak lapels is pretty timeless and will provide a sense of being stylish without being a slave to passing fads.

, As a rule, the tux jacket should fit much like a suit jacket: i.e. the ideal fit will be close but not pinch or restrict your movement. The back should cover your bottom to its lowest curve.The jacket shoulders should fit snugly with fairly high armholes. Shoulder padding should not extend past your shoulder tips, otherwise the jacket is likely too big.With arms at your sides, the arms of the jacket should cover your wrist bone. They should reveal no more than one half-inch of your shirt sleeves., Tuxedo trousers are fairly straightforward. They are black, made from the same material as the jacket, and have a single strip of satin down the outer leg called the “braid.” Choose trousers that are an exact color match with your jacket.Tuxedo trousers should be highwaisted so that there is not gap with whatever waist-covering you choose, either a waistcoat or cummerbund. They have no belt-loops but should either be worn with suspenders or fastened with clasps.
The trousers should also have no cuffs. Some varieties come pleated, but many men feel that plain fronts provide a more elegant look.

, You might be tempted to stand out a bit with a colored tuxedo, perhaps white, blue, or purple. Make this decision carefully before you act. The basic black tuxedo is standard for just most formal occasions and, unlike a colored suit, will not look outdated after 10, 20, or 30 years.


In general, most fashion experts warn against colored tuxedos as novelties. Think the blue and orange tuxes in “Dumb and Dumber.”Two exceptions to the color rule are midnight blue and burgundy (for the jacket only). Both are acceptable for formal events. Midnight blue is a dark navy blue that appears blacker than black in the night time. Burgundy can be a nice change of pace for those who often attend formal events and want something to switch out for the black jacket on occasion.
The white tuxedo is a difficult proposition. White tuxes began as a “warm weather” alternative to the heavier and hotter black tux. While some can pull off the look well, others, especially those with fair skin, look washed out. Still others feel that white tuxes make the wearer look like a waiter., The most important part of selecting a tux is probably getting the shoulders right. The rest can be fairly cheaply altered by a tailor so that everything “pops” as it should, depending, again, on your body type.


Many tuxes will need three basic alterations: shortened sleeves, tailored pants, and a “suppressed” waist—if it suits the wearer.Off-the-rack jackets often have sleeves that are too long. Tux pants, likewise, also normally run too long. You may need to get both shortened. Note that many fashionistas disapprove of cuffed tux pants.Waist “suppression” is a pinching off of the tux waist to accentuate the lines of your figure. Yes, men have figures – naturally “V-shaped” torsos. You don’t want the tux to give you a boxy look, so consider this alteration, if need be., Getting the right shirt seems simple, no? After all, it’s just a shirt. You will be surprised at how much variety there are in tuxedo shirts, from color to collar and cuffs and texture. Choose one that you like and that also goes well with your suit.Crisp white is an excellent choice with just about any tuxedo, matching almost any color.
Tux shirts can have different kinds of colors. A wing collars are starched, high collars with small points that stick out under your chin and that create a more formal appearance. There are also normal turn-down collars, which is a better choice if you want to direct attention away from your neck.
The “bosom” of the shirt is another site for choice. While some shirts are plain, others have vertical pleats and still others have pique, a special fabric that looks somewhat like honeycomb. Some purists argue that pique should only be worn with tails, however.The shirt also has different options for fastening: button covers or studs. Button covers are slotted disks that slid over regular shirt buttons, while studs act like buttons themselves. Both give a splash of black on the white shirt background.
Finally, there are cuffs. Should you choose regular cuffs or French cuffs? It is ultimately up to you, but many purists argue that French cuffs are traditional for evening wear., Traditionally, tuxedos are worn with a black silk, self-tie bowtie. More modern cuts now include long ties, also in black silk, which might appeal to people looking for a different, more fashion forward look.While a long tie is not against the rules of black tie, some people argue that it does not work as well. For one thing, the long tie moves the eye away from the face. It’s association with business suits might also “lower” your look to that of an informal black suit.
You can’t go wrong with the black bow tie, but keep in mind too that bowties come in a number of varieties and styles. These include butterfly bowties, semi-butterfly, straightedge, and pointed.
Clip -ons or pre-tied ties are convenient, but try to learn how to tie your own, especially if you go to formal occasions with some frequency.

, Tuxedos are always worn with a waist covering, either a more traditional waistcoat or a cummerbund. These coverings should not be worn together. There are also some unspoken rules about how and when to wear them.


The traditional waistcoat is the classic look, either in its single or double breasted forms, and differs somewhat in cut from the three-piece suit waistcoat. Namely, it is cut low and wide and has shawl lapels.Cummerbunds are pleated sashes that wrap around the waist and is usually made of the same silk fabric as the tux’s braid and lapel facings.
The waist covering should conceal your waistband all the way around.
Cummerbunds tend to look best when they are the same color as the whole ensemble. Avoid choosing a flashy color or wearing one with a long tie.In general, the fabric that makes up your cummerbund should be the same as your bow tie. Some purists match the cummerbund, tie, lapel facing, and trouser stripe. If all are black silk grosgrain, you can't go wrong.

, Choose a basic pair of lace-up patent leather shoes that are the same color as the trousers, jacket and socks. This approach helps to maintain the unified look from head to toe, preventing any sudden jarring lines.Formal “pumps” or “opera shoes” are an option. This shoes are made from highly polished patent leather and have either a pinched or flat bow on top. However, some fashion experts advise that formal pumps are actually more suited to white-tie dress.
If one wishes, pumps made from velvet—with or without embroidery—may be used in lieu of patent pumps and are less formal.
A simple pair of calf leather black cap toes or whole cuts shined to a beautiful luster are more than appropriate. Stay away from brogueing, suede, boots, etc. These shoes can also be used for less formal events, so are a great choice if you're limited in your budget.

, Accentuating your outfit with a kerchief, pocket watch, or boutonniere can really make the tuxedo “pop” in all the right ways. Be mindful of what is considered acceptable, however, and try not to overdo it.Kerchiefs or pocket squares will look best in white, and preferably in silk.
For black tie, you can wear either a wrist or pocket watch. Try to get one that matches the color of your button studs and cuff links.
If you’d like to wear a hat, don’t go for the top hat – this is considered appropriate only for white tie attire. Go for a fedora or a homburg instead.
When in doubt, choose accessories that are same color as the trousers and jacket.

These suits will be more versatile and favorable for everyday wear. Most dress shirt colors will also match well with a dark grey or navy.Feel free to choose a subtle pattern for your shirt, just make sure it doesn’t clash with any pattern on your suit.;
, The jacket should taper in at the waist to accentuate your shoulders. While the hem should fall where your fingertips end naturally when you have your arms at your side. The sleeves should also sit at the top of your wrists and allow a quarter to a half inch of your shirt cuff to show.For a better fit, visit a tailor to have the jacket fitted around your biceps.
Avoid lapels wider than three inches.
Also be sure to remove the brand label from the sleeve.

, This is when your pants skim the tops of your shoes and create a crease. If there is no crease, it’s a good sign that your pants are too short. However, if you have a deep crease or multiple creases, it’s likely your pants are too long. To make sure you get the right length, try the pants on while wearing shoes.


If you are planning to wear a suit every day, buy more than one pair of trousers as they are likely to wear quickly.

, Pleats are a much older look that has fallen out of fashion. So rather than trousers with a front crease, go for a flat-pressed trouser, which will help slim your legs. Similarly, purchasing pants without cuffs will help elongate your legs, as cuffing makes them appear shorter., Though it can be hard to tell the difference from far away, a quality dress shirt will not only look better but feel better as well. You will have freer movement and the dress shirt will last longer. To make sure you are buying a high-quality piece, look at the crispness of the collar and check for clean stitching.


Also look at the paneling along the shoulders. If the shirt has a ""split yoke,"" which is where the panel is made from two different fabric pieces sewn together at an angle, then it is likely to be better made., You can use the dress shirt to bring in pops of color to accentuate the suit or add personality. However, you don’t want to go over-the-top with patterns or bright hues. A fluorescent neon shirt is unlikely to go over well in a basic office job. Instead, try to stick to whites, blues, light purples, salmon, and grays.


If you are going to wear an undershirt, wear a v-neck so it doesn’t show under your collar.

, The standard rule is that the width of your tie should match the width of the lapels on your suit jacket. So, if your lapels are two-three inches, then your tie should be the same. You should also make sure that your tie partially covers your belt buckle. To do this, you may want to knot the tie to see how long it is when worn properly.

, The most common knot for a tie is the Windsor knot. This knot looks good with any suit and is common for everyday work attire. You can do either a half-Windsor knot or a full-Windsor knot. Though it may sound odd, a good way to judge which knot to use is to go off of the size of your head. You want the Windsor knot to match. For less formal attire, try a four-in-hand knot., Fold it so it fits snugly in the pocket and just peeks out of the top.This is a great accent piece to any suit and is a great way to add a bit of personality or character. However, your pocket square should not match your tie’s pattern or fabric.

, For everyday wear, try dark brown shoes. These shoes pair well with both charcoal gray and navy blue. You can also go for lighter browns or tans if you are wearing a lighter colored suit. Loafers or Oxfords are the most common shoes to wear with suits, though you can change styles depending on the occasion.

, While socks are a great area to play around with style, you always want to make sure they cover your ankles when you sit down. Your pants are going to ride up no matter what you do, so you want to make sure you aren't showing off any extra skin. Aim for pairs that sit halfway up your shin like argyles.


Feel free to mix up colors and patterns or simply stick to blacks and grays.

, A belt is a necessity for a properly fitted suit. However, you don't want a large, clunky item with a big belt buckle to overpower your look. Instead, go for a thin belt the same color as your shoes with a silver, gold, or bronze belt buckle. The simpler, the better.

If you're wearing a leather jacket for a winter look, go for a bomber jacket.Bomber jackets are also more casual, so they can work great for a casual winter look.;
, If you want something a little bolder, opt for a motorcycle jacket. Motorcycle jackets have long lapels, a flared collar, and a zipper that runs at an angle.

Make sure the surface you lay it on is clean and dry so you don’t mess up the handkerchief.
Pay attention to the fabric type and follow guidelines for ironing that particular fabric.;
, Fold the left side across so it lines up evenly with the right side. You want to make sure the edges stay lined up. You can iron the fold to add crispness to the crease., If you are using a small handkerchief or pocket square, you may not need to perform this second fold. It depends on the size of the handkerchief and the size of the pocket you will place it in.


If folding it in half a second time makes it too narrow, you can try folding it just a third of the way across on the second fold.
If you fold it a second time and it is still too wide for the pocket, then you should consider using a smaller handkerchief.

, You don’t want the part you have folded to stick out of the top of the pocket, so pay attention to how much you should fold it. You also need to pay attention to how deep the pocket is to make sure the handkerchiefs sits on the bottom of the pocket.

, You’ll want to look at yourself in a mirror, or get the help of a friend, to make sure the pocket square is sticking out of your pocket just the right amount. You want roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) or less to be peeking out of the pocket.


This look is best for formal, black-tie attire. A white pocket square with a black suit is the perfect look.

Denim is typically available in several types of washes as well to really add a variety of color. Choose one that best suits your tastes and personality.;
, Pick from a wide variety of denim vest styles. Do you want a lot of pockets? Maybe distressed denim is more of your thing, complete with holes tears and rips. Or maybe you’re looking for a denim vest with a wide variety of zippers and buttons. Perhaps your perfect vest is a combination of all of these factors. Denim vests come in almost every style you can imagine – keep looking until you find one you love.


Be aware that denim vests are great for layering during the warmer months of the year. In other words, vests are typically worn with other items of clothing. Be careful not to buy something too distressed to go with elegant clothing and vice versa. , Determine what fit works best for you. Denim vests range from flowing down to the waist to hovering just above the belly button. Vests can also vary in their tightness, whether you’re looking for slightly baggy and loose fit or an elegantly tight fit. Try to choose one that highlights your natural features or other parts of your wardrobe, whether it be a t-shirt or stylish skirt.


A tighter or smaller denim vest will highlight what you’re wearing over your legs. Have a favorite pair of pants? Go for a smaller fit. Larger, looser vests serve to really unite an outfit in the same way a light jacket can in the fall. If you’re unsure or wish to wear your new vest with almost everything, aim for something in the middle., A denim vest is typically worn during hotter months to spice up summer outfits. Add it to your own favorite summertime outfits to make your look more interesting and give yourself a fashionable edge. It’s also seen as more on the casual side due to its association with jeans, so don’t try to pull it off in more elegant situations unless you’re extremely confident it works. While it’s possible to wear a denim vest during colder seasons, the lack of bulk and cloth make the item of clothing little more than a fashion accessory. Save your denim vest for spring, summer and early fall.

, Pair your denim vest with existing items in your wardrobe. A vest is usually paired with sundresses, shorts, a floor-length skirt, and loose fitting pants. If it’s spring or fall, you can also pair a denim vest with an all-black outfit to give it a pop of color


Denim vests are best paired with black outfits, crop-tops, colorful pants, and stripes to both spice up and neutralize worn colors. Wearing denim vests with other denim is doable, but requires the two items of clothing to be of two obviously different washes. , After you’ve properly sported your denim vest, know how to properly keep it clean. Denim is a very strong material – originally invented to withstand a blue-collar workday – but is very sensitive to washing. Washing too much can cause your denim to lose its color.


Spot-clean your denim vest with a toothbrush and a minimal amount of laundry detergent. This will only clean the vest on a need-to-clean basis and save it from the wear and tear of a normal washing machine. Soak your vest in vinegar and water. Water itself will cause the vest to lose its color. Vinegar helps conserve the color. Soak the vest for about an hour before hanging it up to dry. The same technique can be used with a washing machine by washing your vest on the hand-wash setting and adding vinegar over laundry detergent. , Since denim vests are typically a summer item, pick out a pair of sunglasses to go with your own. The pair you pick should go along with the look you’re looking for – if your vest is serving as a pop of color for an all-black outfit, wear neutral black sunglasses. If your vest is serving to neutralize an already interesting outfit, keep the outfit especially interesting with a pair of over-the-top aviators.


Use the same fashion tips as you would when picking out an outfit to go with your denim vest. Shades of black, colorful highlights, and neutral browns go great with a wide variety of denim colors. Make sure your sunglasses follow suit.

, A great way to accessorize your denim vest is the addition of buttons. Whether you’re adding a button with a band logo, a political slogan, flower pattern or funny saying, the button-on-denim look has been a staple of fashion for decades. Find or buy a wide variety of colors to really rock the style.Be aware that buttons can be damaging to any item of clothing, including denim. If your denim vest is more on the elegant side, you may want to shy away from adding buttons. However, if your denim vest is more rustic and worn, a button is practically begging to make its home there.

, A fantastic way to accessorize your vest is to add patches. Use the same rules as when adding buttons and don't be afraid to venture out beyond band name logos or funny sayings. Add something uniquely your own.Patches serve as a great way to show off your stylistic expression as well as your personality.


Patches also come in many popular shapes. It’s not at all unusual to find patches in the shapes of flowers, hearts or even animals. Choose whichever shape you feel says the most about you.

, It’s not at all unusual to decorate denim clothing with a colored marker or paint. Are you artsy and see your vest as a blank canvas? Make your vest the way you feel it should be if you feel it’s too plain. The greatest thing about denim is how much wear and tear it can take – take advantage of this fact and make the vest your own!

Pair your jacket with formal attire.,
Use a jacket as an alternative to a blazer for formal occasions.",How to Wear a Leather Jacket2," Even slim-fitted leather jackets tend to be bulkier in nature, so go for lighter clothing under your jacket. Light shirts, blouses, and other tops work best when sporting a leather jacket.If you intend to wear your leather jacket unbuttoned, go for a t-shirt over something like a button-down shirt.

, As leather jackets are bulky, they go best with slim fitting pants. Go for things like skinny jeans or jeans that are form-fitted. Baggier jeans will not look good with a leather jacket.For example, wear a pair of skinny jeans with a bomber jacket.

, A leather jacket does not have to be worn with casual clothing. It can make a great accessory for a slimming dress or skirt. You can also wear it with a dress shirt and dress pants for a more formal occasion.A leather jacket can look great with a patterned dress, as it's a solid color.

This works best for more casual occasions.A baseball cap looks great when paired with something casual, like a t-shirt, worn under a leather jacket.

Go for shorter, slimmer scarves over clunkier ones to avoid overwhelming the outfit.

Decide on how important practicality is to you.,
Ask yourself if you want a casual skirt or a dressy skirt.,
Stick with fitted tops.,
Avoid over-accessorizing.",How to Wear a Cargo Skirt1,"


Knee-length skirts are universally flattering.
In general, shorter skirts flatter short women who want to make their legs look longer, while longer skirts flatter tall women who may feel self-conscious about their height.
If you have wide thighs and hips, you may want to avoid mini-skirts that end right above the widest part of your leg, since these may make your thighs look larger.;
, Some skirts have deep pockets that you can get a lot of use out of, but other skirts only have pockets that are there for decoration. If you want a cargo skirt for the extra pocket space, gravitate toward styles that are knee-length or longer, since these generally have more practical pockets.

, Most cargo skirts are fairly casual, but some are made from nicer materials and often work with nicer outfits.

, Cargo skirts tend to be stiff and do not often flow well off of the wearer’s curves. As a result, loose, formless tops may end up making you look boxy when pair with a stiff cargo skirt.

, In some sense, a cargo skirt’s pockets are already an embellishment. Adding too many additional accessories may make your look seem cluttered.

Alternatively, throw a blazer with an unusual hue, like lavender, over a neutral t-shirt and khaki cargo.

, Plaid has a reputation as a casual print. You can opt for the traditional red and black style, or branch out into other colors that suit your tastes better. Either way, this type of shirt works especially well when matched with a khaki colored cargo skirt.

, Fitted sweaters look a little dressier than t-shirts and plaid button-downs, but they still have casual appeal that works well when matched with a coordinating cargo skirt.

, You can choose simple flats or a more decorative option. Flats are easier to dress down than heels, however, often making them better suited for casual cargo skirts.

, Skirts made of heavy materials are more likely to keep you warm than thinner materials, like satin. Wearing leggings can further prevent your legs from getting cold, as well.

, Flats can work with dressy cargo skirts as well as casual cargos, but the most casual flats may not look right. Instead of natural canvas styles, stick with leather designs.

, Low, strappy heels look especially nice with a satin cargo skirt for a night out, but other designs may work, as well.

, Heavy materials, like wool or twill, coordinate well with knee-high or over-the-knee boots. Flat riding boots are more practical and may look a little more casual, while heeled boots can take your outfit up a notch.

, To add structure and style to your ensemble, tie a leather belt around your natural waist, over your top. A belt emphasizes your waist, thereby accentuating your curves and preventing your body from looking too boxy.

, Look at bold pieces, like large necklaces with colored gemstone beads or chunky bangle bracelets. Avoid dainty jewelry, since this look may still be too casual to work well with extremely elegant pieces. Conversely, you should also avoid the natural pieces you wear with your casual skirt, since the casualness of these pieces may also clash.

Make sure to ask questions at the facility.",How to Store a Fur Coat," Fur does not do well if it gets exposed to direct sunlight. The ideal place to store fur is a dark location. A closet, for example, is a great place to store fur.Choose an area of your home that does not get a lot of direct sunlight. A closet right by your bedroom window may not be a great place for a fur coat. A closet near the hallway, away from windows, may be a better option.;
, Fur does best at colder temperatures. You should store your fur in an area of your home that tends to be cooler. A closet on the first floor near the air conditioning, for example, can be a great place to store fur.It's especially important to store fur in cool places during the summer months.

, Humidity can be very damaging to fur. Many people try to store fur coats in the basement, due to cooler temperatures. However, basements tend to be very humid. You should never store fur in areas prone to excessive humidity.It may be a good idea to keep a dehumidifier in the room where you store your fur, especially if you live in an area prone to humidity.

, Both cedar closets and moth balls absorb moisture. This can dramatically increase humidity, which can be very harmful to a fur coat. In addition to this, fur can absorb odor from moth balls and cedar. Once absorbed, this odor can be very hard to get rid of., How you hang your coat matters. The wrong kind of hanger can damage a fur coat. In order to support the full weight of your coat, choose a broad-shouldered clothes hanger.You can buy a broad-shouldered hanger at a department store or online.

, A plastic bag is not suitable to use to store a coat. Plastic will dry out a coat. Buy a cloth bag big enough to comfortably fit your fur coat. You may be able to buy a cloth storage bag at the store where you got your coat.
You can also order a storage bag online.

, A coat should never be pushed into the corner of a crowded closet. Coats need ample room for safe storage. If you don't have room for a fur coat in a closet, do not squeeze the coat in. Either move other clothing elsewhere or store the coat in another area., If you live in an area with hot, humid summers, professional storage is strongly recommended. It's very hard to maintain safe levels of heat and humidity in your home, even with amenities like air conditioners. If professional storage is within your budget, it's worth the investment to keep your coat safe., When exploring your storage options, you want to make sure they're adequate to keep a fur coat safe. Any reputable storage center will maintain a 50 degree temperature and a 50 percent humidity. This is ideal for fur., You can find storage facilities online or in the local yellow pages. You should always ask questions when selecting a storage facility. Storing coats is expensive, so you want to make sure your coat will not get damaged by the wrong facility. Ask where the storage area is. Some facilities store fur coats in a cramped back room.You should also visit a facility in person and ask to see the storage area. You do not want to store your coat in a facility where it will be jammed in with other clothing items.
You should also ask about coverage in the event the fur is lost or damaged. If you have insurance, make sure your insurance still covers your fur if you choose to store it. You should also make sure the storage facility has insurance coverage, and ask whether or not you would be compensated in the event of damages.

Fill a large plastic bin with warm water into your bathtub.,
Submerge your jacket in the water and rub out the dye.,
Wring the water out of the jacket.,
Let your jacket dry on a towel for two days.",How to Shrink a Leather Jacket1," The plastic container is necessary because the dye in many leather jackets will bleed when soaked in water and could ruin the finish on your tub. For the same reasons, you should wear rubber gloves to prevent dye from getting on your hands.You can purchase the plastic bins online or at most major department and hardware stores.
Purchase a tub that's at least 33 gallons (125 liters) or big enough so you can submerge your entire jacket.
You should fill the container up half way, or enough so that you can fully submerge your jacket under water.;
, Keep the jacket submerged under water for five to ten minutes. Some of the dye should naturally leak out of your jacket. Rub a sleeve over the entire surface of your jacket and allow more of the dye to bleed out.


This process will make your leather absorb more water and will promote shrinkage., Once your jacket is finished soaking, take it out of the plastic bin and wring it out. Make sure to do this over the plastic container or the jacket's dye could create a mess. Get as much water out if as you possibly can before moving onto the next step.

, Lay out a fresh towel and drape your leather jacket over it. As the towels become soaked by the jacket, make sure to replace them and turn your jacket over so that the entire thing can dry. Keep your jacket in a dry area. If you put it in sunlight or another heat source, it will shrink your jacket faster but will also make it much smaller.


You can also use a hairdryer to achieve faster results. Be aware that this may cause the jacket to shrink more."

If you’re unsure, visit a professional tailor or buy a fabric measuring tape and find out for yourself. In most cases, your optimal overcoat size will correspond exactly with your suit size, as modern overcoats are sized to fit over a suit jacket or sport coat.A size 42 overcoat will not be exactly 42 inches (106.7 cm) around the chest. The sizing number is listed to match your suit size, but will actually be a couple of inches bigger to accommodate the suit underneath.
If you usually wear a 42S size in a suit, consider having your overcoat sized 42R or even 42L to get the right fit. In general, an overcoat shoulder fits slightly long and loose because its primary purpose is to envelope the body and cover the clothing beneath.;
, Wrap a measuring tape around the thickest part of your chest. For most men, this will be just under the armpits. Let your arms rest at your sides while measuring so that your chest will be fully expanded and in the most natural position. This measurement will tell you how large your overcoat needs to be in the chest.It’s usually a good idea to buy one size larger based on chest measurements so that you’ll have ample room to move comfortably in your coat. If your measurement is between sizes, round up.Having a friend or loved one lend a hand in the process can help give you a more precise measurement.

, Lay the measuring tape down the side of your arm and measure the distance from shoulder to wrist. Keep your arms bent with your hands on your hips. This will ensure that the sleeve will be long enough not to pull too high when you bend your arms. Overcoat sleeves need to be a very particular length, so finding out the length of your arm span will help you end up with a coat that fits perfectly.For overcoats bought off the rack, a chest measurement will probably be all you need. However, if you’re having an overcoat made or altered specifically for your figure, you’ll need to get more detailed measurements of your upper body.
Overcoat sleeves should be long enough to cover the sleeve of your sportcoat and the cuff of your shirt when worn., Know your exact height and be prepared to let a sizing professional know if you take the more expensive tailored route. Overcoats come in several different lengths. Full-length coats are the most traditional and cover the body almost all the way to the ankles. ¾ length coats are a more popular modern fit, and tend to come down to around knee level on most men. Decide which style you prefer and how your height will play a factor in sizing the coat.If your measurements are somewhat unusual (if, for instance, you’re shorter in stature but have long arms), you may be better off having the garment professionally tailored to ensure a proper fit.
These days, ¾ overcoats are favored by young professionals and are almost always sized to be slimmer and more fitted., Whether you're buying a coat off the rack or having one tailored professionally to suit your frame, give it a test run to see how it fits. Put the coat on and move around a little, observing how movement causes the coat to tense and draw up on your body. An overcoat should fit comfortably and loosely over a suit, so if it feels snug in any area above the waist, consider moving up a size.Discuss alterations with a tailor or seamstress, even if you're buying a coat off the rack. An overcoat that is too big can be altered after the fact to better fit your physique. Little can be done to modify a coat that is too small.
Look for areas with excessive creasing, tension or bunching. This usually signifies an improper fit., When choosing an overcoat style and materials, take into consideration the climate where you live. If you live in an area with harsh winters or year-round temperate weather, look for coats made from materials like wool and cashmere, the heavier the better. Lighter weight overcoats made from waxed cotton or twill will be appropriate for autumn evenings or in places that don’t get too cold.Winter overcoats should be quite heavy. Many men’s fashion experts recommend a weight of 3-4 pounds for a winter coat to offer optimal insulation from the cold.
Light, waterproof overcoats can come in handy if you live somewhere that receives a lot of rain.

, Pick an overcoat you like that will complement the type of clothing you ordinarily wear and is suitable for the setting in which it is to be worn. One of the most popular styles is the Chesterfield, a traditional English-style coat that is usually knee-length and often worn in charcoal gray, navy or black. There is also the Polo, a double-breasted cut with large lapels and a belted waist. Lastly, there is the immediately recognizable American style trench coat, a full-length coat constructed of durable canvas and featuring a loose fit, high collar and epaulettes. Any of these styles might potentially be a good fit for you and the look you're trying to create.Other common overcoat varieties include Paletot, Ulster and Field Coat styles, which boast different fits and features, many of which are inspired by formal military dress uniforms.
Chesterfield, Polo or trench coats are the most versatile styles, and can be worn with outfits ranging from a sweater and khakis for a night out on the town or formal attire for a business meeting or funeral.

, Keeping in mind weather conditions and the type of clothing you’ll be wearing with it, pick out a coat length that will work best for you. For style reasons you may opt for a ¾ length coat, whereas full-length coats will provide better shelter from cold and wind. These aren’t the only options: overcoats are available in many in-between lengths and can be altered depending on your own preferred specifications.Certain overcoat styles are associated with particular lengths. For instance, the Chesterfield, Paletot and pea coat are made to fall around the knee, while the Polo, Ulster and trench coat drape over as much of the body’s length as possible.

, After you’ve found the right fit and selected a style and length, you have the option of selecting from different colors. Black, dark gray and navy blue are the classic colorways for formal events and are a safe choice for a general purpose overcoat. Khaki and light brown shades are often prescribed for more casual garb, while bright and unusual colors should be reserved for informal, social wear only.Overcoats can be worn in the same color as the clothing underneath, or can be chosen to offset or match garments in different colors. Browns and grays, for example, go well together, and can provide a striking contrast for a more dressy getup.
An overcoat should be worn as a tasteful outer garment. Avoid bright, garish colors or dizzying designs.

, Choose a long, heavy overcoat for cold weather and bundle up. The primary purpose of an overcoat is to act as a warm outer layer. For this end, materials like wool, cashmere and fleece will work best. Look for thick fabrics, strong seams and additional features like belts, buttons and high collars you can use to envelope yourself when it gets brisk.Overcoats pair well with hats, gloves, scarves and other formal cold weather gear.Nicer types like Chesterfields and Polos are ideal for wearing over a suit, which can be difficult to layer effectively in the winter.

, Another function of overcoats is to create a barrier between you and the outside world. They provide enough coverage to cut down on wind chill, are sturdy enough to protect you from moisture and everyday contact, and act as a membrane to keep your formal items from getting dirty. An overcoat can lend you peace of mind knowing that you and your clothing will remain protected and pristine beneath it.If you think your lifestyle might be rough on an overcoat, try out materials like cotton twill, waxed canvas or even leather. These tough fabrics are resistant to wear and tear and are generally easy to clean.
Safeguard leather overcoats with a protective coating of oil to make them water-resistant., Go for an overcoat over a fleece jacket or windbreaker the next time you need to make a good impression. Overcoats are one kind of formal garment that never goes out of style. You’ll look much more suave wearing a well-fitted, sensible overcoat than you would in plain outerwear, or caught unprepared for chilly weather in only a suit.Black, charcoal gray and navy blue should be your go-to color choices for formal dress.An overcoat can and should be worn in place of inappropriately casual jackets whenever possible.

, While overcoats have become a less prevalent fashion choice in contemporary times, they are still regarded as the peak of men’s business and formal style. You’ll stand out from the crowd and be taken seriously as a man of refinement once you add a nice overcoat to your coat rack. It’s a good way to inject some classic style into your wardrobe, and you’re sure to turn heads when you walk past a crowd of people all wearing the same thing.


Go for modern styles and materials and an accentuated fit. Overcoats are marked by a somewhat vintage aesthetic and can look like a novelty if they’re not chosen carefully.

Be confident.",How to Look Good Without Makeup," Skincare is a key factor in looking good without makeup. Spend what time and money you would spend applying and purchasing makeup on skin care. First and foremost, find a good facial wash that's suited to your skin type and use it twice a day—once in the morning and once at night.


Although it may be tempting to wash your face more than twice a day, this is not advisable. Over-washing can make your skin dry and irritable, causing it to look worse rather than better.
Develop a skin regimen for your face. Whatever regimen you choose, stick to it, and always follow through. Repeat the regimen in the morning and at night.;
, Every time you wash your face, you should follow it up with an application of facial moisturizer. Pick a quality daily moisturizer (preferably one with SPF in it) and apply it every day after washing. Opt for a slightly richer moisturizer to wear at night.









Always choose a moisturizer that's suited to your skin type. If you have sensitive skin, go for something gentle and unscented. If you are prone to pimples, try something light and non-oily.
Drier skin types should go for heavier moisturizers with soothing, nourishing ingredients like shea butter or aloe vera.

, Exfoliation removes dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, leaving your face looking fresh and radiant. It can really help to give a healthy glow to your skin, which is a bonus when you're aiming to go makeup free. Find a skin wash with special exfoliating particles which you can use at least once a week, but as often as every 2 to 3 days, for best results.









Alternatively, you can exfoliate using a clean washcloth soaked in warm water. Rub your face gently with the washcloth, in slow circular motions. This option is good for people with skin that is sensitive to the ingredients in any facial washes.
Never scrub your face too hard with the exfoliator or use it too often. This will dry out your skin and leave it feeling irritated, which is the last thing you want.

, Toner is a skin care product that has often been overlooked, but can do wonders when it comes to improving the appearance of your skin. Toner restores your skin's natural pH balance, along with many other benefits depending on the type of toner. Look for toners that are alcohol-free. These are less drying on the skin and help to even out skin tone.









For instance, toners designed for oily or acne-prone skin can help to remove excess oil and tighten pores, while toners for dry skin can help to soothe irritation and lock in extra moisture.
A toner appropriate for your skin type can be used everyday, after cleansing and before moisturizing.

, Even though this article is a guide on how to look good without makeup, chances are you will still want to wear it from time to time. This is absolutely fine, but just make sure that when you do wear makeup, you remember to take it off completely before bed. Makeup that is left on overnight can clog the pores and lead to pimples.


Use a specific makeup removing product, like a foaming cleanser or cream to remove the makeup, rather than your regular face wash. Use a special eye makeup remover to clean off mascara, eyeshadow, and eyeliner.

, Pimples can be one of the main reasons that people are afraid to go bare-faced in the first place, so if you can get rid of those, you will feel a lot more confident about going makeup free. Make sure to follow a rigorous skincare regimen to avoid pores from becoming blocked and remove any excess bacteria from the surface of the skin. Use products targeted at oily or acne-prone skin and look for moisturizers, sunblocks and makeup that are non-comedogenic (non-pore blocking).









Loom for over-the-counter spot creams and gels which contain ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, both of which are extremely effective for clearing acne.
If these measures do not seem to be working, consider seeing a dermatologist who can prescribe a stronger medicated cream or even a round of antibiotics or other oral medications.

, You should wear sunscreen every day, even if it's cold, cloudy or snowy, as the UVA/UVB rays can still damage your skin. Sun damage will cause your skin to age prematurely, and in extreme cases can lead to skin cancer and other skin conditions.









Aim to use SPF 30 or higher and, if possible, find a sunscreen which doubles up as a moisturizer. This will make sunscreen application easy to remember.

, This is a habit many people are guilty of, which can seriously affect the quality of the skin. Picking at spots, rubbing your forehead, or simply resting your chin on your hand are all things which add oil and bacteria to the skin, causing it to break out and look greasy.


Rubbing at your face can also loosen the skin, causing premature wrinkles. Therefore, if you want to improve the appearance of your skin, make an effort to stop unnecessarily touching your face.

, Be sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep per night, and to drink at least 5-8 glasses (or 1 and a half liters) of water. Sleep gives your skin a chance to repair and restore itself, leaving you looking fresh and without dark circles beneath your eyes, while drinking water hydrates the skin and purifies it from the inside out, flushing out toxins and fueling the skin's metabolism.

, Keep your eyebrows looking tidy by removing any stray hairs. Having perfectly shaped brows can do wonders for your face by framing your eyes, therefore making them the center of attention. Well-manicured eyebrows can be very striking and add definition to your features without the need for makeup.


If you're nervous about plucking and aren't sure which eyebrow shape would best suit your face, go to a beautician to have them plucked or waxed for the first time.
Once that's done, you will be able to maintain your new shape at home with a pair of good, quality tweezers. Always pluck one hair at a time, and pluck from the bottom of the brow rather than the top.

, It is important to wash your hair frequently to prevent the hair and skin from becoming very greasy and dirty. However, unless you have extremely oily hair, it is probably unnecessary to wash your hair every single day—every other day will do. This will certainly ensure that your hair doesn't get dried out, but never looks dirty either. Use a shampoo and conditioner suited to your hair type and remember to get a haircut every 3 to 4 months to keep hair in tip-top condition.


Keep your hair nicely conditioned, using a grape-sized dollop of conditioner applied to your roots and pony-tail area daily. For extra shine, smoothness, and softness, rinse with cool water.
Tie your hair in a low ponytail at night to prevent any grease from your hair getting onto your face.

, Long, curling eyelashes can make you feel very feminine, but you don't need lashings of mascara to achieve this look. All you need to do is invest in an eyelash curler—a contraption that may look scary, but is actually painless and easy to use.









The eyelash curler clamps around your eyelashes and is held in place for 10 to 20 seconds, leaving your lashes curled and your eyes looking wider.
You can also make your eyelashes appear thicker and darker by applying a coat of Vaseline to your lashes, then combing them through with an eyelash brush.

, Smooth, full lips are much more attractive than dry, cracked ones, so make sure to look after yours using a combination of exfoliation and moisturization. Exfoliate your lips by gently rubbing a dampened toothbrush against them, then hydrate with your favorite lip balm.









Protect lips from extreme weather conditions by wearing a lip balm with an SPF in the sun, or a protective chapstick in the winter.

, A great trick that can brighten up your eyes and give an overall impression of health and alertness is to use some redness-reducing eye drops. These are readily available at your local pharmacy and are a quick and easy way to improve your totally cute and so far sexy appearance. Simply add a drop or two to each eye every morning for brightness and clarity.








, One simple thing that can give the appearance of beauty and health is a little rosy color in the cheeks. This can be achieved through frequent exercise and time spent outdoors in the fresh air. However, a quick fix is to gently pinch or slap the cheeks, giving them a little color.








, A white, healthy smile can work wonders for your overall appearance, so make sure you give your teeth the care and attention they deserve. Brush a least twice a day, for a minimum of two minutes, using gentle circular motions. Focus on each tooth individually and don't neglect the hard to reach teeth at the back.


It is just as important to floss daily as it is to brush. Flossing removes built-up bacteria, food particles and plaque from between the teeth, thus preventing cavities from forming.
Also remember to brush your tongue with the toothbrush and use a mouthwash to prevent bad breath.

, Smiling brightens up your face and allows your inner beauty to shine through. It gives the impression of happiness and confidence, while also making you more attractive to others. Smiling more often will help you to look your best, regardless of whether you're wearing makeup or not.

, A healthy glow can transform your appearance, making your skin appear more radiant and your complexion smoother and more even-toned. If you can achieve a tan naturally, while also wearing protection, that's great. However, tanning beds and other options like these are expensive and occasionally cause skin cancer, so try a spray-on tan (good quality—you don't want to look fake) or for your face, bronzer for an extra little sun-kissed glow.


Look for facial moisturizers which will slowly build up a natural-looking tan and leave you looking sun-kissed, no matter the weather.

, Feeling good without makeup will rely on how confident you feel about the rest of your appearance. Every girl knows that a killer outfit can make her feel like she can take on the world, so use the time that you would normally spend on making up your face on planning the perfect outfit.


Wear clothes that you feel comfortable in and that fit you perfectly. Don't try too hard to fit in with the latest trends or squeeze yourself into tight fitting clothes. You'll look your best when you feel your best.

, Make sure that your hair looks clean and neat at all times. It just gives you one less thing to worry about. Try a new haircut, like adding layers or bangs or even taking the leap with a pixie cut. Experiment with different styles: straighten your hair, curl it, put it in a bun or plait—use your imagination!


Bad hair days can be covered up with a fashionable scarf or beret—or simply use a little dry shampoo to de-grease hair and add volume.

, Looking and feeling healthy has a lot to do with what you put into your body. Skin, especially, can be affected by a poor diet and healthy skin is essential to looking good without makeup. Try to cut out as many greasy, fatty, sugary foods as possible and load up on fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats instead.


Remember to drink plenty of water to flush out your system, keep skin looking healthy and prevent you from feeling bloated.
Take a vitamin supplement if you feel you are not getting all of your daily requirements from your diet alone. Vitamins A, C and E are all particularly beneficial for the skin.

, True beauty shines from within, so stop believing that you need your mascara to feel confident and start believing in you. Stand up tall, with your shoulders back and your chin up. Make eye contact with people and smile frequently. Remember that makeup is simply a tool used to emphasize certain features—your natural beauty has been there all along.

Go for a cropped blazer if you have an athletic build.,
Look for a short blazer if you have larger hips.,
Choose a very fitted blazer if you have a petite build.,
Stick with simpler blazers if you have a full bust.,
Choose a fitted blazer if you tend to run in the plus sizes.",How to Wear a Blazer1," Women with an athletic build tend to have sturdy, broad shoulders and slim hips. A cropped blazer is a little lower in the front and higher in the back, causing the bottom to be cut diagonally downward toward the front. This cut creates the illusion of larger hips and a curvier waist, de-emphasizing the shoulders as a result.;
, Women with larger hips, such as pear-shaped women, should choose a blazer that stops just short of the hips or just below. Anything longer will draw unwanted attention to your hips. If you are pear-shaped and have a smaller bust to match your fuller hips, you could also wear light shoulder pads to draw the eye upward and make your bust more noticeable. Lots of details or decoration on the top will also help balance your proportions out.

, Blazers are very professional and chic, and as a result, they can make the petite woman look very mature in a way that few other clothing items do. Make sure that the blazer hugs and accents your curves very well, though, or else you could end up looking as though you are swimming in the excess fabric.

, Decorations and structure on the upper part of the blazer can highlight the bust, making you look top-heavy as a result. Choose a simpler style that nips in at the waist to highlight your curves rather than your chest.

, A blazer can look very flattering on a plus size woman, especially if it nips in slightly at the waist. The blazer should fit without being stretched or stressed, but it should not be too loose, either, since the excess bulk will not do anything to flatter your figure.

, Add a darker pink shade in the crease.

, Your skin tone should determine the shade of pink. Lighter skin should choose lighter pinks, and darker skin should choose darker pinks.

, A pair of cute sparkly jeans would look cute here, too.

, Your choice of tops and bottoms will determine your shoes. More casual clothes would look silly with spike high heels or pumps, so wear flats or ankle boots.If your outfit is more formal, go with more formal footwear, like heels. Pick shoe colors that complement your clothing.

, Again, just like with the footwear, your clothes will determine which accessories would not be appropriate. Some suggestions are scarves, necklaces, earrings, etc, but don't go crazy. Choose one or two accessories.


For instance, giant silver hoops with a big, showy, statement necklace would be too much. And if you're wearing that necklace, leave the scarf at home and wear a small, nice ring instead. You could go for pink and red jewelry. Accessories with roses on them are romantic. So have fun!

, A cute hairstyle is to leave your hair down and wear a pink rose head band in it. For this you could straighten or curl your hair. If using heated tools, be sure to use a heat protecting spray in your hair.


Another idea is to put your hair in a messy bun and add a flower clip.

Choose a blazer in a simple color and style.,
Wear a tailored shirt beneath the blazer.,
Throw on tailored slacks.,
Slip on closed-toe shoes.,
Keep your cosmetics and jewelry to a minimum.",How to Wear a Blazer2," The less adorned or extravagant the jacket looks, the more professional it will be. For best results, look for a blazer in a neutral color, like black, gray, tan, brown, or navy. Pinstripe blazers can also look very professional.

, The classic button-down shirt will almost never fail, but almost any tailored blouse can create this look as long as the pattern is simple and the neckline does not interfere with the neckline of the blazer. Neutral colors, strong gem tones, and pastels all work well, but avoid neon colors.

, Straight-leg styles look the most professional and usually work best, but a boot-cut can also do the trick. Your pants do not need to be the same exact shade as your blazer, but it helps if they are in the same color family.


If you feel like being a little more girly, try a knee-length pencil skirt instead of the trousers. Stick with simpler styles and avoid anything that looks too gaudy or decorated.

, Heels, fashion boots, and flats are all appropriate, but you should avoid casual shoes, sandals, or open-toe shoes. Wear neutral colors for a classic look, or make things pop with a splash of bright color, like red.

, A little foundation to smooth your complexion and a small amount of lip gloss or subtle lipstick can keep you looking professional and at your best. One piece of stylish jewelry, like gold bangle bracelets or a silver chain necklace, can also do a lot for your look while keeping it very professional.

Consider a more decorative blazer.,
Slip on a dress in a classic cut.One of the best options is a knee-length dress with a pencil-cut skirt.,
Slip on your favorite heels or flats.,
Get fancy with your hair, make-up, and jewelry.",How to Wear a Blazer3," A simple style can be worn with this look, but this is also a good opportunity to have a little fun with your look. You could choose a blazer with decorated pockets, an interesting lapel, or some type of design on the front. Classic neutrals, like black, brown, gray, and white, tend to be the easiest to match, but you could also try a pastel or gemstone blazer for an interesting twist.

, You can choose just about any neckline, from v-necks and square necks to turtlenecks and cowls, but you should try the dress on with the blazer before wearing it out to make sure that the neckline does not clash with the way the blazer is cut.


The ""little black dress"" is a good option for your blazer, especially if you have a pinstripe blazer or a blazer that is a few shades lighter and somewhat decorated.
As an alternative to a solid dress, you can also wear a nice blouse and pencil skirt. Make sure to add a little feminine or glamorous detail. A vertical ruffle down the front of the shirt works wonders, or a skirt with a little metallic shine can also take your look to a whole new level.

, Closed-toe heels tend to look best, but you should opt for a bit of color or embellishment to make the outfit look a little dressier. Depending on your dress, strappy high-heeled sandals can also work well. If heels are not your thing, though, you can also get away with an embellished flat.

, Style your hair however you usually would when dressing up, whether that means giving yourself an up-do or keeping your hair down in sultry waves. Your make-up should not be caked on too much, but a dramatic lip color or smoky eye can really pump this look up. Your jewelry should still be kept to a few pieces, but colored jewels, sparkling diamonds, or pearls can really invigorate your look.

Choose a simple blazer, but experiment with the color.,
Select a casual but fitted top.,
Wear jeans.,
Go for fashion boots or flats.,
Keep your accessories to a minimum.",How to Wear a Blazer4," A simple black blazer works well, but this is your chance to get as crazy with the color as you want. Avoid too much embellishment, though, since embellished blazers tend to look a little dressier and may make it harder for you to dress it down.

, Fitted t-shirts work well, whether they are in a solid print or have a graphic on the front. For an even more casual and more layered look, you can also slip a fitted hoodie over your t-shirt and beneath the blazer.Make sure that the blazer is a little on the looser side, though, since too much bulk beneath a slim blazer can make your look a little too sloppy.

, Dark jeans will make your look a little more chic, but medium washes can also look appropriate while keeping things even more casual. You can choose nearly any style you want, from boot-cut to skinny jean, as long as the style works well with your figure.

, Heels tend to look a little too dressy for this look, but a fashion boot with a low heel can still work. Flats that are not too dressy or embellished are also a fairly casual shoe and can look great with this style.

, Too much sparkle or bling will look too dressy. A funky ring or chunky colored bangle bracelet can work great, but stay away from dainty pieces or ultra-feminine designs. Keep your make-up looking natural, too, if you even bother to wear any at all.

Match your foundation to the skin between your freckles.,
Use a tinted moisturizer or BB cream.,
Use a CC cream.,
Use concealer sparingly.,
Brush on mineral powder.",How to Highlight Natural Freckles1," Never match your foundation to the shade of your freckles, because it will make your makeup look unnatural. Match your foundation to the lightest shade of skin on your face instead., Skip foundation altogether by wearing only a tinted moisturizer to even out dry skin patches and cover minor skin imperfections. A BB cream works great if you want a tiny bit more coverage than what a tinted moisturizer can give. Look for formulas with at least an SPF 15., If you have redness or acne issues, you may want foundation that will give you more coverage than what a tinted moisturizer or BB cream can. Use a CC cream instead of a heavier, liquid foundation. It will even out your skin tone without covering up your freckles., If you need to cover up pimples or dark circles, use a sheer, liquid concealer. Steer clear of any that go on too cakey or dry. Hydrating formulas are your best bet, but make sure you only apply a small amount of concealer in the places you need it.

, Mineral powder foundation will give you complete, buildable coverage, but it still lets your freckles shine through. Brush on one coat over a tinted moisturizer with a bit of concealer for completely flawless skin.

Look fresh with only mascara.,
Wear a cat-eye with nude lips.,
Use soft colors on your cheeks.,
Play with a pop of color on your lips.,
Draw freckles on.",How to Highlight Natural Freckles2," Freckles make your skin look naturally sun-kissed and the only thing you may need to make your face pop is some black mascara. Swipe a single coat on or layer coats for a more dramatic look., For a look that can take you out-on-the-town all night, line the top of your lash-line thickly with black, liquid liner. Extend the liner a little past your natural lash line while you curve the tail up. Top the look off with shiny, nude lips, so you don’t take the focus away from your freckles.

, Don’t be afraid of blush if you have freckles. Instead use it to enhance them. If the shade of your freckles is more orange than brown, stick with peach and pink blush. If they are on the brown side, use rose colored blush. Most importantly, use soft colors that will make your skin look flushed naturally and steer clear of shades that are too brown., Go bright on your lips by lining them completely with a liner the same shade as your natural lip first. This will prevent any lip freckles from showing through, but remember this is only for bright or dark lipstick! Flaunt your lip freckles otherwise. Top your lined lips off with a bright red, pink or coral shade. Use a medium rose shade, if you want a more subtle look., Maybe you wish you had a little more freckles on the bridge of your nose, or maybe you really just want to look like you’re wearing zero foundation. Go ahead and use a brown liner pencil to draw them on. Make sure your pencil is dull, so your freckles stay natural and soft looking and dot them on haphazardly."

Go easy on the bronzer.,
Stay away from contouring.,
Use vaseline to highlight your features.,
Highlight with an illuminator.",How to Highlight Natural Freckles3," Apply small amounts of sheer bronzer on areas the sun would naturally hit, like cheekbones, forehead and nose. The right amount can complement freckles, but don’t overboard; too much can overpower them. Also, stay away from overly sparkly ones and use a cream or gel bronzer when in doubt.

, Contouring is not a makeup technique well suited for freckles. It creates a lot of heavy coverage and the darker shades involved in contouring can make your freckles look muddy. Skip it and embrace other makeup trends.

, Create a glow and make your cheekbones pop by applying a tiny bit of vaseline in just the right places. Use a small amount on the bridge of your nose and brow bone.

, A liquid illuminator product will make your skin glow without making you look like a disco ball with freckles. Mix a little into your regular foundation or apply some to the tops of cheekbones, the corners of your eyes or in the middle of your lips."

Purchase equal amounts of beeswax and linseed oil.,
Melt the linseed oil and beeswax.,
Test the solution on a scrap piece of clothing.,
Spread out the clothes you are going to waterproof.,
Apply the solution evenly with a brush to the clothing.",How to Waterproof Clothes1," You will also need a brush for painting on the mixture.Linseed oil has a very strong and unpleasant odor, but it is effective at waterproofing clothing.;
, Do not worry about melting them at a certain temperature, you just want to make sure the wax is melted and combined with the linseed oil.

, Let the test piece air dry and note how much time it took for the particular smell of linseed oil to evaporate. You should also check if the wax changes the color or appearance of the clothing.


Long-term exposure to unpleasant smells can cause headaches for some children so make sure the mixture is very dry and the linseed smell has faded before you give the clothing to your child.

, You can do this in your backyard or in your garage. You can also set up a work area inside your home if you do not have a yard or if weather conditions do not permit you to be outside.


Make sure you protect the surface you are working on with old newspapers or old clothing.
Choose a well ventilated area in your home, preferably a room with windows you can open to air out the smell.

, Once you have covered all of the clothing with the solution, let the clothes air dry, preferably inside.


If you dry the clothes outside, dust and dirt could stick to the clothes.
The drying process can take 2-4 days. Once dry, there should be no traces of the solution when you touch the clothing.

Take good care of your skin.,
After cleansing and moisturizing, you can apply your make up.,
Face: With a large powder brush,sweep powder over your T-zone(forehead, nose and chin).,
Eyes: Extra care is a must when doing your eyes.,
Lips: There are loads of kinds of lip balms,so take your pick,as they are essential for keeping your lips smooth and soft.",How to Have Luxurious Skin and Look Great with Makeup," When you have a shower or bath,make sure to use a body wash all over to refresh and rinse off. After you get out,use a body lotion/butter/cream to keep your skin silky soft. Massage in until completely absorbed. Use an exfoliator once a week. Scrub gently then wash off to get rid of dead skin cells. Every morning and night,use a good quality wash or cream cleanser to get rid of any dirt on your face. A moisturizer afterward keeps your face hydrated too.;
, Just remember, don't overdo it! Here are some steps to apply make up like a pro.

, For blusher, smile and dust your blush with a fluffy brush on the rounded parts of your cheeks. Don't use too much to avoid looking pale and red cheeked. Now shine should be at bay and your cheeks rosy.

, Choose an eyeshadow colour, then sweep across your lid(carefully!)and no higher then your brow. Blend in well,either with an eyeshadow applicator,small brush or the tip of your finger. Keep in the lid. For eyeliner,gently line just the outer halves of your lower eyelids to make your eyes look bigger. Smudge carefully for a smokey look. When using your mascara,carefully brush through your lashes and allow to dry, as doing so repeatedly can cause smudges, clumps and spikes. One coat should be enough. If you prefer liquid eyeliner to pencils, then lean on one of your elbows and pull very gently at the edge of your eyelid. With the other hand, draw a fine line along the roots of your eyelashes. Allow make up to dry.

, Use sticks or just little pots. You can use lipsticks for dramatic,noticeable colour. Light pinks and browns are ideal. Paint carefully onto lips,not going over the edges. Or for a more subtle look,how about a lip gloss? These come in colours,with sparkles, flavoured or clear. Squeeze the tube and smooth onto lips for shine. If it is a lip gloss wand you have,paint onto lips just like you would with lipstick.

"
"
Purchase a piece of wax, preferably natural, such as beeswax.,
Prepare a work surface by covering it with old newspaper or clothing.,
Take a piece of wax and rub it directly on the clothing.,
Use the edge of the piece of wax to get into small areas on the clothing.,
Let the clothes dry for at least two days.",How to Waterproof Clothes2," You can also use paraffin wax, as it is colorless and will work as a waterproofing agent, but it could have toxic fumes as it is a petroleum product. So, it may not be the best choice for waterproofing your child’s clothing.If you use paraffin wax, make sure you do so in a well ventilated room or outside.

, Then, spread out the clothing you are going to waterproof on your work surface.

, To make the wax easier to apply, you can put it in a sunny spot to soften it or place it close to a heat source, such as a radiator, heater, or stove.


The wax does not need to melt, but only become a bit soft.
You can also warm up the clothes to make it easier to apply the wax. Heat them up by throwing them in the dryer for a quick cycle, by using a hair dryer or by ironing them.

, You want to be sure the entire surface of the clothing is covered evenly in wax so make sure you get wax on areas around buttons, zippers, and the edges of the clothing.You can also use your fingers to apply the wax and get it on any hard to reach areas.

, The wax can leave an unpleasant odor, so to make the wax evaporate faster, you can put the clothes in the freezer overnight.

Purchase a waterproof spray.,
Prepare your indoor work area by laying down old newspaper and clothing.,
Wash and dry the clothing and then spread it on your work area.,
Start by spraying the inner surface of the clothing.,
Spray the rest of the clothing.",How to Waterproof Clothes3," There are several types of waterproof sprays available, so choose one that is designed for clothes that are not waterproof.Most of these sprays are made with a base of silicon or fluoropolymer., It is best to apply the spray in a room. Factors like wind can make it hard to control the spray if you are working outside.

, Do this to avoid making sturdy stains on the clothing when you apply the spray.

, This way, you can see how it will affect the fabric. If it does not cause a lot of discoloration, continue to spray the entire inner surface of the clothing.

, Hold the spray 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) from the clothing and try to spray it evenly.

"
"
Gather your materials.,
Prepare your work area by laying down old newspapers.,
Dissolve 2 cups of laundry detergent in 8 liters (2.1 US gal) of warm water.,
Soak the clothes in this solution until they are completely and evenly wet.,
Make a solution of 1 cup of alum and 8 liters (2.1 US gal) of warm water.,
Soak the clothes in this solution for several hours or overnight.,
Test the waterproofed clothing after using any of these methods.",How to Waterproof Clothes4," You will need standard laundry detergent and aluminum potassium sulfate, or alum.You can purchase alum at your local grocery store or online., You can use this method indoors or outdoors.

, Stir it until all of the detergent dissolves.

, Then, remove them and let them air dry completely.

, Stir this solution until the alum dissolves completely.

, Remove them from the solution the next day and let them air dry.


The clothes should be immersed in a solution of alum in water at a ratio of 1:10 (1 part alum to 10 parts water). The alum causes a chemical reaction to occur on the clothing, resulting in a deposit of alum on the fibers of the clothing (coating the individual fibers within the yarn), and waterproofing it., To do this, simply wet the clothes. If you notice the appearance of beads of water on the clothing, this means that clothes do not absorb water and are waterproof.If there are any dark stains on the clothing, the fabric has absorbed the water and the clothes are not waterproof. If this occurs, repeat your chosen waterproofing method or try a different method.

Run the mascara wand under hot water.,
Don't pump the mascara wand.,
Add saline solution or eyedrops to your mascara when it starts to dry out.",How to Get the Most Out of Your Mascara1," Keep it under the water until the wand is clean. Then, dip the wet mascara wand back in the tube, rubbing it against the inside walls of the tube. The heat will soften the product in the tube and and your mascara will apply good as new! Plus, you'll have a clean wand!;
, It will let air into the tube and the mascara formula will dry out. Instead, twist it in and out.

, Add 4-5 drops of the solution. Insert your wand and stir; this can be repeated 2-3 times until your mascara is gone.

"
"
Clean the wand before trying any alternative uses.,
Use it to keep baby hairs or sideburns or your hairline in place.,
Use it to keep your brows in place.,
Use it to create a subtle brow tint.,
Use it as a lash conditioner.,
Use it to separate your lashes.,
Use it as a replacement wand.",How to Get the Most Out of Your Mascara2," The steps below give you a lot of different ways to use your mascara wand in your beauty routine, but none of them will work if your wand is still clumped with mascara. Use an eye makeup remover to clean it, first.

, Just apply hairspray on the brush end and use it to comb out the tiny hairs.

, Apply hairspray on the brush end (don't over-apply, otherwise your brows may feel stiff depending on the hairspray you use) and comb your brows the way you want them to stay.

, This works great for those with fine/light coloured brows (but anyone can do it), or those who want to add only a little bit of colour to their brows. Roll the wand through a matte eyeshadow colour that flatters your brows until the bristles are coated, and lightly brush the wand through your brows. You may experience a bit of eyeshadow fall out, and so you might want to do this before foundation (if you use it).

, Look for a bottle of Unrefined/Cold Pressed Castor Oil. Pour a little castor oil in a travel container and dip a clean mascara wand into the oil. Lightly sweep it across your brows and eyelashes. You will notice quicker growth and stronger lashes and brows overtime.

, A brow comb may work wonders for separating clumpy lashes, a clean wand works just as well.  When using a clean brush, it disturbs your mascara less while helping to separate clumps and picking up excess mascara (then if you were to use a brow comb).

, Do you have any other mascaras where you just hate the wand it came with? Save your favourite wands, and when the mascara runs out, use the wand in another mascara for better results."

Exfoliate with a toothbrush.,
Make a lip scrub.,
Moisturize.,
Completely remove make-up at night.,
Wear lip balm with SPF.,
Quit smoking.,
Stay hydrated.,
Avoid licking your lips.",How to Get Pink Lips1," One of the best ways to get naturally pink lips is to regularly exfoliate your lips with a toothbrush.


All you need to do is dampen a soft-bristled toothbrush and gently rub your lips using small circular motions.
This sloughs off dead skin and stimulates blood flow to the lips, making them soft and pink.
;
, An alternative method of exfoliating your lips is to use a homemade sugar scrub.


Simply combine two tablespoons of coarse white or brown sugar with one teaspoon of honey and one tablespoon of organic coconut oil.
Apply a little of this to the lips and gently rub in for 30 seconds to a minute before rinsing with warm water., Frequent and intense moisturization is key when it comes to getting soft, pink lips. Use your favorite hydrating lip balm during the day and slather on a layer of petroleum jelly at night.


This is particularly important during periods of very hot or cold weather, as these conditions cause lips to become dried out and flaky.
If you prefer more natural moisturizers, try applying cocoa butter, coconut oil or even olive oil to your lips.


, Leaving lip make-up on overnight can cause lips to become dried out and even discolored.


Make sure to remove lipstick and lip liner with an effective make-up remover or cleanser before bed. No excuses.
If you run out of make-up remover, a little olive or almond oil on a cotton ball will effectively remove any lipstick or liner.

, Sun damage can dry out lips and cause them to become burned or discolored. To avoid this, you should always wear a lip balm with an SPF to protect your lips in sunny conditions, such as at the beach or on ski holidays.

, The tobacco in cigarettes can stain lips, turning them dull and dark. Therefore, one surefire way to improve the appearance of your lips is to stop smoking. This can be difficult, but your lips (and lungs) will thank you for it.

, In addition to moisturizing your lips on the outside, you should make an effort to hydrate them from within.


You can do this by drinking plenty of water everyday, somewhere between 6 and 8 glasses.
Also try to eat fruit with a high water content, such as melon, tomato and cucumber.

, Although your natural reaction may be to lick dry lips in order to moisten them, this can actually cause lips to become even more dry. As a result, you should avoid licking your lips whenever possible - try carrying around a small lip balm instead, so you can moisturize your lips whenever they feel dry.

For some freebies, you may need to schedule a makeover or visit during a certain time, so just check to see what promotions local department stores are running at their makeup counters., You will probably encounter some high pressure sales people, but resist the urge to ignore them. Be polite and friendly. Smile at them and listen to their sales pitches. Nod occasionally to acknowledge that you understand what they are saying., After you have listened to some sales pitches, let the salesperson know that you are really interested in some of the products he or she has shown you, but that you would like to try them out a bit more before you decide if you want to buy them or not. Then, ask if they could give you a sample.Try saying something like this: “Thanks for telling me about these products. I am really interested in some of them, but I’d like to try them out a bit more before I decide if I want to buy them. Could I please have a small sample of the products you showed me?”

, Most of the time, the salesperson will say yes and give you some samples. But if he or she says no, simply thank them and move on. Don't get angry or discouraged, just try to get samples from a different makeup counter instead."

",How to Get Pink Lips at Home," Before you can add color to your lips, it's a good idea to get rid of dry skin that tends to build up there. A layer of dry skin can cause your lips to look dull and unhealthy. You can make your own lip scrub using ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen cabinets. Use the scrub to massage your lips, then rinse away the dead skin. Try mixing the following ingredients to make a scrub:1 teaspoon sugar (brown or white)
1 teaspoon honey or aloe
1 teaspoon lemon juice;
, If your lips are too dry for a scrub to do the trick, using your toothbrush to exfoliate your lips is another great option. Simply wet your toothbrush and scrub your lips using a circular motion. The dead skin will get scrubbed away to reveal the fresh, pink skin underneath.

, Store-bought lip serums contain certain ingredients that cause your lips to look plump and healthy. You can replicate these effects using household ingredients that stimulate circulation in your lips. Try rubbing one of the following serums on your lips:


1 teaspoon of coconut oil mixed with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon of coconut oil mixed with 1/8 teaspoon cayenne powder (careful, it might sting a little)
1 teaspoon of coconut oil mixed with 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract

, Using a moisturizer conditions your lips and keeps them from getting dry and flaky again. Use a good lip balm or make your own moisturizer by spreading some coconut oil, almond oil or olive oil on your lips. Let the moisturizer absorb into your lips before you use a a lip stain., This natural method for adding a subtle pink color is easy and delicious. Cut open a strawberry, raspberry, cherry, or another fruit with bright red juice. Rub it over your lips and let the juice absorb and dry. Keep adding layers until you're happy with the color, then seal the stain using clear lip balm.


For a more precise application, try squeezing the fruit juice into a cup. Dip a cotton ball or cotton swab into the juice, then apply it to your lips.
If you want a deeper, richer color, you can reduce the juice to concentrate the red pigment. Squeeze the fruit juice into a small saucepan, and heat it over medium heat so that it begins to simmer. Cook the juice until it's reduced to a thick syrup. Let the syrup cool before applying it to your lips.

, Beets have a beautiful red color that creates a bright pink hue when applied as a stain. Cut a fresh red beet into slices. Rub a slice over your lips and let the beet juice dry. Continue adding layers of beet stain until you're happy with the shade of pink you've produced. Seal in the color with a layer of clear lip balm., Kool-Aid drink mix is made with food dyes that can linger on the skin for hours. To use Kool-Aid as a stain, just open a packet of the red powder, dip your finger in it, and rub it on your lips. The more you use, the darker pink your lips will be.


For a more precise application, wet a cotton swab, dip it into the powder and apply it to your lips.
You can also mix the Kool-Aid with petroleum jelly to create a glossy finish., If you enjoyed popsicles as a kid, you probably already know that cherry and strawberry flavored frozen treats make the perfect pink lip stain. Open up a popsicle and eat the entire thing, periodically rubbing your lips with the tip to make sure they get a dose of food coloring with every bite. By the time you're finished with the popsicle, your lips will be bright pink. Seal the look with clear lip balm.

, Pink-tinted lip balm conditions your lips and makes them beautifully pink at the same time. You can easily make your own using one of the following formulas:


1 teaspoon clear lip balm mixed with 1/2 teaspoon dried beetroot powder
1 teaspoon clear lip balm mixed with 1/2 teaspoon red lipstick
1 teaspoon coconut oil, 1/4 teaspoon beeswax and 1/2 teaspoon dried beetroot powder (melt the ingredients together, pour into a container, and let harden before use)

, The sun darkens and dries out the skin, and your lips are no exception. Make sure you protect your lips from the sun all year round to keep them looking healthy and pink. Use a lip balm that contains SPF 15 or higher to prevent your lips from getting darker.

, Do your lips tend to get dry and chapped? This is often caused by dehydration. If you aren't drinking enough water and other healthy liquids, your lips are often the first place it shows. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day to avoid getting chapped lips.


Whenever possible, switch out coffee, soda and other drinks for pure water.
Avoid salty foods and alcohol, which dehydrate the body.

, Winter wreaks havoc on the lips, causing them to get dry, chapped and even cracked. To maintain good lip health throughout the winter, exfoliate often using a homemade scrub or a toothbrush. Keep your lips moisturized with a good lip balm or coconut oil, too.


If your lips seem to get chapped no matter what you do, you may want to try sleeping with a humidifier. Humidifiers add moisture to the air, which can really help your skin when the air is at its driest in the winter months.
Don't be tempted to pick your lips during the winter; that'll just make things worse, and you may even end up with bloody lips. Instead, exfoliate and condition your lips often to keep large skin flakes from forming.

, Cigarette smoke causes lips to get darker, thinner and more wrinkled over time. If you want pink, healthy, supple lips, now's the time to quit smoking.,"

Use pomegranate seeds.,
Make a paste from turmeric and milk.,
Use beetroot juice.,
Make a raspberry lip mask.,
Try crushed rose petals.,
Apply mustard oil to the belly button.",How to Get Pink Lips2," One popular home remedy for lightening dark lips and giving them a rosy pink color is as follows:


Crush up the seeds of a pomegranate, mix the crushed seeds with some cold milk cream to form a paste, then apply this paste to the lips.
This should be repeated several times a week to gradually increase the pinkness of your lips.


, A paste made from a teaspoon of turmeric powder (a popular Indian spice) and a drop of cold milk is believed to remove lip discoloration, leaving lips looking healthy and pink.


Simply apply the paste to the lips and leave to sit for five minutes before rinsing off with warm water.
Do this every day for a week and you should notice a significant difference., Beetroot juice acts as a natural lip stain which will temporarily turn your lips a bright cherry red.


Some people also claim that beetroot juice helps to gradually lighten dark lips, when applied on a regular basis.
You can use beetroot juice from fresh or pickled beetroot - as long as you don't mind the taste.


, You can make a hydrating mask that turns your lips pink by mixing two crushed fresh raspberries with a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of aloe vera gel.


Apply this mask to your lips and leave to sit for five minutes before rinsing with warm water.
Follow with an application of lip balm., Crushed rose petals will give your lips a naturally rosy color! Simply rub the freshly crushed petals (from red or pink roses) onto your lips for a pretty pink flush.

, This may seem somewhat bizarre, but one ancient home remedy holds that a little mustard oil placed in the belly button at nighttime will result in naturally soft, pink lips. Can't hurt to try!"

Stash makeup remover wipes on your bedside table.",How to Fix Your Makeup if You Fell Asleep with It on," After waking up, you may notice your face looks slick and shiny, especially in the t-zone area (forehead, nose and chin). Before you fix your makeup, it’s important to get rid of it. Applying a fresh coat of makeup on top of it can lead to clogged pores, damaged skin and serious breakouts. Blotting papers can quickly and easily soak up the oil, and best of all, they will leave your makeup intact.Press the blotting paper firmly against your skin and you’ll see the paper soaking up the grease. If you are prone to oily skin, you may need to use two or three blotting papers to get rid of the oil.
Blotting papers can be purchased at any drugstore. Look for them on the skin care aisle and keep a packet in your makeup bag.;
, Whether you tossed and turned in your sleep or experienced watery eyes when you woke up, chances are your mascara is now smudged. Inspect your eye area for any black smudges. Use a pre-moistened makeup remover wipe to gently blot your skin and remove the smudges. Be gentle. The skin around your eyes is fragile and can become irritated from vigorous wiping.


Only blot where you see smudges. Do not wipe your lashes or remove your mascara completely unless it has been smeared beyond repair.
If your lashes are stuck together or if most of your mascara is now on your skin, you will probably need to remove it completely.

, Upon waking, your lips are probably going to be dry. If you were wearing lipstick when you fell asleep, it has likely soaked into the dry skin on your lips or stained the area around your mouth. You can take care of this easily by using a fresh makeup remover wipe to dab around your lips. Take care to get in the corners of your mouth and remove any last traces of lipstick from the skin around your mouth.If your lips feel particularly dry, follow up with a layer of lip balm.

, These specialty products can refresh the way both your skin and makeup appear. They plump up the skin with hydration, which creates a dewy surface. As a result, your complexion looks more luminous and your makeup becomes moistened and refreshed.After you spray it on, use a damp makeup applicator sponge or beauty blender to pat any areas that look streaky or blotchy. This will blend the makeup back into your skin evenly., Take a good look at what’s left of your makeup so that you know what you need to fix. Check your foundation first. Is it smeared or streaky at all? If so, run a makeup applicator sponge or beauty blender under warm water, then wring it out so that it’s damp but not wet. Pat at the streaky areas on your face gently with the sponge to blend the makeup back into your skin.


The warmth and dampness of the sponge help smooth the foundation out., After blending away streaks, your foundation should look fairly even. However, you may need to touch up a few areas that require more coverage. Pick up a very small amount of BB cream or lightweight foundation with the damp sponge, and then lightly pat it onto your skin. Use the sponge to blend the new makeup into what you already have on your face.Even if you feel tempted, avoid reapplying foundation all over your face because the results may look very obvious and unnatural.
Stick to sheer layers of coverage only in the places where you need it.

, Most of your blush is probably gone from your cheeks at this point. Refresh it with your favorite blush product. Use a light touch – you can always add more blush, if you need to, but once you apply too much, it's harder to fix. Start slowly and brush it onto the apples of your cheeks. Blend the blush outward very subtly along your cheekbones.


Consider using a cream blush. Cream blush is very sheer, whereas powdered blush may look cakey when applied on top of BB creams and liquid foundations., Refresh your eyes by adding one very light coat of your usual mascara to your top and bottom lashes. Be sure to wipe excess mascara off the wand before you start putting it on your lashes. Since you already have mascara on, adding more on top of it can easily result in clumping if you’re not careful. Resist the urge to apply more than one coat., Since you just woke up, your complexion – especially around the eye area – may appear a little dull. This is normal! Your usual glow will kick in once you start moving around, but help it along by dusting a light layer of highlighter right above your cheekbones. Aim for the area between your eyes and cheekbones. This will help to brighten up your face and eyes a bit.

, Since you’ve already cleaned your mouth with the makeup wipe, you have a fresh canvas to work with. Apply your favorite lipstick as you normally would.Adding a clear gloss over the color will add a little sparkle to your face and make you look less tired.


If you aren’t a lipstick person, applying clear gloss to your lips is still a great idea because it will brighten up your natural lip color.

, Don’t wear the same face of makeup for longer than 18 consecutive hours.The next day, take a day off from applying makeup, if possible. Your skin is going to need a break after wearing a double layer of makeup the day before. You can avoid major breakouts and other skin issues if you skip makeup the next day and let your pores breathe.

, If you are in the habit of falling asleep with your makeup on, your skin may start to show the effects. Your complexion may start to look dull because your dead skin cells aren’t being washed away often enough. This can also make your skin look older and emphasize wrinkles. If you already have acne, it may worsen over time. You also run the risk of getting a skin infection or rash.Strive to always wash your face before sleeping to avoid dealing with these unpleasant problems.

, Even if you’re incredibly tired and already in bed with a face full of makeup on, keeping these wipes on your nightstand will make it easy for you to reach over and grab them. Wiping your makeup off in bed shouldn’t take the place of regularly cleansing your face at the sink, but in a pinch, this technique can help you avoid many of the negative effects associated with sleeping in your makeup."

Just rock your look!",How to Get Dark Makeup Without Over Doing It," No matter what skin you have, a good foundation will cover up any flaws, and foundations with moisturizer are a must because they cover up and don't show dry skin. Apply a little on the tip of your nose, forehead, and both cheeks. Blend until it looks like your natural skin colour. If you already have rosy cheeks(like I do ;]) then don't apply blush. If you don't have naturally rosy cheeks, apply a blush color that compliments your color. Dark skin, try one with yellow or orange tints. Light brown skinned, try tints of yellow and red. Light to pale skin, try a foundation with yellow and peachy undertones and tints.;
, If you don't already have makeup at home, go ahead to your nearest drugstore or mall and pick out some cool shadows, liners, mascaras, lip stuff, and hair accessories.


If you have blue eyes, try a green shadow. Brown or green eyes, try dark purples and plums or orange-y reds.

, Eye and lip liners come in so many colors and types! It may feel overwhelming at first, but most stores will let you sample certain products. Eye liner for a ""dark"" look can range from black to very dark red or purple. Lip liner should be ONE shade darker than you lip color. (it may be best to do this AFTER applying lip gloss, stain, or stick.) Also, if you want a dark eye, avoid a dark lip and vice versa. Read on...

, Apply a light shade to your top lid with a small brush or stick. Then apply a smokey gray to the crease.(the crease color will depend on the color of the lid shade) Then, apply your liner. Liner should only be applied to the bottom lid. A thin line from the outer corner of the eye to the inside stopping a cm. before the inside corner will do fine! Avoid putting too much shadow under the bottom lid, but this is optional if you do.

, If you already feel you have applied a dark and smokey eye look, you should consider skipping this step. If your eye makeup is dark without looking vampire-ish, continue. Drug stores especially, have a HUGE variety of great lip products. Ranging from neutrals to pales to plums to neons, it is important to find some lip stuff that not only compliments you face, but the makeup you've got on at present.

, In other words, a gloss that matches the color of you natural lips. If you have applied a slightly dark eye, try a rosy color such as fuchsia, coral, or pink with red tones. If you want a more emphasized lip, try using a subtle lipstick OR liner (not both) then applying a light or neutral lip gloss over that. If you have applied a light eye or a subtly dark eye, you are free to experiment with almost any lip color you choose! Try a plum, a dark red with gold undertones, or go au-naturale with a neutral, pale/frosty pink, or peachy.

, If you feel like you look silly, you probably do! But this CAN be fixed. Just use a good makeup remover and try again! Once you are all set, you can add some accessories to your hair such as cute/glittery clips and clips that match the color of your lips. Have fun with this and make sure you like what you've done. Again, any mistakes are fixable, but practice before going all out.

, Smokey eyes, killer lips and airbrushed-looking skin will blow your friends away! Don't be afraid now to narrow your eyes at an enemy, or grin flirtatiously at your crush. Just let your creativity and new look shine!!!!!

Make your desired purchases.,
Apply a cleanser.A good cleanser will effectively get rid of bacteria that has made its way into your skin.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Use a skin toner.,
Repeat your cleansing ritual twice daily for a week.",How to Get Clear Skin in 1 Week1," If you're looking for the most effective way to get clearer skin in a pinch, it's best to look first at storebought options. Although you may feel desperate enough to lunge for the most expensive option, they aren't often significantly better than an inexpensive, over-the-counter alternative. For your weekly goal, you're going to want:


A decent cleanser.
A chemical-based exfoliant.
An astringent or alcohol-free toner (depending on your skin.);
, Although an impending deadline may have you heading to the dermatologist for a high-end cleanser, you may find a supermarket cleanser works just as well. Squirt a bit of the cleanser onto your hands and rub your face with it for around a minute. Using small, circular movements to get it around will ensure the cleanser is spread evenly. Rinse your face with warm water after the cleanser's been distributed.










If you don't have a cleanser at hand, an anti-bacterial soap may suffice as an alternative.

, While a cleanser intends to wash out trapped bacteria, the purpose of an exfoliator is to scrub away dead skin particles, leaving your face much smoother than before. This step should come after you have used a cleanser; that way, the cells you want to scrub away will be vulnerable. There are a few ways you can go about this:










Getting a physical exfoliator like a scrub or loofah can be an effective trick you can work into your daily shower. Massage your face with it once your facial pores have been opened. This is actually quite a satisfying technique, as your face will feel noticeably smoother afterwards.
Chemical exfoliators contain alpha and beta hydroxy acids, and are generally preferred by dermatologists due to the fact that they're designed to affect the skin on a deeper level than a loofah.Rubbing your face gently in a small, circular motion for a few minutes should be enough to let the exfoliator do its work. Although they are referred to as chemically-based, chemical exfoliators are most often made with natural ingredients like sugar. However, though you may find chemical exfoliators to be a quicker fix than their mechanical and DIY counterparts, they run the risk of agitating sensitive skin, and tend to be the most expensive route of the three listed. Nonetheless; a chemical exfoliator should result into at least a slightly pronounced radiance after one use, and if you're looking for a quick fix to have better skin fast, this option may do just the trick.

, Toners are used to further cleanse the skin and minimize the visibility to pores. A good toner will help to restore your skin's natural pH balance, and should be used following your cleanser and exfoliator. Toner may be applied lightly with a cotton swab. Again, like the prior steps, there are several ways you can go about getting a skin toner:










If you have oily skin, using an astringent toner will help to remove the excess oil, keeping your skin in clean order. Astringents often have alcohol and salicylic acid among their ingredients, and may be found at a supermarket or drug store.
On the contrary, alcohol-free toners are available to those with dry skin; use of astringents runs the risk of drying out your skin if you're already lacking for proper oils. If you're unsure which toner is right for you, it may be helpful to check in with a dermatologist to get a second opinion.

, If you're looking to get visibly clearer skin in a week, carry out the cleansing ritual twice every day; once in the morning, and a second time at night before bed. Not only will this virtually double the amount of cleansing in the given week, this will also keep any progress from being lost during sleep.



Keep your face clean and moisturized throughout the day. This includes keeping your hands away from your face. Touching your face will transfer oil and bacteria, potentially resulting in new pimples and blemishes.
If it's hot outside, be sure to wear a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15.

Apply bronzer.,
Use golden eye shadow.,
Choose a nude lipstick.,
Get highlights.",How to Get a Sunkissed Look1," Bronzer is a fast and easy way to achieve the sun-kissed look. You can buy bronzer at a cosmetics store, like Sephora, or at many supermarkets. Choose a bronzer that works well with your skin tone. For warm skin tones, most of the golden brown shades of bronzer will work. For paler skin tones, look for peach tones of bronzer. To apply, use a makeup brush and lightly apply the bronzer to the apples of your cheeks, hairlines, bridge of your nose, and the tip of your chin.Ask a makeup consultant at the cosmetic store for advice on picking the right bronzer.
Do not use too much bronzer at once or the appearance will look overdone and false.;
, Use eye shadow with your bronzer to add to the sun-kissed look. A golden eye shadow is ideal. Apply it to your eyelids, inner corners, and under the eye. Complete the look with black eyeliner and mascara for a more dramatic appearance.You can also use a yellow, orange, or coral eye shadow.
Use white eyeliner instead of black eyeliner if you want a unique look.

, Choose a nude shade of lipstick to complete your makeup. Use a lighter or darker shade of nude, depending on your skin tone. Apply a clear lipstick to add a dewy look. If you want a more dramatic look, choose a bold red or berry color.Coral is another nice, summery shade of lipstick.

, Adding highlights to your hair is another easy way to look sun-kissed. Blonde highlights are a common choice, but blonde may not look good if your hair is very dark. Choose a color that is a few shades lighter than your current hair color. You can buy a kit to do the highlights yourself at home, but it is better to get your hair done by a professional.You can also use lightening sprays and lemon juice to add highlights to your hair.

Wash your face with hot water each morning.,
Make a sugar-based scrub exfoliator.,
Make and use a lemon-based toner.,
Finish your cleanse by rubbing an ice cube on your face.,
Repeat the above steps twice every day for a week.,
Give your skin regular attention in the long-term.",How to Get Clear Skin in 1 Week2," You may want to try one of the simplest DIY remedies before resorting to storebought creams, particularly if money is a concern. Washing your face is a remarkably effective way to clear up your skin. If you have dirt and bacteria in your skin, hot water will open your pores, making it easier to clean the gunk out. Using a gently soaked face towel should do the trick. The water should be hot, but not so hot that it's painful to apply to your face.









, Chances are, you already have everything you need to make a sugar-based exfoliator at home! First, mix two tablespoons of sugar into 2 tablespoons of water. Once fully mixed, add another tablespoon of sugar and stir again. Drain out some of the excess water from your sugar mixture. Following that, splash some water on your face, and rub the mixture on each cheek in a circular motion for one minute each.









, If you're the DIY type, you can approximate a good toner at home with a lemon. Get about ten drops of lemon juice on your hands after you wash your face. Smear the drops on your face, and wipe away after a few seconds. This should attend to the dirt particles your cleanser may have missed. Make sure to keep the lemon juice away from your eyes. The resulting irritation may be painful if applied carelessly. Apple cider vinegar is a great alternative toner if you don't want to use lemon juice.









, This will comprise the end of your 'ritual'. This will close your facial pores again and keep dirt and bacteria from getting in, thus keeping your skin clear. Think of this step like patching up an airlock; now that you've opened up your skin and cleared out the muck, you'll want to close your pores back up again so your progress isn't undone.



If ice cubes aren't available, a splash of cold water across the face should do, although it won't likely be as effective as the method above.

, By making a bi-daily routine of this process, you're effectively doubling the amount of progress you can make in getting clearer skin, than if you were just doing it once in the morning. Making sure that your skin is well-tended before going to sleep is just as important as the morning.


, By the end of a week, even if your skin has not cleared up entirely, you should still have seen a noticeable improvement in the clarity of your skin. Although you won't need to repeat the cleansing ritual as often now that your skin is looking better, if you have a predisposition for acne, it's recommended you take the time to repeat it at least once a week for maintenance's sake. Although if you want you can keep doing it as normal, just to be safe.

Choose the right self-tanner for your skin.,
Exfoliate.,
Apply the self-tanner.,
Apply lightly around the wrists, ankles, and joints.,
Wait for the tanner to dry.,
Get a spray tan.",How to Get a Sunkissed Look2," There are plenty of self-tanning products on the market. Before choosing a brand, look up reviews of products. Some self-tanners are more likely to be streaky and unnatural in color than others. When choosing a product, you should also look at the skin tones the tanner is recommended for. If your skin is pale, don’t choose a shade that is meant for medium to dark skin tones. Choosing the wrong shade makes it more likely that the self-tanner will turn your skin orange.Self-tanners can be bought at cosmetic stores and most supermarkets that have a cosmetic section.

, Exfoliating your skin makes the self-tanner appear more even and smooth on your skin once it has dried. Use a wash cloth or exfoliating product. Exfoliate every part of your body. Spend more time exfoliating the parts where the skin is thickest, like the elbows, knees, and ankles.If you have used an exfoliating product, make sure it has been washed off completely. Dry your skin with a clean towel.

, It is best to use gloves during the application process. You can purchase gloves made specifically for self-tanner, but plastic or latex gloves will work. Apply the self-tanner in sections. For example, start with the arms, then legs, and then the torso. Rub the tanner in with circular motions.If you don’t use gloves, make sure to wash your hands after every section.

, These parts of your body or more likely to hold the color and turn out streaky. You don’t have to use extra tanner for your wrists and ankles. You can just extend what product you’ve used on your legs and arms. For your joints, use very little lotion or use a towel to apply the tanner.Have someone help you apply the self-tanner to your back and other areas that are difficult to reach.

, Wait at least ten minutes for the self-tanner to dry. If after ten minutes any party of your body doesn’t feel dry, wait for up to an hour. After, that wear light and loose clothing for the next day. Avoid wearing white. Try to avoid sweating or swimming. The self-tanner usually lasts for about a week.Reapply the tanner lightly if it becomes streaky in some areas.

, If you are not satisfied with the self-tanner, you can opt for a spray tan. You can also choose to get a spray tan instead of applying self-tanner. With spray tans, a fine mist is sprayed on your body that makes your skin appear tan. Spray tans are performed by professionals with a spray gun, or applied in a booth. You can make an appointment at your local tanning salon.Spray tans typically last three to seven days.

Remove your makeup every night.,
Apply SPF daily.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Get a Sunkissed Look3," If you wear makeup, it is important to remove it before going to bed. Removing makeup gives your skin time to breathe. Failing to remove it can clog your pores, which causes acne and blackheads. Use a cotton pad and makeup remover, or apply a small amount of olive oil to your face to remove dirt and makeup., It is important to apply SPF even when you aren’t tanning. UVA and UVB rays can cause skin damage even with minimal sun exposure. Apply sunscreen even on cold or cloudy days. SPF 15 is the minimum, but it is better to buy a sunscreen of at least SPF 30. Rub it on your face and any other exposed skin.Look for a sunscreen with a label that says “nonacnegenic” and “noncomedogenic” to prevent pore clogging.

, An unhealthy diet consisting of a lot of junk food can dull your skin and cause acne. Make sure to drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Eat fruits and vegetables daily. Consume foods rich in vitamin C to promote glowing skin. You should also consider a low sugar and fat diet.Bland foods like rice and oatmeal are better for your skin than spicy and fermented foods, like fried food and salt.

, Exercise at least three times a week. If you can exercise more, at least thirty minutes a day is ideal. Running, jogging, and yoga promote blood circulation and can accelerate your body’s cleansing process."

Consider the pros and cons of tanning.,
Prepare your skin.,
Use a suntan oil.,
Tan early in the day.,
Tan for one or two hours.,
Apply moisturizer.",How to Get a Sunkissed Look4," Tanning outside or in a tanning bed can help you achieve a sun-kissed glow, but it is not the healthiest option. Tanning causes skin damage, which can speed up the process of aging and cause skin cancer. Doctors do not recommend tanning, and you should only do it if you are fully aware of the dangers. If you do decide to tan, make sure to prepare your skin, use sunscreen, moisturize, and take every precaution possible to minimize damage.Consult with your doctor to learn more about the dangers of tanning.

, Exfoliate and moisturize your skin before tanning. You should exfoliate because the sun only tans the top layer of skin, and it is best to start with a fresh layer of skin that won’t flake off quickly. To exfoliate, you can use a loofah, exfoliating creams, or a body scrub. Once you have exfoliated, moisturize with a hypoallergenic moisturizer to soothe the skin and prevent flaking.Exfoliate twice a week.
Moisturize everyday.

, Oil will help the tanning process. You can use suntan oil that has sunscreen in it, or apply sunscreen after the suntan oil has settled. Use a liberal amount of oil all over your body. Rub it in using circular motions. If your oil doesn’t have sunscreen in it, wait ten minutes before applying sunscreen.Reapply the sunscreen every thirty minutes you are out in the sun.
Use at least SPF 15.

, The sun’s rays are strongest during the hours or 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. So, your chances of an overall tan are higher. If you don’t want to tan when the sun is harshest, tan in the early morning or late afternoon. Use a reflective blanket to maximize your tan. If you don’t want to maximize your tan, wear a hat and sunglasses and lie on a white towel.If it is not sunny and warm in your area, it is an option to use a tanning bed. This, however, is not advised. You increase your risk of skin damage and skin cancer with a tanning bed.

, Tanning for longer than one or two hours increases your risk of sunburn. Start by lying on your back for twenty minutes and then switch onto your stomach. After that, you can choose to stop tanning or repeat the process.Sunburn doesn’t appear until about two hours after sun exposure. Don’t stay out in the sun longer just because your skin doesn’t appear immediately darker.

, Repeat the exfoliation and moisturizing product directly after you tan. This will prevent flaking and dehydration of the skin that can happen after a tanning session. You should also apply aloe to your skin if you see signs of a sunburn."

When possible, save older pieces. Changing your look doesn’t require you to throw everything from the past out. Hold on to any pieces that can fit into your new look.;
, You may find that doing a complete overhaul of your closest can appear to be a financially daunting task. However, it doesn’t have to be. Look at this transition as you would any other household expense and allot funds to it. Don’t try to purchase all new clothing at once. That will not only be expensive, but also stressful.


Be realistic and only buy what you can afford. This does not mean buy a lot of cheap items. You are always better placed to own a few good quality items rather than a quantity of poor ones. Save up for good items if you can't afford them now.
Buy in bulk. Instead of sporadically spaced shopping trips, shop regularly to spread out your expenses over time.
Thrift for new items. Thrifting is always a great way for you to find new options without having to be forced to skip a meal or two. Thrifting is not always the easiest option but learning how to pick great locations and having some patience can go a long way. Don’t assume that “expensive” clothing means better clothing. It’s not the price but how well you put the pieces together that determines the true value of your new look. Pair old favorites with new pieces. This can go a long way to enhancing your look, while maintaining your budget. , Taking items that you already have, build onto your look. Before purchasing, set a goal of what you would like your look to be. Use your goal as a guide during your journey.


Keep your lifestyle needs in mind. Things like work, school, social life, etc; should all be considered in your new wardrobe. Look for your wardrobe to not be only fashionable but stylish. Fashion is about following trends. Style on the other hand is all about how you present yourself to the world. Fashion rises and wanes, while your personal style lasts forever. So, refrain from only purchasing trendy looks. Find looks that display who you are., Buying neutral colors will allow you to easily pair/mix and match your new pieces. After you have the basics you can add more color options to your wardrobe later.Get more use out of your clothing with neutral colors.
Buy pieces that are: black, brown, white, cream, gray, and navy blue. Use these items as base pieces to the rest of your outfit. , Accessories and clothing are equally important when it comes to your new wardrobe. Accessories will provide you a great way to mix and match outfits. Accessories also can help transition clothing from one occasion to the next. Look at accessories as another way to further define your own personal style.


Each accessory chosen should add value to your outfit. If you can remove the accessory and not feel like your outfit has lost anything, then you can probably do without it. You should also look for pieces that are versatile.
Men should remember that accessories are just as important for them as they are for women. You should still keep in mind that each piece should have a purpose and enhance your look.
Less is more. While it may appear cool to don all of the accessories that you own at once, you will see you have the greatest affect with a simpler look. Give each piece a chance to shine on its own and appreciate what does for your look.

, It never hurt anyone to have someone to look up to. While you shouldn’t try to replicate that person’s style, you can definitely use them as a source of inspiration for your own wardrobe. , Your hair is a clear symbol of your personality and individuality. Letting go of your usual hairstyle is often the first step to making other changes in your life. Let the color, length, and style speak for you and the person that you have become.

, Hairstyles are all about shape and geometry. So, naturally you should consider the shape of your face when determining your new hairstyle. The hairstyle should enhance your best attributes, while averting attention from those that you are less proud of. Face shape generally falls into one of these categories: Oval, round, square, oblong, heart, triangular, and diamond. Determining which category you belong to will help you pick a style that suits you most. You can determine your face shape by simply studying your features in a mirror.

, With your knowledge and their expertise you should be able to find the hairstyle that best suits you. A skilled stylist will be able to create a hairstyle that best suits you.


Ask questions like, “‘Would bangs suit me?” or, ”How would my hair look short/a different color. Is my hair too thin for this look?’
Also, ask questions regarding what to expect when your hairstyle begins to grow out and what could be done to if you decide you don’t like the new hairstyle after all.
Discuss upkeep and hairstyle maintenance with your hairstylist. Ask yourself how much time you are willing to spend tending to your hair each day. Some styles may require more attention than others.

, Knowing your hair texture will allow you to choose an appropriate hairstyle as well as how you should care for it. Knowing your hair texture will ultimately help you determine the style that suits you best by allowing you to consider some styles and eliminate others. Hair texture can be straight, curly, or wavy. Which hair texture best defines you will help you choose the best looking hairstyle.

Take a shower at least once a day, before you go to bed. You should take a shower in the morning too, if you have enough time. Use a body lotion/shower gel.

Brush your teeth three times a day, after each meal. Also use dental floss to remove food stuck between your teeth.

Always use deodorant.

Make sure all the clothes you wear are clean and ironed. Even an awesome piece of clothing can look horrible if it's not clean and ironed; not to mention it won't last too long if you don't take care of it properly, no matter how well-made it is.

Comb or brush your hair to avoid the messy look. Avoid brushing your hair if it's curly.

Follow a proper morning routine. Do these things on a regular basis; they are the basics of looking good. Of course, to look glamorous, you'll need to do a little more than this, but it will be ruined, no matter how expensive your clothes are or how good your makeup is.;
, The way your hair looks is crucial for your image as a whole. In order to achieve great hair, follow the advice below.



Keep your hair clean all the time. For oily hair, you should wash it every 1 to 2 days. If you have dry hair, you don't need to wash it that often; only every 2 or 3 days. Use the right type of shampoo for your hair. This is absolutely necessary to prevent dandruff and damaging of your scalp.

Make sure your hair always looks perfect. The only hairstyles that look glamorous are the perfectly styled ones. Rebellious hair not allowed. It can be straight, wavy, or curly, as long as it's shiny and perfectly tamed. Get rid of the frizz by using a straightening iron and/or a smoothing serum or, even better, try straightening it permanently (of course, only if you want straight hair for a longer time). Choose either sleek, stylish, straight hairstyles or romantic, wavy, '40s style wavy hair. For shine, apply a shining spray.

Choose the best color for your hair. If you decide to dye your hair, make sure you do it once a month or every 2 months, otherwise your roots will grow, contrasting with the color of the rest of your hair; and that's not glamorous. The most glamorous colors are rich, intense, bright ones: platinum blonde, golden blonde, light brown, golden brown, dark brown, black. Basically, any more saturated versions of natural hair colors are good. Try picking a color that enhances your skin color. If your skin is rather light or white, platinum blonde and dark brown or black will look good on you (""cold"" colors suit light skin). If your skin tone is light to medium, you will look the best in shades of brown, golden blonde or dark blonde; actually any natural, warm color. If your skin is medium to dark, the lightest shade you may choose is medium brown; any lighter color will create an unpleasant contrast with your skin.

, Your face and body need special care to look great. These are the essential steps for having healthy, clear, soft skin.



Keep it free of acne and wrinkles as much as you can. Also, avoid getting red spots on your skin (from allergies, stress or harsh attempts to remove zits). Remove blackheads too. You can do it at home or, more easily, by going to a salon and having it done professionally (it takes much more time and effort to do this at home, and the results are different) Also don't worry if your skin not perfectly clear, most people have some form of acne.

Invest in good quality skincare products. Some good brands are Vichy, The Body Shop and L'Oreal. But if you afford it, go for top brands like Estee Lauder, Chanel and Dior. The products are more expensive, and the amounts smaller, but they do their job better so a little goes a long way. Do some research and figure out what works for you.

Buy a cleanser, a toner and a moisturizer, for they are the basics of skincare. Be sure to exfoliate often, but not to often for smooth, glowing skin. You can go further and use additional products like face masks, for instance.

Try to get rid of cellulite. Some say that it's almost impossible, but that depends on your age and lifestyle. A person who is young and practices sports on a regular basis is much more likely to eliminate cellulite than an older person who doesn't work out. Try some good anti-cellulite creams. You should ask your doctor which are the best, because most of them have absolutely no effects; picking a good anti-cellulite cream is very difficult and you can waste a ton of money if you don't know which to buy from the very beginning. Massage helps as well. If you eventually end up cellulite-free, prevent it from reappearing by eating less saturated fats, quitting smoking, wearing comfortable clothing and being more active.

Combat stretch marks. Maybe you can't remove them completely, but you can diminish them to the extent that they become barely noticeable, even from close up. They usually fade in time. Again don't worry too much about this step, just remember to keep confident in you.

Don't forget to shave your legs and armpits .

Remember to use a body moisturizer too; not only your face needs moisturizing, but your body too.

Avoid excessive tanning. Not only is it bad for your health and increases the chance of getting skin cancer, but it's also somewhat tacky. Avoid excessive exposure to sun, especially in summer, and use lotions with high SPF at the beach, however, if you still decide to go for a tan, at least use a self-tanner, instead of sunbathing (it's healthier).

, Brush your teeth after each meal to avoid having bad breath. If your teeth are not naturally white, go to a dentist to have done a professional whitening; if your teeth are white, keep them that way by avoiding smoking, sodas, and excessive coffee. It's very possible that your teeth are not exactly straight; the dentist will choose the best option for you. (Keep in mind that a gap can be stylish and sexy.)

, Don't bite them, or let them grow too long. Don't let them get dirty- there's nothing worse than black filth under nails. Remember that your toes have to look good, too - especially if sandals are your favorite type of shoe.

, Many women who wear makeup on a regular basis actually know nothing about it; so read further to find out what are the do's and don'ts of makeup. Find a style that works for you wether that is a natural look, full glam or none at all!



A important makeup rule: never go to bed without removing your makeup first. It will clog your pores and possibly make you break out over time.

Start with a slightly shimmery makeup base. Don't use extremely matte foundation, unless your skin is very oily.

Do not cake on glitter. It's not glamorous, it's just flashy and tacky. Glamour is all about being mature, and putting on tons of glitter will make you look like a 15-year-old Barbie girl. However, if you really love sparkly makeup, at least try not to make it very noticeable.

Keep it natural: use colors like pink, beige, brown and (for mascara and eyeliner only) black.

Don't focus on both your lips and your eyes at the same time. If your lips are bright red, keep your eyes natural and apply just a little mascara. If your eyes are 'smokey', use a nude lipstick. Even better yet, don't put too much accent on a certain feature, if it's not an elegant, evening makeup.

Use a creamy lipstick for a natural effect. Glosses are for teenagers, especially light pink, glittery glosses. Lipstick works better for adult women. However, if you go for glosses, at least buy an expensive one, and make sure it's not too sticky. One tip: apply lipstick with a special makeup brush. It looks more natural that way and you tend to apply less.

For lips, go for a shade close to your natural lip color. It's more natural that way. However, if you choose a bright or dark color, keep your eyes free of eyeliner and colorful eyeshadow. Take care with that bright red lipstick. Don't wear red lipstick if your hair is golden blonde and your eyes are blue or green; too many bright colors will clash.

Keep the blush barely noticeable. Blush is a type of makeup whose purpose is to complement your facial features, not to catch your eye. To choose the right color, think of the color your cheeks have when it's very cold outside or after you've run a mile; that's the color that will look the best on you.

Wear natural makeup during daytime: enhance the shape of your lips with a light pink lipliner, use nude, creamy, a bit shiny lipstick, put on some pink blush, a bit of mascara and some shiny light pink eyeshadow on the center of your eyelids. Or the same makeup, with your eyes carefully contoured with black eyeliner, instead of the light pink eyeshadow. On this model, you can think of other ways to apply makeup, keeping it natural at the same time.

Choose the right texture. Your makeup has to be light, shiny, smooth and a bit sparkly- not too much though; see the warning above.

Despite what this article says just remember to be you and whatever makes you confident will look best on you.: You can rock any style you want and you can be glamorous.

, Perfume is, perhaps, the most personal type of cosmetic, because it says a lot about your personality. As a general rule, wear fresh fragrances during summer and ""sweet"" ones during winter. You can go for something classic, like Chanel No.5, or you can choose any other fragrance from top brands. The coolest option is to make your own perfume- that way it's 100% you. Look in a perfumery for vials containing different essences and buy the ones you like the most.

Avoid dressing too fancy at inappropriate times.,
Put on some jewels.,
Learn to shop correctly.,
Know what clothes look good on you.,
Learn to make combinations of colours.,
Invest is some good quality shoes.,
Buy a few bags that go with most of your outfits.,
Show off your new glamour style!",How to Get a Glamorous Style2," They're probably the factor that determine whether you're glamorous... or not. Go for classic cuts and models, which show the line of your body. Once again, invest in something of exceptional quality. The fabrics should be soft and smooth, like silk, jersey, and cashmere. Glamour style is, above all, elegant and sophisticated. Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe are good sources of inspiration. Avoid clothes that look too old, sporty, or messy. It is very important that you choose the image you wish to portray; there are many ways to look glamorous, and each one of them has its specific elements you must follow in order to portray that image. Here are some of them:



Old Hollywood glamour- think Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren. Its attributes are red lips, platinum blonde hair, diamonds, fur and '40s dressing style. Hair is very important; old Hollywood hairstyles are short-to-medium length, wavy and dyed blonde or black. As for makeup, wear red lipstick and use black mascara. Wear medium-length dresses and skirts, diamond earrings and fur coats.

Urban chic glamour- think Audrey Hepburn. Sleek lines, straight hair, and elegant, simple design- it's the favorite look of the wealthy New York women. To get this look, wear trench coats, black tights, stiletto heels, little black dresses, business suits and simple, delicate jewelry. The most used colors are the neutral ones: black, white, and beige; however, bright colors are welcome too, but in smaller amounts. Oversized sunglasses are a must. Wear precious fabrics like silk, cashmere and jersey; the fabrics must be as high quality as you can find. Avoid wearing jeans. Accessorize with huge handbags, fine jewelry and watches. As for makeup and hairstyle, long hair and the classic bob style are definitely the most acceptable; the makeup is very natural.

Opulent diva glamour- the more expensive and rich-looking it is, the better. Everything is allowed here: excessive jewelry, glitter, feathers, heavy makeup- as long as it's not (too) tacky, it's acceptable. To get the look, wear glittery dresses, fur, diamonds, opulent gowns for evening, metallic colors, high heels, animal prints, gold and precious gems. The predominant color is gold. Be careful not to look too tacky, though.

, You can dress casually and look glamorous at the same time. You don't have to wear a long dress every time you go out - you don't want to look like you're going to the Oscar ceremonies when you're just taking your dog out for a walk... A pair of black skinny jeans, high heels and a silk top are sometimes enough to make you look elegant. If all your clothes are good quality and have a somewhat special design or colour, you will never look ""too"" casual.

, Jewelry gives a sparkly touch to everything you wear. During daytime, it must be something that doesn't attract too much attention, but completes your outfit - for example, a necklace with a little gem, or a small bracelet. But for the evening, feel free to put on diamonds, pearls or precious gems and metals. Not too much though - excessive jewelry only looks good at Bollywood. And if you choose one type of jewelry - for instance, a pearl necklace - don't wear another type at the same outfit. For the pearl necklace you will have to choose pearl earrings. For a diamond necklace - diamond earrings. For a golden necklace - no silver bracelets, only gold. You get the idea?

, The key to having a fabulous wardrobe is to know how to shop. Especially if you’re one of those women who view shopping more as a hobby than as a process you have to master in order to make the right fashion decisions, follow these steps:


The first thing you have to do when you enter the store is to ""scan"" the general outlook of the clothes and find out what type of store it is. There are three criteria you must analyze to categorize the store: the range of prices, the age of the targeted consumers, and the fashion style of the clothes it sells. Your first concern should be the quality of the clothes; if it’s not high enough-regardless of the design of the clothes-, leave the place without second thoughts.
Go to the first rack of clothes that catches your eye. Start examining the fabrics; are they fabric too rough, too shiny or too easy to crease? Do the buttons look like they could fall in any moment? Does it smell funny? If the answer to all of these questions is “yes”, then don’t buy it.
Look at the design. Do you think it would flatter your body type? Does it have details that add much volume on one part of your body? Is it wearable? Does its color flatter your skin color?
Look at the price label. Do you think it’s worth the money? Would you wear it often, so the price per wear will be lower?
The ultimate test: try it on. Do you find it easy to dress (meaning the zipper isn’t broken, and the collar is large enough for your head to pass through it effortlessly)? Does it flatter your sizes? Does it fit you (it doesn’t look too tight or too large on you)? If the answers are all “yes”, then the item is probably worth it.

, Unless you have exactly the same proportions as the mannequins in the shop windows, not all clothes look perfect on you; even supermodels have different body types.


Hourglass-shaped girls have the most desirable body type; their balanced proportions and small waist are very resourceful in creating sexy curves. All they have to do is to enhance their waist and keep the balance between breasts and hips. Try wearing a thick belt straight over the narrowest point of your waist.
Pear-shaped girls have small shoulders and breasts, medium-sized midsection area, wide hips and heavy legs. The biggest challenge for them is to create the illusion of wider shoulders and smaller hips. Wear large neck-openings (large in width, not depth) and stay away from skinny pants and long tops that reach to the middle of your hips.
Apple-shaped girls have average shoulders and breasts, fat belly, not much of a waist and average hips and legs. They must create the illusion of a defined waist and enhance their shoulders and hips. Try wearing jackets that make your shoulders appear wider, high-waisted tops and classic jeans.

, As you gain more experience in what fashion is concerned, you will see what colours look good together... and what colours don't. Here are some examples of decent, neutral combinations of colours: cream and brown, black and white, gray/silver and white, gray and pastels. More daring color combinations are: black and either purple, red, yellow, blue, green, hot pink, light pink, gold, silver; purple and white, yellow and blue (sky blue especially), dark blue and gold/cream, white and gold, purple and gray, gold and gray, green and gray, red and silver/gray. Don't put more than two colors (that match) and two non-colors (black, white, gray) in one outfit.

, Shoes are the biggest fashion fetish of many women. Buy at least the absolutely necessary shoes: 1 pair of classic, black shoes, 1 pair of sandals, 1 pair of flat boots for bad weather, 1 pair of elegant boots, 1 pair of flat shoes, 1 pair of sport shoes. Continue your ""shoe collection"" with a few pairs in different colours and one in a metallic colour. Look for classic shapes; as for details, search for lace, crystals or buckles; they're timeless and add a bit of uniqueness to the shoe. Make sure you buy quality shoes, even they're a bit more expensive; finer quality lasts longer and, therefore, you won't have to buy another pair of shoes next month because the old one is already damaged. In a way, you actually save money by buying more expensive shoes. The heels must be as high as you are comfortable with. If you really like a pair of shoes with 12 centimeter (4.7 in) heels, but you never wear heels taller than 8 centimeter (3.1 in), you may buy it, but only wear it in places where you don't have to walk much.

, Look for a black leather bag with metallic details/white bag with golden details, or one in a metallic colour; they scream ""glamour"". Again, look for quality; cheap, fake leather will never look good quality and expensive. Avoid the shiny plastic; it looks cheap.

, Go out there and make yourself noticed. You deserve a little prize for all this effort. Don't forget to flaunt your own individual style too! Enjoy it, girl!

Even out your skin tone.,
Use concealer as a highlighter and foundation.,
Keep your eyebrow line natural.,
Do light eye makeup.,
Brighten up your cheeks and lips.",How to Do Your Makeup when You Are Running Late1," Instead of focusing on fancy concealing or contouring, aim to even out your skin tone. Use something simple like moisturizer or BB cream. This will prevent you from having to prep and then apply foundation. Dab on your cream or moisturizer in discolored areas and rub it into your skin. This should leave your skin more or less even.Make sure to pick a moisturizer or BB cream that matches your natural skin tone.;
, You can skip applying highlighter and foundation by just opting for highlighter. Apply the highlighter on areas you want to smooth out or cover up, such as the bridge of your nose and under your eyes. Then, use a large makeup brush to blend the concealer into the rest of your face. Add a few dabs where you would normally apply foundation. Even without an underlying layer of foundation, your skin will look smoother and blemish-free.Use circular motions to work the makeup into your face.

, If you do your eyebrows, do not do anything fancy when you're running late. Instead of drawing an angle or arch on your brows, stick to filling in gaps following the natural line of your brows.If you prefer lighter brows, add a light layer of brow mascara after filling in gaps. However, this step is optional.

, If you're running late, skip the eye shadow. Add a thin layer of eyeliner on your upper and lower lash line. Avoid filling in your water line, as this will slow you down. A light layer of eyeliner will define your eyes. Finish up with one or two coats of mascara., Finish up with a light layer of blush on your cheeks. Then, apply a light gel or cream on your lips that contains a bright color. A layer of lip gel or balm is easier to apply in a rush than lipstick. This will lighten up your face and save you time applying lipstick and lipliner."

",How to Do Your Makeup Successfully in the Morning," This clears your skin of any grime or dirt that could possibly be built up underneath your skin.;
, Your skin color is unique! When going shopping for foundation there are different types of foundation basically being powder and liquid. A good foundation should not wear off during the day, and should match your skin color!

, You can skip this step if you have clear skin. But if you have a pimple or two, a good concealer can cover it up! But, it has to match your skin tone! Otherwise, it will look very weird.

, This is when it gets complicated. Based on your skin tone blushes can differ from an apricot color, to a peach color. Your blush is vital! Once you find the right one, you're set!

, This locks in your blush, foundation, and concealer. It is amazing stuff!

, This is where it gets fun! Depending on what look you're going for, the eyeshadow varies. If you're going for a neutral look, go with browns or coppers. If you want to wow people, go with a little bit of sparkles! It's all fun!

, The eyeliner can go below the eye or above, not on the actual lower waterline! This can look very trashy! Eyeliner comes in different forms such as pencil, gel (which comes in a paint pot), or as a liquid (which comes in a container similar to nail polish with a brush). If you are going to use gel eyeliner, you will need a brush, an eyeliner brush preferably. But I also sometimes use a smudge brush for that artistic effect.

, This is a tricky step. Don't fret about the bottom lashes. If you extend the top lash and blink lightly after applying, it will do the bottom lash for you!

, This can either make or break the look. Only go with a bold lip if you know what you're doing! Otherwise it's tragic. Neutral glosses look really sophisticated if you have a bold eye.

, Sometimes add some clunky necklaces or a funky bracelets; they look good. Look for natural look accessories, like semiprecious stones, seashells, wood beads, and leather. Plastics and acrylic pieces do not communicate ""natural"" very well.

, Smile a lot and know you can achieve anything. A smile is a welcoming, warm, and friendly expression that doesn't cost anything, and expresses much.

, Simple hairstyles, whether a straight cut, moderate curls, a ponytail, or whatever is natural for your ethnic background will obviously contribute to a natural appearance.

, Even if you live near a beach, a deep tan will look somewhat contrived in the middle of winter, and spending hours in a tanning booth can cost a fortune, as well as your time.

It seems every article regarding personal appearance and style suggests attention to hygiene, and in the bright light of day, choosing a natural look means being conscientious about your cleanliness and health.






Brush and floss your teeth thoroughly and often, and have your teeth cleaned at least annually.






Keep your nails cleaned and trimmed neatly, as well.







, If you choose to polish your fingernails and toenails, use subdued tones with a medium or low gloss finish.

, Having a heavy makeup which does not completely cover freckles or other skin features may actually draw attention to the item you are trying to hide. Many people seem to be self conscious about moles, freckles, and other ""blemishes"", but many successful fashion models and celebrities actually are recognised by these same distinct features.

Cover smudges with concealer.,
Use mascara as eyeliner.,
Contour with a wide brush.,
De-clump mascara with a toothbrush.",How to Do Your Makeup when You Are Running Late2," It's easy to slip up and smudge your makeup when you're running late. Instead of removing smudged lipstick, mascara, or eyeliner, dab on some concealer and work it into your skin. This will cover smudges more quickly than redoing your makeup., Eyeliner can take a considerable amount of time to apply. When applying mascara, wiggle the mascara brush against your eyelid. This should leave you with a line running above your lash line. In a pinch, this helps you avoid taking extra time to apply eyeliner.After you're done applying mascara, you can use an angled brush to smooth out your line.

, Instead of contouring in two steps, cut the process down to a single step by using a wide brush. Swipe a wide brush over dark and light contour powder. Then, swipe your brush alone your cheekbones. This will create the dark and light contour tones in one sweep rather than two.This works best if you have a two-toned contour palette. You can also use two different tones of foundation.

, Mascara clumps easily when applied fast. If your mascara ends up clumped, take out a clean toothbrush. Run it through your eyelashes to de-clump mascara, leaving you with spaced out eyelashes.Only use an unused toothbrush. Getting bacteria in your eyes from a used toothbrush is dangerous.

Stay alert so you know when the bus or subway will come to a halt, as this can cause makeup to smear.If possible, do your eyes before hopping on the train or subway. Eye makeup takes precision and it can be difficult to apply in a moving vehicle.

, Consider splurging on a cab so you'll have more personal space to do your makeup on the go. Stay alert regarding traffic and be aware of when your driver will speed up or slow down. Keep your primary focus on your skin and lips. If possible, do your eyes before leaving.If you don't have a mirror, you can use a phone in selfie mode.

, Make sure to respect people's space when doing your makeup in public. When on the train, look for a spot that's relatively empty. Be aware of your elbows as you do your makeup. Avoid accidentally elbowing a fellow passenger., If you don't get a chance to do your eyes before leaving, opt for pencil eyeliner when applying makeup on the go. Liquid eyeliner does not grant you as much control. If you need to apply some eyeliner in the car, go a pencil. Opt for a thicker one, as these provide more control., A clear lip liner helps control the spread of lipsticks and lip glosses.

Try to go for hairstyles that give more width to your face, like an updo or a side swept look. Be sure not to wear a hairstyle that covers you up though, such as extra heavy bangs.
If you have a square face, you will want to use your hairstyle to give the illusion of length to your face. Choose a hairstyle that is slightly longer than your chin. Avoid styles that fall at your chin or slightly above. Also, avoid bangs that are cut straight across the forehead, as this will emphasize your squareness. Shaping and softening the edges around this type of face is very flattering. Choppy layers and lots of texture help soften the sharp angles. Curls/Wavy styles also work to add femininity to your stronger jawline.
People with round faces should also seek to lengthen their face. Hairstyles should be longer than your chin, as styles that fall at your chin or slightly above will make you look heavier. Avoid any circular style, such as tapering around the face or bangs that are rounded. If you have short hair, ask your hairdresser to give you a layer cut. Also, styles which give hair the illusion of barely touching your shoulders work great, too.
A heart-shaped face benefits from a style that provides balance between the wideness of the forehead and the narrow chin. Therefore, seek out a style that makes the forehead appear smaller or makes your chin appear fuller. Bangs are helpful, especially if you have a high forehead, but should not be squarely cut across the face. Shaping along the face near the chin, or wearing a style that is layered and thick at the bottom, will provide fullness where it is needed. Avoid straight, thin styles, which cling to the face, as these will accentuate your narrow jawline. A middle parting emphasizes the pointy chin, so try a side part.;
, Pale skin suits all hair colors. Avoid shades of red or golden blonde if your skin is pink. Stick to ash tones to neutralize your coloring. Avoid yellow, gold or orange tones if your skin is yellow. Stick to deep reds. Olive & Dark skin suit darker hair colors.

, The best way to choose hair products that are right for you is to shop according to your hair type. For example, if you have oily hair, then you will want to look for products that say that they are designed for oily hair. If you have dry hair, then you should buy hair products that are designed for dry hair. No matter what type of hair you have, it is a good idea to buy for your hair type if you want the most effective results. It's also a good idea to visit the salon every once in a while to help keep your tresses in tip-top condition.

, When it comes to skin, that's your whole body! So we start taking good care of it today.


One thing that's often recommended is to drink plenty of water! Water helps to flush out toxins and give skin a clear look. Also, try to up the veggie intake! Fruits and veggies are the golden rule to beautiful, glowing skin.
Make sure to remove your makeup every night before you go to bed. Your skin needs to breathe at night and if you sleep with your makeup on frequently, you will get many pimples. Do exfoliate once a week. Exfoliating gets rid of dead skin cells on the surface of your skin, and can even get rid of some blackheads and whiteheads. By exfoliating weekly, your skin will always look healthy and soft.
Always moisturize before you go to bed and in the morning; this gives your skin a soft and smooth feel at the start of the day.
Exercise! Exercising daily helps your skin clear up and take in more oxygen-vital for keeping it healthy for life! A good reason to break out the jogging shoes, right?

, This is very important. Apply sunscreen (at least SPF 30) 20-30 minutes before you leave every time you leave your house! Remember, lighter skin tones burn easier than dark skin tones. So decide how much you need. A rough idea of how much you should use is that it takes the size of a big coin to cover up your face and neck and two tablespoons worth to cover your whole body.

, Makeup is supposed to enhance your face, not cover it. To be honest, that's exactly what many people do. You should try a good concealer on uneven spots or lighty over acne. You can easily cover red spots with eye drops made for red eyes. It works!

, You want to choose a color that will complement and enhance your eye color while not overpowering your eyes. The best place to begin is with neutral shades. Neutral tones compliment almost every skin tone, and provide an excellent palate to create highlights to focus on the color of your eyes. Here are the types of colors you would want based on eye color: Green eyes: earth tones (almost any brown, taupes, ivory, chocolate), gold, bronze, copper, plums, pink and purple. Blue eyes: metallics (gold, copper and bronze), taupe, mauve, and purple. Do not use greenish blues or aqua, as these will compete with your eye color. Brown eyes: pinks, peach, corals, golds, green, blue, plum, brown, champagne and purple. Most colors go well with brown eyes.

, 4 steps to beautiful cheeks that are flattering for every skin tone/type are as follows:


Step 1. Use a PEACH cream/mousse color on the apples of your cheeks (peach is the most flattering color for any skin tone), and start from about the pupil of your eye, back to your hairline. Top that with a PEACH powder blush. Layering the two products will make the color last longer!
Step 2. Contour the sides of the face and the hollows of the cheeks with a matte bronzer or darker face powder that is 2-3 shades darker than your skin tone. Remember that you want to create the illusion that the apples of your cheeks are casting a shadow, and you just slightly want to intensify that effect. This will, not only slim down your face, but create that ""healthy glow"" look.
Step 3. Highlight your cheekbones first with a cream highlighter, then with a mineralized pearly highlighter (again, this is just make the effect last longer). You want to put on just enough so that the light catches the shimmer and creates a soft glow and lifted look to the cheeks, but not so much that your makeup starts to look cakey.
Step 4. Take a big kabuki brush and blend all 3 colors for a flawless finish!

, If you think you have too bushy eyebrows, too thin or whatever it is, these steps can help you. Buy an eyebrow brush; it will help you shape your eyebrows. If you can tolerate the pain and have a little money, then go get your eyebrows professionally waxed but if you absolutely cannot do this, then follow these tips. The biggest mistake people make is to tweeze too much. Avoid over plucking as it can take months for brows to grow back. Here's a simple trick to remember: The space between your brows should be equal to, or a little wider than, your eyes. The best brows have a slight arch. Cleanse your skin. Exfoliating with a gentle scrub helps prep the area as well. Worried about pain? Expert aestheticians suggest applying to the brow Anbesol, Orajel or any teething gel for babies. Brush brows up and out. You want both the bottoms and tops to be smooth. So be careful, but tweeze the top AND the bottom.

, The most flattering lip tones will be one or two shades darker than your natural lip color, according to makeup artist Bobbi Brown. To test shades, apply lipstick or gloss to one lip. If that color is just a shade or two deeper than your bare lip, then you have found your shade. But make sure before you apply anything to the lips, you use either Chapstick or Vaseline on your lips so they look good and feel moisturized.

, Decide what type of eyeliner you need. A classic pencil creates a soft line and is easy to work with. A gel or liquid eyeliner creates instant drama but requires precision and patience. A smudge proof, self-sharpening eyeliner that glides well over the lid is probably the easiest to use and is easy to find. Use white eyeliner or a soft metallic silver or gold to make your eyes look bigger and more open with any eyeliner color or by itself with black mascara. Apply the white eyeliner under the lower lid or on the interior upper and lower corner of the lid close to the lashline. Blend it with your finger or a brush into the lid for a more subtle effect. Choose an eyeliner that complements your eye color. Browns and plums compliment brown eyes, taupe, and deep green compliment green eyes, sandy taupes and deep browns make blue eyes sparkle and if you have hazel eyes, pick the color you'd like to bring out and buy an eyeliner in the same hue or choose black to bring out all the colors at once.

, Regular exercise is an important part of staying healthy. One thing most girls are concerned with is their butt! So, if you think you don't have a shapely butt here how to get one: Target your Gluteus Maximus: If you have a little butt-flab, you have to lose body fat to get rid of it. The quickest way to do that is with cardio exercise, weight training and a healthy diet. You should weight train at least 3 times a week. When you're weight training, make sure you do exercises that work your butt muscles (glutes). These exercises are hip extensions, leg presses, lunges, and squats. You should do three sets of 10 repetitions with each exercise. Eat the right foods, including: fruits, lean fish, lean meats, nuts, whole grain breads, pasta and vegetables.

, When you don't get enough rest, the body cannot repair itself, circulation is cut down and the skin receives less oxygen and nourishment. As a result, your skin may look dull and sallow, acne/zits can flare up, and dark circles can appear under your eyes. Suggestion: get your beauty sleep. But try to stay on your regular sleep schedule! Try taking naps on weekends, but don't make them 4 hours long! This can wreck your sleep hours, so you might not wake up properly for work or school! So basically, don't oversleep!

, How do you feel when you open the closet door and peek inside at the clothes hanging in front of you? Are you overwhelmed because all you see are various ill-fitting blouses, frumpy pants and outdated dresses with the tag still on? If you don’t absolutely love most of the things in your closet, it’s time to update your look. Next time you’re out shopping with your friends flipping through the latest Cosmo or watching a stylish TV show, take note of the outfits you like. Get a feel for your personal style and make a note when you see an outfit that you would absolutely LOVE to wear. Once you have a good idea of the look you want to create (e.g., classic, glamorous, artsy, sporty, etc.) you can start shopping for items that reflect your new style.

, There are very noticeable trends in belts, jewelry, bags and purses, so if you haven’t updated these pieces in a while, chances are they’re out of date. The good news is, because accessories are generally less expensive and updating them is an inexpensive way to breathe new life into your entire look.

, Shoes can make or break your look, so make sure these are updated! This can and elongates your body and gives your entire style a more feminine, elegant feel. While you’re at it, toss a new pair of bright red heels into the mix to make your little black dresses pop.

",How to Do Your Eyebrows," In order to style your eyebrows, you must clean them as part of a normal face-cleansing routine. Before you attempt to pluck or ""do"" your eyebrows as part of your make-up routine, wash your face. Wet a small towel in warm water and rub it gently on your eyebrows. Don't rub too hard or you will pull out some hair follicles.






;
, The inner corner of your brows should be in line with the sides of your nose. You can use a long pencil, your make-up brush, or some other object to measure this.









Line up the straight edge against the outside of your nostril and inside of your eye. Where the straight edge is, your eyebrow should begin. Mark this location with the brow pencil. Do this on both brows.
Look straight ahead and line up the straight edge with the outside of your nose and your pupil to determine where your arch should be. Mark this location.
Line up the straight edge with the outside of your nose and the outer edge of your eye to determine where your brow should end, and mark this spot.

, Some people prefer to pick a shape based on their general face shape, rather than attempting to measure for a mathematical ideal. Depending on the size and shape of your face, you may try any of the following designs:


Oval: Soft angled eyebrow shape
Heart: Rounded eyebrow shape
Long: Flat eyebrow shape
Round: High arched eyebrow shape
Square: Angled or curved eyebrow shape
Diamond: Curved or rounded eyebrow shape

, Pluck any hairs that you find outside of your ideal brow line. Find the root of the hair with the prongs of the tweezers and pull quickly in the opposite direction of the hair growth to remove the hairs completely.









Always pluck from the bottom of your brow because if you pluck on top then that will set you up for a lifetime of stray forehead hair.
Be very careful to avoid over-plucking. You can always pluck a few extra, but if you take it too far you'll look severe and bare up top.

, Pluck a few of the hairs on the top and/or bottom as you prefer, to reach your desired shape. Brush your entire brows up and pluck any hairs that lie below your brow line. You can pluck your brows to the width you desire, but alternate working on them so they are more even and make sure to step back to see how it looks in the mirror.








, It's a lot easier to care for your brows if you do this regularly, instead of all at once. Pluck the stray hairs that may grow back and trim your brows regularly to keep them tamed, then brush your hairs along their natural ""grain"" so they fall comfortably. Regularly brushing brows upwards and outwards can help them grow in that direction.

, Apply some gentle facial wax below your eyebrow, just coating the stray hairs you are not happy with. Leave the wax for 30 seconds to make it go a bit tacky so it won't run or smudge into other eyebrow hairs you want to keep.









Carefully apply the wax strip over your eye and leave it for at least 30 seconds to let it set. Pull outwards firmly to remove the hairs and repeat on the other eye.
Apply warm water to remove any left over wax, then apply cold water and moisturiser to soothe the skin.

, To thread, you will need a thin piece of sewing type thread. Take a long piece and tie the ends together. Wrap it around the index and middle finger, revolve your hands three times so you now have two circles. Manipulate the string using these two fingers and your thumb.


Hold the string up to your eyebrow, as you make one circle larger and the other smaller, that middle part that is wound will grab hairs that is passes and remove them. Be very careful and practice slowly to get the hang of it.
It's easy to slide the thread quickly and tear out a lot of hair, and do so in the wrong direction. Use the thread to keep ""brushing"" the brow while you work, just swiping in an up-and-out direction. Use a moisturizing face wash afterwards to care for your skin.

, Keep your eyebrows 1-2 shades lighter than your hair if you have dark hair such as black or brown, and 1-2 shades darker for blonde/ or light hair.


For colored hair, if you don't want to dye your eyebrows, use either black, or invest in a high quality eyeshadow and pencil combo in your color. Use a pigmented white cream and a spoolie to neutralize your darker hair color. It may take a few coats. Powder with transparent or translucent powder, and then apply your new color.

, Eye shadow will make the color of your brows less noticeable, yet if not a good brand can easily wear off. Eye shadow can also help keep your eyebrows looking more natural and less edgy, however.









Get a small brush preferably an edged brush to fill in your eyebrows. Don't go out of your eyebrow shape, you are just trying to darken it so work on darkening from the thickest part to the thinnest. Definitely work in the color at thinner spots, but not too much.
If you want to just make your eyebrows become a bit darker, you should use an eye shadow the same color as your eyebrows, and if you can't figure that out go with your natural hair color.

, Choose an eyeliner one shade darker or the same shade at your roots to achieve this look. Make sure to stay within the shape of your eyebrows and not to draw outside of it.









If you want an edgy punk type look you can use liner to outline your eyebrows then color it in darkly. Be careful when doing so! If you do that you may appear to have no eyebrows and you just colored it in.

, Brow gel is the go-to product you're going to need to make eyebrows look more natural and set the makeup in. Some gels come in clear, light blonde, dark blonde or brown. If you don't have any brow gel, you can use petroleum jelly, a clean mascara brush and hairspray or make-up setting spray to ""set"" your eyebrows in place.









Just dip a Q-Tip into the gel or Vaseline and gently smooth it onto your brows, giving a slightly glossy look. This helps to keep the color on your brows longer.

, Make sure to remove all the makeup from your eyebrows, as the skin underneath can become flakey and irritated if left with caked on products. Also, when you moisturize don't skip around the eyebrows, lightly apply some of your moisturizer in the eyebrow area to keep the skin underneath happy.

Change your hair.,
Wear glasses and sunglasses.,
Make friends with make-up.,
Change your size and posture.",How to Disguise Yourself1," Getting a drastic haircut is the quickest way to look completely different. If you want to disguise yourself, though, you're going to want to pick something that won't draw attention--a blue mohawk or a pink costume wig probably aren't the best choices.


Men can style their hair differently by using products like hair spray or gel to create a more elaborate ""do"" than usual, or could shave their head completely. Also consider a dye-job, or using cheap talcum powder to make some gray streaks that will really throw people. If you have facial hair, shave it into a different shape or get rid of it completely. If you don't, consider growing a beard or a sneaky mustache.
Women can consider getting a realistic-looking wig or extensions to change the basic shape of their hair. You can also quickly go back to your ""old"" style that way, if you want to for further disguises. Keep them guessing by changing frequently and without warning. Dye your hair a different color each week and ensure that you'll never be noticed. Try combinations of highlight patterns and full dye jobs.;
, It worked for Clark Kent. By adding some frames to your wardrobe, you'll pass the ""glance test."" People will recognize you when they look closely, sure, but you'll be able to get past their initial screen. By adding glasses or sunglasses, you'll round out a disguise.


If you have contacts, consider trying color-change contacts, or digging out those old frames you no longer wear.

, For a dramatic effect, paint moles, beauty marks, wrinkles or other imperfections on your face. Lighten or darken your skin to further confuse people. Get a spray-on tan or a conspicuous fake tattoo.


If you're a guy, or even if you just don't normally wear make-up, a little can go a long way in changing your appearance. Just adding some eyeliner and changing your clothes can give you a whole different aura.

, Try changing your height with heeled shoes, or by slouching more and carrying yourself differently than usual. Consider losing or gaining weight, if you have the time to do so, or simply begin dressing as if you had. Pad your clothes with extra layers to look as if you've put on a few pounds.

Set SMART goals.,
Write up a plan of action.,
Set up a reward system.,
See your doctor.",How to Do a Full Body Makeover1," SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely.For example, if you want to lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) to look good in your summer clothing, aim to lose about 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week. Losing 10 pounds (4.5 kg) is specific. The weekly target is measurable. Because it’s a small target, it’s one that you can realistically attain. You’ve made it relevant with a reason for losing weight and timely by setting a deadline.;
, Make a note of what you need to do in order to reach each goal. For example, in order to meet your weekly weight-loss target, you’ll need to figure out how many calories you need to burn each day based on your height and current weight.If you want to improve your smile, make an appointment with your dentist for a checkup, improved hygiene tips, and a treatment plan, if necessary.

, Every time you meet a goal on your makeover list, treat yourself to something nice. For example, after you’ve lost your first 1 pound (0.45 kg), you might take a few hours of “me” time to watch your favorite movie. After 5 pounds (2.3 kg), maybe a shopping trip is in order. This positive reinforcement will make you less likely to lose interest in your game plan., Do this before starting a workout or changing your diet. Talk to them about your goals. Bring a copy of your action plan so they can look over it and let you know if you need to change anything. You could even ask if they can refer you to a personal trainer if you need that extra shot of motivation."

Not your ideal weight? Doesn't matter. Crooked nose? Adorable. Acne? No one cares. Hair? Amazing. Society spends way too much time telling people that we're not good enough, when fact is? You are always good enough. The rest of this article is just tips on how to feel more confident and learning how to rock your completely awesome unique style!;
, The trick is finding clothes that express how you feel, while still managing to be comfortable and confident! It's different for everyone, and some people don't even have one specific 'style' they can claim as theirs. But if there are certain types of clothes, colors, or brands that make you feel amazing when wearing, then own it! There's no pressure to keep up with the fashion trends or what people in Hollywood are wearing! What's most important is your opinion and how you feel!

, Sometimes its hard to feel confident wearing certain clothes because of societal pressures, and sometimes we get stuck in ruts where we don't particularly like our clothes, but feel like that's what we have to keep wearing. You can try breaking out of that by trying on different clothing, just to see what you might end up loving! Going to your favorite clothing shop and just trying on different colors, shapes, and brands might end up with you finding a certain kind of clothing you had never considered before, but end up really liking!

, Our bodies do not dictate what sort of clothes we wear, and no matter if you're tall or short, large or thin, somewhere in between, all types of clothes can look amazing on you. It all depends on finding clothes that actually fit your body! Don't buy clothes with the idea in mind you will grow into them, or lose the weight to fit in a smaller size. Buy for your body as is, and take the time to find clothing that works for you! Some people only wear certain brands of jeans, or prefer a particular cut of shirt. Everyone has their preferences, and its worth it to take the time to find yours!

, Your wardrobe should be fun but functional, and allow for variability! It's good to have clothes on hand for adventures outside, comfy clothes for a rainy day, as well as an outfit for a day out on the town! Buying staple pieces like colored tees or tank-tops can be great as they're usually fairly cheap, and can be worn in many different ways. A tank-top can be layered under a cardigan, or topped with a scarf, or just left over sweatpants for a day inside. Leggings can function as a stylish piece under a nice dress, or just be comfy when worn with a big sweater. With clothes that can be made to suit several different outfits, its much easier on your budget! Things like jewelry, scarves, jackets, pins and hair-styles can make a big difference as well in how a certain article of clothing looks, and give you an extra opportunity to express your individuality!

, Adding a frill of lace to the bottom of a skirt or stitching patches onto a pair of shorts can make clothes look completely new, for far far cheaper! It also helps to know some simple stitching for when a piece of clothing ends up with a rip.

, Whatever it is that you want to add to an outfit, whether its your worn-out Converse, a cool necklace, or fandom pins on your bag, accessories can add color and style to whatever you wear! Its always useful to have few key pieces, like your favorite bracelet or most comfortable shoes, that can be worn with most anything, so if you happen to be running late or just don't feel like putting in much effort, you can add those to what you're wearing and instantly perk up your look. And again, like with clothing, accessories that are fun yet functional are important! Its nice to have a pair of shoes that will go with anything.

, Hair is one of the easiest ways to change up your look for cheap! Even without a drastic new haircut, trying things like new styles, hair accessories, or colors can change how your hair looks completely! And you know your hair best, so you know how to take care of it! Just be careful with the hairdryers, straighteners, and bleach. Damaged hair can take a long time to get healthy again. And if you feel pressured to style your hair a certain way because of societal expectations, it's worth it figuring out what it is YOU like.

, Take regular showers or baths to keep your body clean and smelling nice, and regular face-washings to help keep skin clean and clear. Shaving body hair is always optional, and always up to you! A variety of products are available for help in keeping skin clear or making you smell nice, and can be found for quite cheap. For on the go, it can be useful to carry a small bottle of lotion for dry hands, deodorant for hot days, or a small bottle of your favorite scent to dab or spray on if you're out for a long time and need a pick-me-up.

, Make-up can be for everyone, but it doesn't have to be for you either. Make-up should be about helping you feel more confident in your natural beauty, so if you don't feel like you need it, that's great! If you want to wear a full-face every time you go out, that's fine too. Don't let anyone shame you for the amount of make-up you may or may not wear. If you do wear makeup, don't be afraid to express your style that way as well! Winged eyeliner or bold lip color can be a confidence boost, or maybe you just want to cover that red spot on your chin. Whatever you feel comfortable with is what's right for you.

, You get to decide what you want to wear, and you will look amazing no matter what. Having a perfect look is all about you, and not anyone else. So when you are able to look in a mirror and recognize that you look absolutely fantastic, that's how you know you've found your style.

Men should consider dressing up or dressing down in age. If you usually dress like a 19 year old, consider how your father dresses and start taking cues from him. Wear polo shirts tucked into khaki pants with your cellphone on a belt clip and you'll age 20 years in a minute.
Women could consider dressing in a more masculine style, wearing pants where they might normally wear skirts as a way of changing their general presence. If people are used to seeing you in make-up and nice clothes, it'd be a surprise to suddenly be wearing a basketball jersey.

, It will help for your new look to be believable.If you combine women's dress pants with cholo shirts, it'll be a surprising disguise, but not necessarily one that will last. It'll just look strange. Think of yourself as an actor who's changing into a character that everyone must believe. Wear hats, appropriate jewelry, and look-appropriate gear.

, Wearing baggier clothes than you usually wear can be a good way of changing your basic body shape and looking different. Buy some surprising items a few sizes larger than you'd normally wear them. Layer your clothes to add some weight to your appearance, then shed layers over the course of the day to ensure that you look different in the morning and at night. No one will be able to find you if you keep changing.

, A few years ago, an Asian man boarded a plane wearing a silicon mask that made him look like an elderly white man, and then changed clothes and took the mask off in the middle of the flight, getting past everyone. By having a ready supply of clothes to change into (in a back-pack or purse) you can not only disguise yourself but continue evolving your disguise over the course of the day.


Keep make-up and emergency hair dye on your person for a quick transformation. Shoe polish can work in a pinch.

Develop a new persona.,
Age yourself.,
Avoid people.,
Dress up as a member of the opposite sex.",How to Disguise Yourself3," Give your new identity a name and develop a believable story for yourself. This will help you ""get into character"" better, and make your performance more natural. Develop a different sense of humor than you would normally have, start listening to different music, and developing different attitudes. If you're naturally liberal, imagine that you were a conservative Republican and adopt the style, attitudes, and demeanor of that character.


You can even consider working an accent into your disguise. Practice while you're by yourself and only speak in that accent in public. Change your accents periodically with different people to keep them guessing.

, Looking older or considerably younger is a particularly effective way to fool people. Dying your hair gray when you're young and working a stooped, hunched walk with a cane into your routine will render you unrecognizable to people who know you.


Putting a pebble into your shoe is uncomfortable, but if you're committed to disguising yourself, it can be a good way to ensure that you'll walk differently. Brace your knee with a brace to give yourself a natural limp.

, The most important part of a disguise is to not to attract attention to yourself. ""Hiding in plain sight"" is the best way to disguise yourself. Avoid making eye contact with people you know, keeping your head low and walking calmly and slowly. Looking as if you're busy, as if you're on your way somewhere in particular with something to do will ensure that you look inconspicuous.

, If you want to go for broke, consider dressing either ambiguously or as a convincing member of the opposite sex. Switch back and forth to keep your disguise varied.

Keep an exercise journal.,
Exercise at least five days a week.,
Do cardio.,
Work your core.,
Strengthen your legs.,
Exercise your arms.",How to Do a Full Body Makeover2," Reflect on how you feel after each workout session. Keep track of each improvement you notice. Every lifted mood and every extra minute you can run without getting winded is something to celebrate. Read your entries at the end of the week. This will make you look forward to your next workout., Start out with moderate cardio for 30 minutes each day. Work up to three days of intense cardio and two days of moderate to intense strength training.When your current routine starts to feel too easy, increase your intensity to the point where you can just make it. Keep building to avoid plateaus in your progress.

, Cardio helps to build your endurance, burn fat, and make your heart stronger.If you go to the gym, you can choose from treadmills, exercise bikes, and a variety of ellipticals. Ellipticals typically let you burn more calories, let you work at a variety of intensities, and are gentler on your knees.If the gym isn’t for you, make time to power walk and run/jog in the park, the mall, or around your neighborhood., Keep your core muscles strong to support your posture and overall spinal health. This muscle group consists of your upper abs, lower abs, obliques, and back muscles. You could do sit-ups, oblique sit-ups, and reverse crunches, but if you’d like to try something different, you could go for:


Planks, which strengthen your back and lower abs. Start with 2-3 sets of 10 reps.Rotating planks, which work your abs and obliques. Start with 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps.Single leg resisted curls, which work your lower abs and obliques, as well as your legs and biceps (upper front arm). You’ll need a medicine ball for this exercise. Start with 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps., Strong legs allow you to walk and run longer and faster. Your major leg muscles are your quadriceps (front of your thighs), your hamstrings (back of the upper leg), and your calves. Many exercises that work the quads also work your gluteus maximus (butt). Try these moves as part of your makeover:


Squats work your quadriceps and your glutes. Start with 2-3 sets of 15. Add weights if you need a challenge.
Touchdown jacks strengthen your quads, as well as your obliques. Start with 2-3 sets of 20.
Squat thrusts strengthen your quads and hamstrings while throwing in a bit of cardio. Start with 2-3 sets of 10., Your arms consist of your deltoids (shoulders), biceps, and triceps (back of your arm). You need strong arms for everyday tasks like lifting and carrying objects. Common exercises include push-ups and curls. Additionally, you could try:

Tricep extensions, which help to tone the back of your arms. You could even mix it up a bit and throw in side lunges to work your outer thighs at the same time. Start with 2-3 sets of 10.
Overhead presses, which work your deltoids. Start with 2-3 sets of 10."

Change your skincare regimen.,
Discover your “season.” Visit a color analyst or take an online quiz to find out whether you’re a spring, summer, autumn, or winter.,
Try new makeup tricks.,
Update your wardrobe.,
Get your hair cut or trimmed.,
Color your hair, if you want.",How to Do a Full Body Makeover3," If you’ve been using the same regimen for several years, it could be time for a change. Maybe your acne-prone skin isn’t producing the amount of oil it once did. Maybe the skin on your neck is starting to sag. Maybe you’re noticing more break-outs than usual. These are signs that you need to change your facial cleanser, moisturizer, mask, and other elements in your skincare regimen.A few helpful ideas include:

Treating sagging skin/wrinkles with products containing hyaluronic acid.Treating acne with products containing tea tree oil.Reviving dull skin with an exfoliating cleanser., In this analysis, you’ll discover the warmth or coolness of your skin undertones. Once you know this info, you’ll know which makeup and clothing colors work best for you., Use your new skincare regimen and knowledge of your season to try something new with your makeup. Use colors that complement your natural undertones. Maybe you’re a summer, but your foundation better suits a winter. If you suffer from acne, rosacea, or other reddening of the skin, try green concealer to cancel out the red. If you’ve noticed a few fine lines, avoid piling the on makeup, as this will only make you look older., Now that you know which colors to rock and which ones to avoid, it’ll be easier to buy new clothes. No need to break the bank. You can buy fabulous outfits in charity shops for a fraction of department store prices. Take at least four hours to find outfits that will do your makeover justice. Shop at brick-and-mortar stores so that you can try on the clothes before buying them., Thumb through your favorite magazine, or browse online for the latest styles. Take the picture(s) of your favorite style(s) to the salon. If you have trouble deciding, ask your hair dresser to help. Ask if they have imaging software available so that you can try on a new ‘do before you commit.If you’re not ready to commit to anything too drastic, ask your hair dresser to trim off about 1 inch (2.5 cm). It’ll get rid of split ends and refresh your hair. Plus, it costs a lot less than a full cut and style., It’s natural to want to try out a new hair color during a full-body makeover. Start with something subtle that works with your face shape. For example, if you’re a brunette wanting to lighten your hair, start with red highlights or streaks that easily blend with your natural color. If you have a square jawline, have your beautician use your highlights to draw attention to your eyes."

Eat a balanced diet.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Don’t smoke or abuse alcohol.",How to Do a Full Body Makeover4," Eat plenty of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and plant proteins. Protein sources will keep you full and maintain your muscles for your workout. Whole grains are rich in heart-healthy fiber. Fruits and vegetables (especially leafy greens) lower your risk of a variety of illnesses. Since Vitamin B-12 is usually absent from plant and animal foods, ask your doctor about taking a supplement.Always eat a healthy breakfast to keep you fueled throughout the morning, even if you work out later in the day.
Cut down on junk foods and processed foods heavy in sodium and sugars. These are bad for your skin, stamina, and overall health.
Cut down on simple carbohydrates like pasta and instant rice. They only fill you up for a short time and can add excess weight.

, Water can help keep your skin clear and fight food cravings. When you’re working out, you need more than the typical 64 fl. oz. (1.89 L) of water each day. How much depends on your height, weight, and workout intensity. Talk to your doctor to figure out how much you should be drinking., In addition to the lung problems they cause, tobacco products weaken your endurance and cause premature wrinkles.Abusing alcohol can age you and make it difficult to lose weight. Like smoking, it can totally derail the progress of your makeover."

Apply a medicated, scar-reducing cream.,
Apply concealing makeup.,
Apply a scar-camouflaging kit.,
Use concealing or micropore tape.",How to Cover up Scars2," For recent and especially light scars, you should begin with creams proven to reduce the appearance of scars. Flat scars less than two years old are the best candidates for these creams.Pick a product containing healing ingredients such as quercetin, petrolatum, and vitamin C.Equally as important is minimizing a scar’s exposure to sunlight. Scar tissue does not react to sunlight the same way as normal tissue, so exposing a fresh scar to sunlight can permanently darken a scar, making it more apparent., There are various makeups available on the market that can temporarily hide a scar. Choose a proper color to match your skin tone and test the makeup or cream on your skin to see if you need to blend any colors for the desired effect.









Matching your skin tone can be a challenge for someone who isn’t familiar with the process. Try asking a consultant at a department or specialty store’s beauty counter for tips.
Learning how to apply concealer can also take some practice. Follow the steps outlined at Apply Concealer to learn how.

, For deeper scars or instances when you need longer-lasting concealment than regular makeup may provide, you can look into specialty scar-camouflaging kits that contain a mixture of adhesive creams and powders.









These kits form a paste that you can use to cover up a scar and can last much longer than regular makeup. You can often find these kits sold at any beauty supply shop, drugstore, or salon.

, Some thin, skin-tone specific concealing tapes are on the market as well. These products are best used by cutting the adhesive to match the general shape of your scar so that it blends in with the rest of your skin.

Consult a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon.,
Consider camouflage tattooing.,
Consider a chemical peel.,
Consider microdermabrasion.",How to Cover up Scars3," Certain older scars and especially raised or keloidal scars may require more effective cosmetic surgery to remove or reduce. A cosmetic surgeon will likely have several suggestions during a consultation.

, With advances in technique over the last several years, camouflage tattooing is a solid way to reduce the appearance of scars.The process is highly similar to that of getting a normal tattoo, but the surgeon uses a pigment to match your skin tone, often with imperceptible results.Scars should be at least two years old before undergoing camouflage tattooing to ensure they are fully healed.If conventional tattoos are more your style, you can cover scars with those as well. Consult your tattoo artist for the best type of design to cover your specific scar size, location, and color.

, A chemical peel is a basic procedure wherein a chemical mixture is applied to the effected area, causing several of the top layers of skin to dry up and peel off.The skin peels over several days, and it is considered a minor procedure.This is an especially effective method for reducing the appearance of acne scars., Like a chemical peel, this method removes the outermost layer of dead skin from the abraded area; however, instead of a chemical mixture, the process is completed with a flow of fine, medical-grade crystals.The finished product is a subtle difference, but it is effective against acne scars as well as the discolored hyperpigmentation of some other scars."

Start by curling your hair.,
Put on foundation, if you think it's necessary.,
Next, you should do your eye makeup.,
With an eyeshadow brush, apply a light blue eye shadow all over the lid and spread lime green eye shadow on the inner half of the crease.,
For a more beachy, awake effect, apply a skin tone eye shadow all over the brow bone and then apply a dot of white eye shadow on the tear duct.,
Apply a dark blue liner on upper and lower lash line.,
Curl your lashes and apply your favorite mascara.,
Apply a coral pink blush on cheekbones lightly.,
Apply a coral pink lipstick or lip gloss for the finishing touch.

,
If you want to wear a sea-inspired outfit, try shorts with a plain white t-shirt and flip flops, or a bikini under a summer dress with a floral pattern.,
For accessories, think beachy.,
You're done!",How to Do a Sea Makeover," Take a curling wand (1/1.5 inches) and wrap your hair around it loosely. Make sure to leave one inch towards the bottom uncurled as it creates a beachy sort of effect, which is what you're going for. Once you're finished, spray a salt spray through your hair. If you don't have one, fill an empty spray bottle with water and put two or three tablespoons of salt in it. Shake it well.;
, Try to match it to your skin tone  as much as possible, and if you can, make sure it's waterproof. Blend it into your skin with a foundation or stippling brush. To cover up blemishes or dark circles, use stick concealer.

, Apply an eye primer such as Urban Decay Primer Potion or Too-Faced Shadow Insurance all over the lid and up to the brow bone. This will ensure that your eyeshadow stays on longer and it makes it look better, too.

, Apply a teal eye shadow on the outer half of the crease.

, This will make your eyes pop and works with any color of eyes and eyeshadow.

, You can use a pencil liner or a liquid liner, but liquid liners can be messy and can ruin your makeup. Make sure you wing out your eyeliner so it looks like a wave in the sea.

, Don't put too much, though - you don't want to look overdone.

, Go from the apples of your face and blend outwards toward your ears. Don't look like a clown, dust it very lightly.

,, You could also try blue jeans with a white belt and a crop-top, high-waisted shorts and an old blue shirt, or a white or blue polo shirt with a flowy skirt and beach sandals., Try a sand necklace, or a blue bracelet, fish earrings or a hairclip with shells in it. Don't be tacky, but don't wear anything too expensive either - the point is to wear nice jewelry, but if it got lost in the sea it wouldn't be a big deal., Have fun going to the beach!

Learn the difference between carrier oils and active or essential oils:


Carrier oils are used to dilute the essential oils, lessening their strength.,
Choose your oil pair.,
Understand your skin type.,
Mix oils according to your skin type.,
Experiment with what combination works best for your skin.,
Try adding tea tree oil.,
Create your mixture in the palms of your hands.,
Rub the oil gently all over a dry face, then let the oil sit for about 60 seconds.,
Wet a clean towel with hot water.,
Repeat the oil treatment once or twice a daily for best results.",How to Clean Your Face Using Oil," These are milder oils—olive oil, coconut oil, and sunflower oil—which make a great base for the skin cleansing process.
Active oils like castor oil, hazelnut oil, and tea tree oil should not be used at full strength. Instead, they are the active astringents needed to get clear, healthy skin.;
, Try an olive oil base with a hazelnut boost, or a coconut base with a castor oil boost. Choose a combination based on which oils are locally available in a natural, unrefined state. You should take care to use only the highest quality oils on your skin.

, Skin type is usually defined as normal, combination, or oily. You should have a basic understanding of how much oil your skin produces.

, Try these recommendations:



Oily skin - 1 part castor or hazelnut oil and 2 parts olive, sunflower, or other carrier oil.

Combination skin - 1 part castor or hazelnut oil and 3 parts olive, sunflower, or other carrier oil.

Dry skin - A few drops of castor or hazelnut oil in olive, sunflower, or other carrier oil.

, Transitioning from  your old product(s) to using oil may take a couple of weeks. Use that time to experiment with ratios, using the guideline that your skin should feel clean and fresh after each treatment. Up the strength of your mixture to control breakouts by adding more active ingredients, but do so judiciously as the essential oils can be very strong.

, If your skin is usually pimple prone, try dabbing a bit of tea tree oil directly on the problem area. Note: Tea tree oil is very strong; just a small amount is all you need.

, Make sure your hands are clean, then add the carrier oil and boost it according to your skin type. Once you get the hang of your mixture you can eyeball the ratio quite easily.

,


It is best to start with a dry face, as oil and water repel each other.

, Ring out the steaming towel and place it over your face. The steam will open your pores and release the clogged dirt and old oils. It will prepare your face to be moisturized by cleaning oils you have applied.


Alternatively, hover your face over a pot of steaming water with a bath towel draped over your head and the steam source. This is a good way to deep clean your face if you have extra time.

,


Be aware that, during the transition process, your face might get worse before it gets better. This is the detoxification phase when your skin is releasing built up toxins. The detox phase usually takes a week or two, but once you’ve gotten pass that your skin should stabilize and attain a healthier, clean appearance.

Avoid potentially harmful ingredients.,
Watch out for fragrances.,
Search for natural ingredients.,
Buy Castile soap.",How to Clean Your Face Naturally1," There are certain ingredients commonly found in facial cleansers that can irritate or dry out skin. The safety of some of these products is still debated. Read the ingredients label of your face wash, and avoid brands that use:


Diethanolamine (DEA)
Monoethanolamine (MEA)
Triethanolamine (TEA)
Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or sodium laureth sulfate (SLES)
Triclosan;
, Most fragrances contain phthalates, which are a group of chemicals that are often used to soften plastic and vinyl.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not know very much about the potential side effects of phthalates, so it is best to avoid them. While no scientific evidence supports this, some people even think phthalates may interfere with puberty and decrease sperm count.Additionally, other fragrances might include hormone disrupters.Whenever possible, avoid buying cleansers that use artificial fragrances or perfumes.

, Whether you are using an oil cleanser, face wash, or cleansing wipes, you can usually find an option that uses natural ingredients. Look for face wash that contains herbs, oils, and other plant-based products. Ingredients towards the top of the list are used in higher proportions than ingredients lower in the list.


Green tea has antioxidant properties and reduces inflammation in the skin.Licorice also has anti-inflammatory qualities.Witch hazel, peppermint, and tea tree are astringents that can help control oil and acne.
Aloe, cucumber, and rosewater are good for dry skin.

, Castile soap is a traditional soap that is made with lye and vegetable oils. It lacks many of the unnatural ingredients found in most cleansers. Liquid castile soap can be mixed with essential oils or natural ingredients like honey, or it can be used on its own."

Watch for signs of infection.",How to Clean Road Rash," When you get road rash, you first need to decide how deep the wound goes. If you had a small fall, the road rash will likely be shallow and only affect the upper layer of skin. If you had a bad fall, your road rash may be more severe, extending into deeper muscle and bone tissue. Look at your wound and see how deep the scrapes go.


If it is shallow, you can clean it at home.
If you see underlying muscle or fat, or if it is deep enough you see bone, call emergency services immediately.;
, One of the ways to tell how serious your road rash is is to see how much it bleeds. If your wound is gently bleeding, the abrasion isn’t too deep. If it is bleeding profusely, you should see your doctor right away.


If your road rash is gushing or squirting blood, call emergency services right away and apply firm constant pressure to the wound until help arrives., Your road rash may cover a little or a large area of your body. If your road rash only covers a small portion of your body, you can clean it at home without seeking medical help. If your abrasions take up large areas of your body, you need to see a doctor.


Large wounds can cause many different problems for your health if they get infected, which they have a higher likelihood to do since they cover so much of your body.
You should also contact a doctor if your road rash is on your face.A good estimate to know if your road rash is too large is the palm of your hand. If your wound is larger than the palm of your hand, see a doctor immediately., When you fall hard enough to get road rash, you may have sustained a more severe injury than just the abrasion. Be mindful of any other injuries that might have occurred, especially if you hit your head.


Adrenaline may make other injuries take longer to appear. Head injuries may also develop if you hit your head in your fall. Just make sure you watch for any difference in your behavior or normal routine.Symptoms of concussion to watch for include temporary loss of consciousness, dizziness, amnesia, confusion, dazed feeling, nausea or vomiting, irritability, and sensitivity to light and sound.If you sustain a fall where you may have hit your head, you should have an adult stay with you so that you are not alone for more than 24 hours. You might not notice changes in your own behavior, but, if there are indications that your neurological condition might be worsening (such as changes in behavior), that adult should call 911.

, Before you touch your road rash, you need to wash your hands. Run your hands under fresh water in the sink. Add soap to your hands and lather them all over by rubbing them together. Keep rubbing for at least 20 seconds, being careful to clean around your fingernails, in between your fingers, and up to your elbows. Then rinse the soap from your hands and arms with more clean water.


Dry them off on a clean towel.If you have any road rash on or near your hands, avoid getting it wet until you can clean it out.

, Before you can properly clean your road rash, you need to stop the wound from bleeding. If it is a very minor road rash, it may stop bleeding on its own. If it is a slightly deeper road rash, you will have to apply pressure to stop the bleeding. Find a sterile bandage or clean cloth. Apply direct pressure to the wound with the cloth.


Elevate the wound as well to help stop the bleeding.If there are large pieces of debris in the wound, remove those gently before you apply pressure. You don't want to embed them deeper into your wound.
If the road rash takes longer than 10 minutes to stop bleeding, see your doctor as soon as you can.

, In order to ensure that your road rash doesn't get dirtier than it is, you need to clean the area around your wound. This will make sure that germs do not get in your road rash from the skin around it. It will also help remove any blood from around the wound as well. To clean around it, use a soapy washcloth to clean the area around your rash. Instead of running your rash under water, rinse out the rag and wipe the soap off the surrounding area.


Make sure you do not get soap in your rash. It can cause it to get irritated. Instead, clean around the wound.You may need to cut away fabric around the rash or take off the clothing around it.
There's no need to use antibacterial soap, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or any other antiseptic to cleanse the area around the wound. These products can be irritating to the wound.

, To help get the majority of the debris from the road out of your rash, you need to rinse the wound out to reduce the chance of infection. Place the area where you have road rash under a faucet and run clean water over it. If you can't get the area under a facet because of where it is, put clean water in a cup or bowl and pour it over the wound.If you have a facet with a sprayer attached, you can use it to help get the debris out. Just make sure the water pressure isn't too high. You can try using your shower head as well, as long as it isn't too strong.You can also fill your tub with water and sit in it to help rinse out your wound.

, To make sure you road rash doesn't get infected or debris doesn't heal into your skin, you need to remove any remaining particles from your road rash. Take a pair of tweezers and sterilize them with rubbing alcohol or by leaving them in boiling water for a few minutes and then letting them cool. Use them to pick out any particles left in your road rash.


Be careful to not gauge your wound with the tweezers. If there is a piece of debris that you cannot get out with tweezers or water, you need to see your doctor to remove the debris.
Do not use peroxide, iodine, or other cleanser at this point. This will only irritate your skin since it was just injured., Once you have gotten any debris and rinsed out your road rash, you need to make sure it doesn't get infected. To help with this, apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection and reduce the risk of scarring. This will also help keep the surface moist, which provides the best healing environment for your road rash.


Some ointments may cause negative reactions to a person's skin. To help avoid this reaction, apply ointment to a small test area before applying it to the wound.
If your skin reacts badly to the ointment, stop using it., To protect your road rash from the elements, you need to cover it with a sterile bandage. Take a sterile dressing and tape it over your wound. If your road rash is small, you may be able to find an adhesive bandage that is large enough to cover it or leave it exposed to the open air.Ensure that you don't attach bandage tape to the rash or let the adhesive bandage overlap with the rash.
If you develop a rash because of the adhesive tape, switch to paper tape. You can also use rolled gauze or an elastic bandage to hold the sterile dressing over the wound.
Dress your wound every day, or whenever the dressing becomes soiled.

, In order to make sure your road rash stays clean, you need to change your dressing every day. This will cut down your chance of infection and help keep it from getting irritated more. Before you touch your wound, wash your hands to rid them of any germs or bacteria that might cause your road rash to get infected. Then, gently remove your dressing and discard the old bandage.


If your bandage gets wet or dirty, you should change it right away even if you already have that day. Dirty bandages may spread infection., You need to wash your rash every day with antibacterial soap. This will help prevent infection from getting into your wound. Use a clean wash cloth lathered with warm water and antibacterial soap to gently clean your rash. This will help clean off old antibiotic cream, scabs, and dead tissue as your rash heals.


Make sure you rinse your rash well after you clean it and dry it gently with a clean towel.
You can use your daily shower time to wash your road rash., Once you have adequately cleaned and dried your road rash, you need to redress it. Apply a new layer of antibiotic cream, making sure it is enough to keep it wet enough between dressings. Then apply a clean bandage to cover your rash completely., Once your road rash has healed enough to scab over completely, you do not have to keep a bandage on it. You can still apply antibiotic cream to the rash to keep it from getting infected. In addition, as the scabbed area heals, you should apply moisturizer to it daily.


This will help regenerate the skin on and around your road rash., As you keep your road rash clean, you need to make sure you watch for signs of infection. You need to catch any infection as soon as you can to avoid larger health problems. If you notice signs of infection, go to your doctor immediately. The signs you should look for are:


Increased redness or swelling around your road rash
A foul smell coming from the rash
Noticeable drainage of pus around the wound
A fever
Chills
Nausea or vomiting
Any red streaks starting at the wound
Muscle aches and pains, especially those far away from your road rash"

Also, it is recommended to lube up your elbows before a steamy shower to help the lubricant penetrate deeper into dry areas.Be sure to rub in moisturizer within a few minutes after toweling dry. This helps to slow the natural evaporation of moisture.;
, Exfoliation is scrubbing off dead skin cells to reveal the new and improved skin cells underneath.You can use various creams and scrubbers, in or out of the shower, to slough away dead skin buildup.


Exfoliation should only be completed 1-2 times weekly to avoid irritation.You can use a scrubbing brush, pumice stone, or exfoliating cream to remove dead skin.
Choose products which contain lactic acid which will assist in reducing superficially present keratin buildup in dead skin cells, which is a protein that can cause blockage of healthy skin pores. Keratin has an important role in maintaining the health of your skin, but an excess of keratin is called hyperkeratosis.If you are experiencing this, then it is important to see your general practitioner or a dermatologist to find out what is causing it.

, Try soaking in a warm bath for half an hour to soften skin on the elbows. Prolonged exposure to warm water will soften skin.


Follow all other suggestions: use a moisturizer, wash with mild soap, and use an exfoliating body scrub or scrubber to remove dead skin.
Avoid using bubbles or bath products which contain sodium laureth sulphate which can exacerbate dry skin.Excessive bathing can also make skin drier, so make sure to limit your time spent in the shower and don’t use hot water.Also, be sure to use proper bath products, exfoliate, and apply a moisturizer directly after you towel dry.

Mix equal parts cucumber juice and yogurt and apply as a paste to hydrate dry skin.
Mix equal parts cucumber juice and lemon juice and apply on dark areas for 15 minutes to make a natural bleaching agent.

, The constant use of the elbows as well as exposure to sun can lead to thicker skin on the elbows. In addition, because moisture retaining glands are not present in the elbows, moisture must be manually added. Try using a thick lotion to keep elbows lubricated.


Try applying petroleum jelly and covering with a sock at bedtime to lock in moisture.
Try lotions with ingredients like urea, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, or alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids which are often used to help treat small bumps on the skin. Try moisturizing at least three times a day, every day.

, Sun exposure leads to a buildup of dead skin cells, which can cause darker looking skin on elbows.Always use sunscreen when you go out to protect from harmful UV rays.


Use sunscreen lotions instead of sprays to add additional lubrication.
Use at least an SPF 30 to protect from damaging UV rays.

, If you are taking any medications and notice a darkening of the skin on or around your elbows, talk to your doctor to determine if this could be a side effect of your prescription.


For example, medications such as birth control pills, medications used to ease the side effects of chemotherapy, thyroid medications, human growth hormones, and some body building supplements have been known to cause darkening of certain areas including the elbows."

Have a suspected keloid examined by a doctor.",How to Heal a Keloid," A series of cortisone injections administered to the keloid every four to eight weeks by a doctor can usually shrink the size of the keloid and make it flatter. However, sometimes they can cause the keloid to become darker in color.Interferon is another kind of injection that is being studied for the treatment of keloids, and may be an option for you.;
, Cryotherapy is a very effective treatment for keloids, and can shrink them significantly. In cryotherapy, liquid nitrogen is applied to the keloid to freeze away the excess cells. Cryotherapy only takes a few minutes and can usually be done in your doctor's office. Several treatments spaced several weeks apart may be needed to fully remove the keloid., Laser therapies for keloids are relatively new and have not been studied as much as other treatment options, but they show promise of minimizing or healing keloids. Different kinds of laser treatments work better on different skin types, and on different types of keloids. Ask your dermatologist if she thinks laser treatment might be right for you., Doctors are reluctant to remove keloids surgically, because there is a high chance of additional scar tissue forming at the site. However, in some cases it may be helpful or necessary.


If you have a keloid surgically removed, be sure to follow all of the after-care instructions carefully to prevent a new keloid from forming.

, It sounds extreme, but radiation has been effectively used for over a century to treat keloids, often in combination with surgery or other treatments. Despite concerns over an increase in cancer risk, a recent study indicates that radiation remains a safe option if appropriate precautions (protecting cancer-prone tissues) are made.Radiation treatments are usually outpatient procedures performed at your local hospital under the care of a trained radiologist.

, Safe remedies to shrink keloids include pressure (silicon pads) and the application of healing substances. Do not try to physically remove or shrink a keloid yourself by cutting, sanding, constricting it with string or rubber bands, or using any other method that traumatizes the skin. Not only are you likely to see additional scar tissue form at the site, you can also put yourself at serious risk for infection., Vitamin E has been shown to help scars heal, prevent keloids, and may help shrink existing keloids. Apply Vitamin E oil or cream to the scar twice daily, morning and night for 2-3 months.Vitamin E oil can be bought in health food stores, and many major grocery stores.
You can also purchase Vitamin E capsules, and cut them open and squeeze the oil onto the scar. Each capsule should be good for a few applications.

, Silicon gel sheets or ""scar sheets"" are self-adhesive, reusable sheets that are applied to an injury site to prevent scars, or on existing scars and keloids to reduce their size and appearance. Silicon sheets should be worn over the injury site or on the existing keloid for at least 10 hours per day for several months.Silicon gel sheets are sold under names such as ""ScarAway,"" and can be bought at most pharmacies and many online retailers.

, There are a number of new topical treatments for healing scars that may visibly diminish keloids. The active ingredient in many of these treatments is silicone. Look for a product labeled ""scar cream"" or ""scar gel"" and apply as directed., The best way to deal with keloids is to avoid getting them in the first place. People who already have keloids, or who are very prone to getting them, can take special precautions with skin injuries to prevent keloid scares from forming.

, Pay attention to even minor skin injuries, and make sure that any wounds are thoroughly cleaned. Apply an antibiotic cream and bandage to any open wounds, and change the bandage frequently.


Wear loose clothing over the injury site that will not irritate the skin further.
The silicon gel sheets mentioned above work well to prevent keloids from forming.

, Piercings and even tattoos can lead to keloids in some individuals. If you have developed keloids in the past, or have a family history of keloids in your family, you may want to avoid piercings and tattoos, or consult with a dermatologist before proceeding.

, Keloids are raised scars that can form anywhere on the body where the skin has been injured. They form when the body creates excess collagen (a kind of scar tissue) at the injury site. The skin injury may be large and obvious, like a surgery incision or burn, or small like a bug bite or pimple. Keloids usually begin to develop around three months after the original injury, and can continue to grow for weeks or even months.Ear piercings and tattoos can lead to keloids in some people.
Usually keloids form on the chest, shoulders, and upper back.

, Keloids are usually raised and rubbery in appearance, with a smooth, shiny surface. The shape of the keloid usually follows the shape of the injury, but over time keloids can grow beyond the original injury site. Keloids can vary in color from silvery to flesh-tone to red or dark brown.


Keloids are generally not painful, but can cause an itching or burning sensation for some people.
While keloids aren't dangerous, it is important to have them looked at by a doctor to make sure they aren't a more serious skin condition.

, Some people are more likely than others to develop keloids, and if you have had one keloid scar appear, you are likely to develop more in the future. If you know you are at risk, you may want to take special care of skin injuries to prevent keloids from forming.People with darker skin tones are more likely to develop keloids.
People younger than 30 are at a higher risk, especially teenagers experiencing puberty.
Pregnant women are more likely to develop keloids.
People with a history of keloids in their family are also at a higher risk.

, It is very important to have a suspected keloid examined by a doctor to make sure that it is not something more serious. In some cases, the doctor may be able to visually diagnose the keloid. In others, the doctor may wish to take a biopsy of the tissue and have it screened to rule out cancer.


Most effective treatments for keloids are done under a doctor's care, and early treatment is often the key to success.
A skin biopsy is a simple procedure, in which the doctor removes a small sample of skin tissue and sends it to a lab to be analyzed under a microscope. It can often be done in the doctor's office at the time of your visit."

, These oils are known to strengthen and stimulate eyelash growth. You could also mix them together.Just pour a few drops of the oil onto a Q-Tip, and then coat your eyelashes with it. Keep it on your lashes for a few minutes (around 5-8 minutes) and then rinse.
Do this once a day for 1-2 weeks, and you should notice the effect soon. Also apply olive or coconut oil on your eyelids and on the skin under your eyes every night (before you go to bed) for a noticeable effect. Apply olive or coconut oil with a cotton swab.

, Despite the disgusting idea of rubbing raw eggs on your eyelashes, eggs are a very good way of getting lengthy, healthy eyelashes.


The high protein in eggs can help create thicker and longer eyelashes. In addition, eggs contain biotin and B vitamins that play a major role in improving the overall texture of your lashes.
Just beat 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of glycerin until you get a thick, creamy texture. Then rub this mixture onto your eyelashes using a cotton swab and keep on for 15 minutes. Rinse off using cold water. Repeat this remedy 3 times a week for a few months.

, Use a clean brush or a cotton swab to apply castor oil on your lashes before going to bed. You can also add a few drops of vitamin E oil to the castor oil before applying.

Apply it on your eyelashes using a cotton swab. Leave it on overnight, then rinse it off the next morning. You could also add a few drops of the oil to your mascara tube.

, The peels are rich in vitamins C and B, folic acid and other nutrients that promote the growth of eyelashes.Also, when infused in olive or castor oil, they will help enhance the cleansing and stimulating properties of the oil. Put 1 tablespoon of moderately dried lemon peels in a container.
Pour enough olive or castor oil into the container, so that the peels get soaked. Allow the mixture to sit for a couple of weeks. Using a clean mascara stick, apply the oil on your eyelashes before going to bed. Leave it on overnight, then wash it off with warm water in the morning. Follow this remedy for a few months to get encouraging results.

,, Don't forget to be gentle while applying and removing any products around the eyes. The skin there is very sensitive, also too much stretching will result in droopy skin around the eyes. You don't want that!

,, This is the first step in defining the shape of the 'smoke' in the smokey eye look. Take your time to define this 'V' as it differs for everyone and from eye to eye. Stop and look straight in the mirror to check if you like what you see.

By the way, if you have hooded eyes, you can make them look larger by a neat little trick - just draw an arc not on the natural socket fold but slightly above to give the illusion of a higher socket line. Also pat a little bit of the black eye shadow on the outer 'V' to add emphasis and drama.

, If you think you need more color of any of these three eye shadows, now is the time to add on. Once again use gently patting movements.

, I always do this step to add just a little bit more intensity to the gaze of the eyes. If you want it to be subtle or if you are not really a black eyeliner girl, then you should skip this step. You can wear a smoky eye during the daytime as well if you skip this step and go easy on the mascara.

Keep the stitch marks covered and clean during the day.,
Use silicone pads to help the marks heal properly.,
Do not apply vitamin E or hydrogen peroxide to the marks.,
Protect the stitch marks from the sun by using sunscreen.,
Massage the area once the stitch marks have healed.",How to Get Rid of Stitch Marks1," Though you may think allowing your stitches to breath by keeping them uncovered will help to speed up healing, doing this can delay healing by as much as 50 percent. Moisture and wetness can prevent a scab from forming and lead to prolonged healing or an infection. Use a dry, sterile bandage to cover the stitch marks as they heal.Your doctor may give you an antibiotic ointment or advise you to use an over the counter ointment like Neosporin. This will help to prevent infection and encourage your stitch marks to heal fast.Use a fresh bandage every time you apply the ointment to the marks. You can switch to plain petroleum jelly after a week of using the ointment to encourage new skin to grow over the stitch marks.;
, Apply constant pressure to the stitch marks by using silicone sheet pads, such as Curad Scar Therapy Cosmetic Pads, ReJuveness Pure Silicone Sheets, and Syprex scar sheets. This can help the marks to heal and flatten any scarring.Many silicone pads are made to allow you to cut them to fit the shape of your stitch marks.

, Despite common belief, vitamin E has been shown by studies to prevent wounds from healing, rather than encourage healing. Some people may also develop an allergic reaction to vitamin E. Put medicated ointment or antibiotic cream on the stitch marks instead of vitamin E gel.Though applying hydrogen peroxide to open cuts or marks can help sanitize the area, hydrogen peroxide has been known to destroy new skin cell growth and slow down your body’s healing process.

, The sun’s ultraviolet light can have a damaging effect on your stitch marks and slow down the healing process. Lather up your skin, including your stitch marks, with sunscreen every morning before you go outside. Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30.

, Massaging your healed stitch marks will help to break down any bands of collagen that have attached to the underlying tissue.You should gently massage the area with lotion in a circular motion for 15 to 30 seconds several times a day.

Invest in a product containing glycolic acid.",How to Get Rid of Stretch Marks Fast2," Many pharmacies offer over-the-counter products that can be used to camouflage small areas of skin impacted by birthmarks or stretch marks. Some types are even waterproof, and will remain in place for two to three days., Tretinoin products are often called ""retinoid"" creams. They work by helping your body rebuild the collagen in your skin. Although products containing tretinoin may not completely eliminate stretch marks, scientific evidence does indicate they improve their appearance.Note that these products can sometimes irritate sensitive skin.
Consult your doctor before using creams containing this substance if you are pregnant or nursing., These ingredients operate similarly to tretinoin, stimulating the development of new skin collagen and the maintenance of your skin.

Talk to your doctor about cosmetic surgery as a last resort.",How to Get Rid of Stretch Marks Fast3," Laser treatment employs intense wavelengths of light to stimulate your skin's production of collagen, elastin, or melanin.

The laser's energy causes underlying blood vessels to collapse, causing the color of red or purple stretch marks to either disappear completely or turn white., Your practitioner would use a hand-held device to blow small crystals onto your skin. These crystals abrade, or ""polish,"" your skin's surface. A vacuum then removes both crystals and the resulting dead skin cells. Removing this top layer of your skin prompts the growth of new, more flexible skin.


Note that this is one of the few treatments indicated as useful for minimizing old stretch marks., An abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, may remove folds of skin marred by stretch marks. Bear in mind, however, that cosmetic surgery can be both expensive and risky. Consider carefully whether your concern about your stretch marks makes such an invasive approach worthwhile.worthwhile.Most doctors recommend a tummy tuck over microdermabrasion and laser treatments because the results of a tummy tuck are more cosmetically appealing.

Choose the best cosmetics for dry and sensitive skin.,
Minimize your use of eye make-up (particularly around your eyes).,
Use moisturizing creams around your eyes.",How to Heal Dry Skin Around Eyes2," When choosing foundation/concealer, look for one that says ""hypoallergenic"" on the label as this will minimize irritation and dryness to your skin. Also, when applying it to your skin, put as little as possible around your eyes, or avoid the eye area altogether.


When selecting eyeshadow, the powder form is better than the cream form. This is because it is easier to remove, and overall less irritating to the skin around your eyes. (And remember, irritation to the skin around the eyes is a leading cause in dryness.)

, Also, wash it off as soon as you are done with gentle cleansers that do not exacerbate dry skin. Mascara and eye-liner can cause undue stress (pulling and stretching) of the skin around the eyes, making them more prone to dryness and irritation.

, Choose creams that are specifically designed for sensitive and dry skin. One simple option is Vaseline jelly, as this is a non-irritating and very effective remedy that can be applied gently beneath your eyes before bed each night. That way, you can wash it off in the morning without anyone having to see it during the day. Another option is Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado, which has been reported to have very effective results in people seeking to heal dry skin around their eyes. Overall, any moisturizing cream that is hypoallergenic and that seems to work for you (by process of trial and error, as you will be able to tell quite quickly whether it is worsening or improving the dryness around your eyes) should do the trick. The important thing is to be proactive and to use a moisturizing cream of some sort.

Use mascara to make your lashes longer.,
Apply false eyelashes.,
Put baby powder on your lashes.,
Use products sparingly, though.,
Try a growth serum.",How to Get Thicker Lashes2," If you prefer instant changes, you can use an eyelash curler and mascaraWearing eyeliner along with your mascara can also result in looking like you have very thick eyelashes. Replace your mascara with a new one at least every four months to make sure it won't crumble, dry out and then ruin your lashes.
Make sure that every lash is separate and that you have applied all the way from the root of the lash to the tip. Blot the mascara wand on a paper towel or kleenex to prevent clumping.
Some people have found that using 2 mascaras on top of each other gives more length and volume.

, You can buy eyelashes you apply yourself in the store or you can ask a professional to apply them in a salon.


First, measure the lashes, and trim to fit with scissors. When gluing, make sure the glue is tacky, otherwise it may ""pings"" off.
Apply extra glue to the ends of the lashes as they are most likely to come off. Use tweezers to position the false lashes. Keep the eye that you're applying the false eyelash on closed. Hold the lashes down until dry.

, Apply a normal coat of mascara onto your eyelashes, coating the front and softly rolling to the back.Dust your eyelashes with baby powder. You can use a brush or your fingers. Your eyelashes should be whitish color.
Brush away the remaining baby powder that has fallen around the eye with a soft brush. Apply your second coat of mascara over the baby powder, using a small brush or eyelash comb to get rid of any large clumps.

, Don't go overboard on trying to make your eyelashes too thick. If you do, your eyelashes might get damaged.


Give your eyes a break sometimes. Don’t wear mascara every day, as this product can dry out the lashes.
Similarly, fake lashes should be more of a temporary boost for big occasions because the glue can make lashes weak and brittle. Minimize eyelash curler usage. Putting chemicals on your eyelashes not only dries them out but makes them thinner. Using an eyelash curler causes breakage and damage.

, These are commercial products that claim to make your lashes grow very thick and long.


Some growth serums come included with your mascara. Look for mascaras that include this as an ingredient.
You would apply the serum just as you apply mascara, and applying it with your mascara should thicken your lashes.

Continue brushing the lashes gently using upward strokes. Start from the root of the lashes and slowly move upward to the tip. Brush for about 5 minutes twice daily until you see desired results.

, Create a habit of drinking water often. Water is a neutral substance that helps with overall body health.


There can be no harm in drinking more water. Water provides shine to your hair and health to your skin. It also can help lashes grow lush.
Make sure you take a daily vitamin too, especially vitamin B. Add nutritional fats to your diet, such as avocados, olives, and almonds. These foods carry Omega 3s, which help grow your lashes. Also include proteins in your diet, such as beef, chicken, and eggs.

, Getting thicker eyelashes is all about the basic care. Rubbing your eyes is a big no.


Rubbing your eyes can cause stress on the eyes and make your eyelashes thinner. You might as well be putting scissors to them.
Pulling on your lashes or scrubbing the eye area harshly when washing your face can also lead to breakage of the lashes.

, Always remove your eye makeup softly and carefully, and make sure you remove everything.You could use oil to remove the eye makeup because oil strengthens your lashes and helps them to grow faster.
Many stores also sell wipes that are specifically designed to remove makeup. It’s a bad idea to use soap and water to do it, as they can dry out the eyelashes and the skin.

Get your stitches removed within a week.,
Talk to your doctor about laser treatments.,
See your doctor if the stitch marks become red, irritated, or swollen.",How to Get Rid of Stitch Marks2," Talk to your doctor about removing the external stitches before they leave track marks, which are the small bumps that appear on either side of the incision. If possible, have your doctor remove the external stitches after one week to prevent any permanent scarring.

, For a more serious professional option, consider using targeted laser treatment to remove the stitch marks or stitch scarring. Using laser treatment on fresh scars, within six to eight weeks of the injury, can lead to a more effective treatment and removal of the scar. There are two types of laser treatments:Pulsed dye lasers: This is a non-ablative laser treatment that uses an intense, targeted burst of light. The heat is then absorbed by the blood vessels in your skin and can help to improve the texture and thickness of scars. It can also reduce any redness around the scar.
Fractional ablative lasers: This treatment pokes small holes into the scar. This stimulates collagen production and can remodel the scar to appear less noticeable. This type of laser treatment is recommended for shallow scars.
Most laser treatments will require multiple treatment sessions and can cost between $300 to $600 per a session.

, If you experience any of these symptoms, as well as fever and increased pain around the stitch marks, you should go see your doctor. The stitch marks may be infected or you may have had an allergic reaction to the antibacterial cream.Your doctor will need to examine and treat the stitch marks to prevent further infection or complications.

;
, This will keep your skin from getting too oily during the day, and will help moisturize any dry patches on your skin.











Wait five minutes before putting on foundation (see the next step) so that the moisturizer can sink in., Apply just a few spots with your fingers to your forehead, cheeks, nose and chin, then blend with fingers or a foundation brush, working the spots outwards from the center in all directions.











If you want more coverage, you can use a makeup sponge to apply, using the same blending technique.

, Use a small pointed brush to dot a bit where under-eye circles are darkest, usually at the inner and outer corners of the eye. Add a speck to other blemishes that aren't covered by the foundation and blend into the skin.











There's a little controversy about whether a concealer should be the same shade as your skin or ever-so-slightly lighter; however, it should never be lighter than one shade away from your natural tone. Look for something as close as you can find to your skin tone and err on the lighter side if need be., Apply it to your face, ideally using a velvet-y powder puff (as opposed to a powder brush, as that leaves a lot of loose powder) in a pressing motion. Use a powder brush to flick off any excess. If you are using a powder brush to apply, tap off the excess powder before applying to your face in circular motions. 







, For beginners, try a single neutral shade like taupe or aubergine. Use a rounded shadow brush or your finger and make quick, short swipes across the lid, working your way up to the brow bone.








The shadow should go from your lash line to just beyond the inner crease. From there it fades upward toward the bone.
Set with a thin dusting of translucent powder.If you're using a brush, tap it lightly on the side of the eyeshadow case to remove any excess., Use a black or brown pencil and apply along the rim of your upper lash line in short strokes.











Lift your upper lid with one hand and look down into a mirror as you apply with your other hand.Eyeliner is one of the areas that you can really experiment with as you become more confident applying makeup. Factors like color, texture, and line application can have a big impact on the appearance of your peepers. Play around!

, Place a lash curler at the base of your upper eyelashes (along the lid) and press for five seconds.










, Apply to the upper and lower lashes with the tip of the wand oriented towards the outer corner of your eye. One coat should suffice for this look.










, Smile as you do this so you can clearly see where the apples are. Dab on the blush and blend upwards towards your temples.











Try a cream blush for a natural glow that's easy to blend in.If you opt for powder blush, use a brush that's fluffy yet dense. Dust translucent powder over it to blend the edges., Pucker your lips like you're about to plant a kiss and dab the lip color to the center of your upper and lower lip. This first application can be straight from the tube; then, use your fingers to blend outwards, adding color with your fingertips as needed.











If your lips are chapped, prep them before putting on lip color. Gently buff them with a warm, damp washcloth and put on a light layer of lip balm. Let the balm absorb before moving on to lipstick or gloss.For beginners, the lips are a great opportunity to add color and vary your makeup regime without having to fuss over application technique, etc. You can work with anything from neutral, barely-there gloss to creamy, fire-engine red.

",How to Wear Eye Makeup," If you use a cream blush though, some people prefer adding that as a last step.;
, You can use a not-too-bright cream eyeshadow or concealer for this instead of a ""real"" eye primer.

, Gather 3 shades of the same color (ex. light beige, gold, dark brown).

,,, Voila!

, Blend the eyeliner into your upper lashline; it should be thickest right between the middle and the outer corner of your eyelid. You can also wing out your liquid liner. For eye lining on your lower lid, rub it onto your waterline. Keep it light, though.

,, First, have the right shade. If your complexion is light, opt for a dark brown/brown-black. Otherwise, black should be fine. Set your wand at the base of your eyelashes and wiggle it all the way up. Repeat until all your lashes are coated. Dip the wand in the tube, and repeat a second, third.. time. Then, do the same to your other eye. If you want to mascara your lower lashes, wipe off the tip of the wand, then touch them lightly with the tip.

",How to Wear Eye Makeup Like Alicia Keys," Whatever you usually use should do, although an air brush effect type foundation is a good choice.;
, To prevent the creasing and fading of your eyeshadow, use an eyeshadow powder primer.

, This will go on your eyelid. If you have a skin tone closer to Alicia Key's, you'll want to go for a champagne color. For paler skin, go lighter, and for darker skin, go warmer. Whichever shade you go with, make sure it has some shimmer.

, The color, once again, depends on your skin tone. Since this is a smokey eye, make sure it's a bit darker than the first color you used on the lid. A light brown would work well. When you apply the shadow, the outer corner is lifted just a bit.

, To make it look more subtle, blend it a little bit with your finger.

, Extend the shadow slightly along the bottom lash line and up toward the brow.

,, Blend it with the white. (Note: Blend, don't cover. You want it to look similar to smudged eyeliner.)

, Starting in the center, go straight out, then curve up a bit in a wing. (The wing doesn't have to be perfect, because you'll smudge it out with a brush in a bit). After you make the wing, finish along the lash line, staying as close to it as possible. Go all the way to your corner.

, (Note: When smudging, do both eyes at once so that they are even and look the same)

, Bring it all the way down to the inner corner again.


Optional: Use black eyeliner pencil to go along the water line on the bottom, but not touching the lash line

Foundation will help even out your skin tone, and concealer will hide blemishes and discoloration. The key is to apply each sparingly.









Put a small dollop of primer on your finger and apply a thin layer all over your face.Give it a moment to dry, and repeat the same process with your foundation.
Only use concealer where necessary, such as to cover dark spots under the eyes, on blemishes, and to cover spots, flaws, veins, or redness. Apply small dabs of concealer where necessary, then blend with your finger.To set everything in place, consider applying a thin layer of finishing powder, which will help your makeup last longer and prevent oiliness.;
, The tricks with blush are choosing the right color, applying it in the right spot, and not putting on too much. Take a blush brush and dab it into your blush once or twice only.









Use sweeping strokes to apply a thin layer to your cheekbones.
Blow the excess makeup off the brush and then blend the blush into your skin until the lines completely disappear., For a basic everyday look, stick with pink shades, a natural gloss, or a cream lipstick that’s similar to your natural lip color. The trick with lipstick is to blend it into your lips with your finger after applying it, because this will soften the look.








If you find you’ve put on too much lipstick and want to get some off without starting over, take a piece of paper and give it a kiss with your full lips. Don’t blot lipstick with facial or bathroom tissue, as these leave white fibers on your lips., With a liquid or pencil eyeliner, apply a thin line of liner to the lash line on your top lashes. Try to get as close as possible to the lash line to keep the look subtle. For some extra definition, gradually make the line a little thicker in the middle, but taper it off to a thin line at the inner and outer corners.









To extend the length of your eye, slightly extend the liner beyond the outer corner, following the direction of your lashes.
For definition on the bottom eye lid, choose a liner that’s lighter than the one you used on the top, otherwise you will create an overly dramatic look. Be sure to keep the line thin and right at the lower lash line.
Instead of eyeliner, you can also use a thin line of powder eyeshadow as eyeliner., After eyeliner comes mascara, and the trick to mascara is making sure that it’s not so thick that it’s clumpy and unnatural looking. Pull the wand out of the bottle and, starting at the base of your top lash line, zig zag the wand back and forth across your lashes as you work your way toward the lash tips.









For a subtle look, only apply one or two coats. If necessary, go back with a clean wand or brush to brush out any clumps.
If you like, you can also apply a coat to the bottom lashes in the same way, but make sure it’s a light coat.

, You can wear a full face of makeup without overdoing it, and this even includes wearing eyeshadow. But to do this, you must use colors that complement your undertone and that are appropriate for your skin tone, and you must blend all the colors together.









Choose a color for your eyeshadow and select a base shade, a lighter shade, and a darker shade.
Apply the base shade all over your entire upper lid, then do a couple swipes with the lighter shade just below your brow. Use the darker shade in the crease to add definition. Blend all the colors with a clean brush.
If you are going to wear eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara, be sure to apply them in that order.

, You don’t want to draw your eyebrows on, as that will look overly dramatic and noticeable. Instead, you want to give some extra depth, shape, and color to them. Use the natural shade and shape of your eyebrows to guide you.








With a brow pencil that’s similar to your natural eyebrow color, apply short strokes of color to your eyebrows, then work the color through with an eyebrow brush or comb., If you went with a natural look for your eyes, you can get away with a brighter and bolder choice for your lips without overdoing your makeup.









Steer clear of darker colors like brown and magenta, and instead go with brighter reds and pinks.If you're going for a bold color, apply the lipstick with a lip brush, as this will prevent streaks, which are much more noticeable with a bright color., Your undertone is the color of your skin beneath the surface layer, and this never changes. Some colors complement each other better than others, so choosing makeup that doesn’t match your undertone can make you look ill, and it can make your makeup look very apparent and unnatural. Plus, your makeup won’t flatter your features the way it should when it’s the wrong color.


When you have a cool undertone, you tend to burn quickly in the sun, look best in silver jewelry, and have blue veins at the wrist.When you have a warm undertone, you tend to bronze in the sun, look better in gold jewelry, and have green veins at the wrist.
Neutral is the third undertone, and this means you'll look good in gold and silver, and will have blue-green veins at the wrist., When choosing a foundation, you want it to match your skin and complement your undertone. Using a foundation that’s the wrong shade will make your makeup look obvious and fake. Similarly, with a concealer, opt for a shade that’s just one or two shades lighter than your foundation.








Choose a lightweight foundation as well, otherwise your makeup will look thick and pancake-like. Lightweight foundations come in the form of liquids and powders. To identify them, look for words like “light,” “bare,” and “nude,” which denote that the foundation will provide light coverage.
When testing foundations, test it on your jawline to make sure it will match the skin on your face and not stand out against your neck.
Look for foundation in shades of cocoa, porcelain, rose, or sable if your undertone is cool. Go for golden, tan, caramel, chestnut, or beige if you're warm. If you have a neutral undertone, opt for nude, buff, ivory, or praline., One of the best ways to avoid overdoing makeup is to choose eyeliner and eye shadow colors that are neutral or that only have a hint of non-neutral color.Moreover, if you go neutral and natural with your eyes, you can get away with a bolder color on your lips, and vice versa.For instance, brown eyeliner will be less dramatic than black, but you can use a red-brown if that color complements you and brings out your eyes. And if you stick with neutral browns for the eyes, consider a brighter and more vibrant shade for your lips.
To choose colors based on your undertone, stick with blues, purples, greens, beiges, pinks, and berry colors if you're cool. If you're warm, go for earth tones in reds, yellows, browns, greens, and peaches. People with neutral undertones can wear all these colors, but the most complementary will be raspberries, lemons, and lavender shades., Just as the colors in your clothing outfits should match or complement each other, so too should your cosmetics colors, especially when it comes to blush and lipstick.








To wear blush and lipstick without overdoing it, it’s important to choose makeup shades based on how fair or dark your skin is. The paler your skin, the lighter your makeup should be; similarly, the darker your skin, the darker your makeup can be.
For fair skin, try blush and a complementary lipstick (in the same color family) in plum or light pink. For dark skin, go for tangerine or raisin. For olive skin, try rose or bronze."

Based on the results, gain a clearer picture of the schedule that you will need to follow for your skin to achieve a base tan. Exact results may vary from person to person, but skin types generally fall into the following categories:Type 1: Extremely pale and/or white skin that burns quickly but resists tanning. The skin is usually freckled all over. Other features denoting people with Type 1 include red hair and blue or green eyes.

Type 2: Skin that is more beige in color than Type 1, but still burns easily without tanning. People with Type 2 tend to be brunette or blond, moderately freckled, and blue- or green-eyed.

Type 3: Skin is naturally light brown and may burn after too much sun exposure, but typically tans first. Type 3 people often have brown hair and eyes.

Type 4: Skin is naturally light brown or olive in color. Type 4 skin tans with little difficulty, but may still burn over prolonged periods in the sun. People with Type 4 are usually brunettes with darker brown eyes than Type 3.

Type 5: Skin is naturally browned and tans with little or no difficulty while seldom burning, if ever. People with Type 5 typically have extremely dark brown hair as well as eyes.;
, If needed, have an attendant help you determine your skin type. Then develop a regime to follow in order to acquire a base tan over multiple sessions. The exact regime may vary from one salon to another due to the power and UV output of their equipment, but expect a schedule similar to the following guidelines:Type 1: It is strongly recommended that people with Type 1 skin should never use sunbeds, due to their sensitivity to ultraviolet rays. However, if you persist, start off with sessions no longer than 1 minute. After three or more sessions, add another minute, but only if your skin still feels cool and comfortable after the first minute.

Type 2: Limit yourself to 2 minutes for the first two sessions. Then add another minute for the next three, unless your skin begins to feel warm and/or uncomfortable after the first two minutes. If you still feel fine after three minutes of exposure, add another minute to your last session, for a total of six sessions.

Type 3: Start with a 2-minute session. As long as your skin feels cool afterward, add another minute for your next two sessions. Bump it up to 4 minutes for your fourth and fifth session, unless your skin feels warmer than normal after the first 3 minutes. Finally, increase the time to 5 minutes for your last session, for a total of six sessions.

Type 4: Begin with a 3-minute session. Follow that with a 4-minute session. Then increase your exposure to 5 minutes for your next two sessions. Add another minute for your last two sessions, for a total of six sessions. If your skin begins to feel uncomfortable at any point along the way, reduce the time to a safer amount of exposure.

Type 5: Start with a 3-minute session. Then add another minute to your following session. Try 5 minutes for your third. If your skin still feels relatively cool after each session, add another minute to each following session until you reach 8 minutes for your final session.

, Find out if the salon offers more than one style of sunbed. Ask the staff to help you decide which one is best for you, based on your skin type and desired effect. Also, ask them to clarify the length of time that you should limit each session to for each type of bed.Low pressure beds aim to replicate the UV output of actual sunlight.

High pressure beds alter the UV output to create a less temporary tan in a shorter amount of time.

, Use the provided cleaning solution to spray and wipe down the bed before climbing in. The previous customer and/or staff may have already done so, but do it anyway to rest assured that the bed has been disinfected. If you do not find a cleaning solution on hand, ask the staff for some."

Protect your eyes.,
Remove clothing as desired.,
Apply sunscreen and tan accelerator.",How to Use Sunbeds2," Shield them from UV rays with goggles that are specifically designed for sunbed-use. Rent or borrow one from the salon, depending on their policy. Invest in a pair of your own if you plan on making regular visits. Do not trust your eyelids, sunglasses, other forms of eye-wear to protect your eyes.If you use a pair that belongs to the salon, make sure they have been cleaned since the last customer used them. A salon that does not use a cleaning solution to disinfect their eyewear may also prove to be unhygienic in other areas.A lack of eye protection increases the risk of cataracts, conjunctivitis, and irritation., Wear underwear or swimming gear to only tan those areas that will be visible to the public. Be mindful of where tanlines will appear. Wear briefs, speedos, or bikinis to show tanned flesh even when your shorts, skirt, or dress pulls up, thus exposing more leg. Or eliminate tan lines altogether and tan naked if permitted by the salon.Before tanning naked, be advised that your nipples, genitals, and other delicate areas may burn before the rest of your body does.

, Minimize the harm of UV light by protecting yourself with sunscreen.Apply it wherever your skin is exposed. Wait a quarter of an hour before using the sunbed so your skin has time to absorb it.Minimize your risk further by also using tan accelerator to acquire your desired tan in a shorter amount of time.Sunscreen will help minimize the skin damage caused by UV light, but it won't eliminate it entirely.
Use SPF-30 sunscreen or higher, even if you typically use a weaker formula outdoors. Remember that the sun is billions of miles from Earth, but the sunbed's lights are only a few inches from your skin.
Although tanning accelerators contain ingredients that help defend your skin from the effects of ultraviolet light, they are not the same as SPF sunscreen. Do not use the two products interchangeably.Check your accelerator’s ingredients to make sure it includes L-tyrosine. Be aware that simple moisturizers are able to advertise themselves as tan accelerators, even without this active ingredient. This is only because moist skin technically does tan quicker than dry skin. However, a moisturizer will have minimal effect in a sunbed.

Moisturize.,
Give your skin a rest before your next session.,
Stick to a reasonable number of sessions per year.",How to Use Sunbeds3," Expect each sunbed session to continue to effect your skin well after the session ends. Apply moisturizer as needed over the next 12 hours or more to keep your skin from drying out, since moist skin tans more effectively than dry skin. Be doubly certain to do this if you shower, swim, sweat profusely, or are otherwise exposed to liquids after tanning, since these activities may wash off previous applications., Wait 24 hours at the bare minimum before tanning yourself again, whether indoors or outdoors. If you have Type 2 skin, wait at least 48 hours before your next session. To err on the side of caution, wait 72 hours, regardless of your skin type.Again, people with Type 1 skin should refrain from tanning in general. If you decide to do so anyway, always give your overly sensitive skin the maximum amount of rest in between sessions.

, Limit yourself to a maximum of two or three per week if you only tan seasonally. If you plan on tanning all year long, stick to roughly once per week. Limit yourself to 60 sessions in total for the entire year to avoid overexposure."

Be aware that UV rays are linked to skin cancer.,
Consider your age.,
Take any medications into account.,
Expect damage to take a long time to manifest.,
Continue using sunscreen.",How to Use Sunbeds4," Expect prolonged exposure to either natural or artificial light to increase the risk of melanoma. Be especially mindful of those areas of your body that do not normally receive much direct light. Refrain from tanning naked in sunbeds if your private parts rarely see the light of the day.If you or any relative has suffered skin cancer in the past, consider this a warning sign that you are at much greater risk. Do not use sunbeds if your family has a history of melanoma.

, The younger you are, the greater the danger posed by UV rays. Sunbed use is often forbidden to anyone under the age of 18 accordingly. However, continue to regard yourself as a likely candidate for melanoma well after that. Use sunbeds sparingly or abstain from them entirely until you are 25 or older., If you are currently taking any medication or topical creams, whether they are prescribed or over-the-counter, read the directions before tanning. Double-check for any warnings about extra sensitivity to sunlight. If the directions advise limiting your exposure to natural sunlight, take that to mean that you shouldn’t use a sunbed, either.Consult your doctor about possible ramifications from medications that they prescribe for you, as well as any other health factors that may elevate your risk of skin cancer.

, Be aware that the negative impacts of sunburn and overexposure may take as many as 20 years to show themselves. Refrain from tanning yourself and risking further damage if you have repeatedly suffered sunburns in the past. Be twice as reluctant to use sunbeds if you suffered those sunburns in your childhood, when you were most at risk of developing long-term damage., Although some debate persists as to whether a base tan protects you against sunburn, err on the side of caution. Consider tanning as a natural reaction to previous overexposure in an attempt to prevent further damage. Use sunscreen and other forms of protection to avoid sunburn, rather than rely on your base tan to do the job for you.Skin Types 1 and 2 should use a SPF-30 sunscreen or an even stronger SPF. So should anyone with a personal or family history of skin cancer or any other condition that makes them more sensitive to sunlight.Skin Types 3, 4 and 5 should be safe to use a SPF-15 formula. However, using a stronger sunscreen is still advisable.Give your skin a quarter of an hour to absorb the sunscreen before braving the sunshine. Check the directions for its lasting power. Never wait longer than two hours to apply more. Reapply more frequently when swimming or sweating profusely.

Apply blurring powder after your regular makeup.,
Shake the container to loosen the powder.,
Pat it on your face using a brush or pad.,
Do another layer if necessary.",How to Use Blurring Powder1," Blurring powder is generally used to enhance existing makeup and help further smooth over any inconsistencies in your skin tone. Before applying blurring powder, put on your makeup as you regularly would. Once you're finished with your normal makeup routine, you can apply the powder as necessary., Blurring powder sometimes gets stuck on the bottom of the container. This is especially true if the container is new. To loosen the powder for use, shake the container lightly before opening it. When opened, there should be a light layer of blurring powder on top of the container., Dab a pad or makeup brush into the container, getting a light dusting of blurring powder on the pad or brush. Then, gently dab the powder onto your face. Use brief, patting motions throughout your face to apply the powder. You should apply a layer of blurring powder over all your regular makeup. This should make your makeup look more even.If your makeup looks particularly uneven or sparse in certain areas, target these areas a little more when applying blurring powder.
Make sure to use gentle motions. Moving too fast can cause blurring powder to create dust, which can cause sneezing and coughing., After you're done applying powder, examine your face. Some blurring powder is very sheer, and your face may not look much different after the first layer. If you believe it is necessary, add another layer of blurring powder. You can also simply add a layer on areas that look particularly sparse, like your chin or forehead."
"
Erase pores with blurring powder.,
Conceal troublesome areas.,
Use blurring powder when you'll be under harsh light.,
Apply blurring powder to your lips.",How to Use Blurring Powder2," Blurring powder is generally applied after your regular makeup. However, if you have large pores around certain areas, like your nose or chin, blurring powder can be used to diminish their effect. It can create a smooth surface on your skin before applying regular makeup, which can seep into pores and make them more noticeable.If you have pores you want to conceal, add a layer of blurring powder over areas where pores appear. Then, apply your regular makeup.

, Things like inconsistency in skin tone and wrinkles are easier to conceal with blurring powder than other cosmetic products. Blurring powders are designed to create an airbrush effect similar to something like Photoshop. If you have problem areas, dust a layer of blurring powder over these areas before applying your regular makeup., You do not necessarily need to use blurring powder for an every day look. It can take awhile to apply and may not be necessary in some circumstances. However, if you're going to be under harsh, bright lights, blurring powder can give an extra boost to your regular makeup, better concealing imperfections.For example, use blurring powder if you're going to be out in the sun all day.

, If you want matte lips, but do not want to pay the extra money for supplies, blurring powder can be used to create the effect. Use a glossy lipstick. Then, blot on some blurring powder with a piece of tissue. Keep blotting until you reach your desired effect."
"
Switch up your tools if necessary.,
Do not use blurring powder on irritated or damaged skin.,
Stop using if you notice a bad reaction.,
Store your powder correctly.",How to Use Blurring Powder3," Blurring powder can create dust when applied. Different powders may respond better to different tools. If your blurring powder scatters while you're applying a layer, try switching up tools to see if this helps. For example, switch from using a makeup pad to a brush., If your skin is burnt, damaged, or otherwise irritated, do not try to cover this with blurring powder or any makeup. Allow damaged skin to heal completely before concealing it with makeup., If you've never used a product before, there is always a risk of a bad reaction. Stop using blurring powder and talk to a doctor if you notice any of the following:Red blotches
Swelling
Itchiness
Irritation

, Blurring powder should be kept out of reach of children and pets. You should also keep it out of direct sunlight. Store it in a location that is regular room temperature. Extreme heat or extreme cold can damage blurring powder."

Learn how to remove makeup.",How to Start Wearing Makeup," It's not a foregone conclusion that you have to wear makeup. It is a choice whether or not to use makeup and for some people, it just doesn't work out or interest them. If you want to wear makeup, be sure that it is because it pleases you to do so, not just because your friends are doing it or you feel pressured by other people to do it.;
, Just as it is a choice to wear or not wear makeup, you can decide to wear a little or a lot of makeup. It's entirely up to you, and there are even tutorials on wearing makeup so as to look as if you're not wearing any (the natural look) or wearing very little makeup but making the most of the little you do wear. However, it is a good idea to prefer ""less is best"" when first wearing makeup, to give you time to develop your application skills, to find your style and to avoid shocking people when they see you in makeup for the first time.

, You might want to wear it daily, just for special events or every now and then. You probably won't want to wear it for sports, outdoor activities such as camping, swimming or hiking. You probably want it for formal events such as your prom or a party. Usually it isn't appropriate to wear it to school or for some after-school activities.

, Also understand what each element is for. Makeup consists of such items as:


Foundation/powder: For covering the face to make it appear of one consistency.
Concealer: For covering up blemishes such as under-eye dark circles or a large pimple. If your skin is fine, you don't need concealer or foundation. Same with bronzer if you are naturally tanned. Find the concealer and foundation that matches your skin color.
Eyeshadow, eyeliner: For enhancing the eyes.
Mascara: For adding definition and darker color to your eyelashes.
Blush/blusher: For adding color to your cheeks and cheekbones. Some people also use bronzer for adding color.
Lipstick: For adding color to your lips.
Lip gloss: For adding shine to your lips.
Makeup brushes, wipes, pads, etc.: To assist with the application and removal of makeup.

, If you think Aunt Sally's purple lipstick is awful, you might not like what she picks out for you, so go with someone who has good fashion sense in your eyes. For starters, purchase foundation, concealer, maybe some powder, and some lip gloss. Also get eyeliner, mascara and eyeshadow. And be sure to get makeup remover and wipes to round up all that you need to start with.


If you want to do some tricky makeup, buy a concealer that is lighter than your skin and one that is darker than your skin.
Buy a shade of brown eyeliner that is a close color to your eyelashes if you want a natural look.
If you have enough money, buy some gold or white eyeliner.
Mascara should be just a little bit darker than your lashes.
Nude lip gloss is a good choice if you want no one to notice but you'd like enhanced lips.
Avoid buying products that are glittery; these are not natural looking, they're messy and they're not a good place to start for beginners.

, Get a makeup bag or container to keep the makeup in for storage. You may also like to have a small makeup bag for portable use.

, It will come with practice, but it is best to start with small amounts and gradually build up your application skills. Have an experienced person show you what to do and help you to work out what works best for your face.

, Find a spot in your house where you can see your face with ease, that has excellent lighting and where you won't be bumping into things as you move your arms about to apply the makeup.

, They often have great tips on how to apply makeup and what brands and colors might work well for you.


Check out wikiHow's selection of makeup articles for illustrated examples of how to apply makeup. For example, see How to Apply Makeup, How to Apply Eye Makeup, How to Apply Makeup (for Teen Girls) and How to Apply Base Makeup.

, Since you don't normally wear makeup, putting on a whole lot of it may surprise people and it can also look fake and tacky if you don't know exactly what you're doing. Start off with a little lip gloss, some clear mascara, and a little powder or blush.

, Try these on at home first and ask others what they think. Learn which colors look best on you at which times of day and for which occasions. That lipstick might look good at a school dance, but it might look overdone during a school day.

, You must take it all off before you go to sleep. Usually, soap isn't enough, so get makeup remover when you buy the makeup.

Look at the logo and lettering on the packaging.,
Study the casing.,
Study the labels.,
Sniff the product.,
Check the name of the product.",How to Spot a Fake MAC Cosmetics Product1," MAC has a distinct logo and font used for all of their packaging, which is very sleek and stylized. Counterfeit products will have the same logo but it will either be stretched or manipulated in some way, or it will be placed in a different area of the packaging or casing than it would normally be. For example, the MAC logo is usually centered on its genuine products but a counterfeit may position the logo at the top or toward the bottom. Additionally, MAC uses capital letters for all of its packaging and lettering.Compare the lettering on the package to a MAC product you already have that you know is not counterfeit. If you observe obvious differences, you may have a counterfeit.;
, MAC products come in a casing that has tiny glitter particles on the surface, giving it a subtle shimmer. Counterfeit products will usually manufacture casings that are dull or have a different sheen in comparison. They are also often a slightly different shape, usually bulkier and/or larger than its genuine counterparts., The labels on the bottom of the casing is a great indicator of whether or not the product is genuine. MAC uses all caps on their labelling and labels are either gray with black print or white with a light gray print. The font used by counterfeit manufacturers tends to be bulkier and less sleek., MAC lipsticks have a faint sweet vanilla scent. The fakes will often smell like plastic or cheap perfume. If you’re unsure, take a whiff of the product; the smell should be able to give it away., Some fakes will have a name, but it may not be the name of any genuine MAC items or products. To find out, simply go to www.maccosmetics.com and click on the magnifying glass symbol in the upper right hand corner. Search for the name of the product. If it does not appear, it may either be a discontinued product or it is fake.

Clear fallout with cotton bud again.,
Finish up your eyes.,
Move onto bronzer.,
Add powder.,
Add a light pink natural colour to your lips, making sure it's gloss.",How to Recreate Jennifer Aniston's Oscar Makeup," Jennifer likes to know that her skin is clear and rid of any spots, just like anyone else. To get the finished look before you have even started, grab your concealer and dab (or smear) over places where foundation or spot treatment will not cure.


This is an optional step; however, it gives you confidence to go through the whole day without foundation wearing off and being worried that the spot is visible. If you need this look to last all day, take a bag and keep a small concealer handy.;
, Foundation is also very handy to keep your skin clear or even just to add a bit of colour. Foundation is not the time to add colour to your face; this is a bit later on. Right now, focus on getting a shade lighter than your skin tone to get that natural look that Jennifer has.


Never get a shade later, because many foundations develop or look darker in different shades; you don't want to look like a stick of butter.

, As Jennifer is a natural pretty woman, she doesn't need bright and colourful eyeshadow so you won't need to apply a thick layer of it either. To get the eyeshadow to last, it is advised that you buy a eye primer to keep the shadow on the lid and it also prevents fall out. Now, for the shadow, take an eyeshadow brush, which is one of those puffy soft pads, and pat a beige colour on your lid and get as much coverage as you want. Then, take a champagne colour and spread it over your crease and outer corner giving the feline effect but do not make it too visible, as this is not what Jennifer has done.


For any mistakes, take a cotton bud and use eye make up remover gel to squirt on the pad and go round the outline of the shadow and cover any mistakes.

, Tilt your eyelash curler on an angle so that it makes your eyelashes direct outwards.

, Get a thick brushed mascara with clump free label on it and brush it outwards; do lots of strokes as this makes a wispy effect.

, Use an eyebrow pencil/eyebrow kit with eye shadow to outline your eyebrows to give that soft look to your eyebrows. If you are looking to look like Jennifer Aniston, then have a closer look at her eyebrows and follow the shape of them; maybe the colour if your eyebrows aren't too dark. Use an angled brush to do this.

, Fill in your eye shadow again and eye brows to prevent having gaps or lighter spaces in the eye area.

, Buy a wispy pair of eyelashes and glue them on to the closest part of your lash line and add a thin layer of eye liner to make your eyes pop! Make sure you leave the glue to get tacky before you apply, press down on your eyelashes in place for 10-15 seconds. This will make sure that the lashes are applied properly. When you open your eye look all around 5 times and then wiggle your eye lashes with tweezers to make sure they are to your standard. Once you are happy, move on.

, Now is the time to add colour to your face - as much colour as you want as long as you don't look like a pumpkin. To get the even look, contour in the cheeks and in the temple area and then using the excess of the bronzer on the forehead and down the nose. You could even contour your nose using an angled brush again making your nose look thinner than it is. Contour using a powder brush.

, Use a translucent colour that will just set the makeup, making it last longer. Then, put the powder and powder brush into your bag, along with the concealer.

, If you are feeling adventurous, try a lip gloss that plumps your lips like the soap and glory mother pucker. Also, add the lip gloss to your bag so you can top up on that.

Rub the pad of your finger on the product.,
Swipe your finger on the inside of your arm.,
Observe the pigmentation of the makeup.",How to Spot a Fake MAC Cosmetics Product2," If you are swatching a pressed powder such as eyeshadow or blush, you should press the pad of your finger lightly on the surface of the makeup and rub it in circles a few times. This will lift the product from the casing onto your finger.


Notice the consistency of the product. Sometimes fakes are creamier or softer than the genuine products. Don’t be fooled by this.
If you are swatching lipstick or any other makeup that uses an applicator, rub the product directly onto the skin. For example, run the tip of a lipstick directly onto the surface of the skin to see how the color appears.
If you do not want to use your fingers, you can also use a brush. Rub the brush on the product in order to coat the bristles with enough product to transfer it to your skin. Try a concealer or eyeshadow brush, which can be obtained at any beauty supply store.

, Once you have some of the product on your finger, gently swipe it along the inside of your arm, where the skin is soft and hairless. You can also do this on the back of your hand, whichever is easier for you. The goal is to see how the makeup appears on the skin., The counterfeit MAC products usually have less pigmentation than the genuine ones and will require you to go over the surface of your skin two or more times to be able to clearly see the color on the surface of the skin. Swatching it next to a similar or identical product should allow you to see the discrepancies between the two products.

Look closely at the pictures.,

Consider purchasing directly from the source.,
Report counterfeits directly to MAC.",How to Spot a Fake MAC Cosmetics Product3," When looking at an online posting for makeup, observe the pictures closely to see how much detail the seller is providing. If you can clearly see the labels and the product itself, it may safe to purchase. If you are unsure in any way, it may be best to avoid purchasing from that seller.

, If the deal is too good to be true, then chances are that it is a fake MAC product. For example, if an item is being sold for $10, and the retail price at the MAC counter is $30, you should be wary of purchasing that product., To save yourself the headache of purchasing fake MAC products, consider buying the makeup directly from the MAC makeup counter or ordering it online from MAC’s website. This will give you confidence that you will be receiving the genuine product, instead of inadvertently giving in to gimmicky fakes.

, If you accidentally receive fake MAC makeup or notice fake makeup from an unauthorized seller or boutique, contact MAC to report the counterfeits. You can do this by visiting their website at www.maccosmetics.com and clicking “Counterfeit Education” in the menu at the bottom of the page.Call the 800-number provided on the website under “Counterfeit Education” and give the seller’s name and address (if you have that information), the type of location (i.e. whether it’s eBay, an independent boutique or other), the product(s) that are being sold, and the trademark details.

Highlight your best assets.,
Disguise your weaknesses.",How to Shop for Makeup1," Buying makeup is a waste of time if you’re not going to use it. If you’re the kind of person who only wears a little mascara, buying a large quantity of skin products isn’t going to help you. Likewise, if you already own four bright red lipsticks, one more isn’t going to make a difference.Before heading to the store, make a list of products you need or would actually use. Then purchase only these items.
Go through your makeup and check to see what’s already expired. Make a list of any products you need to replenish.;
, Everyone’s coloring is different, and the shade that looks amazing on your best friend might not paint you in the best light. Try going to a department store or specialty makeup store for a color consultation.If you have fair skin, shop for products in soft pink, tawny and beige. Avoid orangey reds.
If you have medium- fair skin, shop for products with yellow and gold undertones.
If you have medium-dark skin, shop for products in browns, like caramel and honey.
If you have dark skin, shop for products in metallic hues, like copper or bronze.

, The best way to avoid wearing too much makeup (or spending too much money on makeup) is to focus on your best features. Play up the features you're most proud of and let the rest of your makeup be a little more natural.If you have amazing eyes, spend your money on eyeliner and eye-shadow.
If your eyelashes are long, buy an eyelash curler and mascara.
If you have killer cheekbones, shop for blush, bronzer, and an illuminator.
If you have a full mouth, shop for lipstick.

, Makeup is ideal for covering up or disguising your flaws. If you’re insecure about something on your face, shop for products that will help downplay that insecurity.If you get bad under-eye circles, invest in a good concealer.

Buy your foundation at a specialty store.,
Choose a lipstick that looks and feels good.,
Pick your concealer based on what you’re concealing.,
Shop for a mascara that works with your lashes.",How to Shop for Makeup2," Drugstores have a good supply of foundation, but what they don’t offer is a way to try on the product. Foundation needs to match your skin perfectly, so it’s important that you try it on at a store that offers tester strips, like MAC or Sephora.Look for foundations with built-in sun protection, so you don’t have to apply yours separately.
If you have to shop at a drugstore, look for a foundation in a neutral tone. Avoid anything with overtones of other colors (yellow, peach, pink, copper, etc).
If you have bad skin, splurge on the best foundation you can afford. The higher quality will help even out your skin tone without aggravating your acne.

, The biggest mistake people make when shopping for lipstick is only considering color. Choosing a lipstick that works with the color of your skin is important, but it’s not the only factor that counts.Walk around the store and see how the color holds up over time.
Consider how easy or difficult the lipstick is to apply. If it’s hard to apply, you won’t wear it often.
Think about if the lipstick feels good on your lips. If it’s too dry, it won’t be comfortable.
For a natural lipstick color, choose a color that either matches or is slightly darker than your natural lip shade.

, Concealer is meant to conceal small areas, not to be used as an all-over foundation. If you’re just evening out a few small blemishes, look for a concealer with light coverage.If you have dry skin, steer clear of liquid concealers.
If you have oily skin or enlarged pores, avoid stick concealers.
For dark circles, select a concealer with at least medium coverage.

, Different types of lashes require different treatments, so it’s important to match your mascara with your needs. If you have very straight lashes, you’ll also need to invest in an eyelash curler.If your lashes are short, look for a mascara with a lengthening formula.
If you have dry eyes, use a mascara with a wax-based formula.
Skip the waterproof mascara – it’s harder to remove.

Ask your associate about this.
If you’re unsure how to apply a product, your associate can also teach you how to do this.

, If you’re brand new to shopping for makeup, you may want to bring a friend to the store with you. You friend can weigh in on color options and tell you whether an item is worth purchasing or passing on.If you can’t find a friend to accompany you, take pictures on your cell-phone. Sometimes, makeup looks different on camera than it does in real life.

, Your skin changes throughout the year, so it stands to reason you should have different makeup for different parts of the year. When you buy bronzer, buy two shades so you can match your skin tone as it changes.If you’re buying bronzer in the summer, buy an additional shade lighter to use in the winter.
If you’re buying bronzer in the winter, buy an additional shade darker to use in the summer.

, Perfume smells different from the time you initially spray it to the time it dries on your body. When testing perfumes, spray a little on your wrist, then wait two minutes before checking the smell.If you’re going to be testing multiple perfumes, spray the fragrances on tester strips so their scents don’t intermingle.

, Lighting affects your makeup significantly, and the way your skin looks in the store may not be the way it looks outside. When shopping for foundation or skin powder, ask for a sample, then try that sample out at home and outside before committing.If your store doesn’t give samples, try the product on, then head outside to look in a mirror.

, If you’re purchasing a new-to-you product, buy the smallest option. The biggest bottle may save you money long-term, but if you never wear it, it’s a complete waste of money.Buy the smallest bottle and upgrade later when you run out.
If you love something, buy a second travel sized bottle so you can take your products with you on planes.

, Not everyone will have the same experience with the same product, but reviews will be able to give you some insight into a product’s long-term durability and usefulness.


Do extra research when you’re investing in something you’ll use for years, like makeup brushes.Don’t buy new colors of products online. Use online shopping to re-up on items you already know work for you.

, If you don't know a product's purpose or how to apply it, ask. It's worthless to buy anything if once you get home you can't use it.

, It is highly recommended (especially to those with sensitive skin) trying out a product before purchasing it. Ask for a makeover or a mini-facial first. Many counters ask you to purchase items to receive these services, but at least this way you don't have to worry about having a problem returning it because you can take a day before using your purchase and see how you like it and if it's color, you can see how others like it.

",How to Put on Makeup for a Party," Pick a nice, bright color for the base. Then, once you have smoothed the lipstick over 2-3 times, and defined your Cupid's bow, you can put on some glittery lip gloss.;
, You'll want a nice, light color for highlighting, and maybe a lighter pink for the actual blush. Don't overdo it- you don't want to look like you are in Clown City!

, Pick a color that maybe is in your outfit, but doesn't stand out too much. That will make the color in your dress pop out more. The reason why we want you doing eyeliner first is because if you do mascara first, you may not be able to line the waterline too well, or above. That is because the mascara may smudge, and who knows- it may look like you have overlapped and maybe will look like you were too lazy to correct it.

, Don't go for a colorful shade if you already have quite a few colors going on near your waterline. It may look like you are trying too hard. So, go for a black, duo mascara and do about 3-4 coats of it. Try to use water-proofed mascara as well; they have less clumps.

, Pick only one color for the lid, and only one color for the crease. Try to match these colors with small accessories such as bracelets, shoes or earrings. Do this carefully, and try to limit the number of sweeping motions you do on the lid unless you are going for more of a smokey eyed looks than a regular flash-the-lid look. Instead, do the dabbing motion gently. This may take a while, but it is really worth it. For the crease, to the opposite. Some people prefer to use liner if they want a black crease, as in, pencil liner, but I prefer not to. Your choice!

Get a palette - buy a 21 pan palette and de-pot them and take the eyeshadows out.,
Mix your ingredients - use a small metal cup (or a 5-10g jar will work as well) and a spatula.,
Empty your pigment into your cup and add some alcohol.

,
Start with a few drops, and add more as you need it.,
Mix it up until it's a little creamy, not too watery.,
Use the mini spatula to put the pigment mixture evenly into the pan.

,
To press the makeup- If it's watery and still wet, you'll have to wait for it to dry slightly.,
Put the quarter behind the fabric and press onto the pigment mixture.",How to Press Mac Pigments," The pans aren't metal, some think that they're made out of aluminum, so you have to be a little extra careful not to break through it. The palette retails for $10 (or $10.50) and they're buy one, get one 50% off!;
, Typically, about 1/2-3/4 tsp of each pigment should be enough. You don't want to mix too much or else the excess will press out of the sides of the pan.

,, It's much easier that way.

, Make sure that it's all the same consistency. But if you do add too much alcohol, it's okay, you'll just have to wait longer until you can press it into a pan.

,, You should wait an hour or so before pressing them, depending on the consistency. If it's too wet, it will leak out of the pan. It's better to do it when it's drier than wetter. Some take a cotton t-shirt and a quarter to press.

, Press hard! Some people recommend a flower press but some get pretty good results using their own hands. The cloth will get slightly damp, that's ok, that's just the alcohol being absorbed. Give it a couple of presses, really hard, and lift up the shirt and quarter and voila! You now have your very own pressed pigment eyeshadow! Some colors will push out green or red alcohol. Don't be worried about that changing the color. The color on these shades remain the same whether they are used loose or pressed.

Use salicylic acid if you have oily skin.,
Use a creamy or foaming cleanser for dry skin.,
Try oil-free makeup remover.,
Choose an emulsifying cream for sensitive skin.,
Wash your face after you remove your makeup.",How to Pick the Right Makeup Remover1," If your skin is oily or a combination of oily and dry, choose a makeup remover that has salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it. Both ingredients will help to soak up excess oil while the cleanser removes your makeup., If you have dry skin, use a makeup remover that is creamy or foams when you massage it in to your skin. This restores moisture to your skin at the same time that the chemicals in the cleanser break down and remove your makeup., If you’re concerned about your makeup remover clogging up your pores, try an oil-free makeup remover. This type of makeup remover tends to be gentler. Keep in mind that you might need to wipe down your face two or three times with this type of remover.Oil-free makeup removers are good for all skin types, so feel free to use them no matter what type of skin you have.

, If you have sensitive skin, avoid makeup removers with foaming formulas. Instead, get a cream makeup remover that you massage into your skin and then rinse off.

Avoid foam for eye makeup remover.,
Try micellar water.,
Use an oil-based makeup remover.,
Be gentle.",How to Pick the Right Makeup Remover2," You don’t want to use the same makeup remover on your eyes as you do on your face, because the skin around your eyes is very sensitive. Avoid foaming cleansers in particular, because they can easily get into your eyes and you'll likely have to scrub to get your makeup off., Micellar water is a type of cleanser that uses water mixed with minerals that attract dirt. It won’t foam up while you’re using it, but the chemical composition of micellar water will attract dirt. However, you might have to wipe two or three times to get all of your waterproof makeup off., Since eye makeup – especially mascara and eyeliner – tends to be waterproof, using a water-based makeup remover won’t always work best. Instead, try an oil-based makeup remover that will dissolve your makeup more quickly. This is also the best type of remover if you’re in a hurry since you’ll really only need one wipe., Avoid scrubbing your eyelids or lashes and touching the very sensitive area under your eyes. Instead, apply a small amount of your chosen makeup remover to a cotton pad or cotton ball, and hold it over your lashes and eyelid for a minute or two before gently wiping the makeup away."

Don’t use nontraditional removers that clog pores.,
Avoid fragrances and preservatives.",How to Pick the Right Makeup Remover3," Many makeup removers include alcohol as one of their main ingredients because it can easily break down the tough chemical composition of a lot of makeup. However, exposing your skin to alcohol-based removers on a regular basis can damage your skin over time, so avoid using them when you can., Some websites suggests using nontraditional makeup removers like baby oil. This helps you stay away from makeup removers that have alcohol in them, but using something like baby oil can also clog your pores. You want your makeup remover to remove product from your face, not just add new stuff, so try to avoid those types of removers., A lot of makeup companies add fragrances to their makeup removers to make them more attractive to consumers. However, if you have sensitive skin, fragrances can actually irritate your skin. Avoid them when you can.Fragrance-free makeup removers are also best if you have acne, since they won’t irritate your skin further.If you don’t have sensitive skin, you can use removers with fragrances if you like, but the purer the composition of your makeup remover, the better.

Apply foundation.,
Pick the right shade.,
Apply contour lines to the sides of to your nose.,
Apply contours at the tip of your nose.,
Apply a highlight.,
Blend the contour lines.",How to Make a Long Nose Appear Smaller and Thinner1," You need to start by applying your foundation and powder like normal. This will help you know what color you need to use when you contour your nose.


Make sure your foundation matches your skin tone as closely as possible. You don't want to draw unnecessary attention to your face by having it appear a lighter or darker color than normal.Try applying it to your hand, or anywhere that the skin is the same tone as your face; it could also help to seek out any allergies you may have against the product.
Setting your foundation in powder can help with contouring your nose. Your skin will be free of shine, helping to disguise the angles of your face. It will also help set the contour lines you draw by giving the powder something to blend with.;
, You are going to use a powder makeup to contour the areas around your nose. You need to find a powder or eye shadow that is one to two shades darker than your normal foundation. This will help create the darker contour areas, making them recede into the background and causing your nose to appear smaller and thinner.


You can also use mineral powder, foundation, or bronzer as your means of contouring. Any kind of makeup that is a few shades darker than your natural skin tone will work. If you tend to have oily skin, try using powders only instead of cream or foundation. You don't want your nose to appear too oily because it will draw extra attention to it due to the added shine.Don't forget to match your skin's undertones to your makeup. For example, if you have yellow undertones, don't use a pink blush. This is especially important with contouring, as the key is to appear natural. Avoid clashing or dramatic colors that may stand out.

, Using a slanted eye shadow brush, dip the tip in the powder makeup of your choice. Apply a line along the side of your nose, from the corner of your eyes to the tip of your nose, curving around your nostrils. The line should fall at the width that you want your nose to appear to be. The line should also be visible but not too dark. Repeat on the other side.









If you want to give your nose a curved appearance, you can also add a small contour line along the upper portion of the tip of your nose.
Make sure you don't put on too much powder or eye shadow when making the contour line. It is easier to add more powder than it is to wash it off and start your makeup all over. You also don't want to press too hard, packing the powder into your skin. It will be harder to blend later. Just start out subtle and add more if you think you need it., Gently dab just a touch of powder. Be sure to also apply your contouring makeup underneath the tip between your nostrils. This is a contouring trick specific for longer noses. It creates the illusion of the nose being slightly shorter by moving its ""shadow"" up slightly.







, Now that you've started the darker shadows on the edge of your nose, you want to highlight the thinner area on the bridge of your nose. You can either use concealer or a lighter powder for highlights. Draw or brush a thin line down the center of your nose.









If you don't want to highlight the edge of your nose because you feel it will bring unnecessary attention to its length, you can skip this step. It does work well, however, to highlight the thinness of your nose if it is wider than you'd like., Using a makeup brush or sponge, gently blend the edges of your contour lines on all areas of your nose. You want to use soft, even strokes that sweep back toward your face. You don't want to wipe your contour lines off but you need to make sure they look well blended and natural. Your nose should look smaller and thinner with no visible contour lines once you've blended it enough.








Make sure you check from every angle to ensure you didn't forget to blend any spot.

Wear a bold lip color.,
Define your cheekbones.,
Cover up under eye circles.,
Get the right haircut.,
Highlight the eyes.",How to Make a Long Nose Appear Smaller and Thinner2," One of the best ways to make your nose appear less obvious is by drawing attention away from it. Wear a bold lip color such as red or plum. This will make your lips looks nice and luscious, making your nose smaller and less important by comparison. Play around with colors that you really like to find which lip color works for you.


You can also add some lip liner to make your lips more defined and pop out more., Using your cheeks to draw lines out from your nose can help it appear smaller and thinner. Dramatic cheekbones also make your face look longer in general, which may better balance out your features. Using your favorite shade, apply blush or bronzer just under your cheekbones. Avoid putting blush on the apples of your cheeks, as this will have the opposite effect and make your face look rounder.This will also give you an overall glow and healthy appearance.If your cheekbones aren't as defined as you want them to be, you can also use contouring techniques to bring them out as well., Having prominent under eye circles can call attention to the size of your nose, acting almost as arrows pointing to its width and length. Use concealer to lighten the circles under your eyes. This will not only draw attention away from your nose, but it will also get rid of tired eyes, making you look perkier and healthier., Certain hairstyles can also flatter your nose.In general, avoid hairstyles with bangs that draw the eye towards your nose. More specific cuts will depend on the shape of your face.


For a square face, soften your angles with textured curls or waves. Skip level bobs which may make your nose look more angular. Middle parts can also make your features look wider, something you want to avoid if you pine for a thinner nose.
If you have a round face, long, straight hair with low volume can bring your face down, making it appear longer. This may work especially well if you're trying to make the rest of your face better fit your nose.
In general, most hairstyles work for a person with a heart-shaped face and a long nose. Keep in mind that a lot of advice for heart-shaped faces focuses on drawing attention away from your chin rather than your nose. Many suggest wearing dramatic bangs, which would draw eyes to your nose. Ignore this advice and simply wear your hair how you think it looks best.
Short bobs do a good job of bringing out the angles of oval faces. Avoid short layered styles that may make your face look too long. , To draw attention away from your nose, try adding definition to your eyes and eyebrows. Pluck your eyebrows in an arch, which will lead attention away from your nose. Try a jewel toned eyeliner and mascara to concentrate focus on your eyes.

, Go beyond the packaging, and start reading the fine print.The first step is to test the quality of the pigment. Cheaper cosmetics can show up dull and come off more easily. Take a bit of the product, and swipe it onto your skin. Rub it in so that the makeup sticks to your skin. The color should appear true to the packaging. Foundations, concealers, eyeliners should never feel heavy or greasy. It should absorb and blend in well with your skin but should not smudge too easily. Lipsticks and glosses should not be greasy, sticky, or dry. To keep up with competition, drugstore brands will use the same ingredients as brand name companies.

Slather on a good moisturizer before bed.",How to Do Your Makeup for School," Most dermatologists agree that it's not needed, as long as you washed it the night before.If you must wash your face, use a face cleanser made without soap:the harsh chemicals soap contains contribute to dry skin.;
, You can choose between a moisturizer or, if you want more coverage, a BB cream (which stands for “beauty balm”) or light coverage foundation. BB creams are a good choice for your everyday makeup because they are moisturizing and light, but still provide some coverage.Use a small dab of product, about the size of a pea.With your fingers, gently spread the product onto the skin using upward strokes. Be sure to also smooth it over your jawbone, temples, and down your neck. Make sure that there are no streaks.









Choose a shade of BB cream or foundation that is right for your skin tone. When purchasing a BB cream or foundation, bring a friend along or ask a salesperson to help you choose the shade that most closely matches the skin on your face.

, Even if your foundation or BB cream contains SPF, it is unlikely you are using enough of the product to actually get the benefits of sun protection. Apply a nickel- to quarter-sized amount on sunscreen (at least SPF 30) over your face and neck before applying any makeup.







, Concealer is a highly pigmented product that you can use to cover up dark circles and blemishes. It will also help even out your skin tone. Apply this over your BB cream or foundation, or it will just be wiped away. If you want to cover up acne spots, use a green-tinted concealer first, then apply your normal concealer on top of it. The green will help hide redness.









Use a very small dab of concealer to start with. You can always dab on more if you need to.
Blend your concealer well. If you use your fingers to apply your concealer, gently dab it instead of smearing it. This is better for your skin and will keep the concealer where you want it.
If you have dark circles under your eyes, apply a peach corrector right on top the dark areas, followed by a concealer that matches you skin tone and blend. To highlight, apply the concealer in a triangle shape. The triangle should point at your cheek, with the base beneath your eye.Apply a dab of concealer to your upper eyelid. This will form a base for eyeshadow and eyeliner. It helps prevent them from bleeding and smudging later on in the day.

, For school, it is best to choose neutral tones. While tones like purple, blue, green, and black seem like fun, it is best to save them for something like a party. You can layer your eyeshadow to make it more intense, if you wish.








Avoid using too much eyeshadow. You just want to accentuate your eyes.

, Choose a shade that is dark, but not too dark for your hair and skin tone. If you have dark hair and eyes, black or dark brown are good choices. If you have very light skin, blonde hair, and/or blue eyes, it is better to choose a lighter shade of brown. When applying tilt your chin up and point your gaze downward so that you can see your entire eyelid.









There are three main types of eyeliner. Each comes with its own benefits.Pencils are quick and easy to use, and are less easy to smear. Gel liners are applied with a brush, and give you better control over the thickness of your eyeliner. Liquid liners are the most precise, but also the most difficult to use. If you are just starting out with makeup, it might be best to start with a pencil. As you become more experienced and comfortable with your makeup, you can try gel or liquid.
Avoid pulling your lids tight, as this can result in crooked lines.
For a simple and clean look, draw a thin line on your top lid, as close to the lash line as possible.
For added emphasis on the eyes: On the lower lash line, draw a line from the outer corner to the middle of your eyelid. Do not completely circle the eyelid — this will make your eyes appear smaller.
Save more dramatic looks, such as winged eyeliner for parties.

, Use an eyelash curler, press the curler gently against the base of your eyelashes and squeeze it gently shut for a few seconds. Move the curler to the middle of your eyelashes and repeat. This will help your eyelashes stand out.








, Like with eyeliner, you should choose your color based on your natural hair and skin tone. For dark hair and skin, black or dark brown. For lighter hair and skin, choose lighter brown tones.









Always begin by placing the brush at the base of your eyelashes. Gently wiggle the brush back and forth while drawing it through the tips of your lashes. If you want more control you can bend the wand so that the brush is perpendicular to the rest of the wand. To do this, simply bend the tip as you remove the wand from the vial.Apply one or two coats. Depending on how dramatic you want your lashes to look, apply one or two coats. However, be aware that the more your apply, the more likely you are to end up with clumpy looking eyelashes.
Use a brow brush, which has a brush on one side and comb on the other to brush any clumps out. Use the comb side to tease apart any clumped lashes.

, If you have eyelashes that tend to point in every direction, use the brush side of your brow brush to smooth them out. You can also spray a bit of hair spray on your finger, and then smooth it along your brows to help keep them in place, or use a clear brow gel.









Don't overdo it with the hairspray! Just a small dab will do.

, You should choose a color that will complement your face without looking clownish. Generally, rosy and peachy tones work best for light skin, while darker skin looks better in richer tones. Use your fingers to blend it into the rest of your face, smoothing it toward the temples to accent your cheekbones.If you can, go to a department store where makeup is sold. There, the makeup artists can help you choose a color that is suitable for you.









Apply blush lightly. You want to add a bit of color to your cheeks, so don't use too much. In natural light, check to make sure that you haven’t overdone it.

, When choosing between lipstick and lip gloss, know that lipstick lasts longer than lip gloss, but that lip gloss is more moisturizing.Lip gloss is also usually easier to apply.









Again, for school, avoid very dramatic colors such as bright red. Try to go for softer shades such as peach.
When applying lip gloss, apply just a dab or two to your lips and then spread it around with your finger or by pressing your lips together. If you apply too much your lips will look sticky.

,, You don’t have to carry around your whole makeup bag, but do include a few essentials.


For example, keep your lip gloss in your purse or in your pocket as it is likely to come off when you eat or drink.

, Have a pack of tissues or makeup wipes with you in case of smudges. Sometimes, on hot days you may find that your eyeliner ends up underneath your eyelids. You can use the tissue to gently wipe the smudges away.

, Especially on hot days, having a small setting spray to mist your face with can help your makeup last longer and look fresh.


Setting sprays come in many varieties. For example, some are designed to prevent oiliness, while others keep your face moisturized. Choose the spray based on your skin type.
You can save money on this by purchasing a large bottle, and then pouring a small amount into a travel bottle. Not only will it save you money, it will also save space in your bag.

, At the end of each day, before you go to bed, remove your makeup using remover wipes or fluid. Wash your face using a gentle cleanser. This will keep your skin healthy and radiant.









If you choose to use wipes, save money by cutting the wipes in half. Make sure you are cleansing after removing with makeup. Wipes alone don't cleanse the skin, just remove the makeup.
Use only a dab of cleanser and rinse well.

, This is very important for healthy skin, and can help prevent wrinkles later on. Establishing a good skin care routine early on will have many benefits later in life.

Avoid storing makeup in the bathroom.,
Clean makeup brushes regularly.,
Pour out instead of dipping in.",How to Know when Makeup Has Expired1," Makeup should be stored in an interior closet, such as a linen closet, away from an outside wall. This is because exposure to warmth and sun can dry out the products. Too much warmth can also cause the natural oils to separate from the rest of the product, leading the makeup to expire., Although storing your makeup in the bathroom can be convenient, it is not necessarily the best idea. The bathroom has high levels of airborne bacteria that can contaminate your makeup and beauty products. The high exposure to bacteria can cause makeup products to expire sooner than they ordinarily would.Store makeup in your closet or a linen closet outside of the bathroom to keep it cool and dry.
You can store makeup in a dresser, set of drawers, or chest as an alternative.

, An important aspect preserving makeup is keeping your makeup brushes clean. This will prevent bacteria from spreading and cross-contaminating your other products.

Gently rub in brush cleaner or shampoo. Brush cleaners can be purchased at Sephora, Ulta, or drugstores in your area.
Rinse the brush.
Squeeze the excess water from the bristles of the brush.
Set the brush aside on a towel to air dry. It is important to let the brush dry on its side so that the water doesn’t get into the glue and loosen the bristles at the base of the handle.
Brushes used for concealer and foundation should be cleaned at least once a week.Clean brushes that are used for eye makeup at least twice a month.
All other brushes can be washed once a month.

, When using liquid makeup, pour a small amount of makeup, as much as you intend to use, onto a makeup mixing palette. This will keep the bacteria out of the makeup bottle.Set the mixing palette on a flat surface.
Pour a small amount of the desired product onto the surface of the palette, taking care not to set it too close to the edge.
Dip your makeup brush into the product and apply it to your face (or wherever you are using the makeup).

Learn the shelf life of face makeup.,
Understand expiration dates for eye makeup.,
Know when to toss lipstick.,
Record expiration dates.",How to Know when Makeup Has Expired2," Generally speaking, liquid foundation and concealers last for six months and the powder versions can last for two years. This is because bacteria cannot grow where there is no water, and powder makeup does not generally contain water., Similar to foundations, liquid and powder products have different expiration dates with powder makeup generally lasting much longer than liquids. Since these products come into contact with your eyes, which can be sensitive and vulnerable to bacteria, they should not be used past their expiration dates.


Mascara should be tossed after three months, due to it being an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. The tube is a dark, moist environment, which can foster the growth of harmful bacteria.Liquid and gel eyeliners should be thrown out after three months.
Cream eyeshadows should be used for no longer than six months.
Pencil eyeliner and powder eye shadows can be tossed after two years.

, Lipstick and gloss can last for two years and lip liners can last even longer than that, since sharpening them removes the old surface.Liquid lipstick expires after six months, due to the close contact with the mouth.

, When you purchase makeup, use a permanent marker to write the date that you purchased the makeup on the outside of the packaging. You can also use a notebook to write down the purchase date or use a spreadsheet to record purchase history. This will help you keep track of what you purchased and when, preventing you from accidentally using expired makeup.

Toss makeup that has changed texture.,
Do not keep makeup that has changed color.,
Throw out makeup that has an odd smell.",How to Know when Makeup Has Expired3," It is often apparent when makeup has expired, as it often dries out and/or becomes clumpy. When this happens, the makeup will not apply as smoothly. Be sure to dispose of makeup that changes texture, as it can affect the quality of your skin due to the breakdown of the chemicals and the bacteria that grows.

, If you have noticed a change of color in your makeup, dispose of that particular item. Over time, the product can break down and separate, causing it to change color. When this happens, it is not likely that it will apply smoothly anyway, so you should be inclined to get rid of it.

, Any makeup that has an odd smell should be an immediate red flag. An unusual smell generally indicates that the chemical composition of the product has changed and that it has expired.


Periodically sniff your makeup to ensure that it does not have an unusual smell. If it does, toss it immediately.

",How to Do Your Makeup Flawlessly," Wash your face to remove any unwanted oils or old makeup. Use a cleanser that is marketed as gentle or pH-balanced. These cleansers won’t dry out or irritate your skin.You can also choose cleansers that match your skin type. For example:









If you have dry skin, use moisturizing cream cleansers.
For normal skin, use a gentle cleanser without any microbeads or exfoliants.
If you have oily skin, use an oil based cleanser. These cleansers will reduce your skin’s oil production.;
, You should always moisturize after washing your face. There are many different kinds of moisturizers to choose from. For example, if you spend a lot of time outside, choose a moisturizer with sunscreen in it to protect your skin. Other considerations:









If you have oily skin, choose an oil free gel moisturizer. This moisturizer will soften your skin without stimulating oil production.
If you have dry skin, choose a lightweight cream moisturizer.If you struggle with acne, choose a moisture with salicylic acid in it.

, Primer is a makeup product that fills your pores and smooths your skin in preparation for foundation. To apply primer, dab a small amount onto your cheeks, forehead, and chin. Blend the primer into your skin using your fingertips or a foundation brush.Tinted primers can be used to correct color problems on any skin tone. For example:









If you have dull skin, use a light pink primer to give your skin a healthy glow.
If your face looks sallow, use a lilac tinted primer to neutralize any unhealthy tones.
Green tinted primer neutralizes uneven redness or acne spots., Foundation evens out your skin tone and gives you a beautiful glow. To apply foundation, dab a small amount on your cheeks, forehead, chin, and the bridge of your nose. For light coverage, use your fingertips to blend the foundation towards the edges of your face. For a heavier coverage, use a damp beauty sponge to blend the foundation into your skin.








Make sure you use the right color of foundation. The right shade should be invisible on your chin and neck in full daylight.If your neck and face are different shades, match your foundation to your neck. Otherwise, you will look like you’re wearing a mask., Concealer can be used to cover up acne, red spots, or dark circles under your eyes. For heavy coverage, use a liquid foundation and apply it with a small makeup brush.For lighter coverage, use a concealer stick. Blend the edges of the concealer into your foundation to give yourself flawless coverage.









You can use your fingertips, a q-tip, or a makeup brush to blend the concealer.Buy a concealer that matches your foundation exactly. If possible, buy within the same brand to be sure that the colors will match.

, Translucent setting powder is a clear powder that locks in foundation and soaks up any excess oil that your skin produces. Apply a thin layer of setting powder all over your face with a large fluffy makeup brush. Make sure to blend in the areas around your eyes and mouth to avoid any cakey buildup.


Choose a loose powder instead of pressed powder for a lighter coverage., If you already have dark, well-defined eyebrows, you can skip this step. Otherwise, use an eyebrow pencil that closely matches your hair color to fill in your eyebrows. Use short, dash-like strokes to create small “hairs” on your skin. Next, use a dry makeup brush to gently blend the eyebrow pencil into your natural brow.








After you fill them, define and shape your eyebrows by combing them with a colored brow gel or wax.You can buy eyebrow kits for your hair color. These kits usually include an eyebrow pencil, an eyebrow brush, and shaping gel or wax.

, Use a blush brush to apply blush to the apples of your cheeks. Use long, smooth motions to blend the blush towards your temples. Focus on blurring the edges of the blush and creating a natural-looking glow. Use a blush that matches your skin tone. For example:









If you have fair skin, choose a baby pink or peach blush.
Medium skin tones should wear apricot and mauve blushes.
If you have olive toned skin, wear an orange peach or rose pink color.
Dark skin tones look best in bold raisin purples and brick reds., For a simple look, apply a darker color to your creases and blend it onto your eyelids. Next, brush a lighter, shimmering tone onto the center of your eyelids.Purchase quality eyeshadows that won’t wear off throughout the day.

For a natural look, choose a dark brown mascara. For a smoky, bold look, choose a carbon black mascara.
After the mascara dries, apply another coat to further define your eyelashes.

, Choose a bright color that makes them pop. For a bold, heavy lip coverage, use lipstick. For a lighter, shiny color, use lip gloss. If you’re worried about your lipstick or lipgloss smearing, line your lips with a lip pencil before applying your lip color.

Use a makeup brush to apply lipstick. The color will last longer and you’ll have more control over your application., If you are worried that regular foundation will worsen dry skin or acne problems, mineral foundation may be a good alternative.

A true orange or dark peach shade work for dark and medium skin tones, respectively.
How the concealer formula is packaged can be telling of how much coverage you will receive. Concealers that come with sponge wand offer the least amount of coverage.

",How to Cover Freckles With Makeup," Foundation and concealer both come in a variety of formulas, and some work better than others depending on the type of skin that you have. Oil-free powders and liquids with a matte finish work well for oily and combination skin, while moisturizing liquid and cream foundations with a dewy finish are best for dry skin. If you have normal skin, you can use any formula.If you have very sensitive skin, mineral foundations, which contain natural ingredients, are usually your best option. They usually come in powder formulas, but you can find liquid versions as well.;
, Finding a color match isn’t just about choosing a foundation and concealer that are as light or dark as your skin; it’s also important to get the undertone right. You can either be cool, warm, or neutral. You’re cool-toned if your veins are blue and burn easily in the sun, warm-toned if your veins are green and you tan easily, and you’re neutral if you have an equal number of blue and green veins.When you’re choosing a concealer shade to cover your freckles, match it the skin surrounding the freckles, not the freckles themselves. You’ll wind up drawing more attention to the freckles if you use a concealer that’s darker than your skin.If you’re having trouble finding the right shade to match your skin tone, ask one of the makeup artists or sales assistants at the store to help. They’re usually trained to pick out the right shades, so they can point you in the right direction., You may assume that a full coverage foundation is necessary to cover your freckles, but that’s not always true. If the rest of your skin is relatively clear, you may prefer a light foundation or even a tinted moisturizer or BB cream to just even out your complexion and then follow up with a concealer over the freckles. If you have other discolorations on your face that you want to hide, a medium or full coverage foundation may be a better option.

, Even if you think you’ve got the formula and color right for your foundation and concealer, you should test it out on your skin to make sure that they really work with your complexion. Department store makeup counters and specialty cosmetics stores, such as Sephora or Ulta, usually have testers of the foundations available, so you can see if it works for you.When you’re testing a foundation or concealer, it’s best to apply it along your jawline so you can see how it looks against the color of your neck, which is usually lighter than your face. You don’t want to get a harsh line between your face and neck that lets everyone know you’re wearing makeup.Make sure to check out the makeup that you’re testing in natural light. Harsh, fluorescent store lighting can cause shadows that make it difficult to tell if a shade really blends into your skin tone.Even if you don’t plan to purchase foundation and concealer at a department or specialty store, it’s a good idea to visit a counter to talk to one of the makeup artists. They can suggest shades that work for you, so when you head to the drugstore, you’ll have a better idea of what foundation and concealer shades you should be considering.
Don’t be afraid to ask a sales assistant or makeup artist for a sample of a foundation or concealer before you purchase it. Not only can you check the shade out in different types of light to see if it really flatters you, you can wear the products a few times and make sure that they don’t irritate your skin.

, You want your skin to be as smooth as possible before you apply any makeup because otherwise, it may cling to rough, dry patches and look cakey. Allow your moisturizer to sink into your skin for at least five minutes before moving onto the next step of your routine.If you have oily skin, opt for a water-based moisturizer that won’t clog your pores.For dry skin, choose an oil-based moisturizer that can effectively hydrate the skin. Thick creams are usually the best choice.Combination skin usually does best with a water-based moisturizer that’s light enough to hydrate without clogging the pores. However, it’s a good idea to keep a thicker moisturizing cream on hand for times when you have dry patches too.If you have sensitive skin, look for a moisturizer that is fragrance- and dye-free to minimize the chance of irritation., While freckles are often hereditary, sun exposure can make them darker, so you want to protect your face from UV rays before you apply your makeup.Choose a sunscreen with a broad spectrum SPF of at least 15 that guards against UVA and UVB rays to ensure that you’re full protected.To save time when you’re getting ready, you can opt for a moisturizer that contains an SPF, so you can moisturize and protect your skin in one step.
When you’re using a separate moisturizer, make sure that it’s fully absorbed into your skin before applying your sunscreen.

, You don’t necessarily need to use primer everyday, but when you really want your makeup to last and prevent fading that might allow your freckles to show through, it is an important step. It can also fill in pores and fine lines, so your makeup has a smoother, more even look.Use your fingers to apply the primer so you can really work it into your skin.Just as with your moisturizer, choose your primer based on your skin type. For oily skin, it’s best to use an oil-free product that can help minimize shine. Dry skin works best with a hydrating primer that helps illuminate the skin.

, You can apply it with your fingers or a brush, but when you’re covering up freckles, it’s best to use a sponge to press the foundation into the skin. That’s because you’ll get more coverage with the sponge. Blend the foundation carefully over your entire face, taking special care along your hairline, the sides of your face, and the jawline.A sponge can soak up liquid and cream foundations, which means you may waste your products. Dampen it slightly before you apply your makeup to keep it from absorbing the foundation.
You don’t need to worry if your freckles still show through your foundation. You can follow up with concealer.

, If they’re still visible through your foundation, you’ll want to add extra coverage in those areas. To avoid applying too much, it helps to use a small, precise concealer brush that allows you to place the concealer in specific spots. When it comes to blending, your finger is the best tool. That’s because the warmth from your skin really helps the concealer blend into your skin., Once you’ve made your freckles disappear with foundation and concealer, your complexion may be looking a little flat, so adding color to your cheeks can help add dimension to your face. Swipe the blush over the apples of your cheeks for the most flattering look.Avoid blush shades that have a lot of brown in them because they’ll be too similar in color to your freckles and give you a muddy look. Opt for pink and peach tones., The areas around your freckles can sometimes look a little ashy with foundation and concealer over them, so it helps to put some color back into your face. Choose a matte bronzer that’s not too dark.When you’re applying bronzer, think of the places on your face where the sun naturally hit. That means high points like the temples, cheekbones, and nose, not all over.

, Before you set your makeup, you want to make sure that all of the products that you’ve applied are completely blended into your skin, so you don’t have any harsh lines or streaks on your face. Use a clean brush to lightly go over your entire face and ensure that all of your foundation, concealer, bronzer, and blush are soft and blended.


A fluffy powder brush works best for blending makeup across the entire face. Opt for one with synthetic bristles because it will work just as well with powder, liquid, and cream products., To lock your foundation and concealer in place all day over your freckles, it helps to apply a powder that can absorb oil so your makeup doesn’t break down. A colorless translucent powder is usually best.You can use a fluffy powder brush or a puff to carefully press the powder over your foundation and concealer to avoid lifting off any of your makeup.
If you have dry skin, powder may not be necessary. If you have combination skin, you may only need to apply powder in your T-zone, which is the area that is usually oiliest. That’s the forehead, nose, and chin.

, The final step in your makeup routine should be a setting spray, which not only helps set your makeup but can get rid of a powdery look if you’ve applied too much. There are setting sprays for all skin types, so choose the best match for your complexion.Hold the setting spray an arm’s length away from you, and spray it a few times. Don’t apply too much, though, or your makeup may run.

Determine your skin tone by looking at the shade along your jaw line.,
Identify your undertones.,
Combine your skin tone and your undertones to find your foundation shade.,
Test the foundation before you buy it.,
Choose blush based on your skin tone.",How to Choose Makeup Colors1," In the makeup world, there are four basic skin tones: fair, light (or olive), medium, and deep brown. You can determine your skin tone by looking at the skin on your jawline.If your skin appears very pale or white in color, you likely have a fair skin tone.
If your skin appears pale with slightly brown or yellow coloring, you likely have a light skin tone.
If your skin appears light brown, like you have a light tan all over your face, you likely have a medium skin tone.
If your skin appears dark tan or dark brown in color you likely have a deep brown skin tone.;
, Undertones are useful because they can help you determine what foundation you should use on your skin. There are three types of undertones: warm, cool, and neutral. To determine your undertones, you can use a piece of silver fabric and a piece of gold fabric. Place each piece of fabric next to the inside of your wrist. If the veins on your wrist appear blue next to the silver, you are cool toned. If the veins on your wrist appear yellow, green, or brown next to the gold fabric, you are warm toned. If your veins appear blue and green, you are neutral toned, so you can wear both cool and warm tones.
You can also determine your undertone by putting on a black top. If you look washed out in black, you are warm toned. If you appear tanned in black, you are cool toned.
Most people with warm tones look better in gold jewelry and most people with cool tones look better in silver jewelry. People with a neutral undertone can wear both gold and silver jewelry.

, Once you have determined your skin tone and your undertones, you can select a foundation that is right for your skin. For example, if you have a fair skin tone and a warm undertone, foundation in light ivory or porcelain may be right for you. If you have a medium skin tone and a cool undertone, foundation in beige or brown may be ideal.You can use an online tool to determine your foundation shade based on your skin tone and your undertone. You can also talk to a beauty expert at a beauty supply store or at your local drug store to ensure you choose the right foundation for your skin.
Keep in mind, if you are in doubt, it is usually better to choose a foundation that is darker than your skin tone. If you blend the color well, you can end up looking tanned and glowy. If you choose a foundation that is too light for your skin tone, you could end up looking chalky and sallow., Though you may be confident you have chosen the right foundation shade for your skin, you should always test the product before committing to it. You can ask a beauty salesperson for a sample of the foundation and apply it to your skin to ensure it is the right hue.Swipe a small amount of the shade along your jawline and note the color of your neck, which is often lighter than the color of your face. The correct hue should disappear into your skin and blend well.
Make sure you are testing the foundation in natural lighting. Stand by a window or go outside to ensure the color blends well into your skin and does not look chalky or too tanned.

, Blush is a nice way to warm up your face but still appear natural and effortless. You can select blush based on your skin tone for a glowing look that does not wash out or overwhelm your complexion.If you have fair skin, choose a blush in pale pink. Blush in peach and plum are also ideal to add a hint of color to fair skin.
If you have light/olive skin or medium skin, choose a blush in apricot, with a tinge of orange. Many people with light/olive skin have warm undertones that are enhanced with apricot blush. Mauve is also a good option as well as medium pink or orangey pink.
If you have darker skin, go for blush in light purple or purple-pink. Dark skin is great for bold pigments like a deep terra cotta blush or a bright tangerine blush.

Try eyeshadow in deep, cool shades if you have dark brown or black eyes.,
Choose eyeliner and mascara that complements your eye color.",How to Choose Makeup Colors2," To find eyeshadow and mascara that is right for you, you first need to properly identify your eye color. There are four main eye color types: blue eyes, hazel-brown eyes, dark brown/black eyes, and green eyes.If you happen to have heterochromia, where you have two different colored eyes, you may want to factor in your skin tone to help you choose eyeshadow. Try to choose the same eyeshadow color for both eyes, though different eyeshadow colors on each eye can make for a quirky, fun look.

, Blue eyes really pop when they are framed with eyeshadow in warm hues like gold, orange, peach, pink, coral, beige, bronze, or apricot. In general, orange is a complementary color for blue, so eyeshadow in variations on orange are a good option for this eye color.You may want to avoid eyeshadow in blue-green, as this shade can reduce the intensity of your blue eyes.
You can try color combinations like peach and gold or coral and pink to create a fun eyeshadow look. Try starting with the peach or pink first on your inner eyelids, then adding a light layer of gold on your outer eyelids.

, Green eyes look great with cool shades like plum, purple, pink, mauve, red-brown, crimson, and copper. Look for eyeshadows in these colors and avoid blue eye shadow or green eye shadow, as they will not enhance your eyes.You can try color combinations like plum and pink or purple and then a lighter purple shade. Start with the darker colors first, like plum or purple, on your inner eyelids and then finish your look with a layer of the lighter colors, like pink or light purple, on your outer eyelids.

, Hazel-brown eyes look great with many shades, from gray-green to golden brown. You can also apply eyeshadow in orange, khaki, blue-gray, gold, or light brown.Put together color combinations like gray-green and gold or orange and golden brown. Start with the darker shade on your inner eyelid first, like gray-green, and then add a layer of the lighter shade on your outer eyelid, like gold or golden brown.

, Go for deep shades that will highlight your dark eyes, such as dark gray, navy blue, deep plum, or brown. You should avoid pastels shades or very light, pale shades, as they can make you look washed out.You should also try eyeshadows that contain metallics, like gold, silver, copper, or bronze, to add some light to your dark eyes. Avoid matte eyeshadows.
Create color combinations like navy blue and silver or deep plum and bronze. You can then apply the darker shade first, such as navy blue, on your inner eyelids, and then finish with the lighter shade, such as silver, on your outer eyelids.

, You should also consider other eye makeup like eyeliner and mascara. Often, black mascara and black eyeliner can look good with almost any eye color. You can do a dramatic cat eye or winged eyeliner with black eyeliner and finish with a few swoops of mascara for a night out or put eyeshadow on top of black eyeliner for a fun look. However, certain eyeliner colors look better with certain eye colors, making your eye color really pop.If you have blue eyes, go for eyeliner in copper or gold.
If you have green eyes, choose eyeliner in bronze or purple.
If you have hazel-brown eyes, go for eyeliner in bronze, olive, purple, or green.
If you have dark-brown or black eyes, choose eyeliner in amber, midnight blue, purple, or gray

Choose lighter colored lipstick if you have a lighter skin tone.,
Enhance your lips if they appear small.",How to Choose Makeup Colors3," If you have a medium or deep brown skin tone, you may want to try lipstick in a bright color like bright pink, bright purple, or bright red. Bright colors will pop against your skin tone and enhance the warm undertones of your complexion.Try to maintain a balance of color on your face by wearing a bold lipstick color with paired down eyeshadow and foundation. If you go for a bright eyeshadow look, you may wear lipstick in a more neutral color like nude or light pink.

, Lighter skin tones, such as fair, or olive, look good with lipstick in light pink, nude, or light purple. These shades will not overwhelm your pale skin tone and will add warmth to your face., If you feel your lips are small and you would like to enhance them, you can try using lipstick that is pearlescent or metallic, as they will add shine and depth to your lips. You may also try lipstick in light colors like pink, peach, or beige so your lips are not overwhelmed by a bright, dark color.Another trick is to use a lip pencil to create a new lip line outside of your natural lip line. Try to go no further than 3mm out. Make sure the line is precise and even. You can then color in your lips with the lip pencil or with lipstick that is the same shade as the lip pencil.

You can apply your foundation with a sponge or makeup brush. If you use a brush, apply the foundation in circular motions throughout your face. If you use a sponge, use soft, patting motions to apply.;
, With dark skin, you want to create definition using lighter shades. Applying lighter concealer to areas where naturally hits your face can help your face look slimmer and more defined. Go for a concealer or foundation that's two to three tones lighter than your natural skin tone.







, Before you start contouring, you need to find your cheekbones. Much of contouring revolves around accentuating your natural cheekbones. Sit before a mirror and examine your face. Look at where light naturally falls on your face.You can also feel around on your face until you find the indent on your cheeks. From here, you can create a contouring line by tracing a diagonal angle moving down your face.

, To start, you'll be applying your highlighting shade. This is the foundation or concealer that is slightly lighter than your natural skin tone. You'll be applying this shade using a brush or the end of the tube the container came with.









Apply two triangular shapes just below your eyes.
Draw a line down the bridge of your nose.
Add three vertical lines to your chin.
Add a line under your eyebrows that follows the natural curve of your brows.
Place four lines of concealer on your forehead just above the space in between your eyebrows.

, Once you've added your lighter shades, you can add darker shades. Use a darker foundation to shade around your highlighted regions.








Draw a dark line down each of your cheekbones, close to the triangles you drew below your eyes.
Draw two diagonal lines on your forehead, just slightly above and to the left and right of your eyebrows. The slant of the lines should follow the slant of your eyebrows.
Draw two more diagonal lines above the lines on your forehead. Keep the lines parallel. The higher lines should stretch downward until they almost connect with the lines on your cheekbones.
Draw two slanted lines on your chin on either side of the highlighted lines.

Blend it in the same fashion you blended the highlighting makeup. Dab the makeup into you skin in short, delicate motions. Keep blending until there are no regions that look caked on and the makeup is free of lumps and bumps.








You should use a separate makeup sponge to blend the contouring makeup. If you do not have a separate makeup sponge, clean the first under running water and let it dry before you continue blending.

, When dealing with makeup around your brow bone and nose, use a small makeup brush. It can be difficult to fit a sponge in these regions. Move the brush up and down your nose in small, circular motions until the makeup is blended. Do the same to the makeup underneath your eyebrows., When you're finished blending the contouring and highlighting makeup, there will be areas where the contrast between colors looks unnatural. Try to blend these areas together to create a more even contrast. You can dab a sponge brush between the highlighting and contouring makeup. You can also wipe a contouring brush down areas like your nose and cheekbones to encourage the makeup to blend. Keep blending until there are no dramatic changes in color and your makeup looks natural.








It can take a long time to contour, which is why most people do not contour on a day-to-day basis. Be patient and keep blending until your makeup looks smooth. Do not be surprised if this takes a long time.

, When it comes to contouring, you should go for matte colors. Matte colors reflect less light and tend to look more natural. Shimmery or watery foundations and concealers may look caked on if you use them to contour., If your mirror is angled downward or upward, it will be hard to see the natural angles of your face. You want to make sure you're contouring where the light hits your face and accentuating your cheekbones. When you contour, you want to be looking straight into your mirror., Contouring can be difficult work. You want to make sure you have high quality brushes. When purchasing brushes at a drugstore or makeup store, opt for higher priced tools. While you may worry about overspending, pricier brushes will contour more precisely and will also do less damage to your face. Cheap laser-cut brushes can irritate your skin. As contouring takes a long time, you want to use finer brushes to prevent irritation."

Decide whom you will work for.,
Plan your finances.,
Find your niche.,
Weigh the pros and cons of promotional reviews.,
Know your audience.",How to Be a Beauty Blogger1," You may choose to start a beauty blog on your own. Or, you may want to start out working for another company or through an agency. You can also do both. Keep in mind that if you decide to work for someone else, you may be responsible for maintaining a certain amount of social media interest in your material (for instance, through “likes” or “shares”).If you choose to work for another company, you can do so as a freelance journalist or a salaried employee. To browse current opportunities, enter “hiring beauty blogger” into search engines, or use keywords like “beauty blogger,” “beauty journalist” and “freelance beauty” on career search websites.;
, Don’t expect to become a successful beauty blogger overnight.If you’re starting your own beauty blog, you will need other ways to support yourself financially – at least at first. Have a strategy for paying your bills until your blog generates enough income to be your fulltime career.You may want to have a full-time job doing something else, with time set aside on evenings and weekends for your beauty blog., A niche is a topic with a specific focus. Think about what makes your beauty routine unique and try to come up with a topic that relates to you. Make a list of niche ideas, and then perform online searches to assess how much competition you will have in that area. You don’t need to be the only beauty blogger in your niche, but you don’t want to pick a topic that is so general that you will have difficulty making your mark. Keep in mind that you will want your blog to adhere to your niche as much as possible, so don’t choose a topic so ultra-specific that you will run out of ways to write about it.For example, if you have curly hair, your blog could focus on products, tutorials and hairstyles for managing curls.
There is a lot of competition in the realm of general cosmetics. If you want to blog about cosmetics, try to think of a way to make it different than what’s already out there. For instance, you may want to narrow the specificity to makeup for a certain skin type or face shape. Or, you may want to blog about a specific style of makeup such as daytime looks for career professionals, or makeup artistry for the runway and special occasions., Beauty companies may send you free products if you are willing to write reviews about them. Typically, sponsorship opportunities materialize once your blog has an established following. If you are interested in writing promotional reviews but your blog is still new, try looking for start-up companies on places like Etsy or Storenvy – they may be interested in getting product reviews out there regardless of your website’s audience size.


The main advantage is that you get to try new things and don't have to spend a penny on it.
The disadvantage is that it can affect your credibility. Sponsored posts or “brand placement” may result in your audience trusting you less; they may perceive you as biased since you are receiving compensation for your opinion of the product. If your audience doesn’t trust you, your viewership will likely decline. Be honest when you review products and don’t recommend things you don’t like.Search engines may penalize your website’s rankings over lack of value if you promote affiliate content without providing added worth.If you decide to write sponsored reviews, make sure that each of your pages also is full of original written content. Google suggests that you disclose why you’re writing the review and use nofollow links. Nofollow links tells search engines not to crawl them, so that the links don't affect the page ranking of your blog or the affiliate website. Affiliate links should include <a rel=""nofollow""> in them., Once you’ve figured out your niche, you can determine who your target audience is. Get to know who they are and what they would like to read about.Think about what would motivate the people who would visit the type of content you’re offering.For example, if you want to write about anti-aging products, your target audience will be women over 25 years old who are interested in skincare. To cater to that audience, you may decide to use a mature writing style, an elegant layout, and an overall classy vibe.

Know which items are okay at bargain basement price and which might be a bit suspicious.,
Look for good brands.,
Do your research before you buy.",How to Buy Quality Makeup at the Dollar Store1," The things to watch for are explained in the following section. Just be aware that it is important to use your common sense and research skills when purchasing cheap makeup. If you have any worries, don't use it.;
, Dollar stores often carry dumped loads, end of line and sales stock. Therefore, it's quite possible you'll find some decent brands in the dollar store, maybe a little dented, a little older than usual or in last season's colors but they're still a good brand.

, It makes sense to do a reconnaissance trip the first time to scout out what's there, then to return armed with your internet-searched knowledge. This can provide more reassurance that what you're buying is both good value and safe/good to use.


Search for a website for that brand.
If it has no website, look for reviews on the brand's products.

Fact check and proofread for spelling and proper brand names. Use a program on your computer or online that will double-check your spelling and grammar as well.If you’re launching your own beauty blog, have at least 3-5 posts completed that you are satisfied with before you launch, so that you have good material to put up right away.

, Ideally, you will want to either purchase a good camera or arrange to collaborate with a photographer.However, when you’re just starting out, you can use the camera on your phone if you have one. You will want to have a video camera as well if you plan to create video blogs or tutorials., You will need a program for editing and sizing your images; for example, Adobe Photoshop.You will want to put a lot of images on your blog – the more, the better! Use your image editing program to size them down, and save them as internet-optimized so that they don’t bog down your hosting resources and page load time.Natural or studio lighting are preferable. Make or purchase a light tent with a minimum of three light sources. Consider using a tripod if you don’t have great lighting or a camera flash. If you don't have these things, a room with windows that provide a lot of natural light could also suffice, but you will have to take photos and/or videos during daylight hours., You probably need to buy some of the products you want to write about if you’re going to test and photograph them. When you’re first starting out, you won’t have the inventory and free product offers that established beauty bloggers do. However, you can acquire free samples to write about.


Visit beauty stores and department store counters. Try saying, “I’m starting a beauty blog and I was wondering if you have any free samples available that I can use.”Purchase some products that you would like to have and use for yourself, which you can also blog about! Before purchasing anything, check with local beauty stores to see if they have a free samples incentive, so that you can extend your purchase with additional new products for free.

Refer back the list often, so that your brand remains consistent.Reading and writing a lot will help you develop your own voice. Your voice and writing style will likely evolve and be refined as your blog progresses., Affiliate marketing is when you post actual advertisements for other companies on your website – for example, banner or text ads in the side bar or above/below your content. These companies may pay you per click, per impression (when the ad is displayed to users), or just for putting their ads somewhere on your site.


You can join an affiliate marketing network such as Clickbank, or become an affiliate for entities like eBay and Amazon. You can also sign up for the ad programs through a search engine, such as Google AdSense.
In order to avoid ranking penalties from search engines, your site should clearly distinguish ads from the rest of the content on your site. For instance, text should visibly indicate “Advertisement” and ads should not be disguised as articles or site navigation links. The original content of your site should be displayed more prominently than any ads, and the ads should not be overwhelming or overly distracting to users., If you can make a TV appearance or get published in a magazine, do it! You can even try guest blogging. Think of creative ways to spread the word about your blog. You may want to consider advertising your website on other sites through a program such as Google AdWords or Bing Ads."

Post often.",How to Be a Beauty Blogger3," If you’re starting your own blog, you can use a free or paid version of a blogging platform such as Wordpress or Blogger. Another option is to purchase a domain name and hosting package and set it up yourself, which may require more technical knowledge such as uploading files to an FTP site. A couple of things to consider when selecting a platform are ease of use and search engine friendliness.Read online reviews of any blogging platform or domain/hosting company beforehand. It will be helpful to read comparisons of different choices that include pricing and features (such as compatibility with beginners vs. advanced users). Choose an outlet that is well suited to your budget and level of technical expertise.
When choosing platforms and themes, look into any plugins you may want to use, if applicable. Find out when the themes and plugins were last updated and read their reviews. You don’t want to go with a theme or plugin that will bog down your webpage loading times or use up too many resources through your web hosting.

, Your content should be well organized, with your pages easily accessible through your site navigation. You should have a “Contact” and/or “About” page with a description of yourself. You can make your logo online or you can hire a professional to design one for you. If you hire a professional, make sure they understand exactly what you want.

, Add your website to beauty blog directories. You may want to join forums where you can discuss tips and tricks with other bloggers.

Choose makeup based on your skin tone.",How to Apply Perfect Makeup," Primer creates a blank canvas on which to apply makeup, because it creates a smooth surface and gives your makeup something to stick to, meaning it will go on more evenly and last longer.


To apply primer, place a dime-sized amount into your hand. Dip two fingers into the primer and use your fingers to rub the primer into your skin, working in small sections at a time.;
, To help make your features stand out and prevent your foundation from being too matte,apply a highlighter and bronzer (or contour powder).


Highlighters are often in cream form, so use a small synthetic brush to apply it. Dab the brush into the highlighter then apply it to the top of your cheekbones, in between your eyebrows, and above the middle of your upper lip. Blend in any excess by blotting with your finger.Apply the bronzer with an angled brush. Dab the brush into the bronzer and then dab it onto your skin, using the brush to blend as you go. Apply the bronzer to the sides of your nose, just below the hairline along your forehead, and below your cheekbones., Like primer, foundation provides a smooth surface for your makeup to adhere to, and will help even out your skin tone. Your foundation should match your skin tone at the neck and jawline, otherwise no amount of blending will make it look natural.The best way to apply foundation is with a foundation brush.


Dip the brush into the foundation to get a thin layer on the brush. Start in the middle of your face, dab on the foundation, and then blend outward from the center.
For the most natural look possible, finish blending with a damp makeup sponge. Use circular motions to press the foundation into your skin., Once your foundation is on, you can go over your face with concealer to brighten your face and cover blemishes and imperfections. When applying concealer, focus on dark spots under the eyes, pimples, and other blemishes.If you have large circles under your eyes or dark patches of skin to cover, use a cream concealer and apply it with a small brush. Be sure to blend it well. To cover circles under the eyes, apply the concealer in an inverted triangle shape under your eyes and then blend it in with the rest of your face.To cover blemishes, use a sharp pencil concealer to dab the center of the blemish and the area immediately surrounding it.To apply basic concealer, use your ring finger to dab it onto areas that need coverage.

, To reduce oiliness, set your makeup, and increase the longevity of your makeup, apply a pressed or loose powder over your face. Be sure to use a light layer of powder, otherwise it will look cakey.Choose a powder that’s one shade lighter than your skin tone, otherwise it will look too dark when you apply it over your concealer.To apply powder, run a clean makeup sponge under running water. Wring out the excess, then dip the sponge into the powder. Gently dab powder over the areas where you’ve applied foundation and concealer.

, The purpose of blush is to add a touch of color to your face to give you a radiant look, but it’s easy to put on too much. Take an angled brush and swirl it around in the blush once or twice. Tap it off to remove the excess, and place the brush (with the larger end of the angle pointing up toward your eye)against your cheek at the apple, which is the area that puffs up when you smile.Dab the apple a couple times with the brush, then blow off any excess and use the brush (at the same angle) to blend and extend the blush toward your temples.
Continue blending until you can’t tell where the color begins and ends.

, The key to lipstick is moisturized lips, which is why you always apply a moisturizing balm after washing your face.Lipstick can be as simple as a few swipes with a natural pinkish lipstick, but to give yourself perfect lips:


Apply your lipstick of choice to your lips, right from the lipstick bullet. Then go back with a lip liner to smooth and perfect the lines.To make your lips look bigger, apply the liner on the outer edge; to make your lips smaller, apply the liner on the inner edge.
Don’t define your lips too much at the Cupid’s bow (the very top center of the upper lip), and be sure to extend the liner all the way to the corners of your mouth.If you are going with a natural look on your eyes, you can get away with a deeper, bolder color on your lips., Before applying eyeshadow, put on a layer of light, shimmering cream shadow as a primer. Apply it to your entire upper eyelid using either a small brush or your ring finger.Gold, silver, and mauve are always good color picks for this layer.

, With a darker eyeshadow—usually dark brown or bronze—use a flat brush to apply a darker pigment to the very base of your top eyelid (at the lash line), the crease of your eye, and the outer corner to connect the lash line shadow and the crease shadow. Dust off the brush and use it to blend the darker color., Take a pencil or liquid eyeliner and make a thin, straight line at the base of your upper lash line from your tear duct to the outer corner. If your using a pencil eyeliner, make sure it’s nice and sharp. The key to eyeliner is holding your hand steady, so try resting your elbow on a table when you're putting it on.


To make your eyes look larger, extend the line slightly beyond the outer corner of your eye and up toward your temple.If you're going for a more subtle look, use brown eyeliner. For more definition, use black.

, Add extra volume and curl by using an eyelash curler first,then apply two coats of mascara, one immediately after the other. Put the wand at the very base of your lashes and zig zag it back and forth as you pull the wand toward your eyelash tips.Apply a second layer in the same way before moving on to the next eye.


To add the most definition, apply mascara to your top and bottom lashes.

, The final step in your perfect makeup routine is the eyebrows. If your eyebrows are light, thin, or sparse, you can give them more definition and color with a brow pencil. Fill in gaps with the pencil, following the natural curve of your eyebrows.Then use a brush or old mascara wand to feather the brows in small sections to pull the pencil through your brows and make it look more natural. When you’ve feathered the pencil through, use the brush to comb your eyebrows back to their regular shape.


If you don’t have an eyebrow pencil, you can use eyeliner or eyeshadow to fill in your brows.

, One of the most important components when it comes to perfect makeup is healthy, moisturized skin. Take care of your skin by eating a balanced diet, washing your face with a gentle cleanser every day, and moisturizing after every time you wash your face.


Before applying makeup, wash your face, pat it dry, and while it’s still somewhat damp, apply a toner and then a moisturizer.When moisturizing, be sure to remember your lips, which can also become dry and cracked. Apply a moisturizing lip balm after you wash your face, regardless of whether you plan to wear lipstick., Another way to maintain healthy skin is to keep it protected from the elements, especially the sun. UV damage can lead to skin cancer, premature aging, wrinkles, freckles, and leathery skin.


After applying your moisturizer, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, and preferably higher (around 30 to 50).
If you want to save time by using a moisturizer with SPF,be sure it provides broad-spectrum protection.

, This will help you choose cosmetics and products that are right for your skin. There are three basic types of skin, and they are oily, dry, normal, and combination. Many cosmetics are formulated with this in mind, and will often say what type of skin they're designed for.


With oily skin, people often have enlarged pores, lots of blackheads and pimples, and a shiny complexion.Dry skin is often less elastic, has red patches and a dull complexion, and nearly invisible pores.
People with normal skin don’t tend to have sensitivities, aren't prone to imperfections, and have pores that are barely visible.
Combination skin is marked by blackheads, dilated pores, and shininess.

, Your undertone is the shade of your skin below the surface, and knowing what yours is can help you choose colors that will complement your skin the best. Undertones can be cool, warm, or neutral.Bluish, reddish, or pinkish skin indicates a cool undertone. People with cool undertones often have black, brown, or blond hair and green, grey, or blue eyes. They also burn easily or turn pink in the sun, and usually have blue veins on the inner wrist.Golden, yellowish, or peachy skin indicates a warm undertone. People with warm undertones often have black, auburn, or strawberry blond hair and hazel, brown, or amber eyes. They bronze or tan in the sun, and often have green veins on the inner wrist.
A combination of those colors indicates a neutral undertone. People with neutral undertones can wear both silver and gold jewelry equally well, and tend to have blue-green veins on the inner wrist., Certain colors will look better on you depending on your undertone, which will help you when choosing makeup colors. If you have a neutral undertone, you are a combination of cool and warm, and can get away with wearing cool and warm colors.


People with cool undertones will look best in whites, blacks, silvers, blues, purples and berry colors, and emerald and aqua greens.People with warm undertones will look best in oranges, yellows, golds, camels, browns, and earthy greens."

A natural look is casual, fresh, and dewy and is used to achieve a refreshed “just woke up” look.A casual look is achieved with minimal makeup.


Sheer or light foundation might be used so that the skin, freckles and all, still shows through.
Eye makeup is minimal, such a as a light shadow and just a bit of mascara, but no eyeliner.
Lips might have just a touch of sheer gloss in a natural tone.;
, As opposed to a natural look created with minimal makeup, a neutral look is achieved with quite a bit of makeup. Neutral makeup is more subtle than a dramatic night time look due to a neutral color palette, but is just as heavily made up. It is perfect for daytime when bolder makeup colors might not be appropriate.


For a neutral look, the skin is still completely covered with concealer and foundation.
Full eye makeup is applied for a neutral look, including a base eyeshadow color, a highlight shadow, eyeliner, mascara, and false eyelashes, if desired. The shadow, liner, and mascara should all be neutral colors.
Lips are done in a neutral color. A nude lip is a popular neutral look.Neutral makeup creates a flawless look that is essential for looking good in photos.

, Neutral colors can look flattering on a wide range of skin tones, from light to dark. The difference is in the shade of the makeup color. Lighter shades of a particular makeup color (such as light pink) are applied to lighter skin tones, while deeper shades of the same makeup color (such as dark pink) can be applied to darker skin tones.

, No matter how good your makeup technique is, or how great the products you use are, your face and finished makeup will look best with proper skin care.This includes washing, exfoliating, and moisturizing.

, Using your hands (wash your hands first) or a washcloth, wet your face and wash it with your preferred facial cleanser. Gently massage the cleanser all over your face, including the forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose, working into a light lather.


Be careful around the eye area to avoid getting any cleanser in your eyes.

, On damp skin, massage a gentle facial scrub on the forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose, being careful to avoid the eye area. Exfoliation smooths out the skin by removing dead skin cells and flakiness, which will help your makeup go on more smoothly.Skip this step if you previously exfoliated your facial skin within the last 24-48 hours. You shouldn’t need to exfoliate your skin more than twice each week.Individuals with sensitive skin might choose to skip this step. Exfoliation can be harsh on sensitive skin so use a gentle, all-natural product if you want to exfoliate., Dab your preferred facial lotion on your forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, eyelids, and under eye area; then gently blend in until you cannot see the lotion anymore. Allow your skin to fully absorb the moisturizer for about 10 minutes before beginning to apply any makeup.Moisturizer helps keep your skin looking youthful and healthy, and helps keep your makeup from caking.Moisturizing is the last step in prepping your skin for makeup application.

, With your skin deeply clean and properly moisturized, you'll notice how fresh your face looks and feels. It is now ready for foundation, concealer, and powder. Your makeup will go on much smoother now that your skin has been properly prepped.


Use a full coverage foundation to achieve a flawless look. Any freckles, moles, or discoloring you might have should barely show through, if at all, after applying foundation.
Choose a foundation in a shade that complements your natural skin tone to maintain a neutral look.

, You can use a brush, sponge or your fingertips to apply the foundation. Choose whichever option works best for you. To apply the foundation, place small dots on your forehead, cheeks, chin, nose, eyelids, and under the eye area. Gently blend in the foundation using a delicate, light touch to avoid inadvertently rubbing off any foundation.


You can use liquid or powder foundation, whichever you prefer. Liquid foundation will provide more coverage, is easier to blend into your skin, and is good for achieving a polished, neutral daytime look.Dabbing a bit of foundation beneath the eye area helps minimize under eye darkness.

, You can skip this step if the foundation has already sufficiently covered any dark circles under the eyes. If you can still see some darkness, just apply a small amount of concealer with your fingertips and gently blend in.

, Set your foundation with face powder. Use a big powder brush to dust your entire face with the facial powder. This will help set the foundation you have already applied to your skin and help it last longer.Most powders only come in neutral shades and will work perfectly for a neutral look. Just select a powder that complements the color of your foundation, which should be a close match to your natural skin tone.
If you prefer, try using a small powder puff or sponge to lightly powder your eyelids and under eye areas rather than using the powder brush.

, You will need eyeshadow, eyeliner, brow or eye pencil, mascara, brushes, and possibly tweezers.

, Your brows frame your face and eyes, so it is important that they are not too busy. Lightly pluck any stray hairs. Avoid over plucking. For help shaping your eyebrows to best frame your eyes, read Shape Your Eyebrows.

For the lighter eyeshadow, examples of neutral tones include beige, taupe, and champagne.
For the darker shadow, dark brown or dark grey are both good neutral options. A darker shade of the light eyeshadow color you selected would also work.
With an eyeshadow brush, apply the lighter shade all over your eyelid.
Use an angled or very thin brush to apply the darker shade to the eye crease only. You can smudge your eye crease a little bit with your finger tip or smudging brush to blend.

, You can use liquid liner, gel liner, or pencil eyeliner. To create a soft, subtle line, draw a very thin line very close to your lash line.

, Apply two or three coats of black or dark brown mascara on your upper lashes. Black and dark brown mascara are both good options for all skin tones. If you like, apply one coat of mascara on your lower lashes as well.

, False eyelashes are best added after you have finished applying your eye makeup. For step by step instructions on properly applying lashes, read Apply False Eyelashes. Once the false lashes are applied, touch up your eyeliner, if needed, and apply additional mascara, if desired.

, Adding subtle color to your cheekbones and lips can give you a healthy glow that is the perfect complement to your neutral makeup look.

, Bolder blush colors are best saved for dramatic, evening looks. Lighter colors are all you need to create a beautiful, neutral daytime look.

Applying makeup to a dirty face increases future breakouts and is unhealthy for your skin.

, After washing and cleansing your face, it’s important to get some of that moisture back so your face doesn’t dry out. Use a light moisturizer all over your face, and allow that to set and dry for 10 minutes before applying any makeup.

Start with a good primer.,
Apply concealer to the affected areas.,
Use a light foundation.,
Set your look with a face powder.",How to Apply Makeup to Conceal Acne and Look Natural2," While primers aren’t necessary for everyone, if you are battling acne, they will go a long way in smoothing your skin. So if your skin is bumpy and broken out, or even dry from acne cleansers, this will help your overall appearance as you apply makeup. , A good concealer will blend your acne spots with the rest of your face so it is much less noticeable. This will prepare your face for the rest of the makeup regimen. . Use a concealer brush rather than your fingers.
Twist the brush over the pimple to get the concealer into all the nooks and crannies!
Apply the concealer slightly past the pimple to blend it with the rest of your skin.

, Choose something that is not oil based, and is as light as possible while still being affective. This will help protect your skin from future breakouts. Heavy foundations also cake onto your skin and can actually make acne more noticeable. Again, don’t apply with your fingers; use a sponge instead. , Use a fine face powder to lightly dust your face. This allows all the work you just did to stay in place for the whole day! Apply with a large powder brush.

Apply eye shadow to both eyelids.,
Apply eyeliner next.,
Use mascara to give your eyelashes a thicker and fuller look.",How to Apply Makeup to Conceal Acne and Look Natural3," Use three colors that are in the same color family. Many brands carry sets of eye shadow so you have all three colors to start off with. Avoid options with a lot of sheen. Instead, look for a matte or semi-matte option. You should also avoid bold colors and stick to more neutral tones to achieve the natural look.


Start with the lightest shade and apply from your eyelashes to your brow bone.
Take your medium shade and apply to just your eyelid.
Take your darkest shade, and very gently apply that to your crease.
Use your brush to blend the colors so they seamlessly transition and you cannot tell where each color begins or ends.

, Use a neutral black or brown and start in the interior corner of your eye and move out. Your eyeliner should be as thin as possible if you are striving to look natural. You can use a pencil, gel, or liquid eyeliner. It's whatever you are most comfortable using and the option you can control most when applying.

, Start by opening your eye wide and placing the brush as close to the bottom of your eyelashes as you can go without touching and irritating your eye. As you move the brush towards the ends of your lashes, twirl the brush for even application and less clumping.

"
"
Apply blush.,
Finish with your lips.",How to Apply Makeup to Conceal Acne and Look Natural4," Blush keeps your face looking rosy. When used correctly, it gives the appearance of looking sun kissed and happy, and helps you avoid looking too pale, which could give the impression you are ill or nervous. Start at the apples of your cheeks and move up toward your temples using a blush brush. Blend using your fingers so you do not see an obvious line where you applied. If you are fair skinned, stick with soft pinks, peaches or light corals and apply lightly in order to keep a natural look. Applying too darkly or using a darker color will look too dramatic.
For a medium skin tone, use pinks and peaches and avoid applying too darkly. Refrain from using colors with a blue undertone, as those could create a bruised look rather than the naturally sun-kissed you are going for.
If your skin tone is dark, use deep reds, oranges, or browns to highlight your cheeks.

, For a natural yet lasting look, use lip balm, lipliner, and lipstick. Make sure your lip balm has an SPF of 15 or more to protect your lips. Your lip liner and lipstick should be a softer shade that resembles your natural lip color. We are enhancing your natural beauty, not changing it! Start with lip balm to keep your lips moisturized. This will serve as a base for everything else you're going to do.
Line your lips with lipliner. Choose a shade that is a close match to the lipstick you are going to use. In addition to lining your lips, lightly color in your lips. This helps the lipstick last all day.
Apply lipstick by puckering your lips and starting from the middle of your lips (where lipstick fades the quickest).

If you can't test the makeup on your skin, hold the jar next to your hand to see if the shades match. You can buy mineral makeup in just about any pharmacy, grocery store, or high-end department store., Enhancer is mineral concealer. While you can conceal blemishes and discolorations with foundation and a concealing brush, stubborn zits or dark circles might require a dab of enhancer. Buy green enhancer to neutralize the reddening caused by acne, eczema, or rosacea. Purchase yellow enhancer to neutralize the purple appearance of dark under-eye circles., This is also known as finishing powder. In the Bare Minerals line, it's called Mineral Veil. After you've concealed your imperfections and applied your foundation, the setting powder will give your skin an even complexion and a bit of a shimmer., Mineral makeup won't look right if you apply it with a cloth or foam puff. For a successful application, you'll need three brushes. The wide-bristle Kabuki brush gets the foundation on your face in an even layer. You'll also need a thinner concealer brush to work the makeup into acne blemishes or discolorations. Finally, you'll need the buffer brush to apply the finishing powder and blend your makeup., Starter kits contain the makeup and the brushes you'll need to apply it. Some brands might still throw in an instructional DVD to help you get started. You might be able to find these kits in your local pharmacy, but you're more likely to find them at high-end department stores., Use a non-mineral, oil-based moisturizer that won't clog your pores. If your moisturizer doesn't absorb into your skin, neither will your mineral makeup. Wait 10 minutes after applying your moisturizer. This will allow your skin to properly absorb the lotion. Otherwise, you'll risk a damaged makeup job from too much moisture.


On the other hand, the powder might not blend correctly if your face is too dry. You should have just enough oils on your skin for the makeup to adhere to., This includes areas of your skin affected by acne. Press your concealer brush into the green powder. Blot your blemishes to cover them. If you have dark circles, use the yellow enhancer in the same way under your eyes. It'll refract light and make your dark under-eye circles disappear., This helps you to avoid using too much. If you don't get enough, you could always add a layer. A little bit of powder goes a long way, so don't use more than about a pinch. Because powder tends to sprinkle, use your Kabuki brush to pick up the fallen powder., Swirl the brush in the cap. After that, tap the brush into the cap to remove the excess powder. The brush is most important in covering large areas of your face. An inferior brush might make the makeup look artificial., Do this by rubbing the brush on your skin in a circular motion. Start lightly on your cheeks and move off to the side of your face. The brush isn't supposed to just dust your skin with powder. It should buff the powder to help it adhere to the oil in your skin. The more you buff, the heavier the coverage will be. It might take practice to find the technique that works for you.


The foundation will look a little powdery when you first apply it. However, it'll settle into your skin and look more natural in a few minutes., Setting powder prevents your makeup from melting off over the course of the day. If you have oily skin, finishing with a setting powder will give you extra protection and oil absorption. It will also help you obtain a matte finish. Apply the powder after you have the look you want with the foundation and enhancer. Apply it the same way you applied the foundation, using the Kabuki brush at first. When everything looks even, blend the makeup with your buffer brush. You can also use setting powder on your eyelids to set your eye shadow and eye liner, if you wear them.

, Bronzer gives you the appearance of a light suntan. If this look is for you, apply the bronzer only to the areas of your face that get the most sun. Usually, this will be your cheeks, chin, and forehead. Use light, circular strokes with the Kabuki brush., Blush also adds color to your cheeks and can be used as an alternative to bronzer. If you would like to add a bit of pink or light red to your face, apply some blush to the apples of your cheeks. Use the Kabuki brush, moving in circular strokes., Touch your concealer brush to the eye shadow and tap off any excess into the makeup container. Gently apply the makeup to your eyelids starting at the outer edge and moving inward. Use light, downward strokes.

Apply a layer of foundation or setting powder to your eyelids first, especially if you have oily skin. This will help to keep the eye shadow from dissolving over the course of the day."

This is the same for the color of eye shadow that you choose. Different shades of shadow look better on some people than others. This often depends on your eye color as well as your skin tone. In order to find shades of eye shadow that compliment you, you will need to experiment with different colors.

, You only need to use a small amount. Apply a small amount of foundation into in the palm of your hand. Either use your finger or a foundation brush to apply the makeup to your face. Make sure to cover your entire face with a thin layer of the foundation.

Take the medium shade, and apply it to the eyelid. Use the eye shadow brush to apply an even amount to cover just the lid. Make sure not to use too much, you just want a small amount on your brush. The darker the color you use the less you want to apply to the eye.






Take the dark shade, and apply a small amount into the crease of your eye. This is the area where your eyelid ends, and the skin in indented. You should be able to feel the curve of the crease with your fingers. Use the brush to make a smooth line along the crease.






Take the lightest shade, and use this as a ‘highlighter’. You want to take a small amount of this shade, and apply it just above the line you have made in your crease. You want to make sure you don’t put this colour to high. Make sure to stay well below your eyebrows.







, Once again when choosing the color you will have to experiment, but black is the most basic to use. You do not want to use a lot of liner as a little goes a long way.

Apply a thin line to your upper lid. You want to stick to your lash line, and be careful not to stick your eye with the liner. Keep your hand steady as to create an even, smooth line.






Apply a very small amount to your lower lid along the lash line. You want to make sure you press lightly here as to get a thin line.







, Be very careful that the mascara doesn’t go into your eye as this will cause your eyes to water and your makeup to smear. Use the brush on your upper lashes by brushing up. To keep from getting clumps shift the brush back and forth a little when brushing it through your lashes.


Lastly, brush it softly against your lower lashes. You do not want to apply to much to your bottom lashes.

Use the plastic storage with shelves under your sink or in the closet to store all but your daily makeup.,
Organize your makeup into the appropriately sized bags or kits.

,
Store what you don't use daily in its own bag or kit based on the categories above.

Put your brushes in their own bag or kit to keep them clean and protected and put this in your daily bag or kit.

,
Pat yourself on the back!",How to Put Together a Makeup Kit," This isn't a project to rush through.;
, These are some of the most common items in a make up kit:



Foundation evens skin tone and gives a smooth palette to begin applying other products.

Concealer is applied to hide blemishes, sores, bags, and other marks on the face.

Blush adds dimension to your face and can add a youthful or sun-kissed look.

Eyeshadow is available for almost any skin tone.
Neutral and complimentary colors that can be used everyday should be put in your everyday pile.
More exotic and dramatic colors can be added to your special occasion collection.



Eyeliner is used on the edges of your eyelids closest to your eyes and just below the eyes.
Powders can set your foundation and prevent it from wearing off as fast.
Look for a good shade of lipstick and/or lipgloss to include in your kit. Find something that coordinates with the other products you plan to use daily. See tips for colors choices.
Consider a bronzer to add additional color to your face. This is great during the summer time to give the appearance of a tan without the sun damage. This may be a daily, seasonal or special occasion item depending on the frequency you use it.

, Consider what you have time to apply and what is only used for special events. Be prepared to have 5-6 piles before you're done. Gather your items into piles including:

Daily wear






These are your basic colors that match almost anything you wear with the coordinating lipstick. Keep it simple unless you want to carry a suitcase around every day.


Skin care






This includes your moisturizers, makeup removers, serums, sunscreens, acne treatments, etc. You can also include cotton balls, q-tips, etc.
Removal of makeup may be necessary if you travel, play sports or just don't like having make up on all day. To save space, buy a package of pre-moistened face cleansing cloths.


Special occasion






This includes more dramatic colors, infrequently worn colors, products you purchased to match special outfits, wild colors used for Halloween, shimmer powder you wear out to clubs, false eyelashes or anything else you rarely wear.


Seasonal (optional)







Tanning can cause your skin tone to vary from season to season. People who tan often have different foundation and powder shades they use in the summer. If you tan during the summer you may need to make an additional pile for your darker summer colors (or tan free winter colors).



, If it's old, you should get rid of it. Old makeup collects bacteria, separates and may flake off or not apply as well. Here are some general guidelines for how long you should keep an item before disposing of it:


Three Months

Mascara
Liquid Eye Liners


Six months

Eye foundations
Eye creams
Eye bases
Cream eye shadows
Any other cream or gel based item for eyes
Face Powders which have had brushes or sponges in contact with the product.
Foundations that are cream or pancake


One Year

Liquid foundations
Moisturizers
Concealer used on face providing it is in a tube and does not have an applicator.


As needed

Powder and cake blush
Powder and cake eye shadows
Eye liners (pencil) providing it doesn't harden, become difficult to apply or becomes dry.
Bronzer



, Otherwise, put it in a nail kit and store elsewhere.

, Are they sufficient? Dirty? Floating around in the bottom of a drawer or bag? These become dirty and bacteria filled quickly. Toss out any used sponge applicators that came with the makeup and invest in good washable brushes. Dispose of any dirty foundation sponges and powder puffs. By using clean brushes you can extend the life of your makeup by eliminating the amount of bacteria and oils you are introducing into it. Brush kits and brush bags are usually sold at mall makeup counters and makeup stores. The brush bags will keep your brushes organized, protect the brush ends from bending and keep your application tools clean. Here are the most popular applications tools:


Foundation brush or a wedge sponges
Powder brush
Blush brush
Large shadow brush
Small or angled shadow brush
Lip brush
Concealer brush

, Clean eye liner by rubbing an alcohol soaked cotton ball over the pencil and sharpening the tip completely. Clean brushes in antibacterial soap and rinse until they are clean. If your brushes look tangled, deformed or if they are so full of makeup you don't have to actually add make up each time, you need to dispose of those and start fresh.

, If you don't have something big enough or with the necessary pockets you should start shopping. It's always better to go with something slightly larger than something too small.

, Make sure it can hold everything you plan on putting into it including your brush bag.


Train cases are usually hard side and have extending shelves for organization. These can be heavy and bulky but protect well.
Bags vary in size and construction. Look for something made for makeup as it will probably have an interior that will wipe clean, zip closed to avoid spilling and have padded or quilted exterior to offer extra protection.
Small tackle boxes are usually larger than the train cases, less expensive and great for organizing a lot of makeup. This is an excellent product for special occasion makeup as you can easily see what you have available. Since you don't wear it all the time it's easy to forget what you have.
If you don't carry your make up with you and only apply it at home you can use a basket or drawer to store your daily makeup.

, Keep the daily kit easily accessible.

,,,, Your makeup is organized and you should be on your way to a less stressful and efficient make up routine.

If your skin is already quite clear, you may prefer to use a BB cream or tinted moisturizer, which are lighter than a foundation.
If you have heavy acne, you may want to opt for a dual concealer that contains both green and skin-tone hues, as green can help neutralize the red of your pimples; in addition, you’ll definitely want to use foundation.;
, Knowing the natural colors of your skin when it’s flushed (i.e. red/pink) will help you choose which blushes and lip colors to use for a natural glow.


To find out what you look like when you’re flushed, jump up and down or run around for a few minutes until you feel a bit out of breath; your cheeks and lips should look darker than normal. This is the color you want to aim for in your blush and lipstick.

, A good primer will minimize fine lines and pores, and leave your skin feeling velvety smooth. It will also help your makeup stay put. There are different types of primer, so choose one that matches your skin type -- for example, for oilier skin, you’ll want to use a gel primer.You can purchase a good primer at most stores that carry makeup. Aim for a store that carries a lot of makeup; that way you can experiment with different options to see which primer works best for you.

, If you already have clear skin, you needn’t use a concealer. If you have any dark spots, under-eye circles, or pimples, a concealer can help you cover them up.


Choose a concealer that matches your skin as closely as possible. It may take some experimentation on your own skin to find the concealer that’s right for you.

, The ideal shade of foundation for you will be one that disappears into your skin.


If you have young, healthy-looking skin, you can either skip the foundation all together, or try a tinted moisturizer or BB cream.
Tinted moisturizers and BB creams are much lighter than foundations. These provide sheer coverage, giving you a more natural look.
Look for foundation, BB creams, and/or tinted moisturizers with an SPF included.

, Highlighters come in liquids, creams, and powders, and are great for adding a little glow to your skin.


Some makeup artists recommend avoiding highlighters with silvery or champagne tones, as these can make your skin look frosty — instead, seek golden tones.If your skin is mature, avoid using powders as they will sink into and highlight any fine lines or enlarged pores. Liquid highlighters are a safer choice., Choose a translucent bronzer that will give your skin a bit of a glow without looking unnatural. Avoid bronzers that are too sparkly or too matte.


To choose the right shade for you, hold the bronzer up to your face as you look in a mirror. The bronzer should only be one or two shades darker than your skin tone.Sun-kissed is the look you’re going for.

, It’s possible to apply makeup with your fingers and any applicators that come with your makeup; however, proper makeup brushes can help you achieve more professional-looking results.


Most drugstores and beauty supply shops will carry a variety of brushes and basic sets. These will vary greatly in price.
A good-quality brush will have strong bristles that do not fall out. It will also have a strong ferrule, which connects the bristles to the brush handle.
Key brushes for glowing skin: concealer, foundation, powder, blush, bronzer, and shadow.

, After washing your face with a gentle cleanser and patting it dry, apply a moisturizer. The moisturizer will create a smooth base that will help your makeup stay on.









Ensure that the moisturizer has had time to sink into your skin so that you’re not applying makeup over a wet base., Once your moisturizer dries, apply a very light layer of primer to your face. With your fingers, add a few dabs of primer to the centre of your face (nose, forehead, chin) and then work your way out.









Be sure to allow the primer to dry for a few minutes before applying any makeup on top of it., Use a small brush to apply concealer over any dark circles or spots on your face. Dab the concealer with your ring finger to help blend it into your skin.








If your skin is free of blemishes such as pimples or dark circles, you can skip this step.

, Foundation will help even out your skin’s tone and texture. Using a makeup sponge, dab some foundation on your nose and chin, then blend it outward.








Some makeup artists suggest using only four dots of foundation and then blending them outwards with your hands or a brush. In this method, you would apply 1 dot in the centre of each: your forehead, your cheeks, and your chin.For a more natural look, apply foundation everywhere but your forehead and cheeks.If your skin is already quite clear, you can use a BB cream or tinted moisturizer instead of a foundation.

, A matte powder will help set your foundation, giving you a good base for additional makeup. It will also help give your skin a velvety texture.







, A highlighter is key in giving your skin a glowy look. Apply it to the bridge of your nose, your cheekbones, the corners of your eyes, and in the dip of your upper lip.








You can also apply a bit of highlighter to the skin just below your eyebrows, and to the center of your chin.
You can apply the highlighter using a foundation brush, or by dabbing it on to your skin with your ring finger., Once you’re done applying everything else, finish it off with a sheer powder. This will help set your makeup and give you a little extra glow.









Use a big brush to apply the powder, and go very very light on it. Apply it to your T-zone and outward.Some makeup artists recommend using a pale yellow translucent powder so as to avoid looking pasty., To give your skin a natural flushed look, you can apply blush on top of the translucent powder. Apply the blush to the apples of your cheeks, drawing the brush upwards towards your hairline.









Two-blush method: Starting at the apples of your cheeks, pull the brush upward toward your hairline, then down slightly. Then, just on the apples of your cheeks, apply a lighter shade of the same color., Pinks, golds, and plums are great shades for highlighting your eyes and keeping them looking fairly natural.









For a natural look, ensure that your eyeshadow doesn’t cake or clump in the lines of your eyes. Creamy eyeshadows may be a better choice than powdery ones.
You can also dab some highlighter on your eyelids to give them an extra glow.

, You can keep it pretty natural or very dramatic depending on which eyeliner you choose, and how you apply it.









Natural: Apply a light, feathery line of eyeliner in a neutral shade (brown, soft black) to your lash line. You can smudge it afterward to make it look less intense.
Dramatic eyes and a glowing face with neutral lips are a classic look. Draw a classic cat’s eye with black liquid liner, or do a gold smokey eye lined with a smudged black liner.

, Use a non-clumping formula in brown or black to keep your makeup looking natural.









You may want to curl your eyelashes using an eyelash curler beforehand.
If your eyelashes are already dark and you only want to help define them more, you can also use a clear mascara.

, Well-moisturized, soft lips will complement your dewy, glowing skin nicely. You may want to use only a lip balm.









If you want to wear lipstick, stay within the natural shades of your skin (particularly when flushed) for a natural look.
If you do decide to wear a more dramatic color (for example, reds or rich berry tones), go easy on the eye makeup, otherwise you may look overly made up.

, Use a gentle cleanser that’s tailored to your skin type — for example, sensitive, combination, oily.


If you don’t have acne, you can also exfoliate your face twice a week to help remove dead skin cells and brighten your skin.
Avoid exfoliating your skin if you have acne, as the exfoliating beads can cause acne to spread.

, A toner will help balance your skin’s pH and remove anything the cleanser missed. Many dermatologists recommend applying a toner to your face after washing it.


Avoid toners that contain alcohol, as these can dry out and irritate your skin.

, Use a moisturizer designed for your skin type: dry skin will require a richer moisturizer than oily skin, which benefits from light creams or gels.


Seek a moisturizer that contains an SPF, which is important for protecting your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays.

, Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen every day, regardless of whether it’s sunny or cloudy. Aim for an SPF 30, and reapply every 2 to 3 hours that you’re outdoors., You might use an oil-free moisturizer in the hotter months when your skin is more likely to be oily, but in the winter, you may need something richer to combat indoor heating and cold weather, which can dry your skin., Using too many products on your skin can cause irritation. According to some dermatologists, the only products you need for beautiful skin are a simple cleanser, sunscreen, and moisturizer.For mature skin (with fine lines and enlarged pores), add a retinoid or retinol to your skin care regimen., When you’re dehydrated, your skin can appear dull and fine lines may look deeper. To calculate how much water you need each day, divide your body weight (in pounds) in half, and drink that amount in ounces.If you exercise or live somewhere hot (i.e. if you sweat a lot), you will need to drink more than half of your body’s weight in ounces.A 150-pound woman would drink between 75 and 150 ounces of water each day, depending on her level of activity.

, Aim for a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and unprocessed foods. Keep your sugar intake low., Getting enough sleep on a regular basis keeps the skin healthy by optimizing the secretion of human growth hormone (HGH). HGH promotes cell renewal and collagen production, which will help the skin look its best.Adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night; teenagers need 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep per night."

If you look best in silver jewelry, you have a cool undertone. If you look best in gold jewelry, you have a warm undertone. If you look good in both gold and silver, then you have a neutral undertone.

, When selecting your foundation, it is also important to decide how much coverage you want. There are different types of foundations available, and each will give you different results. Here are some tips:








Cream foundation is thick, but it will give you the most coverage. You may not even need concealer for this foundation. It can feel heavy on your face, however. This type of foundation is suitable for normal and dry skin types.
Liquid foundation can give you a sheer coverage to a medium coverage. It will look more natural the sheerer it is, and will help even out your skin tone. Some blemishes may still show through, however, and you may need to use concealer. This type of foundation is suitable for dry and combination skin types.
Powder foundation will give you the lightest coverage, and will look the most natural. It is the best for evening out your skin tone and giving you the no-makeup look. This type of foundation is suitable for oily skin types.

, There are many different ways you can apply your foundation. Coverage also depends on what you use to put the foundation on your skin. Generally beauty blenders give the most coverage, then foundation brushes, and then fingers or sponges. You can use your fingers, a makeup sponge, or even a foundation brush, depending on the type of foundation you have. Start applying your foundation to your nose, and work your way outward along your chin, cheeks, and nose bridge. Blend the foundation outward, and be sure to get your jaw line, sides of face, forehead, and neck.








If you are using powder foundation, you can apply the makeup using a makeup sponge or a powder brush.
If you are using liquid foundation, you can use a makeup sponge, a makeup brush, or your fingers. If you choose to use a makeup sponge, consider dampening it in water first. This will prevent the sponge from soaking up too much foundation, and thus wasting it.
If you are using cream foundation, you can use a makeup sponge, a makeup brush, or your fingers.

, Choose a powder that matches your skin tone and swirl your powder brush in it. Lightly tap or blow the excess powder off, then brush it onto your face. Focus on the nose, forehead, and cheekbones.

For the best blending, eye shadow should have four different shades: The lightest (a shade close to white) on the inner corner and just under your browbone, the second lightest over the lid, next darkest on the crease, and darkest on the outer corner blended in.
If you have blue eyes, you can wear similar shades, such as dark blue, grey, and silver. You can also wear contrasting shades, such as bronze, brown, copper, and taupe.
If you have brown eyes... you can wear similar shades, such as bronze, brown, and taupe. You can also wear contrasting shades, such as blue, green, grey, and purple.
If you have green eyes, you can wear similar shades, such as green, and forest green. You can also wear contrasting shades, such as gold, pink, taupe, and purple.
If you have grey eyes you can wear similar shades, such as blue, charcoal, and silver. You can also wear contrasting shades, such as brown, gold, green, and purple.
If you have hazel eyes, you can use greens and golds to bring out the greens and golds in your own eyes. You can also use contrasting colors, such as plum, reddish-brown, and wine.

, Or simply use a dot of liquid concealer in place of primer.








, Choose your lightest shade. Swirl your brush in the eye shadow and sweep it over your entire eyelid, from the lash line all the way up to the eyebrow. Gently blend the shadow towards the corner or you eye and away from your eye. You can leave your eye shadow like this, or add extra definition by adding some shadow and lid color.









Consider brushing some loose powder under your eye, just beneath the eye lashes. This will catch any loose specks of eye shadow. When you are done applying your eye shadow, you can brush this powder off using a clean brush.
Some people do not like having the same highlight color as their base. If this applies to you, you can use an eye shadow primer to stop your eye shadow from creasing. Be sure to apply your highlight in your inner corners to open up your eyes and to your brow bone to give your eyes definition.

, Swish you brush across the medium shade and sweep it along the entire eyelid, going from right next to inner corner of your eye to the outer corner.








, Take a smaller brush and sweep it across the darkest shade. Run it along the crease of your eye, going in an arch starting from the outer corner and following the shape of your natural eye socket, or where your eyelids fold in when you open your eyes.








, Using a small, fluffy brush, go over the eyelid, where the lid meets the crease. Next, go over the brow, where the crease meets the brow. When you blend, run your brush from the inner corner of your eye to the outer and back to the inner in a rainbow motion.









If you brushed loose powder beneath your eye, you can dust it off after you have finished blending everything.

, Place the tip of your eyeliner as close as possible to the lash line on your upper lid. Slowly draw a smooth line, going from the middle of your eyelid to the outer corner. Then, going from the middle to the inner corner. You can extend the eyeliner a little bit beyond the outer corner, creating a wing tip. Whether you use eyeliner pencil or liquid eyeliner depends entirely on what is easiest for you to work with. Here are some more tips on applying eye liner:









For a natural, daytime look, use brown or black-brown liner. For a more defined or evening look, use black eyeliner.
It helps if you hold a pocket mirror in your other hand, and look down at the mirror while applying the eyeliner.
You can also close your eye partway, and gently pull on the outer corner of your eye, stretching the lid. Draw your eyeliner in a neat line.
You can use eyeliner or eye shadow on your bottom lid. Eyeliner will give you a more defined look, while a thin line of charcoal or dark brown eye shadow will give you a softer look.

, Start applying your mascara from the middle of your eye. Dip the brush into the container and pull it out, dragging it along the rim of the container to remove any excess mascara. Bring the brush as close as possible to your lash line and gently pull it up, wiggling it from side to side slightly; lower your eyelids at the same time as you are pulling the brush up. Repeat the process for the outer and inner corners of your eye.









You can apply some mascara to your bottom lashes. Simply bring the brush as close as possible to the lower lash line, and brush downward.

, Unless you have very thick eyebrows, you might want to fill them in. You can use eyebrow pencil or eye shadow. Follow the natural curve of you eyebrow, making the color softer and lighter the closer it gets to your nose. In general, you want to use a color that is two to three shades lighter than your hair color, unless you have blonde hair. Then, go 2-3 shades darker. Here are some more tips:









If you have blond or light colored hair, use a light brown or medium brown.
For brown hair or medium-colored hair, use a medium or dark brown.
If you have black hair, use a very dark brown. Never use black, as it will be too harsh.
If you have red hair, use a color close to your hair color, but two to three shades darker.
For other, unusual hair colors, such as blue, green, pink, or purple, consider using a shadow that matches your hair color, and going two to three shades darker. You can play around with colors, or use a color that matches your original eyebrow color.

Apply the blush.,
Consider adding some bronzer.,
Outline your lips with lip liner.,
Fill your lips in with lipstick.,
Consider using lip gloss instead of lip liner and lipstick.",How to Apply Basic Makeup3," Choose a color that suits you, and apply it along or just barely on top of your cheekbones. How you apply your blush will depend on the type of blush you bought: cream or powder. If you are using a powder blush, then you can apply it with a powder brush. If you are using a cream blush, then lightly dab it onto your cheeks with your fingers, and then softly blend it outwards. Do not apply too much blush, however; you want just enough blush to give you a healthy glow. Here are some guidelines for finding the right shade of blush:








If you have light skin, go for soft pinks, light corals, and peaches.
If you have medium skin, go for rich pinks, warm mauves, and deep peaches.
If you have dark skin, go for deep fuchsias, warm browns, and tangerines.

, For a healthy, sun-kissed look, you can apply some bronzer.









Bronzer usually doesn't go on the nose, unless you're contouring, and then it's in very specific areas of the nose.
Generally bronzer can go all over the face, but defines the face more when applied along jawline, under blush, and along the top of the forehead.

, Choose a color that matches your lipstick color. If you wish to have fuller lips, then make the line just outside your natural lip line. If you want to make your lips appear less full, then draw just inside the lip line.








, You can run the lipstick directly over your lips, or you can use a lipstick brush. If you are using a lip brush, simply sweep it across the lipstick, and then run it over your lip. Be sure to stay within your lip lines. Once you have finished applying your lipstick, you can get rid of the excess by pressing your lips down on a piece of folded tissue.









If you have really dry lips, then put some chap stick or lip balm before you put on your lipstick. This will help soften your lips and prevent too many creases.
You can make your lipstick last longer by placing a tissue over your lips, and then dusting translucent powder over the tissue. Just enough powder will seep through the tissue to seal the lipstick in.
For extra glimmer, apply a coat of lip gloss.

, If you are going for a neutral, natural look, you can omit the lip liner and lipstick, and brush on a coat of lip gloss instead. Lip gloss works well for the day time, because it is soft and light; lipstick works best for evenings.

Finish off your look.",How to Apply Makeup," When you’re applying makeup, it is necessary to start with a clean palette. Remove any makeup that you might have slept in, and wash off makeup from earlier on in the day. If you try to apply more makeup over the top of old makeup (not including touch ups), your end look will appear caked on and more unnatural than makeup put on a fresh face. You also need to cleanse any makeup residue to keep your skin from getting clogged and irritated. You can use a good makeup remover or a mild baby oil to get rid of all makeup residues.









Keep in mind that you should always remove your makeup at the end of the day; sleeping with your makeup on can clog your pores and cause blemishes and wrinkles.

, For the same reason you remove your old makeup, you should also wash your face. Use a mild facial cleanser to gently wash your face, spending about one minute of massaging to remove all bacteria and dead skin cells in your pores before rinsing with cool water. Finish up by applying a facial moisturizer, regardless of your skin type.








, Before you add any makeup you need to prime your face. The purpose of a face primer is to enhance the appearance of makeup and increase the longevity. You can apply the primer with your fingers, covering your whole face with a small amount. The primer will also help your makeup up stay on all day. If you are going to sweat, run, or do anything that will cause your makeup to wear off or smear, primer is a necessity for you.








, There are several types of foundation, but they are generally applied the same way. Liquid, cream, and powder foundations all act to create a more even complexion, working to create a even base for your other makeup. Use a foundation brush or damp beauty sponge to apply foundation to your face, blending into your neck and earlobes if necessary. Keep in mind that your foundation should be the same color as your natural skin tone, not much darker or lighter. It helps to match your foundation to your chest and neck so your face isn't a different color then the rest of your body. You never want a harsh line from your jaw line to your neck. This is very unnatural and gives a harsh and unblended finish, which is not what you want. Choosing a color that matches your skin always helps.









You can use a concealer brush to add a little extra foundation to cover up stubborn blemishes.
Liquid foundation can be applied with your fingertips, although this is more likely to introduce bacteria to your skin and cause future breakouts.

, The purpose of concealer is to even out uneven skin tone as a result of blemishes or dark under-eye circles. You can also use a concealer in a shade slightly lighter in your skin tone to brighten dark areas or high points of your face. Use a concealer brush or your (clean) fingertips to blend concealer on your undereye area in an upside down triangle shape, down the bridge of your nose, chin, center of forehead, and above upper lip. You can use a shade matching your skin tone to cover any red areas or over any acne or dark spots. Blend the edges of your concealer so it seamlessly blends in to your foundation.








, This step is optional, but if you’re looking for long-lasting, crease free makeup you should use a setting powder to hold your foundation and concealer in place. Use a damp beauty sponge to pick up loose powder and press into the under eye area, then gently sweep off any excess with a brush. Use a large, fluffy brush to cover your whole face in a translucent or matching setting powder. This step is particularly useful if you’re using liquid foundation, as it will help to set the foundation and remove any shine or tackiness. 







, With your foundation completed, it is likely that your face now looks contour-less and flat because of the uniform color. In order to provide some depth, you’ll need to create the illusion of highlights and shadows. You can use a cream (apply before you set your face) or powder highlighter to brighten up the deepest areas of your face: the inside corners of your eyes, underneath your eyebrows, in the center of your cupid’s bow, and on the tops/sides of your cheekbones. This will make your face look more bright and awake than it would otherwise.









Create a ‘3’ shape on your cheekbones, into your eyebrows, and up to your forehead for the perfect highlight.
You can use your fingers or a small highlighter brush to apply the highlighter.

, The opposite of bringing out the highlights on your face, contouring involves adding a powder that is a few shades darker than your actual skin tone (different than a bronzer) to the areas you want to look minimized or further away. Typically, you should contour under your cheekbones in the hollows of your cheeks, on the sides of your nose, and under your jawline. You can also make a large forehead appear smaller by applying contour near your hairline. This will make your face look thinner and longer in appearance, and provide the shadows that naturally occur without foundation. After you contour your face, you can go in with bronzer to add color to your face. Use a big bronzing brush and buff out your bronzer right over where you contoured.








, The final step in prepping your face is to add blush to your cheeks. Everyone’s cheeks have a bit of color, but this color varies for every person. Apply your blush with large brush on the apples of your cheeks (the round part that forms when you smile). Don’t go too heavy with your blush, just add enough to replenish the color that would form naturally.








, This step is optional depending on the fullness of your eyebrows, but is generally recommended for those who have thin or sparse eyebrows. Select a color of brow pencil, powder, or pomade that is close to your natural hair color. Start by outlining the edges of your eyebrows with small dashing motions to mimic hair, and then fill in the center using the same small strokes. Go in the same direction of your hair growth, and set with a clear or tinted brow gel to make them stay all day. 







, This is another optional product, but applying an eyeshadow primer will help your eyeshadow to stay on for much longer. If you’ve gone without it, you may have noticed that your eyeshadow fades or becomes oily and collects in the creases of your eyelids after several hours. Use your fingertip to dab on your eyeshadow primer, blending it from the roots of your lashes to the top of your crease. Set with a powder to make a perfect base for blending your eyeshadow.








, There are many ways to apply eyeshadow, although the most basic and classic look is to apply a single color over the entirety of your eyelid. Use an eyeshadow brush to apply your eyeshadow to your eyelid, starting in the center near your lash line and blending outwards. Fade your eyeshadow into your natural skin tone near your crease and the inside and outside corners of your eyes, to prevent any harsh lines from forming. If you want a bit more dramatic look, apply a second darker matte color of eyeshadow in a ‘C’ shape from the outside corner of your lash line up to the top, outer ⅓ of your eyelid crease. Finish by sweeping a lighter shimmer color starting from the inner corner and ending in the middle, blending with the rest.









Your main color of eyeshadow should never go all the way to your eyebrow, and should not extend further off your lid than the end of your eyebrow (unless you’re going for a very dramatic look).
You may, however, highlight your browbone (the area under your eyebrow but above your crease) by applying a lighter shade of eyeshadow. Be sure to use natural colors such as cream, sand, or white, if your skin is pale. Alternatively, try a nude shade slightly lighter than your skintone. The color doesn't have to be matte, but any sparkle it does have should be subtle.
You can blend your eyeshadow onto your lower lid, sweeping the shadow along the lower lash line starting from the outside corner. Blend well so you don't have a harsh line.
If you use multiple colors of eyeshadow, always be sure to blend them together.

, The purpose of eyeliner is to provide the illusion of a fuller lash line; therefore, choose a color that is similar to your natural hair color (or brown if you have blond hair) to go along your lashes. For a smudgy look, use an eyeliner pencil, or create a sleek and smooth look by using cream or liquid eyeliner. Create a dashed or dotted line across your lash line, and then connect the dots to create a full, continuous line. You can choose to wing the end up and outwards a bit if you want, otherwise you simply need to follow your lash line from the inside corner to the outside corner.









Adding eyeliner to your bottom lash line should be done sparingly, as it will create a much darker/bolder look and appear a bit more unnatural than eyeliner on your top lash line only.
If you feel comfortable, try tight-lining your eyes by using your eyeliner on the waterline of your eyelid.

, To complete your eye makeup, you’ll need to top off your eyes with a bit of mascara. There are several mascaras to choose from depending on the look you want; if you have short lashes, use a mascara that will add length, or if you have thin lashes, use a volumizing mascara. Dip the brush in the mascara once and lightly wipe off the excess onto the edge of the container or a paper towel. Looking straight forward, apply it to the top lash with upward strokes. Start with the inner part of your eye and work your way outward. Do both eyes with two coats, then let dry. You can also apply mascara to your bottom lashes if you like. 








Wiggle the brush as you apply it, as this will help to coat between lashes instead of just the under layer.
Never pump your mascara brush in and out of the mascara, as this causes air pockets.
Avoid applying more than two coats of mascara, as this will take away the natural darkening look and give a cake-y thick look that is much less natural.
A good trick for making your lashes look fuller is to apply a coat of baby powder between coats of mascara; this will add a bit of length and volume to your lashes.

, Apply lip balm, primer, or sealer. This will help make all lip products applied last longer and much more vibrant. Additionally, who doesn’t prefer soft lips? Adding a good balm or salve will prevent your lips from flaking later in the day.








, Line your lips with a liner that matches your lip color or the color you are going to apply. Sharpen your lip liner, and line around the natural line of your lips. With your lips outlined, use the pencil to continue filling in your lips. This works to even out the color and texture of your lips, making it easier to apply a gloss or lipstick later.








, Select a lipstick or gloss of your choice to go over your lipliner; for a natural look stick with a nude shade, or pick a bright hue for a more bold appearance. Start in the center of your lip, and blend the color outwards. Be sure to apply the color as close to the edges of your lips as you can without overdoing it and going outside your lip line. To prevent any lipstick from getting on your teeth, stick your index finger straight into your mouth and pull it out quickly; any excess color will stick to your finger and avoid being transferred to your teeth later on.








, With the completion of your lips makeup, your look is finished! Give yourself a once-over to make sure there aren’t any smudges or loose eyeshadow that needs to be removed with a fluffy brush. If you do have any mistakes, use a q-tip dipped in makeup remover to rectify them.








After you have applied all of the makeup you desire, you should set your face with a setting spray. Simply hold the bottle 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) away from your face and spray 4-5 times on your whole face. Now your makeup will stay on longer than ever!

Use concealer around the eyes.,
Trace your eyes with eyeliner.,
Add a touch of eyeshadow.,
Apply mascara to your lashes.",How to Use Makeup to Make Your Eyes Look Bigger1," If you have puffy eyes or dark circles, concealer can hide these blemishes at least a little. It can also even out your complexion around your eyes, giving them a cleaner look. Dab it under your eyes, in the creases, and along the inside of your nose on both sides.


If you have dark under-eye circles, use concealer one shade lighter than your natural skin tone.
You can also use special foundation meant for use around the eyes; it serves the dual purpose of covering blemishes and holding your eye makeup in place.;
, Eyeliner is the key to making your eyes pop, since it creates a frame that helps them stand out from the rest of your face. Draw a very thin line just under your bottom lash line. Draw a second line above the upper lash line. If done very lightly, the eyeliner will look like it is part your lower lash line and define your eyes, making them look bigger and whiter.


For a natural look, choose a shade of brown or charcoal, rather than black.
Applying white eyeliner to the inside of your eyelid will also cause your eyes to look bigger. Carefully draw a line on the inside of your lash line above and below your eyes.

, Using a color that matches your skin tone, brush the shadow lightly on your upper lid. Blend it thoroughly and carefully to look more natural. Apply white eyeshadow to the corners of your eyes and right below the brow to brighten up the eye area.

, You want to choose a mascara that offers clean, separated lashes so they don't look chunky or clumpy. Start at the roots and lightly brush upwards. If you don't like the way mascara looks on you, try a clear mascara. It subtly defines and lengthens your lashes without attracting too much attention.

You can extend the eyeliner line past the corner of your eye a few millimeters for an even more dramatic look.






Go ahead and use white eyeliner on the inside of your lash lines to brighten up the area.

, For a nighttime look, go darker and more definite. Apply a dark shadow to your eyelid, then use a lighter shadow for the area between your eyebrow and eyelid. Blend the edges together with your finger or a clean makeup sponge. Consider the following color combinations for different skin tones:


If you have a pink or peachy undertone (know as ""spring"" by makeup manufacturers) try sky blues, peaches and pastel pinks, yellow greens, and caramel colors.
If you have a blue or pinkish undertone (summer) try pastel pinks, sky blues, lavenders and plums, and shimmery golds.
If you have a golden or peachy undertone (autumn) try brilliant golds and coppers, ruddy or warm browns, and caramels.
If you have a blue or pink undertone (winter) try blues (any shade!), bright pinks, icy silvers, and beiges.

, Once you get the hang of doing your own eye shadow, experiment with other colors to find the combination that makes your eyes pop the most.


If you have brown eyes, try earthy tones such as browns, deep or olive greens, rustic purples and dirty blues.
If you have green eyes try ruddy browns, coppers, and purples.
If you have blue eyes, try dusty browns, emerald greens, periwinkles, and pinks.
For hazel eyes try browns or olive greens, coppers and silvers.

, Always finish a bold eye with a few sweeps of black mascara. For even thicker lashes, let the first layer dry, then add a second layer of mascara.

It’s best to use an oil-free eye makeup remover because oils can leave behind residue that makes it difficult for lash adhesive to stick to the lashes the next time you use them.;
, After the eye makeup remover has started to loose the lash glue, start to pull up the edge of the lashes. Make sure to peel up from the outer corner of the lashes where they tend to come loose most easily.Use the pads of your fingers to peel off the lashes. Don’t use tweezers or your fingernails because they can rip the lashes or stretch out the band.

, Once you have the outer corner free, pull the lash off toward the inner corner. Make sure to work slowly and carefully, so you don’t stretch the band or warp the lashes.








If there are any areas where the lashes are still stuck, take a fresh cotton swab and wet it with eye makeup remover so you can run it over the spot before continuing to pull on the lash.

, When you’ve removed the lashes from your eyes, wet a cotton pad with eye makeup remover. Run the pad over the entire lash band to remove any eyeliner or mascara that may be on the lashes.








Clean both sides of the lash band to ensure that you remove all of the makeup residue.

They often hold more than one pair of lashes, so you can store all of your lashes in one place.

, Take the dry lashes and place them on the half-moon trays, bending them gently to fit around the curve so they hold their shape. Next, place the tray inside the plastic case and close the container, so the lashes are protected from dust, dirt, and debris.







, Once the lashes are in their packaging, it’s important to store them in the right spot. Heat and strong light can warp the lashes, so you should keep them in a cool, dark spot, such as a dresser drawer, until you want to apply them the next time.Avoid storing your eyelashes in the bathroom, which often gets hot and humid.

If you'd like to only remove some of your makeup (you smudged it or made a mistake, for example), use a Q-tip! Just dab on some shampoo (or whatever you have at your disposal) on the necessary area. Then wipe it off with the other end of the Q-tip. Voila!

, Some foam will most likely appear. Keep your eyes closed so nothing gets in them. Even if it is ""tear free"" you don't want to take any risks!








, Just like you would any cleanser, grab your washcloth and gently wipe off the baby shampoo. Tada! Then gently wipe your face dry with a cloth towel.









If baby shampoo doesn't work for you or you don't have any on hand, try the methods discussed below!

"
"
Use your moisturizer or a gentle soap or cleanser.,
Make your own!,
Be wary of petroleum jelly and oils.,
Use baby wipes.,
Spring for a legitimate makeup remover.",How to Remove Eye Makeup2," Unless you plastered your face with glue, odds are your moisturizer, cold cream, or facial cleanser can take your makeup off just as effectively as any legitimate makeup remover can. Just close your eyes, rub gently over the area, and wipe off with a cloth. You're already washing your face, so why not?









Don't worry about it stinging your eyes -- unless you're using a cleanser that isn't mild (has salicylic acid in it, for example), you should be fine, so long as you keep your eyes closed.
After you've cleansed, dab your face and eyes with a towel to dry off.

, Feeling like a child of the earth? Then you can make your own eye makeup remover! Pretty much any oil works, but olive, mineral, or almond work best.









Try combining 2 ounces of witch hazel with 2 ounces of olive oil for an easy homemade makeup remover. Give the concoction a shake, dab some on a cotton ball or cloth, and wipe across the area. Then go over the area once more with a dry cloth or cotton ball.
Witch hazel is good for wrinkles! The smell isn't great, but it sure can make your skin smooth!

, Some people swear by Vaseline (petroleum jelly) or using oils (mineral or baby oil, specifically) to remove their makeup, but you may not want to take their word for it. It can create a film around the eyes, blocking pores, and creating little bumps called milia.If you have anything else available, go for it first.

, If you're looking for a mess-free, can't-possibly-sting method, baby wipes are the way to go. All you have to do is grab one, wipe it across your eye (closed, of course!), and the makeup comes right off. Keep some by your bed and you don't even have to get out of it to clean your face at night!









Makeup remover comes in wipe form too!

, If you have very sensitive skin and neither baby shampoo nor cheap makeup remover works for you, you may need to invest in a good makeup remover. They are expensive, but if you use it reasonably it will last for a long time. There are dozens of products out there. Choose a brand you trust you won't regret it.


Clinique, Noxzema, Neutrogena, MAC, and Lancome all have products that are worth your investment. There are removers that come in liquid form, as a cleanser, wipe, that foam, or even as creams. There's bound to be one out there that you like!

Apply a light colored liner to your waterline.,
Fill in your brows.,
Use multiple coats of mascara.,
Apply an under eye corrector to dark circles.,
Dot a brightening concealer under your eyes.,
Use foundation to even out your skin tone.,
Choose neutral shades for your lips and cheeks.",How to Make Your Eyes the Spotlight," To make your eyes stand out, it’s important to choose the right shade of eyeshadow. A light color helps brighten and widen your eyes. However, you should choose a light shade that’s opposite your eye color on the color wheel to create a contrast that makes your eyes pop.It’s best to apply your lid shade with a flat, dense shadow brush.
Red is opposite green on the color wheel, so green and hazel eyes look best with shadows that have a red undertone, such as plum, wine, or reddish brown.
Orange is opposite blue on the color wheel, so blue eyes look best with peach, apricot, burnt orange, and copper shadows.
Brown is a neutral color, so brown eyes look good with almost any eyeshadow shade. However, brown eyes usually best with blue and purple tones.
Gray is also a neutral color, so gray eyes look good with a wide range of shades. For the best look, though, opt for earthy greens, cool browns, and purples.;
, To really define your eyes, you want to add definition to them. Using a lighter shade on the lid makes your eyes look bigger, but you should add a darker, mid-tone shade to the crease to add dimension to your look. Sweep the mid-tone shade into the crease with a tapered crease brush to help control where you place the color.Your crease is the area where your eye naturally folds. If you’re having trouble finding it, press your finger lightly over eye -- the crease is right below the socket bone, above the eyeball.
It’s usually best to use a matte eyeshadow in the crease.
While any mid-tone shade can work in the crease, a neutral shade, such as brown, gray, or taupe, is often the safest bet, particularly if you’re wearing a colorful lid shade.

, To open up and accent your eyes, it helps to use a shimmery shadow in key places. Choose a shade that’s lighter than your skintone, and apply it with a small brush just below the arch of your brow and to the inner corner of your eye around your tear duct.For fair and light skin, a shimmery ivory shade works well to highlight your brow bone and inner corner.
For medium skin, a shimmery champagne shade works well to highlight your brow bone and inner corner.
For dark skin, a shimmery gold shade works well to highlight your brow bone and inner corner.

, Eyeliner can help define your eyes and draw attention to them. However, if you line your entire eye, you can actually wind up making them look smaller. To widen your eyes, only line the outer half of your upper and lower lash lines.Black or brown liner works for all eye colors.
If you have brown eyes, navy eyeliner can help make your eyes appear brighter.If you have hazel eyes, gold eyeliner can help bring out the yellow flecks in your eyes.
If you have green eyes, purple eyeliner can help make your eyes appear more vibrant.
If you have blue eyes, emerald green eyeliner can help make your eyes pop.
If you have gray eyes, burgundy eyeliner can help draw attention to your eyes.

, While black or colored eyeliner can help add definition that accents your eye, using a light eyeliner on your waterline helps make your eyes appear larger so they draw more focus. Use a nude, white, or ivory eyeliner on the waterline to instantly widen your eyes.The waterline is the thin strip of skin that’s just above your lower lashes.
The easiest way to apply liner to the waterline is lightly pull down on your lower lid to expose the skin and gently run a liner pencil along it.
If you have sensitive, easily irritated eyes, don’t line your waterline.

, Your brows frame your eyes, so you want them to look as neat and defined as possible. Use a pencil, powder, or cream product to fill in any gaps in your brows, and follow up with a clear brow gel to comb your brows into place.If you’re not used to filling in your brows, it’s best to opt for a powder product because it offers the most natural look. You don’t even have to buy a specific brow powder. Use a matte eyeshadow that matches your brow color and apply it with a small angled brow brush.

, Full, fluttery lashes help draw attention to your eyes, and mascara is a necessity to thicken and lengthen your lashes. However, for the most dramatic results, it’s best to layer your mascara. Start with a volumizing formula to help thicken your lashes, and then apply a lengthening mascara to help separate and define your lashes.For the best look, use an extremely black mascara.
You may want to curl your lashes before you apply your mascara to really open your eyes.
If you aren’t happy with how your lashes look with mascara, you can add false lashes to really bring focus to your eyes.

, Dark circles can pull attention from your eyes, and concealer alone isn’t always enough to cover them. Start by applying an orange-toned color corrector under your eyes to cancel out the blue tones. Use your finger to blend the product in well so the shadows disappear.If you have fair or light skin, use a peach color corrector.
If you have medium or dark skin, use an orange color corrector.
You can apply the color corrector with a sponge or concealer brush, but it usually works best if you apply it with a finger. The warmth from your skin helps the corrector melt in for a seamless look.

, While the color corrector helps tone down dark circles, it doesn’t help brighten under your eyes. Apply a brightening concealer in a color one or two shades lighter than your skin tone under the eyes and use a fluffy concealer brush to blend it in.For the brightest looking eyes, apply the concealer in a triangle shape beneath your eyes that comes to a point on your cheek beside the side of your nose. Fill the triangle in, and blend the concealer in well to create a highlighted effect beneath your eyes.

, Uneven, blotchy skin can draw attention away from your eyes. To ensure that your eyes get the focus, apply a foundation all over your face to even out your skintone and cover any discolorations. If your face is mostly clear, you can opt for a tinted moisturizer or BB cream instead.You can use a brush, sponge, or your fingers to apply the foundation. A sponge offers the most airbrushed finish.
If you have oily skin, make sure to set your foundation with a powder.
Add concealer to add spots on your face that the foundation doesn’t cover. Make sure that the concealer matches your skintone exactly.

, When you want the attention to be on your eyes, it’s important to choose the right makeup to pair with it. Avoid bold colors on your cheeks and lips, and instead opt for neutral shades that won’t compete with your eyes. Choose a neutral pink blush and nude lipstick or gloss so your eyes get all the focus."

To open up close-set eyes, apply eyeliner only to the outer corners of both your upper and lower lash lines. Stop the eyeliner halfway across your lash lines., Applying eyeliner to the waterline can help define your eyes, but it can also close them up. It is best to avoid applying black eyeliner to the waterline, especially if you have small eyes. It can make your eyes appear even smaller.To make your eyes larger, apply white or ivory eyeliner to the waterline of your lower lid.Remember to apply mascara to your lower lashes as well as to your upper when you are done.

, When applying mascara, hold the wand just below your upper eyelashes, close to the lash line. Then blink slowly while pulling the wand upwards. Let the first coat dry first if you need to apply another. Use mascara on your lower lashes sparingly and with care, as it can smudge easily.


If you need to wear mascara on your lower lashes, consider dusting some powder under your eye first. When you are done applying the mascara, dust the powder off. The powder will have caught any stray mascara.
Try to get waterproof mascara. It is less likely to run or smudge.
If you have dark hair, try black mascara. If you have lighter hair, try a brown or dark brown mascara.

Apply a thin line of eyelash glue to the band, and wait for the glue to turn tacky. Carefully place the eyelash against your upper lid, as close to the lash line as possible.


Most eyelash glues come out opaque. They are tacky when they just begin to turn clear.
While waiting for the glue to turn tacky, consider curving the eyelash into a narrow U shape. This will help it curve against your eye better.

, Open up an eyelash curler and bring it close to your upper lashes. Place your upper lashes in the mouth of the curler, making sure the mouth is parallel to your lashes. Move the curler closer to your eye until it's at the base of your eyelashes. Keeping your eye open, slowly close the curler. Hold it like this for about five seconds. Repeat, if necessary, for more volume.

, Apply your foundation first, then apply your chosen concealer. If you are applying/blending the concealer with your fingers, be sure to use your ring finger. It is the weakest and gentlest finger, and thus less likely to damage the delicate skin. Once you have finished applying your concealer, consider blotting the area with a thin tissue. This will soak up any excess concealer and prevent it from looking cakey later in the day. Here are some more tips on using concealer:To hide shadows: choose an orange or peach-tinted concealer. Apply it under your eye using your ring finger, then blend it in. Cover it with a concealer that matches your skintone.

Dust some brow powder (or matte eyeshadow) that matches your hair color onto your eyebrows when you are done.If you want to leave your brows natural, consider combing over them with a brow comb or a toothbrush. Reserve this toothbrush for makeup purposes only; don't use it to brush your teeth. This will help smooth any unruly hairs.

, Bright, bold lipstick and blush may take attention away from your eyes.Instead, try leaving the rest of your makeup subtle, especially if you are going to work or school. Choose some lip gloss or neutral lipstick, and save that bold color for when you don't want to draw attention to your eyes. Keep your blush to a minimum. Use just enough to give your skin that healthy glow, but not so much that your cheeks look rosey like a doll's.

The skin under our eyes is delicate, and applying the concealer thickly will just make your under eyes look cakey and creased., It’s important to do this step before you’ve added any shadow, mascara, or eyeliner, because it will smudge your makeup. Hold your eyelash curler at the base of your lashes and press down for three seconds.

Just be careful not to get your eyelash curler too warm, as you can hurt the sensitive skin around your eyes., Depending on skin tone, outfit choice, and general preference, you’ll be working with various color palettes. However, a general rule of thumb is to apply the darkest color you’re working with to the inner and outer corners of your eyes.This technique is pretty versatile, and works well with all different eye shapes.
Use a stiffer brush for this step. Stiff brushes make it easier to pack color onto the eyes, getting a solid, pigmented look in these dark areas., This will help make your eyes appear larger while adding depth.Make sure that you’ve applied enough of the darker shadow so that it can be seen when your eye is fully open.


Use a thin pencil brush to apply color to the crease. By using a small brush, you’ll get the color into the tiny crease without smudging it all over the lid., By highlighting this area, your eyes look bright and large. Using this same color, add a pop to the innermost corner of the eye, near the tear duct. These two pops of highlight will brighten your makeup look.The stiff brush should be used for this step as well. It packs on the color well, making it perfect for covering the center of the eyelid with the light color., You may have applied the different colors precisely and methodically, but harsh lines on the eyelid do not look good.

Use a soft, feathery brush for blending. This brush makes it easier to delicately blend the colors together instead of harshly smearing the shadows everywhere., For subtle look, apply it as closely and as thinly to the waterline as possible. For more dramatic looks, apply thicker lines.You can apply your eyeliner just to your top lash line, to the top and bottom, or skip this step all together. Depending on your eye shape and the look you are going for, you may need to experiment with some different application techniques.


Liquid eyeliners take a lot of practice to do correctly, and create very harsh lines. Powders and gels are better choices for beginners, and can create softer looks.Line from the outside, moving inward. Stop before you get too close to your nose. Lining the entire perimeter of your eye to your nose can make your eyes look smaller and close together., To apply it to your lashes, start at the base and slowly move to the ends. As you move along your lashes, slightly wiggle the wand back and forth. This will help to prevent clumps from sticking to your lashes.If you are applying it to both your top and bottom lashes, do your bottom lashes first. If you start with your top lashes, you may get mascara on your eyelids when you look down to apply it to your bottom lashes.
Feel free to apply multiple coats of mascara. You can build upon the layers and make your lashes appear thicker., No eye makeup look is complete without great eyebrows. Your brows should start perpendicular to the side of your nose, so use your pencil or brush to find this spot. Brush your brow hairs with a brush, and begin filling them in with color with short, light strokes that blend in with your natural hairs. Make sure that your lines are not too harsh to prevent the brows from looking unnatural.Having your brows shaped professionally can save you time when you’re filling them in. Waxing or plucking them into the perfect shape will give you a stencil to follow with your brow pencil or powder.

Apply them according to instructions on the bottle.In most cases, you should apply 1 to 2 drops in each eye when you’re using redness relief eye drops. However, you should consult your product’s instructions to be sure about the proper usage.
Avoid using eye drops that contain naphazoline or tetrahydrozoline on a long-term basis. Occasional use is fine, but using them regularly can actually make the redness in your eyes worse., Dark circles under the eyes can make you look tired, but concealer alone may not be enough to hide them. To counteract the blue undertones, you should use an orange color corrector first. Apply it with a brush or a clean finger until well blended, and then cover with a flesh toned concealer.If you have light or fair skin, an orange corrector may be too dark for you. Instead, opt for a peach shade.

, Whether you have dark circles under your eyes or not, the right concealer can help make your eyes look more awake. Choose a concealer that’s a shade or two lighter than your skin tone to use under your eyes. That will help brighten the area so you look like you got plenty of sleep.For the most brightening effect, apply your concealer in a “V” or upside down triangle shape beneath your eye. Swipe it directly under the eye, but bring it down to a point on your cheek beside your nostril and fill in the entire area. Blend well with a brush or a clean finger, and use a finely milled powder to set the concealer so it doesn’t crease.

, When you want your eyes to look wide and awake, it’s important to use eye shadows in light or pale colors on the lid. That’s because dark colors make objects recede, while light shades bring them forward. With a light shade on your lid, your eyes will appear larger and more prominent.If you have fair or light skin, ivory and cream shades are ideal lid colors.
If you have medium or darker skin, opt for beige and tan shadows.
Light pink or purple shades can compliment a wide variety of skin tones.
To keep balance with the rest of your makeup, it's best to choose a neutral lip color when you want your eyes to look wider and more awake. By going with a soft lip color, it'll keep the focus on your eyes. The best bet is a shade that's similar to your natural lip color.

, You can make your eyes appear brighter by using a light, shimmery shadow on the inner corner of your eye near the tear duct. The light color and shimmery finish will catch the light so your eyes look wider and more awake.To apply your inner corner highlight precisely, use a small pencil brush that comes to a point.
Instead of using a powder shadow as an inner corner highlight, try using a light shimmery eyeliner or cream shadow pencil to brighten the area.

, When you want your eyes to appear more awake, it's best to keep your eye liner thin and wing it up at the outer corner for a cat eye shape. That helps lift the eye so it appears more open.You don't have to go for a dramatic wing if you want a softer look. A small flick at the end of your liner can still help open up your eye.
Cat eye liner is traditionally done with a liquid eyeliner, but you can use a pencil or cream if you prefer. For a soft, natural look, use a powdered eye shadow and a small angled brush to create your cat eye liner.
You can also skip eyeliner completely when you want a wide-eyed look. By not using liner on your upper lash line, it makes your eye lid space appear larger so your eyes look wider overall.

, To make your eyes appear wider, use a nude or flesh tone eyeliner to line the inner rim of your lower lid. That will make the whites of your eyes look like they extend further, so your eyes appear wider.You can use a white eyeliner in place of nude or flesh tone shade. However, white liner can look very stark, especially if you have medium or darker skin, so it isn’t the most natural option.
In addition to nude and white shades, a champagne colored liner can help widen your eyes. The slight sheen that the metallic shade has provides a strong brightening effect too.

, If you have strongly defined brows, they call attention to the eye area so your eyes appear larger. Use an eyebrow pencil or powder in a shade that matches your brow color to fill in your brows for a strong look.Eyebrow pencils provide a bold look, while brow powder offers a softer, more natural look.
If you prefer powder for your brows, you don’t necessarily have to buy a product specifically for the brows. Any matte eye shadow that matches your hair color will work to fill in your brows.
Whether you use a pencil or an angled brush to apply a powder, use short, dash-like strokes to mimic the way eyebrow hairs naturally look., Flat, straight lashes tend to close off your eyes, while curled lashes make eyes appear wider and more open. Before applying mascara, use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes and open up your eyes so you look more awake.After you’ve curled your lashes, apply a coat or two of mascara. That will help lock the curl in place and add volume to your lashes so your eyes appear larger.

, It’s easy to remember to apply mascara to your top lashes, but it’s just as important to add some to your lower lashline. It will extend the look of your eye so they appear wider and more awake. Make sure to use a waterproof mascara on the bottom lashes to prevent smudging under the eyes.For the most precise application, choose a mascara with a small, thin brush for the lower lashline. That will keep the mascara from smearing beneath your eyes.

, In most cases, adding a coat of mascara to your top lashes is all you need to give your eyes a brighter, more alert look. However, if you want a particularly wide awake look, you may want to Apply False Eyelashes. You can use a single strip of lashes or individual clusters near the end of your eyes to help make them look more open.For the best results, choose natural, fluttery-looking false eyelashes. Avoid oversized, theatrical looking lashes.

Use a colored eyeliner.,
Try a different shade of mascara.,
Experiment with different color eyeshadow.,
Choose a lip color that will accentuate your eyes.,
Try adding bronzer to your makeup routine.,
Consider your hair color.",How to Make Hazel Eyes Pop1," Although most people tend to stick with a simple black eyeliner, if you have hazel eyes, you can try experimenting with different colors to see what makes your eyes stand out.


For example, if you want to bring out the blue in your eyes, try using a deep purple, which will bring out any blue tones you have in your eyes.If you want to bring out the green in your eyes, try using colors such as taupe, brown, green, or gold.;
, As with eyeliner, if you have hazel eyes, you aren’t stuck with black. Try other shades, too! Some mascara comes with flecks of gold, which is a good option for hazel eyes, you can also try lighter browns, or even mascara that has a purple tint., This can be tricky for people with hazel eyes. Most of the colors that will accentuate you hazel eyes tend to be bolder colors that can end up looking clownish, if you’re not careful. Try sticking to colors in the purple, blue, green, and gold family.Apply moderately! If you’re using a green shade, don’t apply it to the entire lid. Especially if you’re applying your makeup for work or some other professional endeavour. For example, start with a neutral color, such as taupe, and then apply your eyeshadow to the crease only so it will be more subtle. You can always experiment with using more when you are going out in the evening.
Avoid using too much blue. A bit of blue can accentuate your eyes if they have more blue tones than brown. However, especially if your hazel eyes tend to be more of a greenish-brown, too much blue can clash., Eye makeup isn’t the only method of bringing out the color in your eyes. Choosing a lip color, whether it be lipstick, lip stain, or a gloss, can also help your eyes pop.While you don’t want to overpower your eyes with a very bold lipstick, you can still accentuate them.For example, try choosing colors that are complementary to your eyeshadow. Generally, berry colors (such as coral, pink, or red) offer good, but subtle choices.One example of a bad color pairing would be to choose a very dark berry color for your lips, and then pairing it with a green eyeshadow.

, Most bronzers are made to give you a golden glow, and gold is great for making hazel eyes pop. However, apply in moderation as you don’t want to give yourself a fake looking orange tint. Simply sweep the bronzer gently over your t-zone. This area includes the skin just above your eyebrows, your nose, and the skin just under your nose, and below your lips., Hair color plays a big role in accentuating or down-playing our eyes. If you already dye your hair, or are up for trying it, you can try warmer tones, such as red or auburn, or even a more golden shade.If you have a more blue tone to your hazel eyes, you might also be able to work with cooler shades such as a lighter gold tone.If you are nervous about dying your hair, try using a semi-permanent color that doesn't last as long as permanent color, or you could even try on a wig in the color you are thinking of to get an idea of how it will react with your skin and eye color.

"
"
Avoid clothing that is the same color as your eyes.,
Use glasses to accentuate your eye color.,
Choose outfits in the purple or green family.,
Accessorize with colors that will bring out the color of your eyes.",How to Make Hazel Eyes Pop2," For a person with hazel eyes, this can mean different things. Some people tend to have more greenish-blue eyes, while others have more greenish-brown eyes. However, you should choose the tone in your eye color that seems to be most predominant, and then avoid that color.


For example, a bright blue sweater will downplay the blue in your eyes, if you tend more towards bluish-green.

, If you wear glasses, you can choose frames that will accentuate your eye color. To bring out the green in your eyes, try choosing frames that are in the purple family, or even dark green frames. To bring out the gold tones, try dark shades of purple or even plum., The darker the color the better. For example, an emerald green or royal purple will accentuate your eyes. Typically, it will be best if the article of clothing used to accentuate your eyes is your shirt (or a dress).

, There are a wide variety of accessories you can use to accentuate your eyes.


For example, try a scarf or hat in which is in the purple, green, or gold family. You can also try this with a hat. If you wear earrings, you can try the same with that, too.
Accessories that are worn closer to your face will play a bigger role than items that aren't. So if you're trying to emphasize your eyes, you should choose earrings, a scarf, or a hat instead of something like a bracelet or your shoes.

Try gold eye shadow.,
Use purple eyeshadow.,
Apply blue eye shadow.",How to Make Brown Eyes Stand Out1," Gold is a great way to add some pop to your brown eyes. Use gold eyeshadow on your eyelids to highlight the gold specks in your eyes. Apply a matte gold shadow or a metallic gold shadow for some real pop.You can also try other warm metallic shades like copper and bronze on your eyes to make them stand out.;
, Purple is another great color for making your brown eyes stand out. Use light purple, lilac, and dark purple shades on your eyes. Layer each shade of purple to make your eyes pop.Look for a purple eye shadow palette that has a variety of shades you can play with. Start with darker purple shade on the lower half of your eyelid and then use a lighter shade on the upper half. Blend them so it looks like you have a gradient of purple color on your eyelids.

, Blue eye shadow can add pop to your brown eyes. Use shades of blue like navy, pale blue, and midnight blue. Try using one shade of blue or layer on darker to lighter shades of blue eyeshadow on your eyes.You can also add a bit of gold eyeshadow to the blue for contrast. Put blue eye shadow on one half of your eyelid and then add gold on the other half. Blend the two colors so it looks like they fade into each other.

Finished.

",How to Make Blue Eyes Pop," If you want to make your eyes pop, then you should put concealer below your eyes so your eyes will stand out for their beauty, and not for their dark circles. Remember to use a concealer that is one or two shades lighter than your skin tone, and to use a special concealer for dark eye circles if necessary. Here's how to wear the concealer correctly:









Put a few dots of concealer around the dark circles below your eyes and gently tap the concealer into your skin to blend it in.
Place a dot of concealer on the inside corners of your eyes next. Tap it into the skin.
You can also add a little concealer to your nose or cheeks to cover any blemishes.
Remember to blend the concealer by tapping it with your fingers or using a light brush instead of rubbing it in.;
, Once you've applied the concealer around your eyes, the base coat will help give your face an even tone that will keep people focused on your eyes.









You can use a sponge or a brush to apply the base coat.
You don't have to apply it over every inch of your face. Just focus on the uneven parts.
Check your hairline and jaw lines to make sure that you don't have an obvious foundation line.

, Shimmer is a fun way to add some glamour to a more casual look and to draw more attention to yourself. Use a brush to apply shimmer to your face and only put it on a few parts of your face, like on your cheeks and eyes, or the look will be too intense.








If you want to apply shimmer to your eyes, you can use a thin brush to dab a light cream-to-powder shadow to the inner corners of your eyes. Then you can drag the brush as close to the lower lash line as you can to create a thin line of shimmer over your top lids.

, The trick to making your eyes stand out is by shading them with a color that is opposite the color of your eyes on the color wheel. If your eyes are blue, then the color opposite blue is orange. It may feel silly to use pure orange, but shading your eyes in a color that is similar to orange, such as bronze or copper, can make your blue eyes pop because of the contrast.









Terra-cotta is another great shade that will make your blue eyes stand out.
If you're feeling bold, you really can use orange to make your eyes pop. You can pick a darker or shimmery orange so your look is less startling.
Shade your eyes in shades of purple. While blue eyes can get lost in shades of blue or green, they can pop with the help of a little purple. All shades of purple, from amethyst to royal purple, are great for this.
Some blue eyes get a very washed out look with purple hues. If you have eyes with bright blue / baby blue hues, and perhaps touches of grey, opt for pinks and gold, these colors will not only make your blue eyes the center of attention on your face, but will also take the cold edge your eyes can give off, and will warm them up to look happy and bubbly. (optional: Pair this eye shadow look with a highlight on the inner corner of your eye in a very light skin tone or an off-white color, and line your waterline with a white color on the inner third/half, and the outer third/half with a bronze-y or brown color. Lightly blend the two in the middle. I suggest Wet 'n' Wild's eyeliner in the color Mink Brown.) Create neutral smoky eyes. Instead of having your eyes get lost in a traditional black smoky look, create a neutral smoky look with rich browns, golds, and pinks to make the most of your blue eyes., To apply eyeliner to your waterline, take your finger and put it below your eye. Drag your skin down slightly, then with the other hand, use the brush to apply the liner on the waterline.









Try wearing regular bronze liner during the day, and dress up your look with dark bronze liner at night.
Use a beige liner to brighten your eyes. Avoid white liner or your eyes will look washed out.
If you can't part with the blue makeup, use a turquoise liner paired with a navy mascara to make your eyes stand out., Putting a little more on the sides of your lashes (near your closest ear) makes your eyes look more elongated and larger.









Brown mascara will make the blue in your eyes stand out more. If you're wedded to black mascara, try a very dark brown or even a navy-black color.

, The same rules about using the opposite of the color wheel apply to your clothes. If you want to make your blue eyes stand out, you should wear bronzes and other shades of orange, as well as purple, to make your eyes pop.









You can also wear blue so people will see that your clothes match your eyes. Wearing blue clothes won't wash out your blue eyes like wearing blue eyeshadow would.
If your clothes don't have any blue in them, wear blue necklaces or earrings to bring out the color in your eyes.
If you really want your blue eyes to stand out, make sure that your hair is out of your eyes, and that if you have bangs, that they are pushed to the side.

You can buy loose translucent powder at the drugstore or beauty supply store.

, Setting sprays are to makeup what topcoats are to nail polish. Basically, they help to ensure that your makeup doesn’t budge. When you sandwich your smoky eyeshadow between primer and setting spray, that makeup won’t be going anywhere.Close your eyes, hold the bottle at arm’s length, and spray it over your face.
Allow it to dry naturally. It should only take a few seconds.

, You’ve probably seen these patches in the drug store. While they boast a variety of benefits, they’re typically to help reduce under eye circles and puffiness. Instead of wearing them while you lounge, however, try putting them on as you do your smoky eye. When the excess powder inevitably sprinkles down, it will fall on the pads, rather than on your skin.Once you are done creating the smoky eyes, remove the pads. With that, you will remove all of the fall-out.
Additionally, your under eyes will be hydrated, calmed, and vibrant.

, If you struggle with a lot of fall-out while doing smoky eye, can always perform a bit of cleanup afterwards. Once you are satisfied with your eye makeup, dip a small cotton swab in eye makeup remover. Then, gently rub away any excess powder that has fallen onto your under eye and cheeks. After all, no one likes to look like they have two black eyes!, If you watch videos of most beauty gurus, they usually start with their eyes. After their eyes are flawless, they move on to their skin. While that may seem like a strange order, it makes perfect sense when you are dealing with eyeshadows. Instead of worrying about fall out and smudging underneath the eyes, you can cover and correct these things with your foundation and concealer. Get your smoky eyes done, and then start applying your skin products., It’s easy to get carried away with a beautiful, dark palette. However, sometimes you take a step back, look at yourself in the mirror, and realize you look like a goth. Luckily, there are ways to fix this. The easiest method is probably to simply dust a neutral shadow over your dark shadows. This will help brighten them up, and make the look a bit less intense., Instead of makeup remover, buy a bottle of cleansing water. You can typically find this near the makeup remover at your local drug store or at a beauty supply store. Then, dip a cotton swab into the cleansing water and gently run it over areas that seem a bit too dark.Unlike makeup remover, it won’t pick up all of the powder you’ve carefully applied. Instead, it’ll pick up excess pigment and leave your lids just looking a bit lighter.

, If you’re worried that your dark smoky eyes make your eyes look dark and dreary, try this simple trick. Take a white eyeliner pencil, and tight line your waterline. This is almost an optical illusion, making the whites of your eyes seem larger. It instantly brightens up your gaze, and undoes some of the heaviness that you created with your smoky eye.

Get enough sleep.,
Drink water.,
Moisturize your face.,
Massage your eyes.,
Exercise your eyes.,
Adjust your eyes to dim light.,
Use an eye mask.",How to Get Bigger Eyes1," If you're prone to staying up late at night, you'll know the reddened, dry look of eyes that comes with sleep deprivation. Getting enough sleep is mandatory if you want to maximize the size of your eyes. Eyes need at least five hours per night to properly regenerate.Of course, you'll need at least seven to ensure you're generally feeling your best each day.;
, Puffy eyes are well-known to result from dehydration. Keeping up with your body's need for water will keep the puffiness at bay. Eight glasses of water is often cited as the goal amount per day.If you have trouble working water consumption into your current day schedule, try bringing a refillable bottle of water around with you. Drink some of it whenever you think of it. Keeping hydrated has a long list of benefits. Not only will you look more awake, you'll feel more awake.

, While moisturizing the area around the eyes is going to improve the look of your eyes the most, the fact remains you should be giving your face a full-blown moisture treatment. This will make you look more vibrant, which in turn will have a beneficial effect on the way your eyes are perceived. Treat your face with a facial moisturizer, and buy an eye moisturizer for the area around your eyes. Eye moisturizers are designed to be very mild, which is perfect for such a sensitive area.You can use your regular moisturizer around your eyes, but you may notice an improvement if you buy a specific eye moisturizer for the job. Eye moisturizers are especially helpful if you are prone to wrinkles around the eyes., Gently massaging your area around your eyes helps encourage blood flow, improving the look of your eyes and reducing dark eye circles. Slowly massage around the eye, rubbing in small circles. If you want to make it a regular habit however, you should purchase a vibrating eye roller.They are relatively inexpensive, limit the transmission of oils between hand and face, and are specifically designed to promote blood flow around the eyes.


If you massage with your hands, make sure you have no excess oils in or on your fingers. Otherwise, the exchange of oil may result in skin irritation.

, If you want to improve the look of any body part, the best way to do so is to exercise it. Though not increasing the actual size of your eyes per se, making sure your eyes are as strong as possible is important and shouldn't be overlooked.Alternate quickly between near and far sight. Purposefully switching between the two quickly will force your eyes to speed up the time they take to adapt.
Directional eye exercises will improve mobility and reaction time. Try moving your eyes in different directions. Keep your head locked in one place, then look up, down, left and right. Try moving your eyes as far in each direction as you can. This will maximize the effectiveness of the exercise.

, It's a well-known fact that your pupils will adjust according to the amount of light in your line of vision. Being somewhere darker or dimly lit will force your pupils to enlarge so they can trap more light. Going somewhere dark will naturally increase your pupil size as a result, which in turn may increase the apparent size of your eyes. Keep in mind the opposite is true for bright lights, so it's best to avert your gaze from any particular brightness if you want to keep your pupils in check.


Some research has suggested that your pupils will contract and dilate when you even think of a different light setting. If you're in a bind where you have no control over the light setting, imagine yourself in a dimly lit space and check to see if it has any effect on your eyes., Putting on an eye mask for ten minutes will reduce inflammation around your eyes. Done regularly, the skin around your eyes will be softer, and your eyes will find it easier to shine.If you don't have an eye mask at hand, rubbing ice cubes around your eyes will have much of the same effect.

Choose your colors.,
Use the right supplies.,
Apply your face makeup.",How to Get Smoky Eyes With Makeup1," Any color can be used to create a smoky eye, although you will need at least three shades of a similar hue. The classic smoky eye is created with black or gray, but bronze and brown are also commonly used.


Green eyes look particularly good with a gray and plum smoky eye, while blue eyes pop with gold or copper and brown eyes go great with shades of navy and gray .
You should choose three shades of each color: a light, creamy color; a medium base color; and a dark, smoky color.
Avoid choosing colors that are too bright, or if you have very fair skin, too dark. You want your smoky eye to accentuate your pretty face, not to distract from it.;
, Although it may be quick and easy to choose the first three complementary shades of eyeshadow you find with a sponge applicator, the perfect smoky eye is created using the right supplies.


Using loose powders gives you the best blending ability, which is necessary for creating a great smoky eye. However, loose powder tends to have a lot of “fallout,” meaning the powder may fall down onto your cheeks and face. Be sure to sweep off any errant powder before heading out the door.
Use pitch-black eyeliner to accentuate your smoky eye. You have the option of using a pencil, cream, or liquid eyeliner, and any will work just fine. Cream and liquid eyeliners give a very smooth finish, while a pencil eyeliner gives a softer blended look.
Be sure to use high quality makeup brushes. Using dirty, old, or sponge brushes will create a smeared look that doesn’t blend. The best makeup brush for a smoky eye is a domed eyeshadow brush, which is rounded at the top. You can find these at many beauty supply stores.
Be sure to use a concealer and eyeshadow primer to prep your lids before applying the smoky eye. Use a concealer brush to apply both.
Have a large fluffy brush, makeup remover and q-tips on hand to fix any mistakes or loose shadow on your cheeks.

, Before you put on your smoky eye, you should create your neutral palette. Apply concealer under your eyes and on any dark or red spots, and then apply a powder foundation over the top to set it.









You have the option of applying blush or bronzer to add dimension to your face. For a bronzer, sweep it into the hollows of your cheeks with a large fluffy brush. To apply a blush, blend it into the apples of your cheeks. Remember to apply both lightly, for the most natural look.
Make sure your eyebrows are well-shaped and colored, as the smoky eye will draw attention to them. Having brows that are too thin or light will make your smoky eye look too dark and unnatural.

"

Start with concealer.,
Apply a natural eye shadow.,
Apply light eyeliner.,
Don't forget your lashes.,
Try highlighter to brighten your eyes.",How to Have Sexy Eyes1," Wearing an application of concealer can help your eyes stand out more. The concealer evens your skin tone around your eyes, providing a sort of blank canvass against which your eyes will look more striking. Choose a concealer that matches your skin tone, and lightly apply it around your eyes. Blend it in with your foundation to create an even palette.









If you have dark circles under your eyes, you might want to go with a concealer that's a shade lighter than your natural skin tone.
Apply it gently with your pinky finger, lightly dabbing and blending. Don't rub it in, since this can tear at the delicate skin around your eyes.;
, Since you're going for a natural look, choose a natural-hued pink, brown or gold shadow that's just a shade or two different from your natural skin tone. This will help your eyes pop without screaming ""look at me!"" The effect will be subtly sexy, almost like you're not wearing makeup at all.









Use an eye shadow brush to apply the color to your lids, from one corner of your eye to the other.
Blend lightly at the top of your lids up toward your brows so no distinct line is visible there. This will help the look appear more natural.

, If you want look like you're barely wearing makeup, choose a liner that's just a few shades darker than your natural skin tone. Navy blue is also fine, but avoid using black, since it will create a much more striking look. Apply the liner on your upper and lower lids.









Use a steady hands so that the liner goes on evenly. If you accidentally draw a wavy line, you can wipe it off and try again. Try to draw the line right up against your lashes.
You can use a cream eyeshadow instead of regular eyeliner. Simply dip an eyeliner brush into your cream shadow and apply it on the upper and lower lids. This creates a much wider range of color choices.

, If you have short or thin lashes, curl them with an eyelash curler to help them stand out a little more. Otherwise, just apply mascara to your upper and lower lashes. Keep the application light so that your lashes don't clump.









If your lashes clump, use a toothpick to gently separate them so you don't have to wipe it all off and start over.
Avoid false eyelashes when you're going for a natural look. They can help your eyes stand out, but it's better to use them when the rest of your makeup is just as bold.

, Create a dewy, natural-looking glow by strategically applying highlighter around your eyes. Dab a little around the inner and outer corners of your eyes, as well as along your brow bone. Swipe more over the applies of your cheeks. The overall effect will be fresh, pretty and sexy.

Use an eyeshadow.,
Use a nude or white eyeliner.,
Give your eyes a cat eye tail.,
Apply false eyelashes.If you're trying to attract the most attention to your eyes, false eyelashes are great.,
Smudge a white shimmer around your eyes.Like a focused white eyeliner, a white shimmer will give your eyes a look of alertness.",How to Get Bigger Eyes2," Eyeshadow is an effective way of attracting attention to your eyes and giving them a look of greater volume. Eyeshadows are good to apply first, as they give the other makeup (like mascara and eyeliner) a coloured foundation.The colour and tone of eyeshadow you choose should be determined by the colour of your eyes. What works for one colour might not work for another.



Brown eyes are very versatile, and can make just about any colour work. Purple is a great shade for brown eyes.

Blue eyes look best with earthier tones like brown or muted grey.

Green eyes favour moderate and warm colours. A mild purple or golden brown work very well.
The colour of your eyeshadow need not match up with your natural eye colour, but if you do, it will make your natural eye colour pop out.

, Nude eyeliner is a safe but effective way to brighten the look of your eyes.In turn, this will make you look more awake. Because nude eyeliner is barely perceivable, it's incredibly versatile and fits just about any situation. If you're looking for a more significant change to the size of your eyes however, you can try a white liner.


Adding some dark shadow underneath your eye, and then applying the nude or white liner in your lower waterline creates the appearance of bigger eyes.

, A smouldering cat eye look is a common and effective way of increasing eye size. Using liquid eyeliner, draw the line outwards from the outer end of your eye, ending it with a pointed tip.Because a cat's eye look is so common and relatively simple, there are lots of different ways you could go about it.


Don't forget to create a base first. Use the lightest coloured eyeshadow that matches your skin tone. This will emphasize the effect of the eyeliner, particularly if you're using a dark-coloured eyeliner like brown or black., They open up your eyes and give them a greater frame than you would muster with natural lashes. Apply some glue to the back line of the lashes, and place it snugly behind your natural lashes. Though it may not target the eyes directly, false eyelashes give the look of opening up your eyes.

, Draw white eyeliner around your eyes and gently smudge it until you have the look of a graceful cloud around your eyes. Make sure the liner is evenly spread, fading out by the point it reaches your eyebrows.


A white shimmer is typically reserved for more glamorous occasions, but if you're daring you might try working it into a casual look.
Getting a good shimmer may take a few times if you're not used to it. If it's not something you've tried before, the interesting new looks you get from it will be worth the challenge.
Other tinted highlighters can also be used in the inner corners of the eyes to make them pop and appear larger.

Curl your eyelashes.,
Wear circle contact lenses.,
Lose the glasses.",How to Get Bigger Eyes3," Even if your eyelashes are naturally curled, you should go about curling them regularly. Eyelashes are the natural frame of your eyes, and curling them will attract more attention to that part of your face. Curled lashes will also increase the wideness of your eyes. Using an eyelash curler, start at the base of your lashes and hold the curler for three seconds. Don't curl for any longer than that, as you'll risk hurting your lashes., Circle contacts function like regular contacts, but they intentionally cover part of the whites as well increasing the apparent size of your irises. This results in a doe-like appearance comparable with Japanese anime.Although circle contacts are popular predominantly in East Asia, you can order them online. They cost between $20-30 a pair, and can be purchased in prescription brands as well. LensCircle is one place to purchase them.Circle contact lenses have been associated with risks and significant injuries, including blindness. They're also currently unapproved by the FDA. There hasn't been a significant amount of empirical research on the subject however, and the perceived risks may simply be fear mongering, but the potential issues should be kept in mind if you decide to look into them., Thick prescription glasses have an effect of visibly shrinking eyes through the lens. If you wear a heavy prescription, simply taking off your glasses will make a huge difference. Contacts are barely noticeable by contrast, and are relatively easy to adjust to. If you have the money for it, laser eye surgery can correct your vision issue permanently. A smaller set of lenses will also help to reduce the issue."

Apply your highlighter.,
Put on your medium shade.,
Begin adding your darkest color.,
Blend your shadows.,
Add your eyeliner.,
Add your mascara.,
Brush away any excess color.",How to Get Smoky Eyes With Makeup2," Your highlighter is the lightest of your three eyeshadow shades. Using your eyeshadow brush, dab it on the inside corner of your eyelid on both your upper and lower lids. Sweep it directly under your eyebrows as well, from the beginning to the end of your brows.








, Take your middle eyeshadow shade and sweep it over your entire eyelid. Be sure to blend it at the inside corners with your highlighter, so that there isn’t a harsh divide between the two colors. Apply it upwards only to the natural crease on your lid, not all the way to the highlighter underneath your brows.








, Begin at the outside corner of your eyes, and sweep in a ‘C’ shape from the about halfway inwards (from the outside of your face) on the lash line, back up and around to about halfway inwards on the crease of your eyelid.









The darkest part should always be the point at the upper edge of your lash line. Whenever you need to apply more of your dark shadow, start at this point and work inwards or upwards.
Don’t apply the shadow too far in. You want the inside third to half of your eyelid to not have any dark shadow. This will help your eyes to look open and bright.
To add a dramatic look to your classic smoky eye, sweep your dark eyeshadow to a point (more of a “<” shape than a “C” shape) towards the end of your eyebrow. Make sure that the darkest point still remains at the outside corner of your lash line.
Sweep a little of your dark shadow under your eye onto your lower lid. Again, start at the outside corner and bring it only about halfway in. This will help to balance the darkness out on the top of your eyes.

, Clean your eyeshadow brush with makeup brush cleaner, face wash, or shampoo and water. Dry your brush on a clean towel or rag by sweeping it quickly back and forth across the fabric. Then, use your brush to blend the colors together.









Start by blending the lightest colors. Make sure that your medium (lid) color does not have a harsh divide with your dark (crease) color. Gently move your brush in a “C” shape at the meeting of these two colors to help them to form a smooth ombre effect.
Blend the dark crease shadow outwards towards your brow bone. It should fade softly into your skin, and should not significantly overlap your highlighter that has been placed under your eyebrows.

, If you want a smooth cat-eye look, bring your eyeliner from the inside corner lash line toward the end of your eyebrow. End it in a tapered line slightly before the edge of your eyeshadow (where the darkest part meets your un-shadowed skin). For a smudgy look, draw a thick line across the top of your lash line, and then use your fingertip or a small eyeshadow brush to smudge and blur the line.









To add more drama to your smoky eye, tightline your eyes. This is when you use your eyeliner to draw a line on the inner-rim of your eyes, located directly under your upper lashes and above your lower lashes. This can be difficult for some, as it involves using eyeliner very close to your eyeball.
Tightline the inner rim of your lash line nearest your tear duct by your nose with a white eyeliner pencil. This will help your eyes to pop, keeping them looking bright even with all the dark smudging above.

, Carefully apply your mascara, wiggling your brush between your lashes to help define them. Add no more than two coats to avoid clumps and an unnatural appearance. Apply a single coat to your bottom lashes to define them without giving yourself raccoon-eyes.








, If any eyeshadow or mascara fell onto your cheeks below your eyes, use a large makeup brush to brush it off in quick, broad strokes. If any of your mascara smeared along your eyelid or cheeks, use a q-tip dipped in makeup remover to take it off, and then use your blending brush to fix any extra makeup that may have been removed.

Clean off any excess makeup.",How to Get Smoky Eyes With Makeup3," Using the same technique as for a classic smoky eye, use your lightest shade of eyeshadow on the inside corners of your eyes and directly under your eyebrow, above your crease. Sweep the highlighter underneath your eyes a bit on the inside corner.








, Instead of starting with your medium shade, take your darkest eyeshadow and use your brush to sweep it along the entirety of your upper lash line. It should be the darkest near the roots of your lashes, and then blend upwards toward your crease.









Use a little on the lower lash line, but only near the outer edge. Sweep inwards with your dark shadow, going to only about halfway across your lower lashes.
Only use your darkest shadow till halfway up your eyelid. It should not reach all the way to your crease, as this will be reserved for your medium shade.

, Take your medium shade of eyeshadow and start from halfway up your eyelid, sweeping towards your crease. You should place this color in the part of your lid where it can meet your darkest color.









You can blend this color upwards beyond your crease and into your highlighter if you want. The goal is for your eyeshadow to get gradually lighter from your lashes to your brows.
Use a little to blend the dark shadow on your lower lash line. Add it the remainder of the way under your bottom lashes.

, Clean your eyeshadow brush by washing it with face soap or shampoo and water, or by spritzing it with an antibacterial makeup brush cleanser. Dry the brush completely on a cloth or towel before using it to blend the shadows. Then, sweep the brush in soft, broad strokes across your lid at the places where the different shades of eyeshadows meet.









Blend in strokes that go in the direction of your lash line (horizontally), but create the appearance of color blending upwards.
Make sure that your lash line is the darkest part of your eyelid, and if necessary apply a bit more of your darkest shadow directly to your lash line as you blend upwards.
Don’t forget to blend outwards and the edges of your eye, so that your shadow softly fades into your natural skin tone. The same should be done for the color that has been placed underneath your eyes.

, For an ultra-dramatic smoky eye, it is best to used a smudged eyeliner look. Use a chunky eyeliner pencil to draw a thick line across your upper lash line only. Then, use your makeup brush or fingertip to blur the edges upwards.


Tightline the inside rims of your eyes to add extra darkness. Draw a line on the part of your eyelid that is nearest your eyeball, directly under your upper eyelashes.
If you add eyeliner on your bottom lashes, only bring it as far in as the dark color goes on your lower lashes. Be sure to taper the end of the line though, and blend it into the shadow so that it doesn’t look too harsh against the color.

, Carefully apply your mascara to avoid getting any on your eyelid. Apply it to your upper lashes first, and then a quick coat to your bottom lashes. Wiggle the brush between your lashes to help separate and define them. Avoid using more than two coats of mascara so that you don’t create unsightly clumps and lumps in your lashes.








, If any of the eyeshadow or mascara spilled onto your cheeks, sweep it away with a large makeup brush. Use big, fast strokes to avoid smearing it into your skin. If you do happen to accidentally smear your eyeshadow, use a q-tip dipped in makeup remover to erase the mistake, and then use your blending brush to blend the area back to its prior state.

Use a shadow color scheme that matches your skin tone. If you have a cool skin tone, choose a bluish-black or bluish gray; if you have a warm skin tone, choose dark brown or a black with some red mixed in.
To figure out your skin tone, use jewelry to help you out. Which makes your skin seem to glow more: silver or gold? If it's silver, your skin tone is cool. If gold works better, it's warm.

, Choose a dark, smokey grey or dark brown that looks striking against your skin tone. It should be in the same color family as the base shadow; you just want it to be several shades darker. Apply it to your lower lids, sweeping from the inner corner to the outer corner. Use your finger to blend it with the base shadow.









Be careful to apply the shadow to your eyelid only. You don't want such a dark color ending up on other parts of your face.

, The smokey eye is not complete without a set of gorgeous lashes. Curl your lashes with an eyelash curler, then apply a coat of volumizing black mascara. For a truly sexy look, consider apply false eyelashes, which are becoming more and more popular as a way to create a sexy smokey eye.

, Use a concealer that suits you best in terms of color and texture. Use a brush or your fingers, depending on what you are comfortable with. Well concealed eyes help the colors of the eyeshadow pop better.

, This works best with black eyeliner. The eyeliner can be extended in four directions to give the illusion of larger eyes. You can extend the tail (the flick of the eye liner).

,,,, The outer 'V' is the perceived 'V' shape formed at the outer corner of the eye. The eyeshadow should form a 'V' here, then start fading out beyond this point. The socket line is formed where the eyeball meets the eye socket. It is lower for small eyes and higher for larger eyes–-the eyeshadow should start fading out beyond the socket line.

Try to match the angle with your lower lash line, and the length with your upper lashes.This will be the base for your wingtip. The longer you make this line, the more dramatic the wingtip will be.

, Place the tip of your brush against your lash line, a few millimeters above the outer corner. Then, draw a straight line down towards the tip of the extended line. Once you have your outline, fill it in. If you are using liquid liner, wait for it to dry at this point.

, Anime characters are known for having big eyes. Applying white eyeliner to your waterline will make your eyes appear even bigger than they actually are.

If you have small eyes, and have filled in your lower lash area with white eyeshadow, draw a false lower lash line just below that. Follow the natural curve of your eye, and only go a quarter of the way. Choose a brown shade for this., Start at the base of your lashes, then apply the mascara using wiggling motions. If you'd like, you can also apply some to your lower lashes too.


If you extended the whites of your eyes, and applied white eyeshadow to your lower lashes, consider using white mascara on your lower lashes. This will help conceal them better.

, Be sure to trim the false lashes to fit your eye, and to match the style to your wingtip. The more dramatic your wingtip is, the longer and thicker your false lashes should be.


If you can't apply false eyelashes, or don't like wearing them, layer on some lengthening and volumizing mascara.
If you have small eyes, and draw on a false lower lash line, you can add some mini ""accent"" false lashes to the bottom corner., Bring an eyelash curler close to your lash line, and then gently squeeze it shut for a few seconds before opening it back up.

It will also help make it more photogenic too.You can save things like contouring and nude or brown-colored lipstick for last, but you should at least have your foundation, eyeshadow, and powder on.

, Use a small, angled brush to do this. Follow your upper lash line, then extend the eyeshadow just past your outer corner. Apply this extension with an angled brush, and match the angle to your lower lash line., Alternatively, you can do this step using black eyeliner pencil instead, and then smudge it with a sponge applicator.If you are playing a younger character, omit this step, as you will be doing your lower lashes a little differently.

, Once again, follow the angle of your lower lash line, and be sure to fill in any gaps. This will help create that single ""lash"" shape that male anime characters have.

,, Starting at the tear duct area, apply black eyeliner to your lower lashes. Use an eyeshadow sponge applicator to help soften the liner at the outer corner. For a younger character, use liquid liner, and omit smudging it.


For a more youthful and stylized look: start at your tear duct, and follow your waterline halfway. Angle the line downward, just below your lashes, and make it connect with your upper liner. Fill in the gaps with more white eyeliner, blending it with the white liner in your waterline., Mascara is typically associated with boys and not girls, but it will help make your eyes appear larger and give them that thick, anime look."

Sketch out some flames on paper so you can practice drawing them before you do it on your face.,
If you have long bangs or hair that covers the area that you're drawing in, pin it back--it is a major frustration drawing with your hair all in the way.,
Take the gold eyeshadow and color around the inside edges of your flame lines, including the flames that are inside the borders.,
Take your dark orange eyeshadow and fill in everything that isn't gold, and be sure to blend the colors together or you'll see the lines and it won't look as good.,
Use your red lipliner.,
Take a q-tip or cotton ball and smudge the red lipliner until you can't tell where the lines were drawn, but the red still stands out boldly against the orange and gold.

,
Finally (this is optional) use gold liquid eyeliner and trace just beneath the red lipliner underneath your eye and accent mostly the top, going around the outside lines of the black, so it's not too in-your-face, but it's easy to tell it's there, and outline the flames 'inside the borders'...and...your finished!

Also optional, put mascara on the top and bottom eyelashes.",How to Draw Flames on Your Face With Eyeshadow and Eyeliner," It helps, a lot.

, Draw the outline of your flames, and then add a few little flame lines inside the borders.

, Also, put a little bit in an arch shaped just above your cheekbone, almost touching the bottom of your eye. (If you can't tell where this is, move your lips over to the side of your face as far as they will go without it hurting. Your cheek will be lifted up almost into your eye--that shows the line where it goes.)

, If you are wanting your eye to stick out in the flames, color the top of your eyelid with a lot of the dark orange eyeshadow, as if you were applying daily makeup, except you need a good bit of it.

, Note all the points on your fire, and color the tips of it red, and then draw it out with wispy lines of red.

Pull your hair back.",How to Do Sequin Eyelids," With this look, you want your sequin eyelids to steal the show. To ensure the attention goes to your eyes, you want to cover up any blemishes or discolorations on your face. Using your fingertip or a concealer brush, dab concealer on any blemishes or spots. Then, apply your foundation.Because your sequin eyelids will be so bold, you want the rest of your makeup to look soft and natural.
If you don’t typically wear concealer or foundation and don’t feel like your skin needs any attention, you can disregard this step.;
, You can purchase a highlight powder or cream at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store. In simple terms, highlighting consists of adding a light shimmer to specific places on your face to add dimension. You should place the highlight on the highest areas of your face, where light naturally hits. This will make your skin look healthy and glowing, and complement the beautiful shine of the sequins.Add a bit to the very tops of your cheekbones, following the natural curve of your eye.
Use your finger to add a dot of highlight to the inner corner of your eyes. This will make them look big and bright.
Finish by sweeping a bit of highlight down the bridge of your nose and above the center of your top lip.

, You don’t need to be particularly careful when applying the powder to your lids. The important thing is that your lids are completely dry before adding the sequins. Use a fluffy blending brush to dust the transparent powder over your entire lid, and anywhere else you plan on applying sequins., There are several different ways to wear this look. You can cut your sequins into small pieces, which will allow you to create different designs and play with multiple colors. Another cool idea is to cut your sequin in half, applying one half to your top lid and the other half to your bottom lash line, so they come together when you blink.Finally, you can leave the sequins whole and apply a few in a line across your lid., Pick up your sequin, or partial sequin, with your tweezers. Carefully squeeze your tube of eyelash glue so that only a small amount of glue comes out onto the back of the sequin.Let the glue sit on the sequin for a couple of seconds to allow it to get tacky. It will thicken up a bit in the air, making it easier to stick to your skin.

, Apply the sequin to your lid with the tweezers. Carefully place it on your lid exactly where you want it. After it’s on the skin, press it firmly into place with the tweezers or your fingertip. Allow the glue to dry, and then blink a few times to double check that the sequin is securely in place.If you aren’t happy with the placement of the sequin, you can start over. Simply peel the sequin off, clean your lid with a bit of makeup remover, and try again.

, You don’t need to do anything dramatic with your lashes. Because your eyelids are flashy enough on their own, a little bit of mascara is all you need to finish off the eyes. Mascara will just open the eye up and add a bit of volume to your lashes. Make sure to apply the mascara very carefully so that you don’t accidentally knock a sequin loose.

, Bright, bold lips only distract from the gorgeous eyes you’ve just created. You can leave your lips completely bare, or add a bit of nude or light pink product. A bit of clear gloss can add a little bit of shine to your pout, to match the sparkle of your lids.Just remember, makeup is all about balance. Let your eyes do the talking and keep the lips basic.

, Instead of having your hair in your face, style it away from your face to showcase your dramatic eyes. You can simply tuck it behind your ears, put your hair in a sleek ponytail, or throw it into a trendy top knot. If you have hair hanging in your face, you’ll distract from your sequined eyelids."

Blue eyeshadow complements those with green or blue eyes.

, To do the gradient smoky eye, you will need three eyeshadow colors, ranging from light, medium, and dark of the same color. You will then layer these colors side by side to create a gradient of color on your eyelids.For example, if you chose black as your base color, you will need light gray, dark gray, and black eyeshadows. If you chose purple, you will need light purple, medium dark purple, and dark purple to create the gradient look.
You may be able to find prepackaged powdered eyeshadows that come in three to four different shades of the same color for a smoky eye look. You can use these packs or “quads” to create the smoky eye, but having separate eyeshadows allows you to choose from a range of colors and shades.If you prefer cream eyeshadows over powdered eyeshadows, you can use them for this look.

, You will need two clean eyeshadow brushes to create the gradient smoky eye look. You will use one eyeshadow brush to apply the three eyeshadows. You will then use the other eyeshadow brush to blend the colors once they have been applied.


Look for brushes that are have small, rounded bristles to use for the eyeshadow.
A blending brush is also a good option, which will often be small and have fluffy rounded bristles to make blending easier.

, Start with the lightest shade so you can build to the darker shade. Use the eyeshadow brush to apply it on your inner eyelid, moving from your lashline up to the crease of your eye.








Apply a few dabs of the eyeshadow. You do not need to apply a lot of the lightest shade on your eye.

, Apply the medium shade next to the lightest shade, moving from your lashline up to the crease of your eye. Try to place the medium shade right next to the lightest shade so they appear to blend together. This will give the gradient smoky eye a more sultry look.








The medium shade should take up the middle section of your eyelid.

, Complete the gradient smoky eye look by applying the darkest shade next to the medium shade, brushing it from your lashline to the outer corner of your eye. Blend the darkest shade softly into the medium shade so there is no empty space or a clear line between the two colors.








If you want a more dramatic look to your eyes, you can extend the darkest shade out a few inches from the corner of your eye. Swoop upward as you do this to give your eyes a more cat-eye look.

, Once the gradient colors are in place, use a clean eyeshadow brush or a blending brush to gently blend the colors on your eyes.

You can also use black eyeliner to line your waterline. This can add to the smoky look of your eye makeup.

, Once you have applied the eyeliner, you will need to smudge it to get the smoky eye look. Use a clean small makeup brush to do this. Go over the eyeliner on the top and bottom of your eye to lightly smudge it so it looks less sharp and harsh. Use small circular motions over the eyeliner with the brush to do this.








If you are using liquid eyeliner, make sure you smudge the eyeliner before it has time to dry.
Only smudge the eyeliner on your top and bottom eyelid. Do not try to smudge the eyeliner on your lower waterline, as this will likely result in eyeliner getting into your eye.

, Mascara will also add to the gradient smoky eye look by darkening your eyelashes and making them appear thicker. You may curl your eyelashes first if your eyelashes do not curl upward naturally. Then, apply one thick coat of mascara on your eyelashes.








Apply mascara to your top and bottom lashes using an upward motion.
If you want to apply more than one coat of mascara, wait a few minutes for the first coat to dry and then apply another coat. This will prevent clumping.

, Complete the gradient smoky eye look by using the lightest eyeshadow shade as a highlighter. Brush the shade right under your eyebrows to highlight this area. You can also brush the shade in the creases of your eyes to make your makeup pop.

Use the ""sandbagging technique."",
Use makeup setting spray.",How to Do Makeup for Oily Eyelids," When applying face makeup, it's vital that you start with clean eyes. First, make sure that you have no eye makeup residue left from last night. Remove any last traces using an eye makeup remover in a gentle manner. Now, wash your face with a cleanser and pat it dry., Putting concealer and foundation on a dry under-eye area is not a wise decision. Instead, apply a moisturizing yet light-weight eye cream. Pat the cream onto the area around your eye (including your eyelid) until fully absorbed. Wait 2-3 minutes before you begin with your makeup so that it can sink into the skin completely., Just to be sure that there's no oily residue left on your eyelids, use an oil blotting sheet. Press it lightly against each eyelid. Oil blotting sheets are amazing at controlling shine. They may also prevent the need for numerous touch-ups throughout the day.If you don't have a blotting sheet, there are alternatives you can use: a napkin, perm-end wrappers, or parchment paper.

, An eyeshadow primer helps create a barrier between the oil on your lids and the product you put on, as well as giving your eyeliner and eyeshadow something to adhere to. Squeeze a tiny amount of primer onto your fingers, warm it up between your fingers and thumb, and apply it all over your eyelids., Eyeshadow base is similar to primer, but it is a little different. It is used to intensify the staying power of your eye makeup, intensify eyeshadow colors, and make the skin tone of both your lids look even. If you really want your eye color to pop, eyeshadow base is a good idea. Eyeshadow bases often come in pencil form. After applying primer, color your eyelids with an eyeshadow base pencil.You can find products that are eyeshadow primer and base in one.

, Once you have applied these products, apply a thin layer of translucent loose powder over your lids. Use a shadow brush or makeup sponge to apply it. In case you don't have this powder, you can also use your regular compact (just apply it lightly)., Layering eye makeup helps build extra staying power. Apply a cream eyeshadow all over your lids, using your ring finger. Then apply each color of your powder eye shadow and blend., You will want to layer your eyeliner as well. Begin with a pencil or gel based eyeliner to draw a line on your eyes, and give it a minute to set. Then, apply a waterproof liquid eyeliner to seal your efforts. Finish with your favorite mascara.If you are using kohl, you can set it with a matte black eyeshadow.

, The ""sandbagging technique""--as popularized by Kim Kardashian's makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic--stops eyeshadow, mascara and kohl from traveling outside the line. Use a damp sponge loaded with translucent powder and apply it on area underneath your eye. Try getting as close to your waterline as possible. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then remove the excess using a fluffy powder brush., If your under eye area appears a little cakey, make use of a makeup setting spray. Spray it from an appropriate distance after you've done your makeup completely. Let it settle for several minutes. You will be surprised to see that it takes down the powdery look and lends a long staying power to your makeup."

",How to Do Eye Makeup for Blue Eyes," This will help enhance the color of your eyeshadow, making it appear brighter, which in turn will also make your eyes appear brighter., One of the best ways to bring out the blue in your eyes is to use contrasting colors. This means choosing eyeshadows in neutral and earth tones, warm colors, and colors opposite of blue and green on the color wheel. Here are some suggestions:For neutral and earth tones, use beige, camel, sable, sienna, tan, taupe, terracotta, and warm brown.
For opposite colors, use red, orange, gold, copper, and bronze.
For warm colors, use pastel orange, rose, and light pink. You can also use a warm purple with red undertones, such as plum.

, You can also use cool-colored eyeshadow, such as blues, greens, and purples. Purple eyes shadow pairs great with blue eyes, while blue should be used with care. If you have flecks of green in your eyes, you can use green eyeshadow to bring those flecks out. Here are some suggestions:


You can get away with wearing blue-colored eyeshadow, so long as the blue is darker than your eye color, such as navy or midnight blue. Be sure not to overdo the blue eyeshadow.Wear greens to bring out blue-green eyes, such as turquoise.
Wear purples, such as dark purple, heather, lavender, lilac, or plum.
You can also wear ash, black, charcoal, silver, slate, or dark grey.

, There are different shades of blue when it comes to eyes, ranging from dark blue to blue green to blue-grey. Here are some color suggestions, based on the shade of blue your eyes might be:If you have light-blue eyes, wear neutral browns and orange or bronze tones.
If you have medium-blue eyes, consider going for blacks, browns, camel, charcoal, copper, heather, or moss.
If you have dark or deep blue eyes, use light, nude browns, or pastel oranges
If you have blue-gray eyes, go for warmer tones, such orangey browns, copper, coral and khaki. You can also wear darker blues, such as teal and midnight blue, and grays, such as charcoal and silver. Lilac will also work well with blue-gray eyes.
If you have blue-green eyes, use warm colors, such as bronzes, oranges, reds, terracotta, and sienna.
If you have bright blue eyes, use lighter colors, such as ash, camel, gold, gray, sable, or taupe.
Purple works well for all types of blue eyes.

, Certain colors look better against certain skin tones and hair colors. If you are having difficulties choosing an eyeshadow color, then try to work with your skin tone and hair color instead. Here are some suggestions based on skin tone and hair color:If you have fair skin and blonde hair:, consider wearing rich browns, warm pinks, or plums. Pair your eyeshadow with some brown eyeliner and lots of mascara.
If you have fair skin and dark hair, go for golds and brighter pinks. Pair your eyeshadow with a darker eyeliner and some lengthening mascara.
If you have red hair, consider wearing dark rust and copper shades with a bit of sage green. Pair this with brown eyeliner and mascara.
If you have tan skin and dark or brunette hair, try a deep peach or plum. Pair this with brown or black eyeliner and mascara.

, If you have difficulties from choosing an eyeshadow color, you can narrow your choices down by matching the color to the occasion. Here are some examples:If you are going to work or school stick with brown, rose, terracotta and neutral shades.
Lavender and light purples work well for daytime events, while deep plum works best for evening events.
If you are going out on a date or a fancy dinner, consider using a metallic eyeshadow, such as gold, silver, shimmery pink, and shimmery turquoise.

, For a subtle golden effect, dust a little bit of bronzer in the crease of your eyelid. Using your fingers or a makeup brush, blend it into the rest of your eyeshadow. The light should catch the bronzer just enough to bring out the blue tints in your eyes.


Use liquid bronzer beneath eyeshadow. If your bronzer isn't in powdered form, use it as eyeshadow primer. Rub a little over your eyelid, then lightly layer your normal eyeshadow on top.

, Instead of using heavy blacks and grays to create a smoky look, try dark brown, gold and dusky pink. The warm tones will showcase your eyes.

, Black might be too cool and overpowering for blue eyes, especially if you have light-colored hair; however, if used correctly, it can really bring out your eyes. Consider using liquid eyeliner to apply a thin line along your upper lid, and extend it just past the lash line in a wingtip.


For a less intense look, consider using charcoal or gray instead.

, The warm tones found in brown or taupe will contrast with your blue eyes, making them appear brighter. Neutral-toned eyeliner works best for work, school, and daytime events.

, Colors such as purple, midnight blue, teal, or turquoise will bring out the blue in your eyes, making them appear brighter. Green-toned eyeliner, such as teal or turquoise, works especially well with blue-green eyes, as it will bring out the green flecks., Colors such as bronze, copper, gold, or silver will not only make your eyes appear brighter, but they will also add some sparkle when you blink., Instead of using a white eyeliner to disguise your waterline (the pink area between your lashes and your eyes), try beige. It'll blend in with your skin better, and the warmth will draw out the color of your eyes., Black mascara is classic, and suitable for all eye colors, including blue. Consider using something with lengthening properties. Because of its intensity, however, black mascara works best for evening events. Here are some more suggestions:


For a less-harsh look, reach for dark brown, dark blue, or charcoal mascara.

, It will also give you a softer look, that is perfect for work, school, and other daytime events. Brown mascara works especially well for those with blonde, light brown, or lighter red hair; it will give you a more natural but still well-defined look.Dark brown mascara will create a subtle contrast with your blue eyes, making them appear brighter.

, Mascara doesn't have to be black or brown. You can also use some colored mascara. Not all colors will work with blue eyes, however. Here are some suggestions for colored mascara that will help your eyes appear brighter:


Dark blue mascara can draw attention to your eyes without overpowering them. It will give you a similar look that black mascara gives you, without being as harsh.Turquoise mascara is great for those with blue-green eyes. It will help brink out the flecks of green, making your eyes appear brighter.Wear purple mascara to bring out the blue in your eyes. If you have a warmer skin undertone, consider using a warmer purple, such as plum. If you have a cooler skin undertone, use a cooler purple, like violet.,"

Apply mascara.",How to Do Chrome Eyes," Makeup primer is a good foundation for any eye shadow look, but it’s especially important when you’re using bold shadows. Nothing will ruin your chrome eye makeup more than it creasing or smudging all over your face. A primer will smooth out and perfect your skin while also giving your makeup a sticky base to adhere to. It will help your makeup stay put and last all day and night.You can find primers at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store. A regular makeup primer will work fine, but there are also primers made specifically for your eyelid.
Let your primer soak into your skin for a couple minutes before starting to apply any product.;
, Like with any other look, you want to avoid stark borders. The key to this chrome look is to make it look blended and dimensional. Before you begin brushing on the chrome shadow, use a fluffy eye shadow brush to apply a soft brown or cream color to your crease and outer corner. This will help to carve out the crease, adding dimension before you begin applying your main color.Blend out your transition color with your fluffy brush.

, After you’ve applied your transition shade, it’s time to apply the showstopper. To apply this most precisely, use a flat concealer brush or a flat shadow brush. Begin brushing it onto the center of your lid, staying below your crease. Brush your chrome shadow to the inner corner, and then bring it outwards until it meets the transition shadow at the crease and outer corner. An added bonus of applying the transition color first is by creating a border for you to apply your chrome shadow within.If you’re using a powder shadow, you may want to spray your flat brush with a bit of setting spray to dampen the product before applying it. This will help you get that really pigmented, opaque chrome color that you want without having to apply several layers of powder., Pick up a bit of light brown shadow onto your fluffy brush. Bring this around the chrome shadow you just applied. By bringing this shadow along the crease and the outer corner, you will soften up the border of the chrome color. Continue blending this until the edges of the chrome shadow are soft and more gradual., Like with most shadow looks, you want to apply your darkest color yet to the outer corner. For this chrome look, a dark brown or a black will do the trick. Using your fluffy brush, pat the dark shadow along your outer corner. Then, start blending again! You want to blend this dark color into your chrome color so that it appears as though the chrome transitions into the dark shadow seamlessly., It’s important to add a bit of balance to this look by bringing product below your eyes as well. Pack a bit of your dark, outer corner color onto a small brush. Then, carefully sweep that along your lower lash line, bringing it about half way across your eye., You can find a variety of silver and glitter eyeliners at pharmacies and beauty supply stores. Rather than lining your entire eye with it, simply apply it your bottom lash line in the inner corner. Bring it outwards until it meets the dark eye shadow you smudged on your bottom lash line, about halfway across your eye.This glitter eyeliner helps to create a more cohesive look on your eyes, bringing the metallic chrome color to the bottom of your eye.
Additionally, the light color and sparkle adds a highlight to your inner corner, which makes your eyes appear bigger and brighter.

, This technique is called “tightlining.” By applying a black eyeliner on your thin waterline where it will sit between your shadow and your eye, it will create contrast with the whites of your eyes and really make them pop. With heavy eye shadow looks, it’s easy for the shadow to weigh your eyes down and make them look small. Tightlining will combat this, making your eyes look big and bright.To tightline your bottom waterline, gently pull the skin below your eye a bit so that your waterline is fully exposed. Then, carefully sweep your eyeliner along your waterline from inner to outer corner.
To tightline your top lid, simply apply your eyeliner as close as you possibly can to the base of your lashes.

, It’s crucial to have dark, full eyelashes to stand out against the shadow. First, curl your lashes using an eyelash curler. Bring the tool to the base of your lashes and press down for about five seconds. Then, apply your favorite black mascara. Position the wand at the base of your lashes and gently wiggle it as you sweep it down your lashes.For extra volume, apply a second or even third coat of mascara. Let each coat dry in between.
If mascara isn’t cutting it, pop on a pair of false eyelashes.

, For green and hazel eyes, you’ll get the most flattering colorful smoky eye if you use cranberry and pink shadows. Red is opposite green on the color wheel so it creates the most striking contrast for eyes that are green or have green flecks.Some red and pink tones to consider include cranberry, maroon, wine, brick, dusty rose, mauve, and magenta.

, Brown eyes typically feature orange and red undertones, so blue and green shades typically offer the best smoky eye look. That’s because orange is opposite blue and red is opposite green on the color wheel.Some blue tones to consider include cobalt, navy, teal, violet, and midnight blue.
Some green tones to consider include olive, forest green, emerald, and moss.

, Purple is the most universally flattering shade of eyeshadow, so it typically works well for everyone. It is especially beautiful with brown and green eyes, but blue-eyed people can wear it too.Some purple tones to consider include eggplant, plum, and royal purple.

, An eyeshadow primer provides a base for your shadow to stick to so it lasts all day. Use a clean finger to spread the primer from your lash line to your brow.








If you don’t have an eyeshadow primer, you can substitute concealer. Smooth it over your eyelid just as you would with primer.
If you have dark skin or just want to make sure that your colorful smoky eye is as vibrant as possible, it helps to use a white base as your primer. Blend a white cream eyeshadow over your eyelid so the colors that you place on top of it really pop.

, To get the classic smoky look, you need to li your upper and lower lash lines with a creamy eyeliner pencil. After you’ve applied the liner, use a pencil brush or cotton swab to softly smudge it. Black liner is traditionally used for a smoky eye, but you can also use a dark liner that coordinates with your shadows.








If you’re doing a blue smoky eye, you can substitute a navy eyeliner.
If you’re doing a green smoky eye, you can substitute a forest green eyeliner.
If you’re doing a orange smoky eye, you can substitute a bronze or warm brown eyeliner.
If you’re doing a purple smoky eye, you can substitute a plum eyeliner.
If you’re doing a red or pink smoky eye, you can substitute a reddish brown eyeliner.
Like black, a charcoal gray eyeliner can also work with any colorful smoky eye.

, To help the colorful shadows you use in your smoky blend more easily, you want to use a subtle transition color in the crease. Use a fluffy crease brush to softly blend a neutral eyeshadow that’s two or three shades deeper than your skin tone through your crease.








The crease of your eye is the area above the lid where your eye naturally folds.
A brown or tan shade is usually the best option for a transition shade.
If you’re worried about your smoky eye looking too stark, you may want to use a transition shade with some warmth. Your bronzer can do double-duty as your transition shade if that’s the case.

, After you’ve added the transition shade to your crease, use a flat eyeshadow brush to apply a mid-tone shadow in your choice of color to your lid. Use a pressing motion to apply the shadow to avoid fallout, and be sure to smooth the shadow over the eyeliner that you’ve applied.








A mid-tone shade basically means a shadow that falls between light and dark shades on the color spectrum. You don’t want to use the darkest colorful shade that you have on the lid, but the shadow should be darker than your usual lid colors.
Use a clean fluffy brush to blend the edge of your lid color into the transition shade for a seamless look.

, To add depth to your smoky eye, use a pencil brush to apply a dark colored eyeshadow that coordinates with your lid color to the outer corner of your eye. Make a sideways “V” shape so one line is angled down toward the lash line and one line is angled up toward the outside of the crease.








Make sure to blend out the shadow that you add to the outer corner with a clean, fluffy brush so there aren’t any harsh lines.
When it comes to choosing a dark shade to use in the outer corner, opt for the same color family as your lid shade. For example, if you’ve used a emerald green on the lid, you might use a forest green in the outer corner.
If you don’t have a dark shadow that coordinates with the color that you’ve chosen for your smoky eye, you can substitute black.

, To keep your smoky eye from looking too dark, it’s important to use a light shadow to highlight your brown bone and inner corner. Sweep a light shade, such as ivory, cream, beige, or tan, beneath your brow with a small, fluffy brush, blending it into the transition. Use a small detail brush to dab a small amount of the same shadow to the inner corner around the tear duct.








You can use a matte or shimmery shadow to highlight your brow bone and inner corner. However, with a smoky eye, it’s especially flattering to use a shimmery shade for the inner corner because it will reflect the light so your eyes appear brighter.

, With dark shadow on your eyes, it’s easy for your lashes to get lost. Finish off your look with one to three coats of your favorite mascara to help them stand out against the colorful smoky shadow.








To really open up your eyes with smoky shadow, it’s a good idea to use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes before you apply the mascara.
Make sure to apply some mascara to your lower lashes too. They’ll have trouble standing out against the dark liner that you’ve smudged there.

, To keep your colorful smoky shadows in place all day, you must start with an eyeshadow primer. Dab a small amount of primer onto each eyelid, and blend it up through the crease.








It’s a good idea to rub whatever primer is left on your finger along your lower lash line, so the colors that you apply there will stay in place.

, Just as with a classic smoky eye, you want to apply a transition shade to the crease to make it easier to blend the colors out. However, because you want all the attention on the colors on your lid, choose a light neutral shadow that’s only a shade or two darker than your skin tone. Sweep it through the crease with a fluffy crease brush.








Make sure to blend the transition shade well after you apply it so it has a soft look.

, With your transition shade in place, use a small fluffy shadow brush to apply a mid-tone shadow in the color family that you’ve chosen to the inner third and the outer third of your lid. Blend the shadow slightly into the crease above the respective areas.








Be sure to leave the center of your lid and crease free of eyeshadow.

, With a small, tapered blending brush, apply a small amount of black shadow over the colored shadow in the inner and outer corners of your lid and crease. You shouldn’t cover the colorful shadow completely; concentrate the black in outer edges of both areas.








You don’t necessarily have to use black shadow for darkening up your eyes. Instead, use a dark shadow from the same color family as the colored shadow you’ve used. For example, if you’ve used a royal blue in the inner and outer corners, darken them up with a navy blue shadow.

, After you’ve darkened up the inner and outer corners, use a flat shadow brush to apply light shade from your chosen color family to the center of the lid. A shimmery or metallic shadow is the best option because it will stand out even more.








If you want to be sure that the lighter shadow really stands out, you can dab a small amount of a white cream shadow over the center of your lid before applying the shadow.
Use a small fluffy brush to blend the lines between the dark and light colors so the shadow looks soft and smoky.

, With the shadow done on your lid, apply shadow to your lower lashline in the same manner. Use a pencil brush to apply the mid tone shade to the inner and outer corners, a darker shadow on just the outermost corners, and the light shade in the middle.You can repeat the same process on your waterline, the bit of skin on your lower lid above your lashes, by using a light pencil liner in the center and a dark pencil liner on the outer and inner corners. However, you can also use a dark liner across the entire waterline or skip liner there completely.

, To ensure that your eyes look bright even with a dark color on your inner corners, it’s especially important to highlight that area. Use a small detail brush to trace the area around your tear duct with a light, shimmery shadow.








Depending on how light the shadow you used on the center of your lid is, you may want to use it to highlight the inner corner. Otherwise, use an ivory, cream, beige, or pale gold shadow.

, Once your eyeshadow is finished, use a dark eyeliner pencil to line your upper lashline. Smudge the liner with a pencil brush or cotton swab to keep the look smoky.








You can use a black liner or a dark liner that coordinates with the colorful eyeshadows that you’ve used.
The liner is an optional step. You can skip it completely if you prefer.

, To finish off your look, apply two to three coats of your favorite mascara to help your lashes stand out. Brush through your lashes with a lash comb to ensure that they are no clumps.








If you like, you can also add some false lashes to really make your eyes look fluttery.

Use white liquid liner on your top lash line.,
Add red stripes.",How to Do Candy Cane Makeup1," Before you begin, it’s important to put a primer over your entire lid. A makeup primer will help smooth out and conceal any imperfections in your eyelid, and it will also create a smooth base for your makeup to stick to. It will prevent smudging and creasing in any look you create. Apply a dot of primer on your finger, and then gently dab it over your eyelid.








After applying the primer, make sure to let it sit for a minute and really sink into the lid.;
, You certainly don’t need to wear eyeshadow with this look, but you can. If you want to wear eyeshadow, choose a neutral color so that your candy cane liner is the star of the show. A taupe color or even a soft gold shimmer can look gorgeous with this liner. Blend it over your entire lid before moving on to the liner.







, Liquid liner is the best type of liner to use for this look, because it will create the sharp, ultra-pigmented strip above your lashes that you need. Begin in the inside corner, moving carefully to the outer corner. Go over this line a few times until it is opaque, and make sure it is thick enough so that you have room to add red stripes. Then, create a wing. Adding a wing to your eyeliner will help highlight the candy cane effect that you’ll be creating.








You can find white liquid eyeliner at your local beauty supply store.

, The best way to do this is either with a red gel liner and a small eyeliner brush, or with a red liquid liner. You can find both of these at your local beauty supply store. With your small eyeliner brush, start creating little stripes along the white band you created. Alternate between thick stripes and thin stripes, just like the pattern on real candy canes. Add stripes along the entire lash lines as well as the wing.

Wear Mascara/false-lashes.",How to Do a Cat Eye on Round Eyes," This step isn't exactly ""necessary"", depending on the look you're going for. If you do want shadow, apply it now before your eyeliner. I find that doing this beforehand is easier, but whatever works for you is fine.;
, For doing a cat-eye look, use a gel or liquid liner. This comes down to personal preference, however, a gel-liner offers more control. There are a huge amount of affordable and awesome liners, both gel and liquid that are $10 and under. If you aren't sure which to use, go to your local drugstore and peruse the makeup section. Or go to Sephora or the makeup section at Macy's. Ask the pros what they would recommend!

, This is not necessary if you are using a liquid liner. Most gel-liners come with a small brush. If it did not include a brush, or if the brush is of low-quality, invest in a good liner brush. Sonia Kashuk created a line of makeup brushes that are sold at Target. They're inexpensive and are of great quality. Remember, if you use low-quality products/tools, your makeup will reflect this fact.


For gel-liner

If you chose to go with the gel-liner, take your eyeliner brush and dip it into your gel-liner.
Evenly coat the tip of the brush. Steady your hand on something. Either sitting down in front of a mirror & resting your elbow on a firm surface, or resting your pinky on your cheek to steady your hand.
Since the goal of this is to not cause your eye to appear more round, begin applying the eyeliner just after the round peak of your eye.
Drag the brush close to your lash line, using small, firm strokes. If necessary, re-apply the liner to your brush.
Create the line to be thicker at the outer corners. Not only is this essential to creating the desired look, it is also vital in reducing the roundness of your eyeball.


For liquid-liner: Liquid liner is, in a way, easier to apply than gel-liner. It is thinner & easier to create a wing spontaneously with just a small flick. Also, it does not require you to purchase an additional brush or wash the said-brush. It's all-inclusive!

Use the same technique as the gel-liner, applying on the outer portion of your eye & using the same wing-technique.
However, be careful not to let the liquid liner get on your upper eyelid. Make sure it's dry!



, After the outer corner has been thickened, you have reached the defining moment of this makeup look: the wing. Take your brush, and make a small flick up toward the end of your eyebrow. Depending on your personal preference, you can make this as short or as long as you like. It's just important to A) make sure it is even on both eyes and B) make sure it is connected properly to the rest of the eyeliner. Make sure it is free of gaps!

, If you have wide-set eyes, I find that this is a good way to reduce that effect. Take your eyeliner (gel, liquid, or pencil-style) and apply it to the upper inside corner of your eye. I wouldn't necessarily apply it to the bottom inside corner, but whatever floats your boat!

, It just brings an extra level of drama. If you do falsies, cut 'em in half evenly & apply to the outer corner with lash-glue. This gives it an even more feline look by accentuating the outer half of your eye. If you don't want falsies, suit yourself. It still looks cool either way.

Prime your eyes.,
Create a striped base with red and white eyeliners.,
Add red and white shadow over the eyeliner.,
Use a deep red shadow above your stripes.,
Apply a black eyeshadow to the crease and blend.,
Apply glitter.,
Finish with mascara.",How to Do Candy Cane Makeup2," While this is an important first step for any eyeshadow look, it’s especially important for your candy cane look. If your careful stripes end up smudging or creasing, you will have an unrecognizable candy cane! Apply a primer to your entire lid using your fingertip. This will create a perfect base for your shadows to adhere to, and it will help prevent your shadows from slipping and sliding.







, You can purchase pencil eyeliners in red and white at a beauty supply store, and they will be perfect for creating your shadow base. Starting at the outer corner of your eye, create a red stripe extending diagonally from corner to crease. Then, go in with the white pencil and add a second stripe directly on top of the first. Again, it should go diagonally from your lash line to your eyelid crease. Continue doing this until you’ve created stripes along your entire eyelid.








For a general idea of how thick your stripes should be, try to fit about three red stripes and three white stripes.
This base will be covered in eyeshadow, so don’t worry if it looks slightly patchy or imperfect. It won’t be left as-is!

, Use a small shadow brush to carefully pat red eyeshadow over the red eyeliner, and white eyeshadow over the white eyeliner. The eyeliner serves three purposes: it serves as a rough draft for the shadows, it helps the shadows adhere to the lid, and it ensures the shadows will be pigmented and opaque enough. Use a patting motion to apply the shadow, focusing on pressing the powder into the lid rather than creating strokes.








You can purchase red and white eyeshadow at any beauty supply store.

, This will add a bit of dimension to your eyelid and smooth out the top of the stripes. With your darker shadow, you'll be outlining the shape of the stripes you just created, making the lid look more polished and cohesive. Use a fluffy brush to blend this shadow along the top of the candy cane stripes, following your crease.







, After you’ve applied the red color, use a smaller shadow brush to apply black shadow solely to your crease. This will give your entire eye more intense definition. Blend the deep red and black shadows together with a fluffy brush, creating a blended, dark border to the candy cane stripes on the lid.







, This step is optional. If your shadow contains glitter or if you’re content with your candy cane being matte, you certainly don’t need to do this. However if you want to add a bit of glitz to your look, you can pat on a bit of glitter.








You can purchase loose cosmetic glitters in white and red at a beauty supply store, mix a bit with water or a setting spray, and then pat those onto your stripes with a shadow brush.
If you don’t want to purchase red or white glitter, you can use a more versatile gold or silver sparkle over the entire lid.

, After your shadow is finished, you will complete the look with big, bold lashes. First, curl your lashes with an eyelash curler. Press and hold the curler at the base of your lashes for about five seconds, and release. Then, apply your favorite mascara. Start at the base of your lashes, and wiggle the wand as you move it from base to tip.









For extra volume, apply two or three coats of the mascara.
If you want more drama than your natural lashes can provide, you can also apply fake lashes to finish this look.

Cover your lips with concealer.,
Press a translucent powder over your lips.,
Fill in your lips with white lip liner.,
Apply white lipstick.,
Create the stripes with red liquid lipstick.",How to Do Candy Cane Makeup3," To create perfect candy cane lips, you want the white to be very pigmented and opaque. In order to achieve this, you want to conceal the natural redness of your lips that could show through the white lipstick. Use a makeup sponge to dab concealer over your lips, making sure to cover the entire surface.







, After applying you concealer, it’s important to set it with a powder. Otherwise, you’ll be applying lip product over a creamy base, and you’ll end up with a smudged mess. Use your makeup sponge to press the powder into your lips, covering all of the concealer.








Brush off any excess powder with a fluffy brush.

, You can purchase a white lip liner at any beauty supply store. First, outline your lips entirely. This is a helpful first step, because it will define the border that has been concealed. Instead of just lining your lips, however, you’re going to use the lip liner to fill in the entirety of your lips.







, The white lip liner creates a really nice base for a white lipstick to adhere to. Carefully apply your white lipstick over the white eyeliner, making sure that every bit of your lips is opaque. If the white lipstick you use is creamy, dab it with translucent powder when you’re finished. If the lipstick is matte, you don’t need to do this.







, After your lips are completely white, it’s time to turn them into a candy cane! For this step, you’ll need red liquid lipstick and a small lip brush. Dip your lip brush into the liquid lipstick, and start creating diagonal stripes down your lips. Let your mouth rest naturally, so you can create lines that continue from the top lip straight down to the bottom lip.








Alternate between thick stripes of red and thin stripes of red, to mimic the pattern of real candy canes.
Continue creating these stripes diagonally across your lips until they are covered.

Apply a light shadow.,

Add some shine.,
Use the product to soften and blend the eyeliner.,
Finish with your gloss.,
Apply a bit of highlight to your face.,
Use a transparent or nude lip product.,
Fill in your eyebrows.,
Bring your gloss with you for touch-ups.",How to Create Glossy Eyelids," Before you add any gloss, you can create a beautiful effect by first applying a soft, shimmery glow to your lids. Anything with soft sheen looks wonderful, such as a pearl-colored shadow or highlight. You can apply it softly with a shadow brush, or simply dab a bit on with your fingertips.While any kind of shadow works, a liquid, gel, or cream shadow will give your eyes a wetter, glossier look.;
, A black liquid liner is perfect for this. By using liquid eyeliner, you can create a thin, precise line that will define your lashes. It’s important to keep this line thin and as close to your lashes as possible, so that you reduce potential smudging once you add the gloss. If you want, you can certainly add a wing.This is the only stark, precise line you’ll create. You want to line your eye simply to emphasize your lashes and make them look fuller and darker. You’ll be covering this line later, though, so it’s okay if it’s not perfect. It’s simply the foundation.

, Once you’ve created that original precise line, you can loosen up. Now, your makeup application will be a bit messier and more sultry. Using a kohl pencil, go back over the liquid eyeliner. You don’t need to create a perfect line – in fact, you don’t want to. The kohl pencil will be smudged and blended with the gloss, so just dab it along your lash line however you want.Once you add the gloss, you can always go back in and add more eyeliner as you see fit.

, There are a few different products you can choose from to add a bit of shine and start blending your eyeliner. Note that this isn’t the actual gloss, but will add a bit of luster to get you started. For this, you want to use a wax-based product that isn’t overly sticky. A wax-based product like MAC’s Mixing Medium Shine is ideal.If you don’t want to shell out the cash for a designer product, you can use some waxy lip balm to create the same effect.If you’re trying this look out for the first time, it might be wise to save the cash and try creating it with cheaper products. If you love the look and want to wear it often, however, it’s worth investing in the longer-lasting products that are created specifically for the eyes.

, Whether you’re using the MAC product or a bit of balm, you’ll apply it the same way. Get a bit of the product on your fingertip and press it onto your eyelid. Using a light hand, carefully use the product to smudge out the kohl eyeliner you previously applied. Gently pull the eyeliner up the lid to create a softer, smokier effect.


If you want your lash line to be darkest, you can certainly add a bit more eyeliner to your lash line after you’ve smudged it out a bit. Remember, though, that this look really isn’t about precision or stark lines.

, Finally, after you’ve blended your eyeliner and laid a shiny foundation, it’s time to apply your gloss. There are a few different eye glosses on the market, like MAC Eye Gloss, NYX Lid Lacquer, MAKE Face Gloss, and Glossier Balm Dotcom. You can find a variety of glosses online or at your local beauty supply store. Use a flat brush or your finger to apply the gloss over your entire lid. Start in the middle and carefully sweep it outwards.If you’re worried about your eyelids feeling sticky, avoid applying any product to the crease. Smooth the product to your lid below the crease and a bit above the crease, but don’t put any directly in it!If you don’t want to buy a product meant specifically for your eye, you can always use a clear lip gloss or Vaseline-type product instead., The defining characteristics of this look are dewy and glowing. By adding a bit of highlight to a few key places on your face, you’ll up the glow factor even more. Dust a bit right below your eyebrows, along your brow bone. Then, sweep a bit down the bridge of your nose, on the highest point of your cheekbones, and on your cupid’s bow., Glossy eyelids are perfect for a fresh-faced, semi-natural look. That being said, they are best paired with a soft, more natural lip color. You can simply roll on a bit of lip balm to keep your lips looking plump and moisturized, or add a bit of nude lipstick if you prefer wearing a heavier product. Whatever you choose to do, let your glossy lids be the star of the show., You don’t need crisp, perfectly manicured brows for this look. In fact, natural brows pair perfectly with this effortless, light look.However, natural brows can always be improved upon! Using an eyebrow pencil, powder, or pomade, lightly fill in any areas where your brows are sparse or thin. Use a spoolie to brush your brows out so that everything looks natural and soft.

, Because this is a glossy, wetter look, you’re bound to have some inevitable movement. Most of the natural smudging is great – you don’t want your eyeliner to be perfectly clean and crisp. However, you also don’t want any smudges on your cheek or near your temple! Bring a little mirror and some extra gloss with you when you’re heading out the door. That way, you can fix any wayward smudges and reapply gloss to keep your lids shimmering all day and night."

Hold a cold compress against your eye.,
If desired, take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory.,
Get help if your black eye was the result of abuse.",How to Cover a Black Eye1," The less dark and swollen your black eye is, the easier it will be to hide. Before you try to cover it up, hold a cold compress against your eye for 10 minutes. Then, take the compress off and let your eye rest for 10 more minutes. Repeat this pattern as needed.


This will reduce the pain and swelling in the skin around your eye and help stop any bleeding under the skin. This should also make the black eye less noticeable before you even apply any cover-up — if not, it will at least make it less painful to touch.Making a cold compress is easy — just take an ice bag or a sack of frozen vegetables and wrap it in a thin towel or rag. You can also apply a pharmacy-grade cold compress or use frozen tea bags.

, If your black eye is especially painful or swollen, you may want to consider taking a small amount of an over-the-counter drug to help soothe it. Specifically, anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen can reduce swelling while easing the pain, making them an especially good choice.


Be sure to follow any dosage instructions on the box carefully. If you are a child, get an adult's permission before taking any medicine.

, If your black eye is the result of an accident or something non-serious, click here to skip this step. On the other hand, if your black eye was the result of violence that a family member or romantic partner inflicted on you on purpose, you should get help immediately. Getting yourself out of this abusive situation is much more important than hiding the evidence of it. Remember, it is never OK for someone to use violence against you.


In the U.S., one great resource for victims of abuse is the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or 1-800-787-3224 for TTY (text telephones). You should also call your local police to report violence or situations that make you feel like you are in danger.

Use a concealer if you have one.,
Optionally, apply a gentle red shade under your concealer.,
Use an orange or green corrective concealer.,
Consider using dark eyeshadow to get your eyes to match.,
As a last resort, use your normal foundation.",How to Cover a Black Eye2," One type of makeup that's especially useful for covering up an unsightly ""shiner"" is called a concealer. This makeup does just what its name suggests — covers things up so that they look like your normal skin.Concealers are usually designed to cover up noticeable marks like cuts, scars, and so on, so they should work well for bruises, especially small ones.


For best results, carefully apply an oil-based concealer with your fingers. This makes it easier to control how hard you press on your eye. If you use a makeup applicator, it's a little easier to accidentally poke your bruise and cause pain and swelling.
If you don't have this kind of make up, you can usually find it for a reasonable price at most cosmetics stores. Be sure to get a shade that closely matches your skin tone.;
, If your concealer leaves your eye with an ""ashen"" or unnatural appearance, try removing it and applying a thin red layer underneath before trying again. The red simulates the flow of blood under the skin, giving you a result that (hopefully) looks a little more full, warm, and natural. It also acts as a color corrector, neutralizing purple and blue tones. Best of all, this trick should work for all skin tones.

, Though it may seem weird to treat a black eye with makeup that's not the same color as your skin, this can actually be very effective if done correctly. Black eyes usually give the skin a red or purple tinge at first. By applying light-colored makeups with light green shade, it's possible to make the two colors ""cancel each other out"", leaving you with a shade that's close to your natural skin color. Green will cancel out any redness due to inflammation.The exact shade you should use to get this just right depends on your natural skin tone and the darkness of your black eye. Be ready to experiment — it can take some time, but it looks great when you get a match.
Black eyes often turn brownish yellow after a few days. At this point, you'll probably want to shift to an orange shade of makeup to cancel out the bruised tones.

, If your occasion calls for a bold look (like, for instance, if you're going to a rave or a punk rock concert), you can always consider darkening your ""good"" eye so that they match. Doing this can leave you with smokey-eyed Avril Lavigne look, which isn't everyone's taste, but if you're confident giving it a shot, go for it!

, In a pinch, you can use whatever skin tone foundation you have with you as a quick solution to your black eye problems. While this will almost always be better than nothing, it's often not ideal. Because of the dark color of the black eye and the semi-transparent quality of most foundations, a bad black eye can partially show through foundation, especially if you're fair-skinned.


However, foundation does work well when used in conjunction with the other methods above, so feel free to experiment to get the look that's best for you.

Wear your hair in front of your black eye.,
Wear shades.,
Wear a hat or hoodie.,
Try flaunting it!",How to Cover a Black Eye3," If you don't have access to any makeup, don't worry! It's still possible to hide your black eye. For instance, if you have long hair, try wearing your bangs low so that they cover the affected eye. This won't work for everyone — for instance, if you have a pixie cut, you're out of luck — but it's a great first step to keep an embarrassing black eye hidden.

, Sunglasses are another great choice for covering up a black eye. The great thing about sunglasses is that they allow you to make a conscious, positive decision about your outfit — you're not just trying to hide your black eye, you're also picking the pair of sunglasses that will make you look great. However, this strategy isn't without its downsides: keep in mind, for instance, that wearing shades indoors can raise suspicion.


For bad black eyes, larger, darker shades are best. For example, reflective aviators or Kurt Cobain-style vintage frames are great choices., If you can get away with wearing it, headgear offers another chance to hide your black eye. Wear your hat or hood low, but not so low you can't see where you're going — the last thing you want is another black eye.


Good choices for hats include standard baseball caps, flat-billed caps, straw hats, sun hats, beanies (stocking caps), and so on. In terms of hoods, basic ""hoodie"" sweatshirts work well.

, Just can't seem to get your eye looking like brand-new? Don't sweat it. There's usually nothing wrong with wearing your black eye as-is. An unhidden black eye can be a badge of pride: you're basically saying to the world, ""I don't care enough to let other people's stupid ideas about beauty ruin my day."" Generally, 99% of the people you meet will be curious about your black eye — not repulsed by it. Best of all, it's a conversation starter, and you'll (hopefully) have a funny story to tell everyone who comments on it!

",How to Create an Elegant Cat Eye Look with a Colorful Lower Lashline," There are two to three things you have to do before you start the look. The first thing you want to do is apply a primer.


Apply something like the Mac Paint Pot in Soft Ochre or just a concealer and set it with powder.
Wait for that to set in and then apply a ""Base Shadow."" This is an eyeshadow that matches your skin tone and that is matte. You can apply these two things with a flat shader brush, or with your finger.
Make sure to also apply the primer on your lower lash line.;
, To help the look build up, grab your favorite black, waterproof eyeliner. Make sure its not something like gel liner or liquid eyeliner, pencil is the best.


Apply this to the tight line, which is also know as the upper water line. If you are not sure what that is, you can look it up on Google, or go up to a Mac store or any other makeup store and they will help you if you have a question.

, Now take a soft brown, matte color on a Mac 217 brush, or any other blending brush you have, and apply that color to your crease. Add some to your ""Outer V"" and blend that color outwards, but not too far.

, Take a gold color on the same blending brush, apply that to your crease and ""Outer V"" making sure that these colors stay matte all the time.

,, Use a lighter color, that's matte, and apply that to your lid with a flat shader brush.


You can go in with another metallic color and apply that to the middle of your eye to add so more definition and to make your eyes look brighter.
Since you've added your lid color, the color on your crease has faded out a bit. Well, no worries. Just go back in with that brownish gold color, just a little, on the same blending brush and blend that color out, just enough so that it has a natural transitioning thing going on instead of having harsh lines.

, Now taking your favorite black pencil liner, maybe the same one that you used for the tight line, apply some to the inner rim of your eye, and feel free to retouch the upper water line part.


Make sure that you go all the way to your inner corner, and then go back up to your tight line. Be careful though, make sure you are applying this eyeliner to the water line and not the lash line. They are the two different things.

,


Take your favorite gel liner and an eyeliner brush, and line very close to the upper lash line, starting at the inner corner and towards the edge, almost as if you were using a regular pencil liner.
Take that same brush, or an angled brush if you'd feel more comfortable, and start the wing. To do the wing, you have to start at the edge of your eye and go out, making sure the line is on a slant and not straight up.
Connect the two lines that you created, and fill that triangle in.
Draw a little curved line connecting these two parts and fill that little space in so no one would tell the starting or ending point. If you feel self-conscious or didn't understand anything written here, make sure to watch tutorials about winged liners.

,


Take a flat shader brush, or an angled brush, and apply some purple to your lower lash line.
Start at the outer edge of your eye and stop at the middle portion of your eye.
Take a clean blending brush and blend that out, then re-apply that purple again.
Repeat this step about three times.

",How to Apply Natural Makeup for Brown Eyes," Keep in mind that certain colors will look natural on some people while looking obvious on others. Stick to shades close to your skin, lip, and hair colors.


If your eyebrows and eyelashes are black or very dark brown, then black eyeliner and mascara will look natural on you. For red hair, try out auburnor brownmascaras to find one that suits you best. If your hair is blonde, taupe mascara can define your lashes while still looking natural.Use eyeliner sparingly if you have lighter hair, and consider experimenting with brown eyeliners.
Pick an eyeshadow that is either close to your skin tone or a few shades lighter as your base color. For fair to medium skin tones, this means whites, taupes, and light browns. Taupes and browns are also good choices for darker skin. Just stay away from white bases when going for a natural look, as these don't blend well on darker skin.Select a second darker color for your shadow. These can be browns, taupes, and mauves.
Go a little lighter than your base for a highlighter. Pick a color that is the same hue as your skin but a little lighter than your base eyeshadow.;
, While skin can shine, it doesn't naturally glitter. Metallic eyeshadows like bronze and gold look wonderful with brown eyes but can ruin the illusion of a completely natural look.


If you want to incorporate metallic colors while still looking natural, do so sparingly and try to pick ones that blend well with your skin tone. For example, a slight splash of gold on the inner corners of your eyes can brighten them while still looking subtle on tan or olive skin.Matte versions of metallic colors are another more natural-looking option.

, Your undertone may be rosy (also called cool), golden (also called warm), or neutral. For a natural look, you especially want to stick with hues with a matching undertone to keep your makeup from standing out.


If you have rosy undertones, eyeshadows with subtle pink, red, plum, and blue tinges can look natural.
For golden skin, eyeshadows with subtle peach, gold, or yellow tones will work for a natural look.
If your undertone is more neutral, then you likely have both rosy and golden undertones. This can make things tricky, since even though most colors will look good on your skin, it can be more difficult to tell what will seem natural. Try out a few different shades to figure out which look best under natural light., Load an eyeshadow brush with your chosen base color. Tap the side of your brush to remove excess powder. With your eye closed, brush the color onto your entire lid using light strokes. It's ok if you go a little above your crease. Reload your brush as needed.

, Load a small angled brush with your chosen shadow color. Tap your brush to remove excess powder. Starting from the outer corner of your eye, run the angled brush along your crease. Stop just before you reach the inner corner of your eye. Do this with one long stroke. The end result should be a highly pigmented outer corner and a gradient towards a much lighter inner corner., Use a clean blending brush. Make small, circular ""buffing"" motions with the brush along the line where the two colors meet. Start from your inner corner and work your way across to the opposite side. Do this until the two eyeshadows have blended together seamlessly. Your eyelid should now look airbrushed and very close to how a shadow would natural fall.

, Use a clean eyeshadow brush. Dot a tiny bit of your highlight color at the inner corner of your eye and directly under the point of your eyebrow's arch. Use a clean, preferably small, blending brush to blend your highlighter into the surrounding area.

, Eyeliner will accentuate your beautiful brown eyes. However, eyeliner is the trickiest type of makeup to put on when you're going for a natural look. Which eyeliner styles look natural will depend on a combination of your eyelash color and your eyes' shade.


If your hair is light, consider minimal eyeliner. The easiest way to achieve this to make a very thin line across your upper lashline. For an even more subtle, natural look apply liner between each individual lash instead of drawing on a line.If your hair is dark, you can use either a minimalist technique or a slightly thicker line. A thicker line will bring more attention to your brown eyes, but a thinner one will look more natural.
If both your eyes and hair are very dark, you can try a subtle winged or ""cat eye"" eyeliner in addition to any of the above methods. At the outer corner of your eye, continue your eyeliner slightly at an upward angle pointing to the end of your eyebrow. Match the thickness of this line to the rest of your eyeliner. Small wings will create the illusion of an extended lashline.

, Finishing your eye makeup will help your brown eyes look even more beautiful. However, like eyeliner, this is another step where it's easy to overdo it. If you're worried about looking too done up, consider skipping this step. Otherwise, go over your upper lashes just once or twice with the mascara color best suited to your look.

, No matter which color palette you’ve chosen, you should use the lightest shade as the base for your look. Using a fluffy eye shadow brush, apply the shadow over the entire lid, from the lash line to above the eyelid crease.








Because you’re working with a light shade, you may need to go over the lid several times to pack on enough color. Certain shadows are more pigmented than others.
To make the light shade as intense as possible, you can apply a coat of white eyeliner to the entire lid before applying your shadow., Apply the powder to your brush, and simply follow your natural crease.

Another trick is to gently blot under your eyes with tape. The stickiness of the tape should pick up any loose bits of shadow.

, Just like with eye shadow, brown eyes can pull off basically any color of eyeliner and mascara. Because they’re a beautiful blend of many hues, different color products will accentuate them in different ways. You can stick to the standard colors, like black and brown, or experiment with bolder, vibrant colors.

, First, apply eyeliner to your top lash line. This will create a dark base for your lashes, making them look more full and lush. By rimming your eyes with eyeliner, it will enhance the whites of your eyes and make your eye color stand out.

Choose eyeshadows with orange tones.,
Try out purple shades.,
Warm up a smoky eye.",How to Apply Eye Makeup (for Blue or Grey Eyes)1," Bring out the blue in your irises by choosing eyeshadow colors with subtle or bold orange tones present in them. This could be any eyeshadow in bronze, copper, gold, terra cotta, orange, brown, peach, or salmon.


Makeup with orange tones work well with blue eyes because orange is the contrasting color of blue on a color wheel. The contrast makes the blue “pop” and appear more vivid.In general, use at least three shades of the same hue of eyeshadow to create a blended gradient on your eyelids that goes from lightest in the inner corner to darkest in the outer corner.
These colors can also be used as eyeliner for the top or bottom lash line by applying an eyeliner pencil in the same hue, or using eyeshadow on a thin brush to create a line.;
, Use purple tones for eyeshadows to complement blue eyes. While purple shades won’t provide as much contrast for blues as orange tones do, they offer a subtle accentuation to the color.


If you don’t want to use bright purples as your main eye shadow color, try using amethyst and royal purple shades as eyeliner for a smaller pop of color.A dark plum that is almost black is also a great color for lining the eyes that is a slightly more neutral and understated way to bring in some color.

, Opt for a warmer smoky eye with brown shades rather than cool black and grey, as this can drown out your blue eye color. Use browns, golds, and light pinks for eyeshadow.








A typical smoky eye is achieved by first applying a light shadow across the eyelid. In this case, a taupe or gold color would be great. Then apply a dark brown to the outer “V” of the eye, just above the crease and down along the lash line. Blend together with a soft brush and add a little light pink to the inner corner and brow bone.
You can also use a dark brown eyeliner or even brown mascara instead of black for this look. This keeps all the eye makeup on a warm, softer palette that will not detract from the blue of your eyes.

This is a good trick for any eyes, as it makes them appear bigger to put your eye color on display.









Those with blue eyes might want to use a highlighter that’s slightly pink-toned rather than stark white, as it will look more natural.Those with grey eyes may want to stick with a silvery highlight, in a cooler tone if they want to make grey eyes lighter.

, Use a dark brown mascara rather than the classic black to provide a warmer contrast to cool blues and greys. Brown lashes may also help to subtly open up smaller eyes to showcase your iris color.


Applying a lengthening mascara liberally, or putting on false lashes, also helps to open the eye up and show off your grey or blue color.
Mascara also comes in other unusual colors besides black and brown. Try a navy blue mascara as a subtle way to bring out the blues in grey eyes.Brown mascara and eyeliner are great for those who have paler complexions or red hair, as they provide less contrast than black, which can make the complexion appear washed out.

, Use an eyeliner pencil not only on your top and bottom lash line, but also on the inside of those lines, at the wet part known as your waterline. Provide some contrast to the whites of your eyes and color in your irises by using this trick to make them pop.








Consider a brown eyeliner for a color that won’t wash blue colors out. Or choose grey eyeliner, which is slightly more dramatic than brown and will also bring out greys and silvers in the eye.
You can still use black eyeliner if you like the look of higher contrast with your skin and more of a silver or grey tone to blue eyes. You can balance darker eyeliner with salmon and coral tones of eyeshadow if you want to keep bringing out the blue.Try using a light or white liner for the waterline if you have small eyes and want to make them appear larger. The eyeliner on your lids can remain brown, black, or grey., Remember that the rest of the makeup on your face can also affect the intensity of your eye color and eye makeup. Use your lips and blush to create further contrast, or downplay the rest of the face to keep the eyes on display.


Apply shimmery bronzer to the cheeks and face to further bring out blues in the eyes. You can also brush on a peachy blush to the apples of your cheeks to bring in more of the orange hue that makes blues pop.
A peachy, coral, or even red lip color works well for highlighting blue in blue or grey eyes. A nude lip works best with grayscale eye makeup to play up light grey in eyes.

Use multiple colors of glitter shadow.,
Color the bottom lid.",How to Apply Glitter Eye Makeup1," Creating a smoky eye using glitter shadow is a great way to create a sultry, dramatic look. There is a wide array of glittery eye-shadows from which you can choose. One of the most important things to consider is which color of shadow you want. For example, if you are trying to create a more subtle look, try a shadow that closely matches your natural skin tone. This method will make your eyes appear to sparkle.If you want to highlight your eye color, glitter eye-shadow can help you do that. To make brown eyes pop, use a cream shade. To make green eyes glow, try a shadow with a reddish tint.
Any of these color palettes can be used to create a smoky eye. Gray is also great for smoky eyes, and works on all skin tones.
Glitter eye makeup comes in many different forms. You can buy eyeshadow pencils, powders, or gels.
If this is your first time using glitter, try purchasing an eyeshadow palette. This will let you experiment with multiple shades.;
, Once you have chosen the right glitter shadow, it is time to achieve the look you want. Take a couple of minutes to make sure that you have everything you need. To start with, you'll need the shadow and a tool to help you apply it.You can apply eye shadow using your finger, a sponge, a brush, or a Q-tip. Many people prefer using a silicone brush as it is sturdier and can better handle the weight of a glitter shadow.
Have tissues nearby to help you clean up any stray glitter.
Make sure that you have a gentle eye-makeup remover handy in case you need to remove the shadow and start over.

, A primer is a base that you apply before putting on your actual makeup. It will typically be a clear liquid, but is sometimes in powder or gel form. Using your finger, apply a small amount of shadow primer to each of your eyelids. This will create a smooth palette for your shadow and make it last longer.You can purchase eyeshadow primer at any drugstore or department store. Remember, a little goes a long way.

, Once your eyes and your tools are ready, it is time to put the glitter shadow on your eyes. Try using several different shades to create a dramatic effect. Begin by applying a charcoal gray shadow. Use a medium brush to cover your lid with shadow. Then, use a slightly darker shade to color the inner and outer corner of your eyes. This will help highlight them.

, Different shades are what create the smoky look. Next, you want to apply the darkest of your shadows. Using a brush, apply a thin line of dark shadow across the crease of your eyelid. This will help create the smoky effect.


Remember, it is easier to add more shadow than to take it away. Start with less than you think you might need. You can always apply more.
Blend the colors. Blending the complimentary colors will help create a softer, yet still dramatic, look. For this step, you can use either your finger or a brush. Lightly smudge each of the colors together so that they are no longer sharply defined., To create a true smoky eye, you need to focus on your lower lid, too. Use a gunmetal shade for this step. Use a small, firm brush and press shadow along your lower lid line.To keep the look from being too severe, use a light silver shadow to lighten the overall effect. Place a small amount in the inner corner of each of your eyes.

Add definition to your eyebrows.",How to Apply Eye Makeup on Fair Skin," An undertone is the basic tone of your skin underneath the surface layer, which isn’t affected by things like tanning, acne, and surface discoloration. Your undertone will help you choose the best shades for makeup, clothes, and jewelry, because undertones are associated with certain colors, which can be better matched with some colors over others.


People with cool undertones are associated with bluish, reddish, and pinkish skin tones.People with warm undertones are associated with golden, yellowish, and peachy skin tones.
People with neutral undertones can have a combination of cool and warm skin tones.;
, There are a few indicators that will tell you what your undertone is, such as your hair color, how your skin reacts to the sun, the color of your veins, and the color of your hair.



People with cool undertones: look best in silver jewelry,burn easily in the sun, have blue veins at the wrist, and usually have hair that’s blond (ash or sandy), brown (ash or dark), blue-black, auburn, snowy, or silver-gray.

People with warm undertones: look best in gold jewelry, will bronze in the sun, have green veins at the wrist, and often have hair that’s blond (golden, strawberry, or honey), brown (golden or caramel), brown-black, red (copper or wine), or creamy white.People with neutral undertones: look good in both types of jewelry, have blue-green veins at the wrist,and tend to have hair that’s blond, brown, red, white, or gray.

, Once you know your undertone, you can select colors that will best complement your skin. Most people with pale or fair skin tend to have cool undertones,which means you should look for cosmetics (and clothing) in sea shades, soft purples, taupes and grayish beiges, metallics,pinks, and berry reds. It’s best to avoid oranges, orange-reds, and yellows. For pale people with warm undertones, try earthy reds, yellows, greens, browns, peaches, corals, and violet-reds.
If you are pale but have a neutral undertone, you can wear any color, but you may look best in muted berry colors, such as raspberry, lemon, and lavender., When it comes to applying makeup on fair skin, one of the most important things to remember is that darker shades may simply be too dark. The contrast of dark cosmetics on pale skin can be too stark, but it can also make you look bruised.Try browns and grays instead of black for cosmetics like mascara and eyeliner,and use brown instead of black as your base color when you are creating a smoky eye effect, and blend your eyeshadow more rigorously., You always want a fresh canvas to work with when you're applying makeup. This is especially true if you have pale skin, because any leftover makeup will show up more prominently than it might otherwise.


Wash your face with a gentle cream facial cleanser. Lather the cleanser in your hands and use circular motions to massage it into your face.
Rinse your face with warm water, and then pat your skin dry with a clean towel.
When your face is still slightly damp, apply your favorite moisturizer, serum, or toner.

, To create a good base for your makeup to stick to, and to cover veins and redness, rub or brush a pea-sized amount of primer, concealer, or foundation onto your eyelids, under the brow line, and below your eyes.This step is particularly important if you are going to be using a light shade of makeup, which won’t cover discoloration and veins.

, Once you’ve picked out colors that will match your undertone and that aren’t too dark for your fair skin, you can start applying makeup to your eyes. For a basic look, start with three colors: a base color, a lighter color of a similar shade for highlighting, and a darker color of a similar shade for contouring.Apply a small amount of base to the root of your eyelashes. Slowly build the color and work it up toward your brow bone, stopping just below your brow line.
Take a lighter color of a similar shade and apply that just below your brow line. Use the darker color in the crease of your eye to add some contour.
Make your eyes look more open by adding a dab of your base color above and below your tear ducts.

, Use a quick drying eyeliner to avoid smearing dark eyeliner all over your freshly applied eyeshadow, and remember to use a lighter color, such as gray, brown, or even blue.


Apply a line of eyeliner along your lash line from the inner corner of your eye to the outer corner.Apply one to two layers of mascara to your upper lashes.

, People with fair skin and hair may need to add some extra definition to the eyebrows, and you may want to add some extra darkness to your brow if you have fair skin and dark hair.Choose a brow pencil or tinted gel that matches the shade of your eyebrows. Apply short strokes of color to your eyebrows, starting at the inside corner and working toward your temple. Use the brush to work the color through your brows and gently sculpt the shape."

",How to Apply Dark Eye Makeup," Use a soft, fluffy eyeshadow brush with longer bristles to do this. This will give you that nice, soft base color.









If you have a darker skin tone, a light brown might be too light for you; opt for a shade that is 2 to 3 shades darker than your skin tone instead.;
, The eyeshadow should be darkest along the crease, and faded to almost nothing as it goes towards your eyebrow.








, Use a smaller brush with slightly shorter and stiffer bristles to do this. Focus the shadow inside the crease, as well as just above and below it. For this, you can use a somewhat sparkly eyeshadow.








, Start by blending most it downwards towards your lash line. Finish off by blending it upwards towards your eyebrow, just a little bit past the crease. Don't worry so much about getting the blending on the eyelid perfect, as you will be covering it up.








, Start applying the eyeliner to the center of your eyelid, right along the lash line. Work your way to the corners, making the line thinner as you go. When you are done, you should have a half-circle shape halfway up your eyelid.









You can also use black eyeshadow, black kohl, or a black eyeliner pencil.
If you are having difficulties applying the makeup to your lash line, take a little mirror and hold it below your eyes, in the palm of your hand. Look down into the mirror, and carefully outline your upper lash line.

, Do not blend it up too high, however. The black eyeliner will simply act as a base, so that you can get the darkest black possible.









Finish off your blending by running your brush along your eyelid, just below the crease. This will help soften any harsh edges.

, This will help set it, and prevent it from smudging. It will also help take away any shine. If you want, you can use a black eyeshadow with some shimmer in it.








, Use the same brush you used to apply it originally—the one with the stiffer bristles. Be sure to blend it up towards the brow bone. When you are done, you should have a sort of ombre effect on your eyelid, that starts black, and gradates to a lighter brown towards your brow bone.







, Use a black eyeliner with a felt tip or brush applicator to fill in the gap between your upper lashes and eyelid. This will help create a smoother transition, and blend everything together.








, If you have not already, trim your false lashes down until they fit your eyelid. Apply a thin line of eyelash glue to the back strip of your falsies, and wait until the glue starts to turn tacky. Carefully apply the eyelash, and lower your eyes until it dries.









Most white glues will start to turn clear when they get tacky.
Consider holding your falsie in a U-shape between your fingers while you wait for the glue to turn tacky. This will give it a nice curved shape, and help it mold better against your eyelid.
Learning how to put on false lashes takes practice. Some people use special applicators or tweezers to put them on.

, Use a brush with shorter, slightly stiffer bristles to do this. This will help open up your eyes, and make them appear wider, brighter, and more awake.








, This will give your eyes that darker, smokier effect. Begin by lining your lower eyelid with black liner. Dust on some dark brown eyeshadow using a brush with short, stubby bristles. Be sure to follow the outline of your lower eyelid. Blend everything together using a thin, crease brush.








, This will help balance your eyes out, and make them look less top heavy—especially if you are wearing very heavy false lashes.







, This will give your eyes that nice, clean look. Begin by combing your brows upwards with a ""spoolie"" brush. Fill in any gaps and sparse areas with an eyebrow pencil; use as light a touch as you can. Next, fill in your eyebrows using a pressed powder and an angled brush; use a softer touch towards the inner corners of your eyebrows. Finish off by combing through your brows with the spoolie brush.








A spoolie brush looks a little bit like a mascara brush.
Use colors that closely match your eyebrows. If you have blond or very pale eyebrows, however, go a few shades darker. If you have black eyebrows, use a very dark brown or charcoal.
To set the look, comb some eyebrow gel over your eyebrows. You can also dust on some translucent setting powder instead.

",How to Apply Eye Makeup2," Wash your whole face with a gentle cleanser or makeup wipe before you begin, paying particular attention to any leftover mascara or eyeliner. If you're having trouble removing residual eye makeup, try using cold water or regular lotion on a cotton swab. If you have dry skin around your eyes or suffer from eczema, rub a little moisturizer underneath your eyes, as well as between the outer corners of your eyes and your temples. Don't put moisturizer on your eyelids - this will make them greasy, and the makeup you apply will run off.


Apply primer to your eyelids(optional). Primer or base smooths out your skin and gives the makeup something to stick to. If you do choose to use primer, apply it all over your eyelid and up to the brow bone.

, Apply concealer to dark under-eye circles and to the area where your inner eye meets your nose. (Shop for concealer somewhere that allows you to test samples and swipe them across your inner wrists - buy the one that covers up the veins best.) Use your fingers or a concealer brush to blend the makeup outward to your cheekbones and nose. Set the concealer by brushing a loose, flesh-toned powder over it; apply some powder to your eyelids, as well.

, You can use one color, or several. Here's a basic three-color plan.









Apply a medium color on your eyelid. Your eyelid is the area running from your eyelashes to your crease (the slight dip between your eyelid and your brow bone). Pick a medium pink, light brown or any other middle-of-the-road hue for this area.
Apply a light color on your brow bone. Most people have an area of their brow bone that sits beneath the eyebrows proper. Highlight this area and make more light bounce off of it by brushing on a pearly off-white, light gold or other delicate color that matches your eyelid color in tone.
Apply a dark color on your crease. Use light, little strokes to deposit little bits of darker powder on the crease of your eye. Go from the outer corner of your crease and follow the arch about 2/3 of the way in toward the inner corner of the eye. Try a violet, brown or other dark color that matches up with the first two colors you used.

, If you applied more than one color of eyeshadow, use your fingers or a fluffy, tapered blending brush to mix the colors a bit. This will create a more natural, cohesive look.








, You can use liquid eyeliner, a liner pencil, or even wet eyeshadow on an angled brush to line your eyes. Whatever you pick, move across your upper lash line in tiny, controlled strokes as if you're drawing a dotted line. Go back and fill in the blanks with more small strokes. For more drama, line your lower lashes as well.








, Use an eyelash curler to grip your upper lashes. Hold the clamp for about five seconds. Accessing your lashes is easiest if you half-close your eyes. Remember, always curl before you apply mascara, never after.

, You can apply a little or a lot, and there are many different brands and formulas for volume, length and definition. Find a product you're happy with. Start at the base of your upper lashes and slowly sweep upward. For a more dramatic effect, apply mascara to the lower lashes as well. If you want to apply multiple coats, do it while the first coats of mascara are still wet - applying a new coat to dry mascara will result in clumps.

To create the perfect cat eye, you will need two different kinds of liner.You will need a gel eyeliner pot. You will also need an eyeliner brush.
Additionally, you will need a felt-tipped liquid liner. One or both of these liners can be glittery.

, Start with the gel liner and the eyebrow brush. Dip the brush in the pot of liner. Draw a line with the brush from the outer corner of your eye towards your temple. Try drawing a line approximately 1/8 of an inch long. You can make it longer if you want.This is the ""tail"" of your cat eye.
Using the same gel liner, create a series of dots along your upper lash line. Start the dots about 1/4 of the way in from the inner corner of your eye.

, Now you are ready to fill in the outline that you have begun. Using the gel liner again, draw dashes between the dots. This creates a solid line of eyeliner across your lid.Now it is time to connect the tail and the line. Using the gel liner, return to the tail. Draw a small triangle that connects to the line of dots and dashes. This should be a diagonal line that comes off of the tail and angles towards the line across your lid.

",How to Apply Glitter Eye Makeup3," Glittery eyebrows are a major fashion trend right now. You can accomplish the look as long as you have a few specific tools.

Using a glitter liner is a great way to experiment without committing to a full glittery eye.

, Your eyelashes are a great way to get creative with glitter. You can try a mascara that contains a little bit of sparkle. These products come in different colors, and have different amounts of glitter. Try swiping a coat on your lashes for some extra sparkle.If you want to ease into using glitter, apply one coat of your normal mascara. After allowing it to dry for 10 seconds, follow with a coat of glitter mascara.
Try pairing the glittery mascara with a sparkly lipstick. Your look will be festive and fun.

This will give your lashes a natural curl instead of just bending them up at one harsh angle.If an eyelash curler is out of the question, there are other ways to make your lashes stand out.


Blow on the ends of your fingertips to warm them up, then gently press your lashes up. Hold for ten seconds, and repeat if necessary.Heat a spoon in a mug of warm water, then hold the edge of the spoon along the root of your eyelashes. The curved side of the spoon (the side that holds soup or cereal) should be facing out, away from you. Use your fingers to gently push your lashes up and against the edge of the spoon.Use a clean toothbrush to brush your lashes upward. Run the bristles under hot water to warm up the brush, wiping off excess moisture on a towel. Then brush the bristles up through your lashes, a starting near the root, and holding at the tips for ten seconds.;
, Figure out what shades really highlight your eye color and buy shirts and scarves in those colors. Think about what color you are wearing when people compliment your eyes, or try holding up a bunch of different colored fabrics to your eyes and have a friend tell you which ones look best.


Blue eyes should start out with black and different shades of blue (darker blues will make your eyes look a deeper blue, lighter blues will lighten), purple, pinks, and light green.Brown eyes should start with oranges and red (or combinations like peach), shades of light brown, bold blues, lavender, gold, and moss green.Green eyes should try any shade of purple or green, black, navy, pale yellow, and deep browns.Hazel eyes should try black, navy, and other dark neutrals, orange, burgundy, and lavender., Your eyebrows frame your face and bring balance to your features. Stick with a strong, natural looking brow over over-plucked, pencil-thin lines. If you can have a professional salon shape your brows they will give you a template for how they should look and then you can do maintenance with a tweezer.Avoid waxing your brows, as the process damages the extremely sensitive skin around your eyes. Try plucking or threading instead.If you aren't allowed to tweeze your eyebrows, use a toothbrush to brush the hairs upwards slightly.

, The skin around your eyes is extra thin, which means it is extremely sensitive and will show the effects of a sleepless night. Lack of sleep can affect your circulatory system, making the blood vessels more visible through the paper-thin skin under your eyes.Sleep with your head propped up on two pillows, allowing the skin under your eyes to drain while you sleep and prevent puffiness.Dark circles can also result from allergies, genetics, or bone structure.To lessen puffiness, try sleeping propped up on two pillows, which can help drain excess fluid from your face overnight., Swollen-looking eyes are usually a result of excess fluid under the eyes.

, You may need to experiment with a few different eye creams to find the right one, but you ultimately want something that is moisturizing and contains vitamin E. Beware of eye creams that are too rich, greasy, or waxy, as these can trap dead skin cells and lead to tiny white bumps, or milia, around your eyes.Look for creams that de-puff your skin (caffeine can help reduce puffiness) or contain gentle exfoliants.Older women should look for creams that reduce wrinkles and firm the skin around your eyes, which can begin to droop as you age.

",How to Make Eyes Look Bigger1," Doing so will cause your eyes to look smaller, as they will appear fenced or ringed in by the circle line. (This also means avoiding the smoky eye look). This is not necessarily a bad thing — small eyes can still look mysterious and dramatic — but not if you're looking to make your eyes look larger.









Apply eyeliner only to the outer 3/4 of your eyelid. Avoid lining the inner corner of your eye.
When you apply eyeliner on your lower lashes, do it just below the lash line, not inside the rim.You might also want to line the inner rim of your lower lid with white or other light color. It makes eyes look noticeably bigger, but be careful, as overdoing it will look awkward.;
, This line should move upwards a little as well, mimicking a very long eyelash. This technique will make your eyes appear wider, but can be tricky to do well. If the eyeliner isn't applied symmetrically, it can make your eyes look lopsided, so try doing this with a mirror or ask a friend to help initially.








Try not to get discouraged and keep practicing. It takes some time, but if you keep trying you will be able to master this technique.

, This technique helps to bring more light into your eyes and produces the effect of larger-looking eyes. Use soft white though; a harsh white will look theatrical. You can also use the white liner on your lower waterline, which extends the white part of your eye.

Apply a black colored mascara.If you want, you can use an eyelash curler(preferably one that has been designed to give volume and lengthen lashes).

,
Move the mascara wand in a zigzag pattern through your lashes from the base to the tip and wait at least 10 seconds between applying coats.,
Check the overall effect in the mirror, and redo the eyeliner if you think it's necessary, but it shouldn't, if you do the eyeliner after the eyeshadow.

,
You can also use false eyelashes, depending on whose look you're emulating.,
Follow the package instructions on applying the lashes.",How to Apply 1960's Style Eye Makeup2,",, Use a small and stiff brush to trace, an eyeliner brush will do. This will define your eyes more. Blend it well with a small fluffier brush, but keep it dark.


If you're going for a more theatrical Twiggy-like look, don't blend at all! Use a black gel liner, or liquid, trace your crease shape, let it set, and that's it. You can go back and refine the crease a bit, but keep it very sharp and neat looking.

, This is also known as 'feathering'.

, Make it look neat. (Before the next step, if you want, you may apply false lashes)

,, This makes your lashes look thicker and longer. Do not try to put on too many layers of mascara as this may make your eyelashes clump together and look ""spidery"". If you are planning on drawing on your bottom eyelashes like Twiggy's, don't put on much mascara on your bottom lashes.

,, But generally, you should use eyelashes that are long and thick but still look somewhat natural. Use the appropriate eyelash glue. Some pairs of false eyelashes come with pre-packed glue but it is better if you buy a separate eyelash glue tube - the applicator is often 10 times more precise.

, This can be very tricky unless you have experience. If possible, try having someone with a steady hand apply the lashes for you.

"
"
With a steady hand, using a black (or grey, a subtler look) liquid or gel eyeliner, you can draw on your bottom eyelashes.,
For a less dramatic alternative, you can draw on smaller, closer together eyelashes that all go in the direction of your outer eye corner.

",How to Apply 1960's Style Eye Makeup3," Use short strokes. They should be spaced apart, shaped like upside down triangles, and they should be straight, not leaning in any particular direction. The last eyelash or two on your outer corner can go in that natural direction, though.

Apply a matte light pink or coral lipstick.",How to Apply 1960's Style Eye Makeup4," Nude colored lipstick is great too, especially if you've done the eyes dramatically. If you're going for dramatic then you can perhaps put on a bit of gloss.


Lipstick was quite bright or nude at the time, so red might be a bit too 1950s. If you don't like nude or light lipsticks, just wear a toned down lipstick close to your natural lip color.

Groom your eyebrows.,
Make your eyelashes look longer.,
Shape your eyes.",How to Make Eyes Look Bigger2," In much the same way a picture frame affects the way the picture looks, your eyebrows affect the way your face looks — including your eyes. The simple act of removing stray hairs can make your eyes more noticeable; however, don't make the mistake of assuming that the thinner your eyebrows, the bigger your eyes will look.










Thick eyebrows are flattering to every shape of face and give you a fresh, youthful appearance., There are several ways to go about doing this:









Curl your upper eyelashes with an eyelash curler.
Apply mascara.
Apply false eyelashes.

, Apply white eyeliner to your waterline, or apply black eyeliner from the outer corner to the middle, not the whole way.

Reduce any puffiness in your eyes.,
Get rid of dark circles under your eyes.,
Try applying cold spoons.",How to Make Eyes Look Bigger3," Swelling in the skin on and around your eyes can make them look smaller. Try these steps to reduce puffiness:


Get plenty of sleep.
Wash your face with cool water.
Place cold, used teabags over your eyes. The tannins in the tea act as an astringent, tightening the skin.
Reduce your salt intake. Too much salt leads to water retention, which leads to eye puffiness.
Exercise to increase circulation, which in turn reduces water retention.

, This won't necessarily make your eyes look bigger, but dark circles will detract from even the biggest, most beautiful eyes.


Stay healthy. This means getting plenty of sleep, eating a balanced, healthy diet and minimizing the intake of salt in your diet.
Some people have thinner skin under their eyes, which can cause the appearance of dark circles. Use an orange or red primer under your concealer to balance blue or purple tones.

, Before you go to bed, place two spoons in the freezer overnight. Wake up, rub the sleep out of your eyes, and place the two spoons over each of your eyes for about 1 minute. This can help you appear refreshed and tighten up the skin around your eyes. Plus, it helps to reduce the appearance of under-eye circles."

Genetics, ageing, and even the color of your skin may make dark under-eye circles an unwelcome fact of life.For those people who suffer from less controllable variables, solutions in the form of makeup exist.


Apply a salmon-tone corrector to the inside corners of your eyes and blend out with a brush. Be sure to dab, not pull.
Apply concealer to the space beneath your eye in a triangular shape, again dabbing and not pulling. Avoid getting any concealer or corrector too close to your bottom lash line, as this may result in makeup malfunctions.;
, A nude shadow over the entire lid helps to even out color and can serve as a base for other colors. Use a darker shade of medium brown along the crease line to help give more definition. Highlight the area directly underneath your eyebrow and above the crease with a very light color.


Using non-neutral, colored eyeshadow can provide extra drama for the eyes, but not all colors are considered equally appropriate for all eye colors.
Generally speaking, your optimal eyeshadow colors will be complimentary, or opposite, to the actual color of your eyes on the color wheel. People with green eyes should consider violets, purples, chestnuts, plums, and browns.
Blue eyed individuals most often look best in eye shadow shades that are gray, rose, mauve, peach, orange, and bronze.
Hazel and brown eyed people possess a neutral eye color and therefore can usually wear any color from purple to amber.

, Using a dark, usually black but sometimes brown, eyeliner, draw a dark frame for your lashes as close to them as you can get. Try to keep the application as even as possible, but thicker on top.

, Dark colors make spaces appear smaller, and by contrast light colors make them appear bigger, so applying a bright color to the skin nearest your eyes will help them to appear larger. Your waterline is the thin strip of flesh right along the inside of your lower lashes. The tightline is the paralleling area on your top eyelid.

, If your cheeks or lips are drawing people's attention with bright, bold, or dark colors, your eyes will no longer be the center of their attention. This will make your eyes appear smaller in comparison to these other emphasized areas. Choose neutral colors close to your natural skin tone and avoid lip glosses to achieve this effect.

, Although sunlight can give you a healthy looking tan, it is also very damaging for your skin. This can lead to skin discoloration over time. If you have to be in the sun for very long, wear protective sun screen and large sunglasses to help protect the skin under your eyes., Salt makes your body retain water.This can lead to swelling. Because the skin around your eyes is thin and fragile, it's particularly vulnerable to swelling.

, The skin underneath your eyes is especially fragile and thin, and the blood vessels underneath there are very close to the surface. Harsh rubbing can irritate these areas, increasing the dark look underneath your eyes, as well as making the skin swell, which will make your eyes appear recessed by comparison.

, Your body is roughly 60% water. Your cells need water in order to be full and healthy, properly regenerate, and to get rid of waste products amongst other things.Drinking more water will give your skin a natural, healthy glow and better texture.

, Do this with retinol creams or lotions available at your local pharmacy, grocery store, or beauty supply shop. Moisturizing should happen at least once, if not twice, a day after properly cleansing your skin. Restoring moisture to your skin helps it to retain its youthful appearance.


Avoid using hemorrhoid creams around your eyes. These creams contain ingredients which may irritate the delicate skin around your eyes., Sleep is when your body, especially your skin, regenerates. Without proper sleep, your blood vessels are more likely to dilate, or expand.As mentioned before, the blood vessels under your eyes are very close to the surface, making them very visible: the larger they get, the darker your skin will appear.

, Think of your skin as a canvas: you want it to be as smooth and even as possible before you ever even advance to make-up application. This means minimizing and getting rid of any extra bumps that do not belong. Apply adhesive eye pads or a cold compress to the under-eye area to get rid of any puffiness or swelling.

Shape and thicken your eyelashes.,
Maintain your eyebrows.,
Trim beards and mustaches.",How to Accentuate Small Eyes3," Although individuals with lighter colored hair, or those who have eyelashes that grow straight naturally, will benefit the most from this step, even people with naturally dark or curly lashes should notice an immediate difference. Thick, dark lashes create a more dramatic frame for your eyes. This is because it creates a naturally greater contrast between both your skin and the whites of your eyes.


Clamp an eyelash curler tightly to the upper lashes of each eye, as close to the eyelid as possible without pinching your skin, for about 10 seconds.
Apply 2-3 coats of lengthening and defining mascara to your upper eyelashes as well as at least one coat to the bottom lashes as well.

, Eyebrows act as frames for your eyes. By accentuating your eyes, brows naturally make them appear larger. Improving the shape of eyebrows will make your eyes stand out even more. At the same time, you do not want them to be so unruly that they distract people from your eyes themselves.


Use a spool-style brow comb to brush your eyebrow hair upward into their natural curve. Use a pair of tweezers to pluck any stray hairs above, below, or between your eyebrows, but be sure not to over pluck: eyebrows that are too thin or start further than the corners of your eyes may look unnatural.
Use a small pair of scissors to trim any hairs that are needed to retain your brows' fullness but are too long.
Fill in any gaps in your eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil using small, short strokes going in the same direction as your actual hair to mimic your natural hair. After brushing your eyebrows again with the spool-style brush, use a colored gel to set your hairs in place. , Facial features like large beards and mustaches draw attention away from the eyes. Either keep beards and mustaches trimmed to a minimal size or do away with them entirely.

Dab a touch of highlighter at the inner corner of each eye.,
Blend your eyeshadow well.,
Put on some subtle eyeliner.,
Finish up with some light mascara.",How to Apply Easy Eye Makeup1," Load an eyeshadow brush with your makeup of choice and simply swipe it across your entire closed eyelid. Stop just above your crease.


Avoid shimmery eyeshadows during the day if you're going for a ""no makeup"" look.
Taupes, browns, honeys, and creams are the best eyeshadows to use for natural-looking makeup.
Pick a color that is either slightly darker or lighter than your natural skin tone. If your skin is darker, a lighter eyeshadow usually works best, and vice versa if you're on the paler side. If you have medium skin, then you can pick either.Even neutrals can stand out and be obvious if you pick one too different from your natural skin tone.;
, Select a very light eyeshadow, such as honey or white. Lightly load a clean eyeshadow brush and touch it to the corner of your eye near your tear ducts. This small detail will brighten up your eyes.


You can also choose to use any other type of powder highlighter for this step. Foundations, concealers, and contouring kits will work here., Use either a clean eyeshadow brush or the same brush you used on your main eyeshadow. Start from the upper outer corner of your eye where the eyeshadow begins. Make small, circular buffing motions across your eye's crease with the brush. Go over it a few times until the makeup looks totally natural.


Blending softens harsh lines to create a more natural look. Here, well-blended makeup will form a gradient from your lid color to the surrounding skin tone.
Since you only have one neutral color, it shouldn't take much time to blend properly., Apply a thin strip of eyeliner along your upper lashline.


For the natural look, avoid heavy eyeliner. If your skin and eyes are fairly dark, some eyeliner on your lower lashline can appear natural. Otherwise, stick to the upper lid only.
If you're a beginner and making a straight line is difficult, try using a kohl pencil rather than liquid or gel liner. Kohl pencils are easier to smudge and blend.If you have blonde or red hair, consider using a brown or taupe eyeliner. Black eyeliner can stand out too much on people with lighter hair.
If you're just learning how to do makeup, applying eyeliner can be tricky, especially when you're trying to make it look natural. Consider skipping it for now if you have trouble.

, Brush a single layer onto your top lashes.


Like eyeliner, this is another step that's optional for the natural look. Mascara is much easier to apply also but isn't essential, especially if you have naturally well-defined eyelashes.

Add some eyeliner.,
Finish up with mascara.",How to Apply Easy Eye Makeup2," For this look, you will need two different eyeshadows: a lighter base color and a darker color to use for shading.


You can pick any color for the base, as long as it's lighter than the crease color. Pick your favorite or coordinate it with your clothes.
Some colors will look more flattering on you than others. Shades that match your eye color (blues for blue eyes, for example) will make them pop. Bright, vivid colors will look great on darker skin, while jewel tones tend to suit lighter skin.
The most common shadow color to use is a simple black. A darker version of the base eyeshadow is also popular.
Many eyeshadows come in palettes containing colors that work well together., Load a clean eyeshadow brush with powder. Apply the eyeshadow to your lid beginning at the outer edge. Move the brush horizontally across your eyelid. Go back and forth a couple times for even coverage.


Tap off the excess before bringing a loaded eyeshadow brush to your face to prevent fallout. This is especially important when working with non-neutral colors that contrast with your skin.

Make small, circular buffing motions from the corner to about a quarter of the way across your eyelid. This should blend the two colors together to create a seamless, airbrushed look. Next, run your brush back and forth along your eye crease. This will soften the shadow and make it look less harsh., Feel free to go a little heavy with the liner if you want. For the easiest (but still glamorous) look, simply line your upper lid with black. Start at the top outer corner of your eyelid and trace the lid towards your nose.


If your hand isn't steady, try using a pencil instead of liquid liner. Liquid liner can be easier for some people to use but is harder to smudge and blend to correct uneven lines.
Another easy and popular eyeliner style is the cat eye look. Simply add two more lines to the standard upper eyelid one you started with. Extend this line further out until the corner lines up with the end of your eyebrow. Next, take it back in and lightly line the outer half of your lower lid. Liquid and gel liners typically give you the best results for this sharp look.

, Mascara works to open up your eyes by enhancing the lashes. For this style, you can use dark, dramatic mascara on either the top or both eyelids.


Do your best to keep your mascara from clumping. To prevent clumping don't use more than two coats. If your mascara is clumping with only one or two coats, try removing excess product from the brush with a tissue before applying."

, No matter what style eye makeup you'll end up putting on, putting down a base layer of primer on your lids will give you the best results. Primer gives you a smooth surface to work with, making the rest of your eye makeup much easier to apply. It also helps keep your makeup in place, preventing it from rubbing or sliding off.


General makeup primer will also work for this step.
If you don't have primer, you can use a layer of foundation and concealer instead. Make sure to seal it with powder to help your eyeshadow stick to this base., Eyelash curlers can look intimidating, but they're actually very easy to use.

Take a cool shower or bath.
Use a cold compress such as ice or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel.
Rub the skin with an ice cube. Take breaks between applications to avoid damaging your skin.;
, Cucumbers cool and moisturize irritated skin. Simply cut thin slices from a refrigerated cucumber and lay them across the affected area. The wider the cucumber, the better. If you don't have cucumbers, you can use a potato because it contain lots of water and also is moisturizing for the skin.


If you're having a hard time getting the cucumber slices to stick, try moistening your skin with a little oil or lotion. It acts like a glue.

, Aloe is one of the few natural ingredients widely known to provide relief from sunburns. Rub aloe vera gel, or a gentle lotion containing this ingredient on the affected skin as soon as you notice redness or feel pain. Repeat several times per day to keep pain and irritation at bay.If you have an aloe plant, you can slit the leaves down the middle and squeeze them onto your sunburn to get a 100% natural soothing effect., Steroids are a type of drug that can reduce pain and swelling when they come in contact with the skin, making them perfect for sunburns. There are many different types of steroid ointments available over-the-counter. Hydrocortisone cream is one common choice.To apply, gently rub a pea-sized amount over the burned skin, reapplying every few hours as needed.


Note that topical steroids are not the same kind of drugs infamous for being abused by athletes. These are anabolic steroids. Over-the-counter steroids are perfectly safe for use (except in some cases for very young children)., According to some, the tannic acids in black tea can soothe burned skin and prevent peeling.To do this, first boil a pot of water. Steep five or six tea bags in the hot water for about five to ten minutes. Let the tea cool to room temperature. (Cool it in the fridge to reduce your wait time.) When it's cool, apply it to the burnt area with a rag or spray bottle and let it sit for half an hour. Alternatively, just hold one of the wet tea bags against the skin.


Most sources recommend a black tea such as Earl Grey for this., Although it may seem like an odd choice, oatmeal can be a helpful tool for dealing with sunburns and promoting healing. It has healing properties such as normalizing the skin’s pH level and soothing itchy and irritated skin.Try running a cool bath and mixing in two to three cups of plain (unsweetened) rolled oats. Soak in the bath for 20 minutes before rinsing off or proceeding to one of the other treatments.
You can add 3/4 cup of baking soda to the bath as well for extra moisturizing power., Although it may seem strange, vinegar helps restore the pH balance of the skin, which helps soothe and heal the skin after a sunburn.First, take a cold shower. Next, fill a spray bottle with vinegar and gently mist the burnt skin. Let the vinegar mixture sit for about an hour. After, rinse it off or take another cold shower.

Try to use a product without added fragrances or scents. The chemicals in these can sometimes irritate inflamed skin.

, Sunburned skin is extra dry and inflamed, so ensuring your body has a good supply of water can help keep it protected. Stay hydrated inside and out to prevent too much skin from peeling and flaking off. Mayo Clinic recommends about 9 to 13 cups of water a day.Water also can help with headaches, which are sometimes caused by sunburns., The fat in dairy products can help moisturize burnt skin by reducing pain and preventing peeling. Whole milk is usually the cheapest most convenient way milk to use. Try soaking a rag in whole milk and holding it against your burn in 20 minute intervals as a cold compress. Alternatively, add whole milk to a cool bath and let yourself soak.


Don't use low- or non-fat milk for this. Without the fat, the milk loses much of its moisturizing properties.
Whole-fat plain Greek yogurt also has the same effect when used as a lotion.Don't use sugary sweetened yogurts, which can get sticky and might irritate the skin.

, The starch inside potatoes contains lots of water, so laying it against the skin is a great way to re-moisturize skin that's dried out from a sunburn. Grate a potato to turn it into a starchy paste. Then, rub this mixture against the skin and let it sit.Wash off with cold water after 20 minutes.


You can also use a food processor to make your paste. If you do, cut your potato into small pieces first. Trying to grind up a whole potato at once can be too much for some processors.

, While many natural oils will moisturize and soothe dry skin just as well as commercial lotions do, coconut oil is an even better choice. In addition to providing moisture and giving burnt skin a healthy glow, it also gently exfoliates, removes dead skin and promotes healing.Coconut oil is available in solid blocks from many health food stores and specialty grocers.

Dab the concealer all over your eyelids and into your brow bone.
Gently rub the concealer into your eyelids until it's blended into your natural skin tone.;
, You want to start off with a lighter shade of eye shadow. Opt for a shimmery, rosy color to start. To start, use your finger to press the eye shadow onto the outer half of your eye. Then, use your finger to pull the shadow inward to the other corner of your eye. This will create a faded effect. The color should start darker on the outer corner of your eye and lighten as it moves inward.








Repeat this process on your lash line. Apply a light line of eyeshadow using your fingers that moves from the outer to inner corner of your eye.
Repeat with the other eye.

, Once you've added your light layer of eye shadow, create smoky corners using a darker shade of rose-colored eye shadow. Imagine your eyelid is split into three parts: a rectangle in the center and two triangles on either corner.

From there, use a shadow brush around the edges of the triangle and into your crease. Use the darker eye shadow to define this corner of your eye.

Use your coffee tanning lotion daily.",How to Tan Skin with Coffee1," You’ll need about a cup of very strong coffee to make your tanning lotion, so only put enough water in to brew that amount. If you brew an entire pot of coffee, then it will not be strong enough because a standard coffee maker will not hold enough coffee grounds to brew a pot that strong.


If you usually use another type of coffee maker, such as a French Press, you can still use it to brew your tanning coffee as long as you can add enough coffee grounds to brew extra strong coffee.;
, You can add more coffee if you want to brew a stronger cup of coffee. The stronger your coffee, the richer the color.Choose caffeinated coffee so that your lotion will also improve the look of your cellulite.
You can use a medium or dark roast, though dark roast will result in a darker color.
If you don’t feel like measuring, you can fill the filter with enough coffee to make a whole pot, but only add enough water to brew one cup.

, Turn on your coffee maker and allow it to process. As soon as the drip finishes, turn off your machine so that the warming plate under the pot will not keep your coffee hot.

, Pour the coffee into the mixing bowl and stir. Continue stirring until the color of the lotion reaches an even consistency. It should reach a dark beige or light brown color, depending on how strong your coffee was., Great storage options include the bottle that the lotion came in, a bottle that you’ve saved, a jar, or a food storage container. To make it easier to use, choose a container that allows you to easily dispense the lotion.


Make sure that your container is clean.
If you don’t have a container that holds all of the tanning lotion, you can split it into multiple containers.

, Use the lotion as you would a self-tanner or body lotion. Allow it to completely dry before getting dressed again. Your tan should immediately show on your skin.Quickly wash your hands after you use your lotion so that they aren’t darker than the rest of your body. Since they are in contact with more of the lotion, they may absorb more color.
Your tan may wash off the next time you shower or go swimming.

, To maintain your tan, use the lotion every day after you take your shower.


You can store your tanning lotion in the bathroom if you go through it quickly. If you’re concerned about shelf-life, store your lotion in the fridge.
If you’re unhappy with the color, you can adjust the amount of coffee you use the next time you make tanning lotion.

, Look for products that contain green tea, copper, and Vitamin C, such as topical Vitamin C cream from your dermatologist. These antioxidants will reduce any skin inflammation, decrease redness, and promote healing.You can also make your own antioxidant salve by steeping a pot of black or green tea and letting it cool in the refrigerator before applying it to your skin with a compress, in a spray bottle, or by pressing the tea bag directly on your skin. The tannic acids that occur naturally in tea are a great remedy for sun damaged skin.According to the American Academy of Dermatologists, topical green tea can inhibit the growth of cancerous cells on the skin., Over-the-counter products that contain Retinol A can help to normalize sun damaged cells. They also plump up your skin’s topmost layer, revive the collagen and elastin in your skin, increase blood flow to the skin, and help to slough off any dull or dead skin cells.


As the retinol in these products gradually convert into retinoic acid, which is the active ingredient in prescription creams, they are less potent and have more subtle results than other options. Expect to wait 12 weeks to see any visible results or improvements.Your dermatologist can also prescribe products that contain Retinol A, such as tretinoin (brands include Atralin, Avita, Retin-A, Retin-A Micro, Renova), tazarotene (Avage, Tazorac), and adapalene (Differin).

, The buildup of dead skin can make your skin look blotchy and uneven, especially if it has sun damage. The remnants of self-tanning products can also collect in typically dry areas, like the elbows and knees, causing your skin to lose its natural luster. So it’s important to remove these dead skin cells.To create a homemade remedy, mix 2-3 cups of oats into your bath to soothe sunburned or sun damaged skin. You can also dissolve ¾ cup of baking soda into a warm bath to cool your skin and keep it from drying out.You can also apply a paste of turmeric powder and milk to your skin to counter the more visible signs of sun damage. Mix together three parts milk with one part turmeric powder to create a paste and apply it all over your face and body. Let it dry and rub it off in circular motions before rinsing away the residue., Don’t use a product with benzoyl peroxide or any kind of acid on your face, even to treat acne. Many companies make products for sensitive skin, so look for sensitive skin or mild products to treat sun damage.

, The dermatologist can prescribe several topical remedies and also screen you for skin cancer.


Frequent checks are a great way to detect skin cancer early so it can be properly removed and treated.Always get any moles that take on “A,B,C,D” symptoms with your dermatologist. “A,B,C,D” symptoms mean the mole is asymmetry, has border irregularity, has changed color or has a diameter greater than five millimeters. These are all warning signs of a possibly cancerous lesion., Microdermabrasion uses exfoliation to help slough away the top layer of your skin to give it a healthier glow and increase cell turnover. You can get microdermabrasion done at your dermatologist office, but an at-home kit or product that uses micro beads to exfoliate your skin, can also work as well, for a quarter of the price.


Look for kits with serums or creams that are still gentle or soothing on your skin., In this procedure, a chemical solution is applied to your skin, which makes it blister and eventually peel off. The newly exfoliated skin will be smoother, less wrinkled, and have lightened brown spots. It will also appear firmer as the peel stimulates collagen production in the skin.


A chemical peel will use the mildest form of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), retinoic acid, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), or for the deepest peel, phenol.
Chemical peels rarely result in any serious complications, but there can be side effects like scarring, infection, swelling, stinging, changes in skin tone, and cold sore outbreaks.
The deeper the peel, the more redness, crusting, and peeling will appear on your skin, and the longer your recovery will be, possibly up to a couple of weeks.
You will need to avoid any exposure to the sun for several months after the peel as the new skin will be fragile.

, Sculptra is a biodegradable diluted mixture of polylactic acid and sterile water that is injected into the skin. It triggers your body to produce collagen and is often used to help restructure and add volume to hollow, fat-deficient areas of the face caused by too much sun.


The results of Sculptra can last up to two years.
Sculptra requires a series of treatments and improvements to your skin will be gradual and subtle, so this option requires patience and can be expensive.
Keep in mind that other injections like Botox do nothing to counter sun damage.

, Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are electronic light sources, and some home units are available. Begin with a low energy LED called the Tanda, which can help promote collagen production, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and improve acne.

, Professional laser treatments can improve everything from blotchiness and discoloration to wrinkles.Photodynamic therapy - laser or intense pulsed light (IPL), used in combination with a topical solution known as Levulan (aminolevulinic acid) - can remove scaly patches of actinic keratosis from your skin.

, Skin lighteners contain an active ingredient or combination of ingredients that reduce the amount of melanin in your skin. Skin bleaching is a cosmetic treatment that reduces skin discoloration and evens out your skin tone. Both products can be purchased over-the-counter or by prescription, but lightening and bleaching your skin with these products can lead to mercury poisoning, as they both contain mercury.The most widely used ingredient in skin lighteners sold in the U.S. is hydroquinone, which is regulated for use by the FDA. Over-the-counter skin lighteners can contain up to 2% hydroquinone and your dermatologist can write you a prescription for a lightener that contains 4-6% hydroquinone.
Always check with your doctor before using products with hydroquinone or any skin lighteners or bleachers.
Prolonged use of skin lighteners and bleachers can lead to premature aging of your skin, a higher risk of skin cancer, skin infections, allergic reactions, and an untreatable skin discoloration called ochronosis.

, Look for a non-greasy, non-comedogenic (won't clog pores) moisturizer with SPF.


Use a sunscreen with substantial SPF (30 and higher), as lower SPF levels will not provide enough protection from UVA/UVB rays.

, Suggested reapplying times can usually be found on the product you are using however most dermatologists stress the importance of reapplying sunscreen every 30-40 minutes.


Obviously, your skin type will affect how often you need to reapply, as fairer skinned people need to reapply quite often.

, The sun's rays dry out your skin, leaving it deprived of the vital nutrients needed for cell repair.


Aloe vera is a good moisturizing option, as it soothes and heals sun burns, as well as products that contain Vitamin E.
You can also use home remedies like a cucumber and milk paste, or yoghurt. Applying either product will help to minimize the flaking that happens as a result of a sunburn or sun damage., If you are sunburned, you should not be in the sun for prolonged periods of time until your skin is fully healed. If you must go out, be sure to use a high SPF sunscreen.

, Even if they have SPF, it will likely be too low to be of any help to your skin. Also, most of these products speed up burning, rather than tanning, and will not improve your sun damaged skin.

Use a sunless tanner removal product.",How to Remove Sunless Tanner from Skin1," In most cases, moisture will help you retain your sunless color. However, baby oil has the opposite effect and will loosen the skin cells pigmented with sunless tanner. Using a baby oil treatment can tone down or completely remove self-tanner without harming your skin.


Soak your skin in baby oil and leave it on for ten minutes. Then hop in the shower and gently scrub your skin with a loofah to remove the color. Repeat the process if necessary.;
, Exfoliation is one of the most effective ways to remove and smooth sunless tanner. By pairing exfoliation mitts with the acidity of lemon juice, you can break up and lift off the color from your skin.


Spread lemon juice on the part(s) of your body where you want to remove sunless tanner with a cotton pad or ball. After you’ve finished this, put on your exfoliator mitts and hop in the shower.

Give up sunbathing and tanning.",How to Restore Skin Health After Tanning," Use moisturizer liberally on the sunburned area of skin to cool, soothe, and start to restore your damaged skin. Moisturizer won’t heal a sunburn, but it will calm irritation and make you feel better.Try a moisturizer with aloe vera, which has natural soothing properties. A cream or gel with hydrocortisone can also help, as it reduces swelling and inflammation and relieves pain.
Reapply the moisturizer or other cream often, several times per day.
Drink plenty of water as well. Sun exposure causes fluid loss through the skin, so replenish your body’s fluids.;
, Sunburns are uncomfortable — stinging, itchy, or both. Try to find other ways besides skin creams to relieve this discomfort. Compresses, baths or showers, and pain medication can all work.Take cool showers or baths to cool your skin. You can also apply a cool compress to the area, like a damp washcloth or towel. Avoid alcohol and products containing alcohol, however, which can dry out the skin.
Consider over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen to control pain, as well, until the soreness and swelling subside. Ibuprofen in particular will reduce the inflammation in the skin that is causing the pain. Tylenol may also be appropriate, but it will likely not be as effective.
For itching, dab some calamine lotion on the affected area and repeat as needed. If you are allergic to lidocaine, avoid any topical pain relievers with “-caine” in the name (like benzocaine), as they may cause allergic reactions.

, Your skin may blister and then peel away after a sunburn, depending on the severity of the burn. Don’t be tempted to intervene in this process — it’s our body’s natural way of dealing with damaged skin. In fact, picking and peeling skin can slow the healing process rather than help it.Don’t pick or pop blisters. Blisters are a protective barrier that your body forms, and popping them can cause infections and slow your healing.
Instead, cover any blisters with gauze — you can wet the gauze with water first to make it more comfortable on the blister. If they break, wash them with soap and warm water, apply a disinfectant cream, and cover them with a wet bandage.
Your outer, damaged skin may peel away as you heal. Let it be. Do continue to apply moisturizer frequently, though.

, Retinoid creams are made from vitamin A and usually applied topically to the skin, like Retin-A, Tazorac, Renova, and others. When used in this way, they help you to shed old skin cells and partly restore damaged collagen. Look for them in local pharmacies or ask your dermatologist to recommend one.Be aware that retinoids can make your skin itchy, dry, or scaly. Use them together with a good moisturizer.
Topical retinoids can also make your skin more vulnerable to burning, so be sure to combine them with a strong sunscreen (at least SPF 30) and also protective clothing when outdoors.

, Laser treatments will “resurface” your skin to remove outer, damaged layers and allow the underlying layers to grow in their place and heal. It can remove mottled patches and wrinkles caused by sun damage and also stimulate new collagen growth, improving the appearance of leathery skin.Talk to a board-certified dermatologist about your options. She may recommend “ablative” laser treatment, which is more aggressive and will take a few months to heal — but, the effect can be more pronounced.
There is a second type of “non-ablative” laser treatment. This procedure carries less risk and offers a more subtle effect. You may also have to repeat the process several times to see results.

, Chemical peels and dermabrasion are two other ways to renew your skin and to lessen the effects of long-term sun damage. Both involve removing the top layers of your skin and stimulating underlying layers to grow, ideally leading to new, tighter, and younger-looking skin. Talk to a dermatologist about these procedures to see which might work for you.In a chemical peel, a doctor will remove the top layers of your sun-damaged skin with a weak acid. The idea, as in laser treatment, is to encourage the growth of new and younger looking skin cells for smoother skin.
Dermabrasion works the same way, but uses an abrasive brush rather than acid. You can get deep dermabrasion or lighter microdermabrasion, which only removes the top-most layer of skin.
Be aware that both of these procedures can cause discomfort, redness, or swelling and may take some time to heal. They are often expensive and generally not covered by insurance because they are considered cosmetic-only procedures, not medically necessary procedures.

, To prevent more damage to your skin, take basic precautions whenever you go outside. These practices won’t restore your skin to its original condition, but they will keep you from making the situation worse. Your first basic line of defense should be a strong sunscreen.Apply sunscreen liberally whenever you go outside. You should put it on whether or not it is sunny, on all exposed skin.
Use SPF 30 or higher. Give the sunscreen at least 30 minutes to absorb into your skin and reapply it every two hours or after going swimming or sweating heavily.

, Try to limit your other exposure to direct sunlight, as well. The less total sunlight your skin absorbs, the less damage it will have over the long-term. Use clothing, hats, umbrellas, shade, sunglasses, and other wear for the best protection.Favor loose-fitting garments made from tightly woven fabric, as these offer better protection. Dark colors and dry garments also protect better than light colors and wet clothing.
Don a hat — ideally, a wide-brimmed hat — and sunglasses. Try to get sunglasses that block 99% or more of UV and UVB rays.
Use shade to your advantage. Also try to do your outdoor activities when the sunlight is not direct, either in the morning or in the later afternoon and evening.

, One of the worst things you can do to your skin is expose it to direct UV light through sunbathing and tanning. You may have already noticed skin damage from your tanning. In the long run, overexposure to the sun can reduce your skin’s elasticity, create blemishes, and make the skin appear leathery. It also puts you at an elevated risk for skin cancer.Avoid tanning outdoors. Sunscreen will not “counteract” the harmful UV rays.
Indoor tanning rooms and beds are just as harmful to your skin as natural sunlight. In fact, they can actually produce more concentrated UV rays.
If you want a tan, opt for an artificial spray-on or rub-on tan. It is much safer and kinder to your skin.

Wash your hands before applying eye makeup.,
When trying on makeup at beauty stores, use new disposable applicators only.,
Do not apply makeup while in motion.,
Choose eye makeup that is right for your sensitivities and skin type.,
Be savvy about what you're using.",How to Apply Eye Cosmetics Safely1," Your hands are another potential source of transferring germs to your eye area.


Remember that fingers harbor bacteria too. If using your fingers to apply cosmetics to the eyes, make sure to wash them well beforehand.





;
, Using non-disposable ones intended for reuse risks transferring germs and bacteria onto your eyes.

, For example, do not apply makeup when driving, as this can lead to eye injuries such as a corneal scratch (which can lead to infection). Applying eye makeup when in motion also risks stabbing your eye with the applicator, which can cause serious damage.

, Getting the eye makeup matched to your individual needs is important––avoid using products just because a friend does or because your favorite movie star is advertising them. You must choose according to your own needs and sensitivities.

If you have sensitive skin, it is recommended that you use makeup labeled ""hypo-allergenic"", ""fragrance free"" or "" for sensitive skin"". This should help to reduce the chance of experiencing an allergic reaction. However, be aware that even these labels don't necessarily mean that you won't have a reaction––you may need to test different brands or even discuss your reactions with a dermatologist or eye care specialist.
It is highly recommended that you avoid using anything considered to be “multi purpose make-up”. This refers to makeup such as color sticks intended for use as lip color, blush and eyeshadow. This type of makeup is a sure-fire way to introduce bacteria from your mouth and nasal region direct to your eyes, where the infection can be end up being much more severe.
Do not use eyeliner on the inner lids; to do so is to give the makeup direct access to your eye, increasing the chances for infection or allergic reactions.Avoid glittery and iridescent products. As pretty as these seem, they can scratch and irritate your eye, leading you to rub them and potentially spread infection. Once in a blue moon might be okay but don't use this type of makeup regularly., Not all eye makeup is made equal––the more ingredients that you don't know about, the more wary you should be about the product. Seek products that carry a full disclosure of their contents and that certify that the ingredients used are non-toxic and not harmful with long-term use. If your current eye makeup lacks this information, do some online research. One reliable source to find such information is the Cosmetics Database found at: http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com. This site can tell you which ingredients in eye cosmetics and makeup removers contain ingredients that are thought to be harmful to your health.Be very careful if using ""natural"" or ""preservative-free"" cosmetics. Without any preservative, bacteria will thrive. Such products should be stored somewhere cold, perhaps the refrigerator, and used quickly. Read the labels carefully to check for other storage directions."

, Spray tans affect the top layer of your skin. The best way to remove the tan is take off the top layer of dead skin. The point of an exfoliant is to remove the dead skin, so it can also take off the tan.In the shower, get your skin wet. Rub the exfoliant in with a shower loofah or your hand.

If you're trying to correct a mistake like streaks, you can apply more spray tanner after exfoliating to lessen the streaking effect.

Moisturize your skin.",How to Remove Sunless Tanner from Skin2," Certain areas of skin such as your elbows, hands, knees, and ankles soak up more self-tanner than others. You may need to tone down or smooth out the color and a simple exfoliating wipe can do this without completely removing the color.Get exfoliating wipes at any pharmacy, large retailer, or specialty cosmetics store. You may want to choose one for sensitive skin so that you don’t rub your skin raw.
Rub the area on which you want to smooth in a gentle motion. This can help ensure that you don’t harm your skin or remove too much of the self-tanner. Check the area occasionally to make sure that you’re not rubbing off too much self-tanner.
Consider trying baby wipes, too. Although not all of them work for sunless tanner, some do and have a pleasant scent, too., Streaks of sunless tanner can develop when you don’t apply enough product or miss a spot during application. Using a sugar-based exfoliator can gently even out the color of your skin.Find a sugar-based exfoliator by reading package labels. Sugar is a common product in many exfoliators and you may notice that it has a gritty texture. You can get these products at many large retailers, pharmacies, and cosmetics stores.
Apply a generous amount of the product to your skin and lightly rub it to remove the sunless tanner. After 30 seconds to a minute, rinse off the exfoliator with warm water and check to see if the color is even. If not, repeat the application until you reach the desired color.

, Lemon is a natural exfoliator and can lighten your skin, too. If you have a few streaks or spots you want to remove, cut a lemon and gently massage it on your skin.Rub the spot for two to three minutes. Check the spot and see if your streak is lighter. If not, repeat the process until the streak is the same color as the surrounding skin.

, It may sound unusual to use acetone, which is nail polish remover, to smooth out self-tanner streaks. But applying a bit to the streaks you want to smooth out can quickly and effectively hide any mistakes and streaks.Make sure to get an acetone polish remover by reading the packaging label. Non-acetone polishes may not smooth or remove self-tanner streaks. You can easily get acetone polishes at pharmacies, large retailers, and specialty cosmetics stores.
Soak a cotton ball or pad with acetone and rub it into the area you want to smooth. Check every few seconds to see if the spot is smoothed. If not, continue to rub the area with acetone until you smooth out the streak.
Be aware that acetone can cause serious harm if you ingest it by drinking. It is safe to use on your skin, but rinse off acetone if it burns your skin or causes any discomfort., Depilatory, or hair-removal, creams may also seem like an unusual way to smooth out streaks, but it also can gently take down the color of mistakes. Applying a hair remover cream for half the recommended time may quickly and gently remove color to smooth out streaks.Dab a small about of hair remover cream onto a cotton swamp. Gently apply this to the streak and leave it on for half of the application recommended time. Rinse off the product with warm water and check the color. If necessary, repeat the process until the streak matches the surrounding skin.
Avoid leaving the hair remover on for the whole application time suggested on the packaging. This can completely remove the tanner and cause a white streak.

, Hands and fingers are one of the areas most prone to getting streaks of sunless tanner. Applying a dab of whitening toothpaste to them has the same effect as it does on your teeth—it lifts stains. Try rubbing a thin layer of whitening toothpaste to any areas on which you want to smooth out the color. Consider trying a whitening toothpaste that also has baking soda and peroxide, which may help to boost the effect of the product., Streaks or splotches are often the result of dry skin patches. This is especially true on areas such as the hands, elbows, feet, and ankles. You can easily remedy this by using moisturizer to your benefit with an exfoliator.


Exfoliate the areas you want to lighten or smooth out. Check the spot after a minute to see how much of the sunless tanner you’ve removed. When you think you’ve blended out the streak, moisturize the spot.
Prevent these types of streaks and splotches by moisturizing your hands, feet, ankles, and elbows before you apply sunless tanner. This can keep the areas from absorbing too much product."

, This avoids the scorching peak hours and is recommended by the American Cancer Society for the safest tanning.This is especially important if you have fair skin or are just starting to tan.
It takes a bit longer to tan in these hours, but it is much safer, and the extra time outside will be worth it.

, A sunscreen’s Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, is a measure of how much UV light the lotion blocks. SPF doesn't stop you from getting a tan, but it prevents you from burning and blocks some of the dangerous UV. This makes it an essential part of your tanning regimen.SPF 30 sunscreen blocks around 97% of UVB rays.Sunscreens above SPF 30 (such as SPF 100) have a negligible effect on UV absorption. Most dermatologists believe that SPF 30 is more than enough.

, Your eyes can be easily damaged by the sun if you are not careful. Protect your vision with sunglasses that offer UV protection. This should be advertised with a sticker on the front of the lenses., All these do is greatly increase the chance that you will burn, which in turn increases the risks of skin cancer. A gentle, slowly built bronzing is the safest way to get a good suntan. Tanning pills, which contain beta-carotin, are known to be dangerous to your liver and eye-sight and are not FDA approved., When skin is exposed to sunlight, melanin is created by special skin cells. Melanin is a dark colored pigment that absorbs UV light to protect your skin from damage by the sun. This is why pale skin burns more easily–their skin has less melanin to absorb the UV.UV light still passes through clouds, meaning you can still get burned on overcast days, especially if you are fair skinned and out for long periods of time., Once you’ve applied sunscreen, step out into the sun and start tanning. Know, however, that sunscreen usually loses its potency after 30 minutes and will need to be reapplied.


You need to think about gradual tanning, not immediate gains, to stay safe.
Note that the sun is extra strong around 12 o'clock PM because the rays hit the earth at a 90° angle. You should not stay out as long during the midday sun or you'll risk burning., After 20 minutes or so, put on a new layer of sunscreen and flip to your other side to tan your whole body. For example, if you are lying on your back at first, roll to your stomach after a short period of tanning.

, Sunscreen needs to be reapplied frequently in order to be effective. Even waterproof lotions will lose some potency after a swim, so dry off and reapply the sunscreen to prevent burning and skin damage.


Remember—sunscreen just protects your skin; it does not prevent you from getting tanned.

, Always bring a full water bottle with you while you tan, and drink constantly. Water keeps your skin cells healthy, which can prevent damage done by the sun.

, As your skin darkens, you can potentially tan more often, but serious diseases like melanoma are not worth the temporary-tanned look. If you have naturally pale skin, you may not want to tan for more than 30-40 minutes taking breaks halfway through.


Start tanning for 15-20 minutes, increasing your time in the sun by 5-10 minutes as your skin darkens. You can generally increase the amount of time you're tanning every 1-2 weeks.

, These are the first signs of a burn. While there is a myth that you will appear tan after the burn disappears, in reality the skin will peel off painfully and leave you red, not tan. If you feel pain, get inside or find shade immediately.


Apply a moisturizing lotion when you get to the shade. This will help keep your skin healthy and prevent some of the damage of the burn. Gels with aloe are particularly popular., While many people prefer the look of a natural tan, you can protect your skin by supplementing time in the sun with a gentle bronzer. This way, you get the shade you want while still protecting your skin. In general, the safest way to get a deep tan is to supplement your outdoor work with a moisturizing bronzer.


Tan extenders are generally considered safe, but only those containing dihydroxyacetone (DHA) have been FDA approved., If you are fair-skinned and freckled, you cannot get a deep tan safely. This is just the unfortunate reality of pale skin types. If your skin is light, you burn easily, or just can't seem to get tan, you should learn to love the skin you have instead of risking your health. Fair skin is just as beautiful as tanned, and you should take care of yourself before running out into the dangerous UV rays., This is one of the most dangerous, baseless myths of suntanning. You do not need to burn to ""kickstart"" your tan. In fact, all burning does is damage your skin, making it leathery and potentially leading to skin cancer.


Getting burned five or more time doubles your risk of developing melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer., This will help your skin stay healthy and promote even flaking of the dead, burned skin. Apply it 3-5 times a day, or whenever you face extreme discomfort.


Creams with vitamins E and C may help prevent some skin damage., Staying hydrated will help your body whisk away the waste and by-products of dead skin cells. Make sure you are constantly sipping on some cool water to help yourself heal., Ibuprofen, found in Advil, will decrease pain and swelling, which can actually prevent some of the long-term damage of a burn. Try and get ahead of the pain -- if you notice some painful pink at the beach, pop a few as soon as you can with a big glass of cold water., Repeat every 10-15 minutes. This can help keep the dead skin wet, which will prevent it from drying and cracking off painfully., Your skin will slough off naturally, and blisters contain healthy oils and liquids needed for your skin to heal. Keep moisturizing, drinking water, and taking care of the pain with ibuprofen and the dead skin and blisters will heal themselves.

, The best way to fight skin cancer is to be proactive. You want to look out for any dark new splotches or blemishes, often when in the shower or in the mirror. Check your moles as well -- are they growing? Are they changing color or shape? If you have any of the following symptoms or any large black spots, see a doctor or dermatologist immediately.


Skin cancer is very treatable when caught early on. Always err on the side of caution when if you see something worrisome."

Care for your makeup.,
Store your eye cosmetics with a view to preventing spoilage.,
Replace brushes and sponges regularly.,
Avoid sharing any eye makeup with other users.",How to Apply Eye Cosmetics Safely2," Poorly maintained eye makeup can harbor bacteria and fungi. If shared, it may also be a source of transferring viruses and other infections. Good care for your eye makeup includes:

Keep all brushes and applicators cleaned on a regular basis.
Replace eye makeup that hasn't been used every three to six months.
Avoid trying to make eye makeup go further by the addition of other substances––you risk creating unknown reactions, such as allergies or rashes.
Close make-up containers tightly after using them each day. This keeps the product in a good, safe condition for a longer period of time.
Keep eyeliner pencils sharp; this helps to avoid digging into or scratching at your eyes., Store in a cool, dry and dark place away from direct sunlight. Keep your cosmetics away from extreme heat or cold, as these extremes tend to break down the preservatives and can speed up bacterial growth. Keep eye cosmetics out of your hot steamy bathroom and other humid areas––the damp heat breaks down the preservatives and the moisture provides a happy place for bacteria to live., It is recommended that you replace these items every two to three months. This vigilance will help to thwart the spread of infections like ringworm, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and sties.

, You can never be sure what infections might be transferred this way––the person sharing with you may not even be aware that she or he has an infection. It is not an indication of lacking trust––it's common sense and good precaution."

Wipe off any excess spray tan on your palms.,
Try a whitening toothpaste.,
Use acetone.",How to Remove Spray Tan2," Also wipe around your nails. Doing so immediately after applying the tanning product will keep it from tanning those areas as much.


Tanning spray is a problem if it pools around your palms and nails. You don't want your nails or palms to be colored by the spray, as they are naturally lighter than the rest of your body. Mostly, you want to avoid spraying in that area, but you do need to spray your hands, which can lead to your nails or palms getting sprayed.

, If the damage is already down, use a whitening toothpaste on your nails and palms.Choose a clean toothbrush used specifically for this purpose. Put some toothpaste on the brush. Scrub into your palms and around your nails. Rub in gentle circles, but don't rub too hard.
Wash off the toothpaste. You should have removed some of the spray tan.

, You can use the acetone in nail polish remover to remove the stains from your nails. Simply apply as you normally would: rub the remover on with a cotton ball in circular motions. Rinse your hands afterwards."

If the stain is in upholstery, use a sopping washcloth to flush out the stain. Hold the sopping washcloth to the stain, letting it soak in.

, Mix a small amount of dish detergent with warm water. A couple of drops should be sufficient., Wet a washcloth or sponge, and soak up the soapy water., Use the cloth to dab at the stain. Don't rub the stain. Instead, let the moisture in the sponge soak into it., Use a washcloth or sponge soaked in clean, warm water to remove the soap from the fabric.If the stain is on your clothing, throw the item into the washer afterwards.

Assess your skin color when you wake up in the morning.",How to Remove Self Tanner," If your tan is even but too deep or orange-colored, then your removal method will be a little different than if you are dealing with streaks. We'll cover overall tone in the next section if your self-tanner has left you looking less ""ooh la la!"" and more ""oompa loompa."" But for now let's concentrate on those patches and unfortunate streaks.;
, It purportedly gets rid of freckles, right? If it can get rid of permanent marks on your skin, it can definitely get rid of temporary self-tanner. It's best for that random streak, on your palms, or little places you just got a little over-zealous with. There are two ways you can get your lemon on:


Combine a couple tablespoons of lemon juice with baking soda to form a paste. Slather it over the affected area, leave it on for a few minutes, and wash it off while gently rubbing.
Cut the lemon in half and rub one section over the affected area. If it's really bad, it may take more than once, but you should see improvements just about automatically.

, Those little crevices between your fingers? A self-tanner's nightmare. To get at those little pesky nooks and crannies, try whitening toothpaste. It has the same bleaching agents in it as everything else, which work on your teeth and skin.


This obviously works best for small, confined areas. Put a dab on your finger and massage it into the area. Scrub it off and assess your results, repeating if necessary.

, Acetone is known as nail polish remover, by the way. Take your cotton ball, saturate it, and rub it over the area. Use this method sparingly, however; the stuff can be quite hard on your skin if used unyieldingly.


If you do go this route, be sure to moisturize afterward. Your body will be craving the hydration after being exposed to either of those two products.

, Choose a time when you are free to soak for at least 1 hour. The more recently you put on your self-tanner, the better; it's a bit harder to take off when it's set. Consider this an excuse for an hour of me time!


This part is totally optional. Soaking for longer can loosen your self-tanner's jaws, but exfoliates and toners work by themselves, too.

, If you don't have one, you can make one yourself! The sugar beads lift up your top layer of skin, greatly reducing that unfortunate color you've acquired. And it leaves your skin silky smooth!


Use an exfoliating mitt to expedite the process and double your efficacy. A pumice stone is generally to hard on your skin, so it's best to stick to the mitt or your loofah.
Then apply a gradual self-tanner, if you'd like. You know, one of the kinds that is purposefully slow-going. It can help even out what's left of your original experience.

, The longer you can keep it on the better, but aim for at least 10 minutes. 30 if you can tolerate the boredom of just standing there! This is a good method if you're just too dark or too orange, as it will reduce the difference between your natural tone and your tanned tone overall.

, These will be your biggest priorities, since they can't be easily covered with clothing. They are also resilient areas that are not prone to irritation when a toner is used.


If you have a toner with alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), use it. These acids tend to be very effective at correcting skin discoloration.

, Yep, there's definitely such a thing and they generally cost around $15. They come in the forms of pads or creams and are pretty self-explanatory.


They'll be effective, but not necessarily any more so than the stuff you already have in your bathroom/kitchen. Only shell out the bills if for some reason you feel compelled to.

, You should notice significant improvement, but if you still see some discoloration or streaks, continue with regular baths, baking soda scrubs and lemon juice and toner applications. No self-tanner is that permanent; it'll just take some diligence!

Sun exposure increases fluid loss and dehydration in skin, so it is important to replenish the lost fluids in your body after a sunburn.


You can also try drinking some unsweetened ice tea. The antioxidants in green and black tea may help repair free radical damage from the sun.;
, Spending time outdoors without protecting your already damaged skin will increase the risk of peeling, and worsen your burn. This is because the outer protective dead skin cell layer is damaged, so more harmful UV rays will pass through this layer of skin.Wear a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher if you are going to be outside with already sun damaged skin. Also wear protective clothing and accessories (hats, sun glasses) to prevent further damage., The soothing and moisturizing properties in oatmeal can help the skin retain its natural moisture and prevent burned skin from peeling. To make an oatmeal bath, stir 1-3 cups of oatmeal into a bathtub filled with warm water. Soak in the oatmeal bath from 15-30 minutes, and rinse your body with clean water when you are finished soaking in the oatmeal.


After your oatmeal soak, apply a moisturizer to your body to further add hydration to your skin.
Consider following this remedy daily before going to bed to give your skin the best chance of not peeling after a sunburn.

, Aloe vera is a natural cactus extract that has long been hailed around the world for its soothing properties. You can buy an aloe vera lotion, pure aloe vera gel, or break open an aloe vera plant, and apply the plant juices directly to your peeling skin.The aloe vera can aid healing, fight the sunburn pain, and avoid infection.


Try looking for pure aloe vera that is 98% to 100% aloe vera to avoid feeling sticky.Consider storing the aloe vera in the refrigerator so it feels even cooler when you apply it to your skin., Apply a moisturizer to the sunburned areas of your skin. There are specially designed moisturizers to for recently sunburned skin that are available in most drugstores. Avoid moisturizers that contain alcohols, retinols, and AHAs (alpha hydroxyl acids), which can dry out and further irritate sensitive skin.Apply the moisturizer throughout the day if possible, and immediately after bathing to ensure maximum moisturizer absorption.Alternative moisturizers include baby oil, coconut oil, and honey.

, The tannic acids that occur naturally in tea are a great remedy for sun-damaged skin. Steep a pot of black tea and cool it in the refrigerator before applying it to your burned skin using a compress or spray bottle.The tea will help reduce inflammation, decrease redness and promote healing.
You can also try pressing the actual tea bags onto your skin rather than using a compress or spray bottle., A baking soda bath can help restore your skin’s pH balance and help soothe the burn irritation. Add about ¾ cup of baking soda to the bathwater, and soak for 15-20 minutes before rinsing your skin with clean water.You can also add a heaping tablespoon of baking soda to a bowl of cool water, soak a washcloth in the mixture, and the use the wrung out washcloth as a compress to treat the tender, burned areas.You will know that you’re adequately hydrated when your urine color runs pale yellow., Pour white or apple cider vinegar in a spray bottle, and mist the vinegar onto your sunburn. The vinegar can help to prevent unsightly blisters and prevent peeling.If the smell is too offensive, you can mix a solution of 1 part water and 1 part vinegar, and spray that into your skin instead.

, Soak a washcloth in cold whole milk, and wring out the excess milk. Then apply the washcloth to the sunburned area of skin and leave the cloth on your skin for 10 minutes. Then wash the area with clean water.Repeat this process 2-3 times daily until your skin is completely healed from the burn.


Milk is very beneficial to burned skin because the protein in the milk has a soothing effect, while the lactic acid can reduce irritation and itching on the burned skin.

, Mint leaves can help stop the process of peeling and instead promote skin that is smooth and healthy. To use this remedy, take fresh mint leaves and crush them in a bowl to extract their juice then apply the juice directly to the part of your face that is peeling., A balanced and nutritious diet that is high in water, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats can keep your skin healthy, and reduce the negative effects of sunburn and peeling.


Eat plenty of protein, iron, and foods that contain vitamins A, C and E. These nutrients help ensure your skin is prepared to heal from a sunburn.

, Sunburned skin often itches, but scratching or peeling away your skin will only increase tissue damage on the sunburned areas, increase peeling, and promote the risk of a skin infection.If you get the urge to scratch your sunburn, try applying an ice cube wrapped in cloth or a damp paper towel to your skin and rubbing the area in small circles to offer temporary itch relief.
If you absolutely must remove some peeled skin, do not pull on the skin, no matter how tempting it might be. Instead, use a small pair of scissors and carefully cut away that section of skin., Try bathing and showering with cool to lukewarm water, rather than using hot water. The hot water will dry out your skin and promote peeling, whereas the cooler water will feel better on your skin and reduce the likelihood of peeling.Also avoid rubbing your skin dry after bathing, as you could rub off the outermost, burned layer of your skin, causing peeling.

, Soap can be very drying to skin, and when you have a sunburn, you want your skin to stay as moisturized as possible to promote healing and prevent peeling. Keep the soap use to a minimum, being sure to avoid using it on particularly burned areas of your skin.


If you do use soap, try to refrain from using a washcloth or loofa to apply to soap. The rough surfaces of those materials may irritate your skin and encourage peeling.
Also try to avoid shaving and waxing, but if you must shave, try to use a rich, moisturizing shaving cream, gel, or lotion."

Exfoliating removes the top layers of tanned skin, revealing the new, untanned skin underneath. You can exfoliate using a body scrub (preferably one with large gritty particles, such as a salt or sugar scrub) and/or a loofah.


Exfoliate in the shower every morning, really focusing on the areas where fake tan tends to stick, such as the knees and elbows. Massage the skin with the body scrub or loofah using circular motions. Just don't scrub too hard or you might damage the skin.
Only use scrubs and loofahs on the body. Removing fake tan from the face will require a gentler exfoliator, such as a facial scrub containing fine particles or a damp washcloth.;
, Swimming can help fade sun tan and fake tan. If stubborn patches of real or fake tan remain despite your exfoliating, consider hitting your local pool. The chemicals added to the pool water, such as chlorine, will help to strip fake tan from the skin, leaving you streak free.Try to swim for at least an hour, to give the pool water enough time to do its thing. Don't just splash around, do as many lengths of the pool as you can throughout the hour. This will provide a great cardio workout! Two bird, one stone.

, Hair removal creams can be used to remove particularly resistant patches of fake tan. This is due to the fact that hair removal creams contain chemicals that break down substances in the fake tan, allowing it to be easily wiped away. All you need to do is apply a light layer of the hair removal cream to the patchy or streaky tan you want to remove, let it sit for about ten seconds, then wipe it away with a cleansing wipe or damp towel.Obviously the main use of these creams is to remove hair, so don't use this technique on any areas of the body where you may wish to keep your hair -- such as arms.
People with sensitive skin may not react well to these creams, so do a patch test on a small area of skin, such as on your wrist, before applying it all over. Hair removal creams designed for the body should never be used on the face.

, Hitting the steam room can be a very effective way of removing fake tan, as the hot steam causes pores on the skin to open up, releasing the tanning product. Try to sit in the steam room for at least 20 to 30 minutes, then immediately rub down your skin with a damp towel once you come out.The removed fake tan should be visible on the towel, so you may want to use an old one.

, Many good fake tan brands also produce products designed to help remove the tan when you're done. These come in a range of forms such as body scrubs, tan removal wipes and bath oils and can be very effective, particularly when used to remove fake tan produced by the same brand. Follow the instructions on the label for details on how to use specific products.


Depending on the brand, these products can be a little on the pricey side but are worth the investment if you need to get your tan off in a hurry!

, There are certain things you can do before applying fake take to ensure that it fades evenly, without leaving patchiness or streaks. The main thing you need to do is ensure that your skin is well exfoliated and moisturized before applying the tan. This prevents the tan from getting trapped in dry patches of skin. You should begin this prep work 2 to 3 days before applying your tan.


You can make an extremely effective exfoliator at home by mixing a little lemon or lime juice with some baking soda. Pour this mixture onto a new sponge and heat in the microwave for two minutes before using it to scrub all over your body. Do this once a day, in the 2 to 3 days before tanning.Moisturize with a rich moisturizer after each exfoliation, but never moisturize on the day you apply the tan as the moisturizer will dilute the tanning product and cause streaks.
Remember that cheaper tanning products are more likely to cause streaks and to fade unevenly than more expensive brands. However, some tanning products will just not react well with your skin type, so shop around to find one that works well for you.

, Unfortunately there's not a huge amount you can do to remove a natural tan in a hurry, but you can prevent the tan from becoming any darker by wearing sunscreen. In fact, if you want to keep your skin light in color and free from sun damage, you should be wearing sunscreen every day, all year round.


Liberally apply a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 all over the body, 30 minutes before sun exposure.
You should use a separate sunscreen for your face, potentially one with an even higher SPF. Look for the word ""non-comedogenic"" on the label -- this means that it will not clog your pores.

, Similarly to wearing sunscreen, covering your skin with light layers will prevent your tan from developing even further and protect it from sun damage. If you're living or staying somewhere very hot, try wearing light, breathable materials -- such as cotton -- in loose, airy styles.


Protect your face by wearing sunhats or baseball caps and sunglasses, or by carrying a parasol during the hottest hours of the day.

, In addition to removing fake tan, exfoliating your skin will also help to fade natural tan by sloughing off the top layers of dead skin, leaving fresh new skin behind. Exfoliate in the shower using a body scrub and loofah, at least once a week, using gentle circular motions.


Use a separate facial scrub for exfoliating the skin on your face, or use a clean washcloth soaked in warm water to gently massage the skin.

, It may be possible to use skin lightening or bleaching products to remove tan on small areas of skin, but be aware that these products are usually reserved for discolorations and dark spots caused by sun damage, and it is important that you consult with your doctor before use. Skin lightening creams work by reducing the amount of melanin in your skin. The more melanin pigment your skin contains, the darker your skin will be.


Skin lightening creams are available over-the-counter and by prescription. The safest, most effective lightening creams usually contain either steroids or retinoic acid (a form of vitamin A) as their active ingredient. Other creams use natural ingredients such as arbutin, kojic acid and azelaic acid.
Hydroquinone is the active ingredient in a number of effective skin lightening products, available over-the-counter and (in stronger percentages) by prescription in the US. However, hydroquinone has been banned in many European and Asian countries due to links with cancer, so consult with your doctor before using.
Mercury is the active ingredient in some skin lighteners made in Asia. The use of such products can lead to mercury poisoning, which can have very serious side effects, including the death of unborn children. The sale of mercury products is banned in the U.S., however be sure to check the labels of all skin lightening products before using, just to be safe., Keeping your skin well hydrated encourages this important organ to work at full capacity, increasing cell turnover and allowing skin to rejuvenate itself. These processes will help a natural tan to fade more quickly. You can hydrate your skin internally, by drinking plenty of water and eating fresh fruit and vegetables, or externally, by regularly applying a rich moisturizer (preferably one with natural fruit acids to aid with tan removal) all over the body.

, This mask works wonders to brighten skin and reduce facial tan, when used on a regular basis. Simply mix two tablespoons of gram powder with 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric powder, the juice from half a lemon and a drop of milk to form a thick paste.Apply this mixture all over the face and neck and leave to sit for 15 minutes before rinsing off with lukewarm water. For best results, apply this mask once every two days.
If you have oily skin that's prone to breakouts, you can replace the drop of milk with a little rosewater.

, The citric acid contained in lemon juice is an effective skin lightener, and can be used to fade or remove both natural and fake tans, particularly from stubborn areas such as hands and feet. Juice three or four lemons and dilute the juice in a basin full of warm water. Allow hands and/or feet to soak in the lemon infused water for 15 to 20 minutes.


Lemon juice can be quite drying, so be sure to moisturize hands and feet with a rich moisturizer after using this treatment.
Undiluted lemon juice can also be applied directly to tough tan-stained areas like elbows and knees and left to sit for 15 minutes before rinsing off.
Lime juice or, at a push, orange juice can replace the lemon juice in this treatment, as they both contain a certain amount of citric acid.

, Raw potato contains quantities of vitamin C, which is used in many skin lightening treatments. Some people claim to have successfully lightened tanned skin by rubbing the juice from a raw potato on the darker areas.


Simply cut a raw potato in half and rub the exposed, moist flesh on the tanned skin. Repeat as often as possible, until you begin to see results.
Tomatoes and cucumbers, which also contain high quantities of vitamin C, can also be rubbed on the skin to produce the same effect.

, It is surprisingly easy to make a great homemade exfoliator with added tan fading benefits from natural ingredients in your kitchen. Simply mix a cup of crushed sugar with some high quality olive oil and a little freshly squeezed lime juice.The sugar will slough off dead skin, the lime juice will lighten the skin and the olive oil will add moisture.
Rub this mixture all over the body with clean towel or washcloth dampened with warm water. Wash off in the shower.

, Aloe vera is said to help fade dark tans, in addition to relieving burns and helping to heal wounds. For best results, purchase an aloe vera plant from your local garden center and use the gel-like sap directly from a broken leaf. Aloe vera is completely safe to use, with no common side effects, so you may apply it as often and as liberally as possible.


However, aloe vera may make your skin extra sensitive to sunlight, so be sure to wear sunscreen outdoors when using this treatment.


, Coconut water applied topically to the face and hands is said to fade tan while also leaving skin soft and supple. For best results, it should be applied on a daily basis, no need to rinse off.Drinking coconut water is also a great way to hydrate your skin from the inside out -- it is low in calories and provides a tasty alternative to regular water.

, Mix a tablespoon of oats with a drop of buttermilk and spread this mixture over your body, using circular motions to work it into the skin. The oats will exfoliate the skin, while the buttermilk will soothe and soften. you can also try putting on gram flour, milk, lemon juice, turmeric paste for good tan removal results."

Protect yourself from the sun indoors and in cars.",How to Protect Yourself from the Sun," You should wear sunscreen each time you go out during the day, even when it's overcast. Make sure you select a sunscreen with a strong enough sun protection factor (SPF) to protect you from UV rays.Go for a sunscreen of at least SPF 30. The SPF should be written somewhere on the sunscreen bottle.
If you have cancer, or pre-cancer, get a sunscreen with SPF 45 or higher.
Look for the words ""broad spectrum"" on the bottle. This assures you the sunscreen protects you from UVA rays in addition to UVB rays.;
, Do this each time you leave your house during the daytime when the sun is out. This is especially important if you'll be exposed to the sun for more than 30 minutes.If you have trouble remembering to apply sunscreen, try leaving yourself a note on the door before going out.

, Keep track of how long you've been outside. You should make the effort to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours so it stays effective. If you're inside all day, and go back out before the sun sets, you should also reapply sunscreen.If you've been swimming, you may want to reapply sunscreen after getting out of the water even if two hours have not yet passed.

, Many people do not realize how much sunscreen you actually need for adequate protection. You need at least 45 milliliters (1.5  fl oz) of sunscreen to cover all exposed skin on your body. This is about as much sunscreen as could fit in an average shot glass.Smooth sunscreen over rather than rubbing it.
Make sure to cover any skin that will be exposed, including skin on your back. Have someone else help you apply sunscreen if there's any spot you can't reach.

, When you're going out in the sun, especially for a long day, you should wear clothing that will block out harmful UV rays. A good way to test your clothing is to place your hand inside a garment before putting it on.Shine a light on the clothing. If you can see your hand clearly through the garment, this outfit offers little protection.
You should either choose a different outfit or apply sunscreen on the area the item covers.

, Sunglasses should be worn year-round, and not just in the summer. Make sure to check the label of a pair of sunglasses before you buy it. Any sunglasses you wear should block 99 to 100% of UVA and UVB light.If you have a purse your backpack you carry, try storing your sunglasses in there. This way, you may be more likely to remember to throw them on before leaving your home.

As long as the brim is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm), you should be protected from the sun., You should go for long-sleeved shirts and longer pants to protect yourself from the sun. Some clothing actually comes with ultraviolet protection and is marked with an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF). A UPF of at least 50 only allows one fiftieth of UVB rays to reach your skin.During warmer months, longer clothing may be uncomfortable. During these months, be extra vigilant about applying sunscreen to any exposed areas of your body.

, During these hours, the sun is at its peak. You're most likely to get skin damage during this time of day.If you're going to be out in the sun, seek shade from trees, patios, and other objects whenever possible.
You may want to limit your exposure to the sun during these hours, especially if you have sensitive skin.

, Sun is sometimes reflected off of water, snow, and sand. This means that, even in the winter, sunscreen and sun protection is important. Your chance of sunburn increases near snow, water, and sand.Make sure to take extra precautions around these terrains. Always wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and wear clothing that covers your body.

, The sun can actually cause damage, even if you're inside. Transparent window film screens can be installed to block out the sun's rays. You should also wear sunscreen, even when riding in your car or sitting by a window in your house.Remember, film screens only provide protection when windows are closed.
If you have a sunroof, avoid using it. You should also avoid driving with the roof down if you have a convertible.
Sun can also penetrate the windows in your home, leaving you exposed to UVA rays.It's a good idea to draw your blinds during peak hours or stay away from the windows. You can also wear sunscreen in your home.

Choose sunscreen protection that offers full-spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB rays.,
Choose a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) that will protect your toddler from the sun.,
Use more sunscreen for your toddler than you think you need.,
Apply sunscreen protection on your toddler with care.,
Protect your toddler from the sun by re-applying sunscreen often--about every two hours.,

UVB rays tan the skin and can prompt a sunburn. Skin cancer can result from exposure to UVB rays.
UVA rays, on the other hand, penetrate deeper than UVB rays. UVA rays damage elastin and collagen in the skin, making wrinkles and sunspots appear. These rays also affect the appearance of skin, making it appear to have sag and have a leathery texture.;
,


Choose at least SPF 15 or more if your child burns easily, but you may not need more than SPF 30. Higher SPFs offer a small amount of added sunscreen protection for your toddler but can expose your child to a higher amount of chemicals contained in the product.
Sunscreen marketed as children's versions are usually no different than those that are marketed for adults.

, Many people skimp, but for full sunscreen protection, apply sunscreen generously.


Use about 1/2 ounce of sunscreen, about enough to fill your toddler's palm, each time you apply sunscreen.

, Watch for often-missed areas such as hands, neck, tops of feet, ears and the back of their legs.


Apply a lip balm with SPF protection for your toddler's lips.

,


Apply the first layer of sunscreen about 30 minutes before you plan to be outside so the lotion can soak into your child's skin.
Apply sunscreen more often if your child is playing in water or sweating, even if the sunscreen claims to be water- or sweat-proof. Reapply after your child is towel-dried.

, If you can't avoid going outside during these times, try to spend time in the shade when possible.

Stay out of the sun during peak UV hours.,
Use broad-spectrum sunscreen any time you're in the sun.,
Wear protective clothing in the sun.,
Avoid smoking.",How to Prevent Sun Spots on Skin1," Ultraviolet rays are strongest and most intense between the hours of 10:00 am and 3:00 pm. If at all possible, try to avoid going out into the sun during those peak hours. If you must go out during that time, make sure you take preventative measures to protect your skin from UV radiation., Sunscreen protects you from the sun's radiation, but not all sunscreen is the same. Many sunscreen products only protect against one type of radiation, but your skin can be damaged by both UVA and UVB radiation. Health experts recommend that you use broad-spectrum sunscreen, which guards your skin against both types of radiation.Choose sunscreen with a sun-protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher.
Sunscreen doesn't necessarily work instantaneously. Make sure you apply sunscreen about 15 to 30 minutes before you plan on being out in the sun.
Reapply sunscreen at least every two hours. If you go swimming or sweat a lot, you should reapply sunscreen more frequently.
When you are around water, the reflection from the water can increase the strength of the sun's rays, increasing the chance of sun damage.
Use sunscreen even when the day is gloomy or overcast. Applying sunscreen can also help prevent existing sunspots from becoming darker.

, In addition to wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen whenever you're in the sun, you should also wear protective clothing to limit your skin's exposure to UV radiation. Reducing exposure and protecting your skin is the only proven way to lower the chances of sunspots developing.Brimmed hats, long-sleeved shirts, long skirts/pants, and sunglasses can all help protect your skin from the sun.Choose tightly-knit fabrics, which are better at guarding your skin.
You can also buy clothing that is designed to protect against UV radiation. Some articles of clothing can provide ultraviolet protection factors of 50 or higher.

, Smoking (and secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke) has been linked to premature aging of the skin.Because of this, some experts advise that you should avoid smoking if you want to prevent sunspots and other skin conditions associated with aging."

Make your own shade.",How to Prevent Skin Darkening in the Sun," Lotions, creams, and blocks that protect from the sun work in different ways, but they are all designed to protect your skin from damage, and this will prevent your skin from getting dark in the sun.


Sunscreen filters the UV radiation that passes through to your skin. Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen, which protects from UVA and UVB, with an SPF of at least 30. Sunscreen gels are good for hairy parts of your body, like your scalp.
Sunblock creates a physical barrier between the sun and your skin. Look for broad-spectrum, an SPF of at least 30, and ingredients like octyl salicylate and methoxycinnamate, and octocrylene.Apply sun-protective lotions about 30 minutes before going outdoors, and use at least an ounce of sunscreen at each application. Reapply after swimming, activities that caused you to sweat, or every two hours.;
, Sunscreen or sunblock is only effective on the areas of the body you apply it to, and there are some areas that people often forget. Don’t forget to apply sunscreen to your:Nose
Tips of your ears
Scalp
Lips
Eyelids

, Most moisturizers, bronzers, foundations, and lipsticks these days are available with built-in sun-protection. For an extra layer of protection for your face, choose cosmetics that have an SPF rating of at least 15.Because you only apply makeup once in the morning, you can't rely on it for all your sun protection. Use SPF makeup in conjunction with your other sun precautions. You should still apply a base layer of sunscreen to your face before applying makeup.

, This still applies even if you don’t plan to go outside. Your skin is still exposed to UV rays inside, because UV passes directly through glass and windows in buildings and houses.


Wearing sunscreen to be in the car is also important, because UV also passes through car windows.

, Most summer clothing doesn’t provide a measurable amount of sun protection, but there are clothes out there that are specifically designed to protect you from the sun.Sun-protective clothing will have a UPF rating that measures how much protection it offers. Look for something with a UPF rating of at least 30, and make sure to wear long sleeves, long pants, and high collars to protect the most amount of skin.For regular clothes that aren't UPF rated, dark clothes with a tight weave will provide more protection than light colors and open weaves.

, To protect your face from tanning or burning, wear a wide-brimmed hat with a brim that’s at least two to three inches wide.Be wary of straw hats and hats with open weaves that still allow the sun through.
Look for hats with total coverage brims or veils that protect sensitive areas like the ears and back of the neck.If you want to wear a baseball hat or hat with minimal coverage, pair it with a sun-protective veil or bandana that will cover exposed areas., Sunlight and UV rays reflect off a wide number of surfaces. You have to be careful of the rays from the sky and the ones bouncing back at you from below, because they can all darken your skin.


Some of the most reflective surfaces are water, snow, sand, and concrete., There is growing evidence suggesting that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can help protect the skin from the sun. However, it’s important to use diet in conjunction with other sun-protection measures, such as using sunscreen and wearing protective clothes. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include:Salmon
Halibut
Algae
Nut oils
Chia and hemp seeds

, Lycopene is an antioxidant that’s found primarily in red foods such as tomatoes and red peppers. However, in order to attain the most sun-protection benefits from lycopene, it’s important to cook the foods in a small amount of oil.Good sources of lycopene, therefore, include:


Tomato paste
Vegetable pasta sauces
Roasted red peppers

, Cocoa is packed with antioxidants such as flavonoids and catechins, and eating it can help your skin protect itself from sun damage. To get the most benefits from dark chocolate, eat about 2 oz (60 g) per day.


Avoid chocolate that has milk added to it, as this can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb all antioxidants., The UV index is a measure of the strength of the sun’s UVA and UVB rays on any given day. The higher the index the stronger the sun, and the greater chance there is of tanning and damaging your skin.You can check the UV index in your area on local weather reports, or websites like the Sunburn Map, and the World Health Organization’s UV Index webpage.
A low UV index is between 0 and 2, and indicates that you don’t really have to worry about sun protection.
A moderate UV index is between 3 and 7, and this means sun protection is required.
A high UV index is 8 and above, and means that you should take extreme precautions to protect yourself.
An extremely high UV index is 10 and over. When the sun is this strong, you should stay indoors whenever possible., The sun is always strongest between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. When possible, you should stay indoors during this time.To avoid the sun during peak times, try to schedule outdoor activities and trips for the early morning or late afternoon instead of midday.
It’s not always possible to stay inside when the sun’s rays are at their most intense, but if you must go out, take precautions to protect your skin. This is especially true when the UV index is moderate or high.
The sun is stronger in the summer months, but you do still have to worry about sun protection in the winter. This is especially true if you like to ski, for instance, because the air is thinner at higher altitudes, and this means the sun is stronger., When you do have to be outside in the sun, staying in the shade is one of the best ways to protect yourself from your skin getting darker. Finding shade is especially important on high index days, and when the sun is at its strongest in the middle of the day. Great sources of shade include:Tall trees with dense leaves
Buildings
Roofed structures like gazebos and patios

, It’s always a good idea to take a regular umbrella out with you, because it can protect you against both sun and rain. A black umbrella can provide a UPF of 50+, so you can use an umbrella to create shade for yourself when you have to be out in the sun.Be careful, however, that you are still wearing sunscreen and protective clothing under the umbrella, because UV will still reflect off a number of surfaces. The larger the umbrella the better, because a bigger umbrella will protect you from more reflected UV.

Choose clothing with ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) in the fabric for better sun protection for your toddler.,
Add accessories to your child's ensemble to protect your toddler from the sun.",How to Protect a Toddler from the Sun2," UPF measures the amount of UV radiation that impacts skin through clothing.


Clothing can be marketed as sun-protective when they have a UPF of at least 50. Sun-protective clothing can lose its effectiveness through repeated wash and wear, or if it's stretched or damp. Some laundry additives contain sunscreen and can increase UPF.
Dark colors and polyester clothing are best because they reflect UV radiation, while white clothing absorbs UV rays. Regardless of what clothing is worn, apply sunscreen on your toddler's skin underneath her clothing to offer protection from the sun.

,


Use a broad-brimmed hat to protect your child's scalp, face and ears.
Sunglasses with UV protection can protect your toddler's eyes.

Try over-the-counter fade cream.,
Use prescription-strength bleaching creams.,
Treat your sunspots with retinoids.",How to Prevent Sun Spots on Skin2," Fade cream may help reduce the darkness of sunspots, though cream won't necessarily erase them. The effectiveness of fade cream will depend on the darkness of the sunspots and the frequency with which you use fade cream. Most people who see results use fade cream consistently over a period of several weeks or even months.Common ingredients in fade cream that have been proven to help treat sunspots include:


Hydroquinone (may cause skin irritation and discoloration)Glycolic acid (may lead to skin tightness, redness, and irritation)Kojic acid

, Prescription skin-lightening creams like hydroquinone can be used to fade the brown sunspots on your skin.These creams can be used alone or in combination with other topical skin treatments.Many dermatologists combine bleaching creams with a mild steroid to increase their effectiveness.
Be aware that these creams may cause temporary redness and irritation of the skin, and could potentially cause permanent bleaching of the skin., Retinoids are derived from vitamin A, and studies suggest these topical treatments can help improve a variety of skin conditions.Tretinoin and other retinoids may be able to help reduce sunspots and other skin damage that was caused by UV radiation.Be aware that retinoid use may cause your skin to get dry, red, and irritated, and may result in peeling skin."
"
Use laser and light therapy.,
Have a dermatologist freeze the sunspots off.,
Try dermabrasion.,
Get a chemical peel.",How to Prevent Sun Spots on Skin3," Some dermatologists recommend laser and/or intense pulsed light therapy to reduce or erase sunspots. These treatments usually take several treatments before significant effects are achieved, and they work by destroying the cells in your skin that produce melanin.Laser and light therapy are both considered safe, sound treatment options. They successfully eradicate melatonin-producing cells without damaging the surface of your skin.
Laser therapy may slightly discolor your skin, but it will not cause any significant damage.
Any time you use laser or light therapy, your doctor will advise you on how to best protect your skin from exposure to the sun.

, Another option for removing sunspots is cryotherapy. This procedure involves having a qualified dermatologist freeze the spots with liquid nitrogen so that the excess pigment in your skin is destroyed. The treatment may cause some slight scarring/discoloration, but as the skin heals it will appear slightly lighter., Dermabrasion involves a dermatologist carefully smoothing down the outer layers of your skin, called planing, with a rotating electric brush. Once the outer layer of skin is gone, a new layer will grow over the affected area with a lighter pigment. Be aware, though, that dermabrasion can leave your skin red and may cause the affected area to temporarily form a scab.Only use approved dermabrasion products if using this option at home. Attempting to smooth down your skin with a device that was not intended for dermabrasion could cause permanent skin damage.

, Chemical peels involve the controlled use of a mild acid. A dermatologist will apply the acid to your sunspots to burn off the outer layer of skin, and as new skin forms it will grow with a lighter pigment. Be aware, though, that this treatment option typically requires several treatments, and may cause irritation and some discoloration at the site of the treatment.If you're considering having a chemical peel, you should only allow a qualified dermatologist to conduct the procedure. Do not attempt to burn off skin blemishes at home, as this may cause serious injury and skin damage.

Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen.,
Select an appropriate SPF.,
Check the expiration date.,
Apply generously.,
Reapply regularly.",How to Prevent a Sunburn1," The sun produces two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays -- UVA and UVB rays. UVB rays can burn your skin, while UVA rays cause premature aging, such as wrinkles and dark spots. For the best protection, you should use a sunscreen that protects against both types of rays, so check the label to ensure that it provides full- or broad-spectrum protection., A sunscreen's SPF measures how well it protects your skin from UVB rays compared to not wearing it. For example, if it normally takes 20 minutes for your skin to turn red, a product with SPF15 will typically prevent sunburn for 15 times longer. You should use a product that has an SPF of at least 15.If you’re only going to be spending a few minutes here and there in the sun, using a face moisturizer or aftershave with SPF15 is usually sufficient to protect your skin from burning.
If you're extremely active and plan to spend most of the day outside, a water-resistant sunscreen with a higher SPF, such as SPF30, is a better option.
For pale, sensitive skin that burns easily, it’s best to use a sunscreen with an SPF50 .

, Sunscreens become less effective as they age, so it's important to use one that's still able to protect your skin. A date is usually printed somewhere on the bottle that indicates when the sunscreen should be used by, so always check to ensure that it's still good to use.Most sunscreens are good for approximately three years after you purchase it. Because you need to reapply regularly, you'll probably use up a tube or bottle long before it expires.

, If you don’t apply enough sunscreen, you won’t get the full benefits, and may wind up burning. For the best protection, you need 1 ounce, or a shot glass full, of sunscreen to cover your entire body, including your face, ears, and scalp.Make sure to apply your sunscreen 30 minutes before you plan to go outside, so the ingredients have enough time to absorb into your skin.
Some sunscreens may recommend a specific amount to apply. Always consult the label to ensure that you’re applying enough.

, If you are going to be in the sun for a prolonged period of time, your sunscreen is going to wear off, putting you at risk for sunburn. To keep your skin protected, you must reapply every two hours when you’re in the sun. If you’re swimming or sweating a lot, towel off and immediately reapply.Because you need to reapply on a regular basis, you can expect to use ¼ to ½ of an 8 ounce bottle of sunscreen if you spend a long day at the beach. Always be sure to have enough sunscreen on hand for reapplication.
Spray sunscreens are often easier to reapply, so they're a better option when you're on the go.
If you wear makeup, powder sunscreens are usually most convenient for reapplication because they won't disturb your foundation, concealer, or other face products the way that a lotion or cream sunscreen does.

Stay out of the sun during peak hours.,
Wear the right clothes.,
Use accessories to protect your head and eyes.,
Stay in the shade.,
Don’t try for a base tan.",How to Prevent a Sunburn2," The sun’s UV rays are strongest between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., so that’s when you’re at the greatest risk of getting a sunburn. If you stay inside during midday, you can avoid these dangerous rays and protect your skin. Schedule your outdoor activities, such as walking the dog or mowing the lawn, before 10 or after 4 whenever possible.If you aren’t sure how strong the sun’s UV rays are, pay attention to your shadow. When it’s longer than you are, UV exposure is low. However, when your shadow is shorter than you are, UV exposure is high, so you should try to stay indoors.
If you have to go outside when the sun is at its strongest, try to limit the time you spend outdoors. The less exposure you have to the sun, the less chance you’ll have of getting a sunburn.

, Sometimes, you have to go outside even during the sun’s peak hours, so the key to preventing sunburn is covering yourself with appropriate clothing. Long-sleeve shirts and pants cover more of your skin than tank tops and shorts, so they can help block the sun. The more skin that your clothing covers, the more protected you'll be.Loose-fitting clothing made of tightly woven, synthetic fabric, such as lycra, nylon, and acrylic, offers the best protection from the sun.
Dark clothing can block more sunlight than lighter colored items.
Some clothing is made of fabric that has built-in sun protection. The label will indicate the item’s UV protection factor (UPF), so you know how effective it is at blocking the sun’s rays. Choose clothing with a UPF rating of at least 30 for the most effective protection.

, The right hat is not only stylish, but can protect your scalp from a possible sunburn. Make sure to throw on a pair of sunglasses before you head out the door as well because it can be difficult to apply sunscreen around the eye area.While a baseball cap or visor offers some sun protection, a wide-brimmed hat with at least a 4-inch brim is the best choice because it will shield your scalp, eyes, ears, and neck.Choose sunglasses that provide 100% UV protection, so your eyes are protected from both UVA and UVB rays.
Make sure your sunglasses fit well and don't slip down your nose, exposing the eye area to the sun.

, When you have to go outdoors, choose areas where the sun doesn’t reach, such as beneath a large, leafy tree. If you go to a spot where there isn’t much natural shade, such as the beach, bring an umbrella, portable canopy, or tent that can shield you from the sun.Being in the shade doesn’t provide complete protection from the sun because you can still receive indirect sunlight that reflects off nearby surfaces, so you should still wear protective clothing and sunscreen to prevent sunburn.

, Some people assume that if their skin is tan, it won’t burn when exposed to the sun, so they lay out to establish a “base” to protect them. However, a tan doesn’t offer any real protection from the sun -- and tanning on a regular basis, whether in the sun or a tanning bed, can do long-term damage to your skin, so it should be avoided.If you want some color, the only safe tans are those that are the result of spray on or self-tanning products. However, keep in mind that an artificial tan doesn't provide any sun protection, so you must still protect your skin with sunscreen and other sun safety measures.

Too much sun can dry out your skin, leaving a tan with a cracked or burnt appearance. Use moisturizer each day to maintain a smooth, attractive tan.Apply any regular moisturizer you use after showering or each time your skin feels dry.
In addition to your regular moisturizer, go for after-sun creams like aloe vera. Applying such creams after being out in the sun can help your skin repair, leaving you looking tanned rather than burnt.;
, If waxing is your chosen hair removal method, go a different route. Waxing can strip off the top layer of your skin, removing your tan. Instead of waxing, opt for shaving as you try to maintain your tan.As shaving can dry out your skin, always moisturize afterwards. You should also use a moisturizing shaving cream.

, A tan can go from bronzed to burnt without proper protection from the sun. Each time you go out in the sun, apply sunscreen to any exposed body parts. Use a sunscreen with a high SPF. The higher the SPF, the better protected your skin will be from the sun.It can also help to avoid sun exposure by wearing longer sleeves and things like hats and visors.

, When taking your morning shower, avoid the hot water. Hot water can strip oils from your body, lessening your tan. When showering, opt for cooler water to keep your tan longer.Also, use moisturizing body washes in the shower to avoid stripping your skin of oils needed to maintain a tan.

Exfoliate your body.,
Shave unwanted hair.,
Bring the proper clothes.",How to Prepare Your Skin for Spray Tan,"


This is perhaps one of the most important first steps when it comes to preparing your skin for a spray tan. Dry, rough patches of skin tend to attract and hold more color than skin which is smooth and soft. Failing to exfoliate before spray tanning can result, therefore, in blotchy patches of dye on your elbows, knees, and other rough areas.
Use a loofah or other type of exfoliating tool to scrub your entire body. A body scrub with sea salt or other exfoliating products also provides the optimum results.;
,


While excessive body hair will not impair the ability of the spray tan to stick to your skin, shaving soon after receiving a spray tan can be detrimental. In fact, shaving soon after this procedure often results in the color flaking off from your skin. As spray tans can be quite expensive, most individuals who receive them want to ensure their longevity.
Avoid lotions, creams, deodorant, or other personal hygiene items that could interfere with the spray tan adhering to the skin.
Many women and men enjoy applying lotion or moisturizer to their face and body to ensure soft, supple skin. To ensure the best results during a spray tan, refrain from using skin lotions and moisturizers until after having the spray tan done as these lotions often block the spray tan from sticking to your skin. The same applies to products like antiperspirant, deodorant, make-up, perfume, or powder as they too can block the adherence of the spray tan to your skin, resulting in blotchy coloration.

,


The spray tanning solution is likely to remain damp for awhile after you exit the tanning booth. While some individuals would prefer to remain in the nude until the solution dries completely, this is not an option for all. To prevent the solution from rubbing off onto your clothing, bring a selection of T-shirts and pants which are as loose as possible. In addition, as some brands of spray tan can stain clothing, consider bringing clothing which is black or another dark color.

Avoid chlorinated water if possible.",How to Maintain a Spray Tan," Imagine your skin is like a wall in your home and a spray tan is like a can of paint. Sure, you can apply the paint directly to the wall without any preparation, but it might not look very good. Instead, taking the time to prepare the wall for paint (e.g. filling holes, sanding rough spots, using primer, etc.) will ensure the new layer of paint you apply will look its best. You want to do the exact same type of preparation to your skin before applying a spray tan in order to help it look great and last as long as possible.Use a body scrub and washcloth to exfoliate your skin in the shower every day for at least 3 days before your spray tan is applied.
Complete any waxing you need at least 24 hours before your spray tan is applied.;
, Ideally, you should shower and exfoliate about 8 hours before your spray tan appointment. If needed, you can apply a light body moisturizer after your shower, but don’t use anything heavy or thick the day of your appointment.By showering and exfoliating 8 hours before your appointment, you’re allowing your skin to reach the best pH level for taking a spray tan.

, The clothes and shoes you put on immediately following your appointment can cause all sorts of problems with your tan if you’re not careful. You’ll want to avoid anything with straps (including a bra) so as not to create lines in your tan.Light cotton clothing that is loose fitting and without straps is your best option for wearing home from your appointment.
Sandals are also the best footwear option, but be careful that the straps on your sandals don’t cause lines in the tan on your feet.
If you do get strap lines on your feet, you can exfoliate the skin on your feet until the various coloured areas blend together.

, The day of your spray tan appointment you may want to avoid using products such as deodorant, foundation, and thick or heavy lotions. If you have no choice but to wear these items that day, make sure the technician at the spray tan clinic provides you with wipes to remove them before the spray tan is applied.These products form a layer on top of your skin that the spray tan product won’t be able to penetrate. That means when you wash these products off, the skin where they use to be will be lighter than the surrounding skin.
Wearing eye makeup to your appointment should be okay, and won’t need to be removed before the spray tan is applied.

, Yes, the paper underwear isn’t fun, but wearing them is worth the effort if you want your tan to look great. Putting on regular underwear may cause lines to form where the elastics touch your skin. The purpose of a spray tan is not to have any lines, so this completely defeats the purpose!, Not every spray tan product is the same. Some require more time than others to set. It’s important to ask the technician who applied the spray tan what specific instructions you need to follow for the specific tan you had applied.Once you know what your instructions are, make sure you following them precisely. If you need to time something, set a reminder alarm on your phone so you don’t forget.

, Depending on the spray tan product you had applied, you may need to shower within a few hours of your appointment, or you may need to wait until the next day. Either way, your first shower after your spray tan is applied should be lukewarm, not hot. You’ll also want to use really light and natural products on your skin to help prolong the tan as long as possible.Use the most basic type of soap you have to wash your skin during this first shower.
Avoid any soap products that have a lot of added items (like moisturizers) as they’ll leave residue on your skin.
Moisturize after your shower with a light water-based moisturizer. As with the soap, don’t use a moisturizer with added oils or other products.

, The last thing you want to do is spend money on a good spray tan and then get really sweaty immediately after and watch the tan disappear. One good way to help control sweat after you’ve had a spray tan applied is to use baby powder. The baby powder will not only help reduce the sweat, it’ll help keep the spray tan product in place.Ideally you should apply the baby powder to your cleavage, underarms, knees, and the back of your legs to reduce immediate fading due to sweat.

, The cooler the water in your shower, the better. Your spray tan will not only last longer with cooler water, it’ll prevent your spray tan from being uneven.It is also a good idea to have short showers rather than baths while you have a spray tan.
When drying off after a shower, use a blotting motion with your towel rather than a rubbing motion.

, Some parts of your body will naturally shed skin faster than other parts, specifically areas that rub against skin or clothing. As these areas shed skin faster, your spray tan will also fade faster. Exfoliate these areas gently every couple of days in order to balance the colour out and make the tan look more even.Use only gentle products and tools to exfoliate your skin. A washcloth or a gentle body scrub will both work well.

, Unfortunately not all moisturizers will help keep your tan glowing. You do need to make sure to use the right type of moisturizer in order to prolong your spray tan as long as possible. Good options are cocoa butter, aloe vera body butter, or coconut oil. You’ll want to avoid products that contain citrus extracts.At the very least you should moisturize your whole body after you shower or bathe every day.
You can also moisturize your skin before you go to bed.

, Even though you have a spray tan on your skin, you still need to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays. This means you still need to apply sunscreen to every piece of exposed skin while you’re outside, including your face. In order to protect your spray tan, however, use water-based sunscreen lotions rather than oil-based., The act of rubbing against your skin with a shaver, or pulling at your skin with a wax, will make your spray tan fade faster. Since most spray tans only last up to 10 days, try to avoid shaving or waxing until the last couple of days in the 10 day period. But make sure to shave or get a wax at least 24 hours before a new spray tan session., When you have a spray tan, you want to avoid putting newer and newer layers of the tan product on top of older layers. Not only can this make your tan look very uneven, it isn’t good for your skin. Instead, you should do a complete spray tan detox at least once a month to remove as much of the previous layer of product as possible before getting a new tan applied.Mix baby oil with a small amount of lemon juice and apply the mixture to your whole body.
Sit with the mixture on your skin for about 10 minutes and then have a shower.
While in the shower, use a body scrub to remove the mixture and the outer layers of dead skin cells.
This mixture helps make your skin more pliable, which in turn will help you remove more of the outer layer and the old tan.

, Because different parts of your tan are going to fade faster than others, it’s beneficial to use a self tanning product at home in-between spray tan applications. One place this will be particularly important is your face, as the tan on your face is likely to fade approximately 3 days after you get the tan applied. Another good spot to use a self tanner is on your legs.If you suffer from acne on your face, you’ll want to make sure the self tanning product you buy is non-comedogenic. This type of product won’t clog your pores and cause more acne.
You’ll likely want to use a lighter coloured product in-between spray tans, so you don’t cause the tan to look uneven.

, Summer is a typical time for lots of swimming. Unfortunately the chlorine in a pool will cause your spray tan to fade faster. Ideally, try to avoid chlorinated pools as much as possible, especially within the first week or so after you’ve had your spray tan applied.If you’re near the end of a spray tan period (and going to get a new one in a few days), swimming in chlorinated water will actually help you remove more dead skin and old tan before your new tan is applied.

Pick out some tanning spray or lotion.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Moisturize your body.,
Put on tanning gloves.,
Apply the tanning solution.,
Buff your body.,
Let it soak in.",How to Home Tan1," Drugstores have tons of different options for home tanning, and most of them won't break the bank. Select a type of home tanning spray of lotion that works for your skin tone and texture. You probably only need one bottle for your body, but if you want to ensure full coverage, you may want to buy a backup.









Choose a tanning color just a few shades darker than your normal skin tone. If you go from snow white to burnt orange in a day, the transition won't necessarily be positive. The goal is to look a few shades darker, as though you just spent a week in a warm, beachy locale.
Consider whether to get a spray can or lotion dispenser. If your skin is on the dry side, you might want to choose a lotion for the added moisture. Some people find it easier to evenly distribute the tanning solution through a spray nozzle - it's totally up to your personal preference.;
, You don't want to apply the tanning solution to dry, flaky skin; you'll end up looking splotchy next time you exfoliate. Exfoliating thoroughly before you apply the solution is key.








Start by dry brushing your body to remove all the dead skin flakes and help your circulation a bit. Both the brush and your body should be dry. Brush your arms and legs in short strokes toward your heart. Don't forget your torso, back, and any other areas you plan on tanning.
Take a lukewarm shower and use an exfoliating body cleanser. Scrub areas like your knees and elbows, and any other spots that tend to get dry or scaly, especially well.

, The next step is to prevent your body from getting dry all over again by applying a good moisturizer. Use baby oil, lotion, or your preferred moisturizing method to seal in moisture from your neck to your toes after your shower. Wait a few minutes for your skin to absorb the moisturizer before you proceed with tanning.








, If you bought a home tanning kit, it might have come with a pair of latex or plastic gloves to protect your hands from getting tanning solution all over them when you apply it. If you didn't get a kit, it's important to find a pair of gloves to protect your hands - otherwise, they'll turn bright brownish orange after several coats of tanning solution.








, Stand in your bathroom and either spray your body with tanning solution or use your hands to smooth on some tanning lotion. Work methodically so you make sure you don't miss any spots. You might want to stand over an old towel so you don't end up tanning your bathroom floor.








Start with one leg and apply the tanning solution from the toes up to the thighs, then do the other leg. Follow the directions on your bottle of solution, making sure to hold the spray bottle the correct distance from your skin. If you're applying lotion, spread it on smoothly instead of rubbing it in too deeply in one spot.
Next do your torso, back and neck. You can have a friend work on hard-to-reach spots, or use a ""back spatula"" (available at drugstores) to apply the solution to your back. It's shaped like a body brush, but with a smooth buffer instead of a brush on the end.
Apply it to your arms. Finish your hands by removing the gloves and applying the solution carefully with a cotton ball.
Take special care with your face. You can use a little vaseline around the edges of your hairline to make sure the solution doesn't build up there., Once you're completely covered, go back over your body with a soft cloth and buff it in circular motions. This ensures your entire body will get an even coating of tanning solution.








, You'll need to give the solution time to soak into your skin. Take a few hours to stay around the house in long, loose, dark clothing that won't get stained by the tanning solution. After a few hours, it's fine to take a shower, put on light clothes or leave the house.

Use a lemon juice, yogurt mix.,
Apply almond paste.,
Try using milk to lighten and moisturize your skin.,
Apply peroxide onto the area.",How to Lighten up Your Bikini Areas1," Papaya soap is natural and using it regularly will help to lighten the skin. Use it at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, until you see results.

In a couple of week’s time, you should see significant lightening.;
, These two ingredients are the lightening agents used for acne treatments and can also be used for this purpose. Dab a pad on the areas and then get into the shower. Let the steam sink in for a couple minutes and wash off.

Most salons will offer a small sticker to apply to your skin somewhere so you can gauge your tanning progress.,
Relax.",How to Go to a Tanning Salon," Most tanning salons will sell you a package of visits. For example: 10 visits for $100. Then you schedule when you want to use your visits. Tanning time depends on the model of the bed used. Some are 15 min. some 20 min, etc.;
, Using a tanning accelerator is optional; most will tell you on the label if you need to apply in advance. Any skin lotion is helpful to keep your skin from drying out and brings out the beautiful tan color.

, If your tanning salon is busy they cannot extend your time into the next persons time. So make sure you are there 5 minutes before your scheduled appointment. If a bed is open you will have a few extra minutes to get ready.

, Usually the staff at the salon will take your first visit to acclimate you to the routine. Most nice salons will have a radio or some type of personal music selection for you to choose from. All beds have a timer which they will show you how to set. You will need to wear tanning goggles while in the bed. Most salons will have a bowl or bucket full of sterilized goggles for you to choose from. Some people prefer to buy their own and carry them to their visit. Some salons ask the patrons to clean the bed after using, some have the staff do the cleaning. Cleaning requires a spray on solution and wiping of all touched surfaces. There should always be a little sign on the bed saying it was cleaned before the next user. Ask the staff what the practice is of the salon you chose.

, Choosing to wear easy on & easy off clothing and shoes now pays off. If you are going to wear a swimsuit to tan in you can wear it under your clothing or change when you get in the room. Whether you wear a swimsuit or tan in your birthday suit is up to you! Be aware though, that the skin which has never seen the light of day before is very sensitive. So, to avoid unpleasant burning, tan in short increments to gently and gradually expose the private areas of your body. It costs more to do it this way but you won't have any tan lines to deal with, or bad burns on those tender places.

, Some are Playboy bunnies, some peace symbols, etc. Do not apply it to your abdomen. Apply it to a hard to tan place, like under your upper arm. Apply a new sticker on each visit to the same place, then you will get a real idea of how you are progressing

, You're IN and ALONE with the tanning bed! Set your tunes, put on your sticker, get comfy in the bed, place your goggles on your eyes,set and RELAX! The next 15-20 minutes can be the most relaxing time of your day, enjoy it!!

Use self-tanner on your face.,
Wear bronzer.,
Patch up your tan with spray-on tan.,
Use pills.",How to Maintain a Tan2," Your face is generally the first thing people notice. A fading facial tan will be immediately noticeable, so use self-tanner to fix up any fading. Purchase a self-tanner designed for your face and apply it regularly to keep your tan noticeable.Go for gradual tanners, as these tend to look more natural.

, A little bronzer on your face can also help your tan last longer. Apply the bronzer on areas where the sun naturally hits your face, such as the forehead, temples, nose, and cheekbones. This will highlight your natural tan, preventing the product from looking fake.Apply enough bronzer to give your skin a natural glow. Too much bronzer can be overwhelming and make your tan look fake. You want to recreate your natural tan rather than replace it altogether.

Maintain your tan.",How to Home Tan2," The skimpier it is, the more area you will be able to get tan.









If your back yard is private, consider tanning in the nude. Nothing's sexier than no tan lines!

, Get a towel, some music, a magazine, sunglasses, a hat, a glass or bottle of water, and a friend. The more you have to keep yourself occupied, the longer you will want to stay out there. It is very important to keep yourself hydrated, since you will be sweating out your body liquid.








, This will promote a safe and healthy tan, and let you stay out longer without burning.









Don't use tanning lotion below SPF-15. Prolonged tanning without some protection from UV rays is very bad, and is a major cause of skin cancer.
Apply the oil about 20 minutes before you go out into the sun, and repeat every hour or so—or if you go into the water. This holds true even if your sunscreen is waterproof.

, Lying on the ground is extremely uncomfortable and not very relaxing either.









Find a chair that lets your skin breath, and wicks away moisture (sweat) for the most comfort.
Bring a towel outside with you to cover parts of your body you don't want to tan.

, To prevent burns (which will not help you tan evenly), avoid tanning during the peak hours—from 10 am to 4 pm. The less you wear, the more you want to pay attention to this rule. The last thing you want is a burned bum!









Lay out for 2-4 hours, reapplying your tanning oil hourly. If you get hot, run through your sprinklers or jump in the pool.
Remember that the longer you're outside, the greater chance the sun will damage your skin. Be smart and go inside if it feels like you're getting burned.

, You won't have that golden glow in one day, but if you spend a little time in the sun every day, you will have a great tan in about a week.








, Once you're burnished like a fine bronze goddess (or god), keep your skin hydrated to maximize the time that tantalizing tan will stick around.









An aloe-based moisturizer will not only keep your tan in place, it'll also keep your skin moist and soft.

Ask the doctor about using a skin bleaching cream containing hydroquinone.,
Talk to your dermatologist about a milder skin bleaching treatment.,
Find out from your doctor if you’re a good candidate for using a bleaching agent, such as chlorine, to lighten the areas.,
Opt for laser hair removal.",How to Lighten up Your Bikini Areas2," This kind of cream works by preventing melanin from being produced in the skin. It’s one of the most popular lightening treatments. However, if the concentration is too high or if it’s used for too long, it could worsen the discoloration or reverse the effects. It can also be toxic to the liver.

, Some alternative, fading creams that are known to have less side effects are azelaic acid, kojic acid and one containing only 2 percent hydroquinone. All of these are known to help with persistent or residual skin discoloration problems. They work by preventing keratin, a hair protein, from being produced in the skin., This is a mix formulated by the medical professional doing the treatment. Due to the concentration of bleach, dermatologists and medical doctors are the only ones allowed to administer it., If the darkening is caused by waxing, shaving, and/or you can see dark hair stubble as it’s growing back, then laser hair removal may be a good solution for you. Though it’s considered semi-permanent, the hair usually doesn’t come back. However, you have to make sure to complete the recommended number of treatments and the ongoing, but infrequent, touch-ups.

When they accumulate, they can make the skin appear darker and duller. Prior to shaving, lightly exfoliate the region using a loofah, scrub or exfoliating brush. This will remove the dry skin and will also help to prevent skin irritation and ingrown hairs in the bikini areas.

, When going in the sun, use a sunblock to keep the sun from penetrating those areas of your skin that you don't want getting darker. Choose a sunblock with a high SPF number (Sun Protection Factor) such as SPF 45 on that region. Also when you come out of the sun, apply olive oil to the area, as it’s also known to be a natural skin lightener.

, Sweating in the bikini areas are known to cause darkening. Avoid polyester clothing and other synthetic fabrics, as they don’t allow the skin to breath. Also tight clothing sometimes causes chafing and could also darken these areas., If shaving irritates the skin, it could darken it. Basically, dark spots are caused by constant friction. If you shave every day, your skin attempts to protect it so it darkens up. Any type of injury to your skin will either create a stain or keloid.


Waxing can also cause darkening if it’s too hot.

Choose between rub-on lotions, aerosol sprays, and oil rubs and mists that all contain some SPF.


Ideally, choose an SPF between four and 15 depending on the strength of your base tan. If you are already somewhat tan, you can go with a lower SPF. If this is your first exposure of the summer season, choose SPF 15 to avoid getting sunburned.
For the most even tan possible, choose a spray or an oil. Because of their watery texture, these two options are the easiest to spread thoroughly over your skin. Make sure to rub in sprays with your hands after spraying.
Popular sun tanning lotions and oils are available from Hawaiian Tropics, Australian Gold, Banana Boat, and Maui Babe. Most can be found at your local drugstore or beauty supply store.

Olive oil
Coconut oil
Hazelnut oil
Avocado oil
Wheat-germ oil
Sunflower oil
Sesame oil
Green Tea Extract, Like a chicken roasting in a rotisserie, you need to turn your body over frequently to get an even tan. A good rule of thumb is to turn in 1/4 revolutions every half hour. Start on your back, then turn to your left side, then your stomach, and lastly your right side. Make sure to change the position of your arms and legs frequently to avoid awkward tan lines.

, As the sun moves across the sky, move your towel or lounge chair so that you can always be in direct sunlight. If you don't want to lay around all day, you can also do something active outside, just wear as little clothing as possible to allow the sun to hit your skin.

, Though dermatologists usually tell you to avoid the sun during peak hours, if you're trying to get tan quickly, hit the tanning grind when the sun is strongest.

, If you are trying to get tan all over, then there's really no other option than to put on your birthday suit and soak up the sun. Find a nude beach or a private (fenced) area of your backyard and let the sun work its magic!

, This technique is a blast from the past, but it will actually magnify and focus the sun on your skin. There are several reflective products on the market that can help attract the sun to your body. Lay-out on a reflective towel or purchase a reflective sun screen. Rest a sun screen at your waist and tilt it at about a 45-degree angle until the sunlight hits your body.

, Because water attracts and reflects sunlight, laying on or near a body of water will help you absorb as much sunlight as possible. Get some floaties, lay on a raft, or sit in an inner tube on the water to tan in the sun.

, Make sure that you are always covered with some sort of low SPF oil or lotion. Even water-resistant products should be reapplied just to be careful.

, Keep your skin hydrated and seal in your bronze after a tanning session by applying a moisturizing lotion.

Understand how self-tanners work.,
Choose a product.,
Wear gloves.,
Spread it evenly.,
Apply everyday until you reach the desired skin color.",How to Get Tanned Fast2," Self-tanning lotions contain the compound dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to add pigment to the skin. It is a three-carbon sugar molecule that reacts with amino groups in skin proteins. When they react, the form what is called a Maillard reaction, which is similar in its operation to the process of browning bread and caramelizing sugar., Self-tanning products come in lotions, creams, gels, foams, sprays, and oils. Several companies such as Neutrogena, L'Oreal, Jergens, Aveeno, Bath & Body Works, Banana Boat, Clarins, and Lorac all make self-tanners that have gotten good ratings from beauty magazines and websites.As per the instructions, apply the lotion or spray evenly, taking care to get all skin covered.
Choose a noncomedogenic lotion to avoid clogging your pores.

, Since you'll be spreading the lotion all around your body with your hands, they will absorb much more of the lotion or oil than the rest of your body. Buy disposable medical gloves and wear them when applying self-tanner to avoid having hands darker than the rest of your body.


Throw the gloves away after use and use a new pair each time you apply.
Make sure to rub some lotion or oil into your hands after you finish applying it to the rest of your body. You want them to be the same color of the rest of your body, just not darker.

, One of the biggest challenges posed by self-tanning lotion is the ability to spread it evenly around your body. You may need to ask a friend to get those hard to reach places like the middle of your back to avoid blotchy, discolored skin.


Move your hand in a circular motion when applying self-tanner to avoid a streaky appearance.
Take it slow. Don't rush to put on self-tanner, or odds are you will end up with blotchy areas or you'll miss areas altogether. Take the time to rub it in completely.
Don't forget those areas that are normally hidden from public view, including your armpits.

, Once in the morning should be enough to reach your desired color, but you may apply once in the morning and once at night to speed up the process. Be aware that self tanners can stain your clothing and bedding.

Choose a product.,
Determine the number of layers you need.,
Exfoliate your skin before getting sprayed.,
Visit a spray tan salon or hire a professional to your home.,
Touch up your tan every one to two weeks.",How to Get Tanned Fast3," Like self-tanning lotions, spray tans also contain the three-carbon sugar dihydroxyacetone (DHA), that reacts with amino acids to add color to the skin. Spray tan solutions are generally more concentrated, however, and require anywhere from one to three layers to reach the desired level of tan.

, Experts advise choosing a spray tan product with a lower percentage of DHA so that you can gradually add color. You can always make yourself darker, but once you spray it on, there's no going back.


Additionally, seek out products infused with erythrulose, a sugar compound present in raspberries. This compound will allow your tan to last longer and produces a healthy glow.
If possible, choose products that contain a small amount of green pigment. The green pigment is present in order to balance out any orange that occurs from the spray tan., For people with very fair skin, one layer of spray tan will be sufficient for creating a beautiful glow. For people with tan or dark skin, you may need several layers. Just start slow and gradually add more pigment until you reach the desired color. The most important thing to remember with spray tans is not to overdo it. Fake-looking, orange skin is not attractive.

, Make sure to get rid of all of the dead and rough skin on the outer layer of your body before getting sprayed. Choose an exfoliating scrub that is oil-free and contains some sort of rough beads or granules that will polish your skin. Use a loofah or a washcloth in the shower to scrub your body., Unlike self-tanning lotions, you really need a professional to perform a spray tan on your body. You can either visit a tanning salon with a spray machine or hire a private professional to come to your home and spray you in your shower. The first option will be much cheaper, however.

, Depending on the strength of the tan and your original skin tone, a spray tan can last anywhere between five and 10 days. Moisturize with lotion every day to make your tan last longer. To keep a golden glow, touch up your tan as it begins to fade."

Avoid tyrosine-based tanning accelerators.,
Choose an amount of time.",How to Get Tanned Fast4," Tanning beds use ultraviolet (UV) light bulbs emitting UV radiation similar to that of the sun.However, these beds are known to heighten your chances of getting skin cancer. Therefore, dermatologists highly advise against using them. But, if you need to get an immediate tan, this is the quickest, most effective method out there.

, It is extremely important that you wear goggles specially formulated for tanning beds while tanning. You can buy or rent these at the tanning salon.

, Tyrosine is an amino acid that your body uses to produce melanin, a chemical that makes your skin darker. However, the FDA does not approve tyrosine and there is no concrete evidence that it actually works.

, If this is your first time tanning, you should start with a relatively small amount of time around eight minutes. People generally tan in beds for between eight and 20 minutes, though the median rests around 12 minutes. If you have very fair skin, go for a shorter period of time than if you have darker skin and/or a good base tan.


Undress completely and get in the tanning bed. Shut the top flap over you like a clam shell. Find the button to flip on the tanning lights.
The lights are programmed with a timer and will shut off automatically when your time is up. Be sure to get into the bed right away when the timer begins.

, These ingredients can help treat the fungus called tinea versicolor, which is often the cause for white sun spots on the skin.Tinea versicolor is fungus that actually acts as a sunscreen in your skin, and prolonged sun exposure can make this fungus more visible. But don’t worry—everyone has naturally occurring yeast in their skin, so this fungus is very common.Selenium is found in many dandruff shampoos, and you can often get sulfur creams from a dermatologist for a low cost. Put some of this on your skin for 5-10 minutes, then rinse.
Tinea versicolor is a skin infection that causes the skin to change color. It commonly occurs in people who live in warm and humid climates. It does not spread from person to person and it is not contagious.

, Since these spots are mostly caused by a yeast in the skin, a simple anti-fungal cream (like one for athlete’s foot or jock itch) sometimes does the trick to minimize the yeast itself and, in turn, the white spots.You might also try adding a hydrocortisone cream (1%) to the anti-fungal cream. This has proven more effective for some people using this method.If this does not work then consult your doctor he may be able to give you a stronger cortisone cream or even a shampoo.

, Since these spots simply lack pigment, applying artificial pigment could help blend them in with the rest of your skin.


Try applying sunless tanning cream with a Q-Tip to the spots for better precision., A procedure called Intense Pulsed Light, or a Photofacial, can be used to treat not just the white spots, but the entire area of sun damaged skin and allow for a more even skin tone.If you do not have a dermatologist, contact your primary care provider for a referral to one in your area.

, As with any sunburn, it is vital that you stay hydrated. Drink water and/or sports drinks to replenish lost electrolytes.


Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, feeling sleepy or dizzy, not having to urinate as frequently, and headache. Children can become dehydrated even easier than adults, so if your child is displaying these symptoms, make sure you talk to a doctor.
Drink at least 8 eight ounces of water every day, and drink even more when you are out in the sun. Also, watch out for heat exhaustion.

, The white spots that show up after sunburn are sometimes guttate hypomelanosis, which is completely harmless and simply a discoloration in the skin believed to be caused by sun damage. This usually occurs in middle aged and older individuals. Although treatment is not usually necessary, some treatments are as follows: topical calcineurin inhibitors, fractional carbon dioxide laser, phenol, and cryotherapy. A doctor can prescribe topical steroids or other medications that may eventually make the spots look better., You might be surprised to learn how many common household items can be used to soothe a pesky sunburn. Cooked and cooled oatmeal, yogurt, and tea bags soaked in cold water can all be applied to the sunburned skin to create soothing effects.Coconut oil applied directly to the burned skin can help soothe and heal the burn., This can also help to treat the aftermath sun spotting that may have already occurred. Sun poisoning symptoms usually go away on their own within 7-10 days, but the best method of defense is to avoid getting sun poisoning to begin with and actively protect yourself from the sun’s damaging rays.


UV rays are at their most intense between 10AM and 4PM, so trying to avoid the sun through these hours will be especially important., Try to stick with “broad-spectrum” sunscreens of at least SPF 30. Broad-spectrum sunscreens block out both UVA and UVB rays. Make sure you apply it at least 15-30 minutes prior to sun exposure.A sunburn can occur after spending only 15 minutes in the sun, so applying sunscreen before going outside into the sun is especially important when being proactive with your sun protection.These white spots are not completely fixable, as the pigment is gone from the skin. Your best plan of action is to prevent the light spots from spreading, which means protecting your skin before more sun exposure., This includes things like hats and sunglasses. The more skin you have covered, the less likely you are to expose yourself to the sun’s harmful rays.


You might not know it, but the sun can be very damaging to your eyes. Around 20% of all cases of cataracts can be directly related to UV exposure and damage. The sun can also cause macular degeneration, which is one of the foremost causes of blindness in the US., If you are taking any medications, you will want to check out the literature that came along with them from the pharmacy. Some drugs are known to cause further sensitivity to UVA/UVB rays, which could put you at more risk for sun poisoning if you don’t protect your skin.Some of these medications include some types of antidepressants, some antibiotics, some acne medications, and even some diuretics.These are only a few examples, so be sure to check yours specifically.
If you no longer have the literature that came along with your prescriptions and medications, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Exfoliate your skin every day to help fade your tan.,
Choose an exfoliation method.,
Soak in a milk bath to speed up dead skin removal.,
Use lemon juice and sugar to rid dead skin cells.",How to Get Rid of Farmer's Tan1," Exfoliation is the process of removing the top layer of your skin's dead cells, which will help get rid of awkward tan lines faster. When the dead skin cells are scrubbed off, your tan will begin to lighten and your original skin tone will be restored.It may take several exfoliation treatments before you begin to notice a difference, so stay patient.;
, Exfoliating is easy and even good for your skin. With several different methods you can choose from, it really just depends on how abrasive you want the exfoliation to be. Using a loofah or wash cloth and cleansing cream, are two great methods to start out with.


A loofah will be the most effective because of its coarse texture. However, if you have sensitive or sunburned skin, avoid using a loofah because it may cause irritation. To use, gently scrub skin in circular motions for one to two minutes and repeat once a day in the shower or bath. .
A cream wash and wash cloth is the best method for sensitive skin, but it will take longer to work. To use, lather your wash cloth in soap and gently scrub skin in circular motions for three to five minutes once a day in the shower or bath.

, Soaking in a bath with added whole milk acts as a natural exfoliator by softening the top layers of your skin. It also adds moisture back into your skin cells. After your skin is softened, it becomes easier for the dead skin cells to fall off.Spend at least five to seven minutes in the whole milk and water.Tanned skin cells are already damaged and on there way out, so a soak in the tub just helps give them an extra push off., The acid in lemon juice may help to break down partially dead skin cells, while the texture of the sugar will serve to exfoliate. Simply cut a lemon in half, and squeeze the juice in with some sugar.Apply the mixture to a wash cloth, or your finger tips, and rub it against your skin using circular motions.


Avoid the sun for at least an hour after doing so, or you’ll just get a darker tan.

Consider vinegar treatment.",How to Get Rid of Peeling Skin," Switch to a gentle cleanser when dealing with peeling skin. Some soaps can actually be fairly abrasive, and using them now can dry out the skin and cause further irritation.Opt for a creamy, liquid soap. Bars of soap tend to be the most abrasive option, followed by clear liquid cleansers.
Rinse with warm water, then gently work the cleanser or soap into the skin. Rinse it away with more warm water when finished.
Use warm water, especially during the initial rinse and wash. Cold water won't be as effective at removing flakes of skin, but hot water can dry the skin too much and may cause additional discomfort. If your skin is especially itchy, you can use cool water during the second rinse to help soothe it.;
, Use an exfoliator while you're taking a shower or bath, immediately after you finish washing the skin. Good exfoliators will assist you in the task of actually removing any currently flaky, peeling skin.


There are physical and chemical exfoliators. Physical exfoliators use tiny beads or granules to strip flaking skin away, while chemical exfoliators remove the skin using certain enzymes.For the sake of removing peeling skin, chemical exfoliators are safer. Physical exfoliators may tear the skin and cause infection if you aren't careful.
Chemical exfoliators with fruit enzymes, like papaya or pineapple, are your best choice. If you do opt for a physical exfoliator, choose one with smooth beads instead of harsh granules.

, After you finish exfoliating, stand or sit in the warm steam of the shower for several minutes.


Intense steam, like the kind you'd find in a sauna, can actually be bad for peeling skin. Small amounts of heated mist from the shower are beneficial, though, since it infuses moisture back into your otherwise dry skin.
After spending a few minutes in the steam, you can exit the shower and dry off. Pat your skin with a soft towel but do not scrub yourself dry.

, You should apply moisturizing creams or lotions immediately after your shower. Your skin is still moist at this point, and applying lotions now will help hold some of that moisture in place.


Everyone's skin is different, but if you aren't sure which product works best for you, consider trying a moisturizing cream containing hyaluronic acid. This chemical is known to attract and bind moisture to the skin.

, External skin care is important, but you'll need to keep your skin hydrated internally, too. To accomplish that task, drink more fluids on a daily basis.


A general rule of thumb is to drink eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic fluids daily.
When dealing with peeling skin, however, you should consider increasing your intake of fluids to ten 8-oz (250-ml) glasses daily., It might seem tempting to pick or pull away peeling skin, but doing so interferes with the body's natural healing process and may increase your risk of developing an infection.


If you're dealing with huge flakes of peeling skin and you're worried about accidentally catching and tearing it away, you can cut away the already dead flakes. Use clean nail scissors and carefully trim away the dead portion only.

, Exposure to direct sunlight can weaken your skin further and complicate the problem. This is true regardless of whether your skin is peeling due to a sunburn or due to dryness.


Apply sunscreen over any exposed skin when you know you'll have to be out in the sun.
Cover as much skin as possible with hats and clothing before stepping outside. Focus especially on the areas that are already damaged and peeling.

, Aloe vera is a relatively well-known treatment for irritated skin, and you can find aloe vera gel in most pharmacies. Gently massage the gel into the affected skin. Let it dry completely, then rinse the area with warm water to remove any sticky residue.


You can apply aloe vera gel two or three times each day.
This plant-based product can reduce inflammation, irritation, and itching. As a result, your skin will feel more comfortable and less stressed, allowing it to heal more effectively.

, Oatmeal is another well-known treatment for itchy, flaky skin. You can soak in an oatmeal bath or apply an oatmeal-based scrub.


To prepare an oatmeal bath, mix 1 cup (250 ml) of oatmeal into a bathtub filled with warm water. Soak in the bath for roughly 30 minutes, then rinse with clean water.
To prepare an oatmeal scrub, soften 1/4 cup (60 ml) of rolled oats with a little warm water. Gently massage the moist oats over the affected skin, then rinse it all away with clean water.

, Soak a clean washcloth in a small dish of ice-cold whole milk. Lay the washcloth directly over the patch of peeling skin and leave it in place for 10 minutes.Milk contains lipids that can rehydrate and plump up damaged, flaking skin. The cold temperature and lactic acid in the milk can soothe the skin and strip away some of the flakes.

, Certain oils contain fatty acids that can moisturize dry, peeling skin. Massaging the skin with one of these beneficial oils can lock in moisture just as effectively as any hydrating cream could.


Two of your best options are olive oil and coconut oil. You could also try grape seed oil, sesame oil, castor oil, or almond oil.
Microwave 1/4 cup (60 ml) of oil for 5 to 10 seconds in the microwave. It should be warm but not hot. Generously rub the oil over the flaky skin, and repeat the procedure up to three times each day.

, Lemon juice alone has the ability to work as a gentle chemical exfoliator. By combining the lemon juice with sugar, you can transform it into an exfoliator that works both chemically and physically to strip away peeling skin.


Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) of sugar with the juice of one lemon half. Stir the ingredients together until a thick paste forms.
If desired, you can also enhance the scrub with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of honey and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil, but doing so is not necessary.
Gently rub the scrub over the affected skin using small, circular motions. After letting it sit for several minutes, rinse it away with cold water.

, Cucumbers have a high water content, so they can help hydrate and cool irritated, flaky skin. They also contain vitamin C, which can assist your skin's natural ability to heal itself.


Grate one cucumber into paste-like shreds. Carefully apply the grated cucumber to the skin and leave it in place for 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse with warm water when finished.
You can apply cucumber to the affected skin twice daily for one or two weeks, or until the skin heals.

, Certain fruits can be grated or mashed and applied to peeling skin as gentle moisturizers. Bananas, apples, and papayas are among the most effective.Mash one banana into 1/4 cup (60 ml) of yogurt until a lumpy cream forms. Apply the cream to peeling skin and let it sit for 5 minutes before rinsing with clean water.
Grate one apple into paste-like shreds and apply the shreds directly to the affected skin. Rinse with clean water after 5 minutes.
Mash a papaya and spread the fruit directly over the affected area. Tie a clean cotton cloth over the treated area to hold the papaya paste in place for at least 30 minutes. After it dries, rinse it away with clean water.

, Rub honey directly over the patchy, peeling skin, using just enough to coat the skin with a light layer. Let the honey sit for 10 to 20 minutes before rinsing it away with lukewarm water.


Honey is a combination of different nectars, so it can contain a variety of beneficial elements, including fructose, water, oil, glucose, enzymes, and various nutrients.
As a result, honey works well as a natural moisturizer. There is also some belief that honey contains natural antibacterial properties, so it may help reduce the risk of infection associated with torn skin.

, When applied in small amounts, apple cider vinegar can be used as a chemical exfoliator.


Rub a very small amount directly into the peeling skin. Consider covering the area with clean cotton cloth to prevent the vinegar from rubbing off.
Allow the vinegar to sit on the skin overnight, then wash it away with lukewarm water in the morning.
Only apply vinegar once or twice a week. Using it too often could result in further irritation.

Seek medical advice for severe burns.,
Spray the sunburn with apple cider vinegar.,
Take a warm oatmeal bath.,
Treat the area with diluted peppermint oil.,
Apply witch hazel to the sunburn.",How to Get Rid of an Itchy Sunburn (Fair Skin)1," Home remedies can be helpful, but they're usually intended to treat mild burns. If you are experiencing blistering, dizziness, fever, or possible infection (draining pus, red streaks, increased tenderness),you should contact your doctor before treating the sunburn yourself.


If you or a friend are feeling weak and unable to stand, confused, or passes out, you should call an ambulance.
Skin that is waxy and white, very dark brown, or raised and leathery are signs of a third degree burn. It is very rare, but it is sometimes possible to suffer a burn this severe from the sun. Seek medical help immediately.;
, Vinegar is a weak acid that is sometimes used as an antiseptic. It balances your skin's pH, which in turn promotes faster healing and can relieve itchiness.Vinegar does have a strong smell, but it should dissipate after a few minutes.


Fill a clean spray bottle with apple cider vinegar. Test it by first spraying it on a small area of sunburned skin and wait to see if you experience pain or any kind of reaction.
Spray the vinegar on the sunburned skin, allowing it to drip-dry. Do not rub it into your skin.
Reapply if your skin begins to itch again.
If you don't have a spray bottle, pour a few drops on a cotton ball or washcloth and dab it on the sunburn.Some claim regular white vinegar as the same effect as apple cider, so you can try using that instead of apple cider vinegar if none is available., Oatmeal moisturizes dry skin and will normalize the skin’s pH, which is often at a high level when skin is dry and itchy.You can use colloidal oatmeal, which is ground and will float in the bathwater, increasing the exposure to your skin. Otherwise you can put 3/4 cup uncooked oatmeal in a clean pair of panty hose and tie or knot it.Run a lukewarm bath (hot water may dry out your skin and cause more itching).Add the colloidal oatmeal to the running water so it mixes completely. If you are using the stocking, toss it into the bath at this time.Soak for about 10 minutes. If you feel sticky afterwards, rinse with lukewarm water. You can take an oatmeal bath up to three times a day.Make sure you pat dry with a towel—do not rub. This can cause further irritation to your skin., Available in most health stores, peppermint oil has a cooling and calming effect on skin.Do not use peppermint extract--it is not the same as peppermint oil.


Dilute the peppermint oil in a carrier oil (a vegetable oil like jojoba or coconut). Add 10-12 drops per ounce of oil for adults. For children, pregnant women, or those with sensitive skin, add 5-6 drops.Test the oil on a small area of your sunburn to make sure you don’t have an allergic reaction.
Rub the oil into the sunburn. You skin should feel a cold/hot sensation, and the itching should subside temporarily., Witch hazel contains tannis, which may reduce swelling, pain, and itching.It is a good alternative if you don’t want to use hydrocortisone cream.


Rub a small amount of witch hazel cream into your sunburn (after patch testing for allergic reaction).
Use a cotton ball to apply witch hazel water to your skin.
Use witch hazel up to six times a day to relieve pain and itching."

, These can be performed at dermatologist offices and some spas. The procedure employs a combination of acids that help to remove the top layers of skin. It can, however, leave the affected area red for several days.

, This procedure typically uses liquid nitrogen to freeze the spots. They will then scab and fall off in approximately 1 week.

Apply a self-tanner to the sections of your skin that didn’t get tanned.,
Get a spray tan from a trained specialist.,
Choose a tanning bed to fix tan lines.",How to Get Rid of Farmer's Tan2," This is the safer and healthier alternative to tanning using UV rays. When choosing a self-tanning product, start with a lighter color with an added moisturizer to help blend in awkward tan lines. It may be tempting to match the self-tanner to your tanned skin areas, but that would not be wise. If you apply deep tanning colors to your untanned skin, it will create an orange-y, splotchy mess with streaks on your ankles and feet which are hard areas to tan.Moisturizing self-tanners are easier to spread and blend in.
Gradual self tanners take about one week to work, but they will look the most natural.

, Spray tan specialists use an airbrush to gently apply fake tan to blend in your skin tones and offer you an opportunity to get specific areas tanned in a semi-private atmosphere. These types of tans can last about two weeks and should fade away at the same rate as your natural tan.Paying for a specialist to give you a spray tan can be costly. Consider the cost before going out to get one.
This is a good option if you don't feel confident in applying your own fake tan.

, Tanning beds can be a nice choice for convenience and total privacy. Tanning beds will also create a consistent, full coverage tan even if you have several skin tones going on. The more pale areas should be more effected by the tanning bed UV rays and after a few trips to the tanning saloon, they should catch up to your darker skin.In a tanning bed, you can control which areas of your skin are exposed to UV rays and for how long. This will allow you to match the tone of your skin more accurately.
Beware of the damage caused by tanning beds. Tanning beds emit the same UV rays as the sun that can lead to skin damage and cancer.

"
Wear different cuts of clothing everyday.,
Avoid being in the sun when the UV rays are at their strongest.,
Prevent a farmer's tan with sunscreen.",How to Get Rid of Farmer's Tan3," Odd tan lines are due to long sun exposure in a specific cut of clothing. By mixing up what you wear, you can expose different parts of your skin to the sun to help even your skin tone out. For example, alternate between a tank top and T-shirt so you can avoid getting a tan line across your arm and neckline. You can even consider wearing loose-fitting long-sleeve shirts or pants to keep your skin covered from the sun.

, The sun is most intense from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. standard time. If you find yourself outside during these hours, try standing in the shade as much as possible. If shade is not an option, try keeping your skin protected with either clothing or sunscreen., The best way to protect your skin and stop unwanted tan lines from forming when you are out in the sun is to wear SPF 30 or higher. Even after you have seen the effects of the sun on your skin, continue applying sunscreen so your tan lines don't become even darker.


It takes thirty minutes for sunscreen to absorb into your skin and start protecting you from the sun's UV rays.If you know you are going to be outside in the sun all day, continuously apply sunscreen to your exposed skin every hour to prevent a farmer's tan from occurring.

Use .5%-1% hydrocortisone to relieve pain and itching.,
Take an over the counter antihistamine to stop itching.,
Use a topical anesthetic to numb your skin.",How to Get Rid of an Itchy Sunburn (Fair Skin)2," Hydrocortisone is an over the counter steroid cream that is often very successful at reducing inflammation, redness, and itching. It stops your cells from releasing inflammatory substances, which calms the skin.Apply hydrocortisone to your sunburn 4 times daily, rubbing it into your skin.Use hydrocortisone very sparingly on your face and for no more than 4 or 5 days., Sometimes the itchiness in a sunburn is caused by immune-system cells that release histamines to notify your brain that something is wrong.An antihistamine can suppress this reaction and temporarily relieve itching and swelling.Take a non-drowsy antihistamine (such as loratadine) during the day.Follow the directions on the box for dosage and use.
At night you can take a diphenhydramine, which can cause extreme drowsiness. Don’t try to drive, operate machinery, or do anything that might endanger yourself or others when taking this antihistamine. Just go to sleep!If the itching is severe, talk to your doctor about hydroxyzine. It is a prescription drug that sedates your central nervous system and also acts as an antihistamine.

, Available as sprays, creams, and ointments, a local anesthetic blocks nerve signals in your body so you won’t feel the itching sensation.To use the aerosol spray, shake the can well and hold it 4-6 inches from your skin. Spray it on the sunburn and rub in gently. Be very careful not to spray any into your eyes.For creams, gels, or ointments, apply the cream to dry skin and gently rub until it is evenly distributed. Look for brands that include aloe which can help soothe your skin."

Take a hot shower for severe itching that doesn't respond to treatment.,
Talk to your doctor about prescribing a high-potency steroid cream.",How to Get Rid of an Itchy Sunburn (Fair Skin)3," If you are experiencing what is known as the ""Hell Itch""--extreme itching that usually sets in about 48 hours after a burn, a very hot shower may be the best course of action. The Hell Itch does not respond to other treatments, and is so persistent and severe it can lead to sleep deprivation, depression, aggressiveness, and suicidal thoughts.If no other treatment works, including those recommended by your doctor, you may choose to try this method. If you are under 18, talk to your parents first.
Take a shower in water that is turned up as hot as you can stand.Don't use soap or scrub your skin--the hot water will dry your skin out and soap will make this worse.
Continue with the extremely hot showers until the itching subsides (usually about two days).The hot showers work because the brain can only process one sensation at a time. The heat of the water activates the pain nerves, which will suppress or shut down the sensation of itching., If the itching is so bad you can't concentrate on anything else--you can't work, can't sleep--and feel like you might go crazy, your doctor may be able to help with an aggressive treatment. A high-potency steroid cream may reduce inflammation and calm the itching.These medications are available by prescription only, and can weaken your immune system and cause other serious side effects. They should only be used in the most extreme cases."

Know the risks.,
Purchase a high SPF sunscreen.,
Cover your entire body generously with sunscreen.,
Prepare a comfortable area to lay out.,
Lay out in the sun.,
Make sure to flip over half-way through.,
Reapply sunscreen within two hours.",How to Get a Tan With Fair Skin1," Although you may want a ""natural"" tan, you should be aware of the serious health risks associated with the kind of extended sun exposure it requires. People with particularly fair skin should be aware that they are at an extremely heightened risk for all of these consequences:


Sunburn, while painful in its own right, is more dangerous for the link between it and melanoma, a form of skin cancer. The damage to the DNA in your skin cells caused by UV radiation from sunlight or tanning beds results in the unregulated growth of cancerous cells.
Though melanoma is treatable, it is also the type of skin cancer that causes the most deaths annually in the United States. The American Cancer society estimates that 120,000 Americans are diagnosed with melanoma each year.Extended UV radiation exposure can lead to premature aging of the skin.The price of a tan today will be the early onset of wrinkles, blotchiness, sagging, and leathery skin. These results have been observed in people as young as 20 years old.
Though you may not think of it, laying out can severely damage your eyes. Sunburn to the eyes, medically termed ""photokeratitis,"" can result in severe pain, temporary blindness, and longterm decline of eye function.UV exposure can also result in cataracts, a clouding of the eyes' lenses that occludes vision.Overexposure to UV radiation can suppress the healthy functioning of your immune system, leaving you exposed to illnesses your body should otherwise be able to fight off and potentially causing adverse reactions to certain medications.Indoor tanning beds put you at a much higher risk of all of these consequences; people with fair skin should never frequent tanning salons.;
, SPF stands for “sun protection factor,” and lets you know how long you can stay out in the sun without getting a sunburn. Keep in mind that sunburns are more than just uncomfortable — they indicate injury to skin cells that can result in cancer. Therefore, it’s very important that you use a high SPF product.


An SPF 15 product will extend the time it takes the covered area to burn by 15 times. For example, if your skin would normally get sunburnt after 10 minutes, you could stay in the sun for 150 minutes without burning if you wore an SPF 15 sunscreen.
Note that SPF products will not prevent you from tanning; they will allow you to stay out in the sun longer without damaging your skin cells.
People with fair skin are at a particularly high risk of burning easily in the sun, so purchase a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 35.

, Although it’s important to use a product with a high SPF, far more important is that you use enough sunscreen. Most people simply apply a thin layer, as they might for cream on their face. However, when the FDA tests the SPF of sunscreens, they use a layer as thick as “cake frosting.”Use more sunscreen than you think seems reasonable — a cake frosting layer of product.
Rub it into your skin as well as possible, but don’t worry if your skin can’t absorb all of the product immediately.
Let the rest of the product air dry.
Ask a friend to help you cover areas of skin that are difficult to reach, especially your back.
Make sure to cover all of your skin — your face, chest, neck, between your fingers, the bottoms of your feet, etc.

, If you have a beach or poolside chair, pull it into an area that receives a good amount of sun. Prepare some snacks and drinks, and perhaps take a book or some other activity to keep you occupied while you’re laying out.

, You may think that the best way to get a good tan is to lay out for a long period of time, but that can be extremely dangerous — especially for people with particularly fair skin. Because your skin has a higher likelihood of reacting badly, you should lay out for short periods of time, giving yourself days in between sessions to see how your skin reacts. You should never tan two days in a row.


Begin with half an hour of total exposure.
As your skin gradually darkens, you can lay out for longer periods of time.
Work your way up to an hour, but don't lay out too much longer than that.
Set a timer if you’re worried you’ll fall asleep or lose track of time.
Give your skin a few weeks to heal completely if you ever lay out too long and get burnt.

, Set a timer for half-way through the amount of time you plan to lay out — half an hour if you plan to lay out for the maximum recommended one hour. When the timer goes off, flip from your back to stomach (or vice versa) to make sure that you get an even tan all over your body.

, Especially if the weather is very warm, you’ll probably sweat off some of your sunscreen without even noticing it. However, even if you’re not sweating noticeably, the ingredients in sunscreen simply lose effectiveness within two hours of their original application.


Reapply a frosting-thick layer of sunscreen all over your body if you originally applied the sunscreen two hours ago or more.
Note that you shouldn’t lay out for two hours; this advice is simply for people who may have applied sunscreen at the beginning of the day, then decided to lay out later.

Repeat the self-tanning procedure as necessary.",How to Get a Tan With Fair Skin2," Consider your options carefully before making a purchase. If at all possible, try to test the product on a small patch of your skin to see what color it is; there’s nothing worse than committing to a product without testing it, only to end up looking like an orange!


Self-tanning lotions tend to last longer than sprays, and you can control the application more easily with your hands that through a spray nozzle.
Gradual tanning products deepen skin tone incrementally, whereas instant tanning products make an immediate, significant change. Instant products are far more noticeable, though, and can look silly if you change your skin tone too dramatically in one sitting.

, Though the fine hairs on your arms and the rest of your body won’t really interfere with the evenness of your tan, leg and chest hairs tend to be thicker. As such, you want to make sure that you apply self-tanning products to freshly shaved or waxed skin in those problem areas.

, Dry and dead skin cells react to the tanning products differently, so you want to make sure you’re working with an even surface of fresh skin. By removing the dead cells on the surface of your skin, you’ll ensure more even, natural-looking tan.


If you don’t have an exfoliating bath scrub, you can use an exfoliating glove or a hard loofah. Rub gently in circular motions, pressing hard enough to invigorate but not damage the skin.
Dry your skin thoroughly after your shower, as the product will have trouble binding to the skin if you’ve left it damp.

, Regardless of whether you’re using a lotion or a spray, self-tanning products are messy. You’ll be using your hands quite a bit to apply the product evenly, and you don’t want to have freakishly dark hands by the end of the process. To protect your hands, cover them with latex gloves.

, To keep track of where you’ve already applied the product, focus on one part of your body at a time: start with your legs, then do your arms, then your torso. Wait until the next step to apply the product to your face and neck.


If using a lotion, squeeze as much tanning lotion as you would normal moisturizing lotion into the palm of your gloved hands.
Use large, circular motions to apply the product evenly across your dry skin.
If you’re using a spray bottle, hold the bottle at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the skin when spritzing. This will avoid heavy, splotchy application and encourage an even mist.
Ask a friend to help you with your back regardless of which method you use, as it’s very difficult to both reach the skin on that area, and to see whether or not you’re applying the product in an even layer.
Don’t apply the product to the bottoms of your feet or your palms, as those areas don’t tan naturally.

, You don’t want to use as much tanner on your face and neck as you did on the rest of your body. The skin in these areas is more delicate, and the color will deepen far more easily here than on the rest of your body.

, Don’t put on any clothes while you’re waiting for the product to set. Be especially careful not to come into contact with any fabrics for the first ten to fifteen minutes after application, as the product will still be wet on your skin and will stain surfaces easily.


You can use a blow dryer to speed up the drying process.
Wait an least an hour before putting on any clothing.

, Once that period has passed, take a regular shower to clean your skin of any excess product that may have been left behind. Once you’ve done this, your self-tanning process is complete.

, Self-tanning products are temporary, and while some last longer than others, all will eventually fade away and reveal your fair skin again. Most products will have begun to fade within a week, so repeat the procedure whenever you feel you need to.


Remember that if your tan has not faded completely, you don’t need to use as much product to get yourself back to your originally desired color.

Accept that a flawless whole-body sun tan is physically impossible.,
Prevent sunburns.,
Take extra care in protecting the delicate skin of your face.,
Avoid straps while tanning.,
Change positions consistently.",How to Get an Even Tan1," Recent medical research has shown that different areas of the skin respond to sunshine differently, effectively tanning at different rates. No matter how perfectly you time your tanning, thicker patches of skin will always be a little paler than the surrounding area.


The same researchers have suggested sunless tanning as a safe, more effective method of achieving an even tan.;
, It's a commonly-believed myth that fair-skinned people must burn first to tan. While sunburns and tans are both reactions to damage from ultraviolet rays, they are two completely different processes.Not only is a burn not required for a tan, but burned, damaged skin often results in a patchy, uneven tan once it has healed up. If you see your skin turning red or start to feel a burn, you should get out of the sun.If you have light skin, wear a broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen while tanning. If you have naturally dark skin, SPF 15 is enough for protection.
Always be sure to reapply your sunscreen at least every two hours.
Remember that there is a maximum amount of tanning you can do in a day. At a certain point, your skin will produce no additional pigment but it will still be vulnerable to burns. This cut-off varies, but for most people it's generally about two to three hours.Sunburns usually don't show until well after the damage has occurred, so be sure to plan ahead.Don't ever fall asleep while tanning. If you think there's a possibility you'll start snoozing in the sun, be sure to wear a wide brim hat in addition to sunglasses. This will help to both protect your sensitive face in case your sunscreen isn't enough while also making sure those sunglasses don't cause embarrassing tan lines., The skin on your face tends to be more sensitive while also receiving more sun exposure than the rest of your body. Because body-formulated sunscreen can sometimes feel uncomfortable and leave behind residue, it can be easy to miss spots on your face, leading to an uneven tan. If you have this issue, try using a facial sunscreen. These are often formulated with less oils and feel lighter on your face., Try to expose as much skin as possible, but save your strappy classic bikini for after you've built up your tan. If you don't feel comfortable sunbathing topless, tube tops and bandeaus are good, strapless alternatives. You may still end up with tan lines, but they'll be low enough not to show when wearing most tops and dresses.If you must wear that strappy bikini top, when you're lying down to sunbathe, consider undoing your top's straps temporarily if possible. Just be careful not to let it slip off.
Give tan-through swimsuits and clothing a try. If sunbathing in the buff doesn't interest you, you can reduce and sometimes eliminate tan lines completely with these special sunbathing outfits. Just keep in mind that they still block out about 20% of sunlight, so they may not give you an even tan. Also remember to wear sunscreen underneath., If you're sunbathing lying down, flip over onto your back or stomach at regular intervals. Switch it up every 20 to 30 minutes.


Because the sun's rays vary in intensity throughout the day, this method won't give each side a perfectly equal exposure, but it should be enough for the most even tan possible.If possibly, try lying out on a reflective blanket. The reflected sun rays will help to even out your sun exposure, making sure to tan your sides as well as your front and back."

Choose your UV source.,
Hydrate your skin.,
Wear sunscreen when you tan!,
(Un)dress for success.,
Find your place in the sun.,
Move while you tan.,
Protect your eyes.,
Hydrate!,
After you tan, moisturize.",How to Get a Tan1," For ultraviolet tanning, nothing beats good, old-fashioned sunshine. If your skies or weather don't permit, though, tanning beds are an effective, year-round alternative to keep your skin lightly browned.


Keep it all in moderation—great looking skin can end up looking like leather if you stay in the ""oven"" too long.;
, Skin that's well hydrated will tan better than dusty, dry skin. Before you do prepare your skin to tan well, do the following:


In the shower, exfoliate dry, dead epidermal cells by scrubbing gently with a rough cloth, loofah, or exfoliating soap.
Moisturize your skin with a lotion containing sodium PCA. It's a naturally-occurring component of human skin that helps maintain a healthy epidermis, and works by attracting moisture from the air.
Apply the right level of sunscreen for your skin. If you have light skin, use a lotion with a higher SPF rating than if you have darker skin. No matter what your skin type or how much base you have built up, always use a sunscreen with at least an SPF rating of 15.
If you are going to be in the water, make sure your sunscreen is waterproof, or re-apply when you're out of the water. Otherwise, re-apply sunscreen as directed on the label—usually every couple hours.

, If you are just going to sit on the beach and tan for an hour put SPF 4-15 on, depending on how fair your complexion is and how much base you've already built up.


If you don't use sunscreen while tanning, UVA and UVB rays can still harm your skin, even if you don't get burned!
Use lip balm with sunscreen as well. Ideally, apply your sunscreen in the shade, and let it soak in for 20-25 minutes before you go into the sun. Reapply as needed if you go swimming and the sunscreen is not waterproof, or every couple hours as directed on the label.
If you notice redness developing on your skin, get out of the light—you're already burned, and continuing to bake will only deepen the burn and increase your risk of serious damage.

, Unless you want a patchwork quilt of tan lines, wear the swimsuit you will wear when you are swimming! Wearing the same swimsuit will give you a smooth, buttery tan that flows from skin to bathing suit.


Skip the swimsuit altogether if you can. The only thing better than minimal tan lines is no tan lines at all!

, You can tan in your own backyard, at the beach, or anywhere that the sun shines. All you need is your tanning lotion, water, and a beach chair or towel.


Position the chair or towel in the yard where the sun will hit you directly.

, Think ""rotisserie chicken."" To get that great, all-over browning, you have to keep on the move. Front, back, sides, and places where the sun doesn't normally shine—like underarms.Or spend one day on your backside and one day on your frontside


If you don't want to lie around all day, but still want that tan, another alternative is to go for a jog, or even a walk. This not only increases your sun exposure and increases your tan but helps give you a slim, toned body at the same time. Yummy!

, They can be burned, too. For tanning, though, it's better to either wear a hat or just keep your eyes closed rather than wear sunglasses. Bright light on your optic nerve stimulates the hypothalamus gland, which in turn causes the production of melanin, thus achieving a deeper tan.

, Make sure you drink plenty of water. Jump in the pool to cool yourself down now and then, too. Don't worry, this will not harm your tanning in the least. Don't forget to re-apply your sun screen afterwards.

, Use an aloe-based skin lotion to sooth and moisturize your skin. It will help keep your skin healthy and will prevent it from becoming flaky and dry from the sun.

Prepare your skin for a sunless tan.,
Try out a self-tanner.,
Be cautious with spray-on products.,
Treat your skin right after sunless tanning.,
Stay away from tanning pills.",How to Get an Even Tan2," Most sunless tanners require the same initial steps for the best results. This applies to all major types of self-tanner and to professional salon spray-on tans.


If you plan on waxing or shaving an area you'd like to tan, do so the day before getting a sunless tan. Sunless tanners interact with dead skin cells, and fading happens when these cells begin to slough away. Hair removal methods often remove the outer layer of these cells, causing a tan to fade faster.
Exfoliate your skin right before applying a self-tanner or going to a tanning salon. Be sure to focus on dry patches like your elbows. Excess dry skin can absorb more tanner than the surrounding area, giving you an uneven tan.
Wash your skin before applying self-tanner. Make sure your skin is as dry as possible afterwards.
Skip moisturizer and deodorant the day of. Ingredients in these products can affect the tanning process and may block tanner from being absorbed by the skin., Almost all self-tanners use the chemical dihydroxyacetone (DHA). This is a colorless chemical that interacts with the amino acids in dead skin cells to create a brown pigment similar to melanin. A second ingredient, erythrulose, also known as raspberry sugar, has also started showing up in self-tanners, usually in conjunction with DHA. Erythrulose enhances the effect of DHA for a longer-lasting tan that looks more natural on redder skin tones.Choose the right tanner for your skin type and skill level. Although the basic process is the same, self-tanner comes in many different forms, such as lotions, gels, mousses, and sprays. Lotions are the best product for beginners, as they take a little longer to absorb, letting you correct any mistakes you may make quickly. Gels spread easily on normal and oily skin, but are often too sticky for dry skin. Mousses spread quickly and dry fast.Sprays offer the most even coverage under optimal circumstances, but are relatively difficult to master. Best results with sprays are usually achieved by a second person applying the product for you, such as at a salon.
Pick the best tanner for your skin tone. Self-tanners vary in color intensity corresponding to their concentration of DHA, ranging from 1% to as high as 15%.If you are self-tanning for the first time, err on the side of caution and try a lower concentration, especially if you have lighter skin. The unnatural orange color that many people associate with self-tanner is usually caused by using a concentration of DHA too high for your skin tone.Do a spot test when using a new product. Before tanning your whole body, test a small amount of your tanner on a small, inconspicuous patch of skin. Rinse it off after a few minutes and wait 24 hours. Look for any signs of an allergic reaction. While safe for most people, DHA and other ingredients can give a serious rash to people with allergies. Testing on a small patch of skin will both minimize any damage and also give you a better idea of what the product will look like on your skin.
Apply the tanner in sections (arms, legs, torso) and massage it into your skin with circular, buffing motions. Prevent over-tanning your hands by washing them after each section. Applying a light amount of moisturizer to your hands and feet if they feel dry will also prevent them from absorbing too much tanner.Dilute the tanner at your elbows and knees, as these spots tend to absorb DHA quickly than others. Apply the tanner to your face in a very light but even layer. Consider using a slightly lighter self-tanner on your face for a more natural look.
Wait at least 10 minutes before getting dressed. Wear dark garments in case of staining. Wipe off any excess product from your skin.
Avoid bathing, swimming, or sweating for four to eight hours after application.Check any manufacturer's instructions for any special instructions regarding application times.

, While professional spray-on tans can have great, natural-looking results, they do have drawbacks. DHA is safe for external use, but it has not been approved for contact with the mucous membranes.Some physicians assert that DHA can potentially cause damage when in contact with living cells. Spray-on products are a possible risk, as they may be easily inhaled, introducing a relatively large amount of DHA to the living cells that line your lungs. If you choose to spray-tan, do your best to avoid breathing in fumes and to protect your eyes, mouth, and nose.


Self-tanners also come as sprays. While spray-on self tanners can give you a very even tan when used properly, they have the same risks as professional sprays., Unfortunately, sunless tanner typically last only three to seven days. Make sure to do the following to keep your skin healthy and stay tan as long as possible:


Moisturize your skin well with your choice of lotion. Keeping your skin hydrated will help your tan last as long as possible.
Use a full-strength sunscreen. Sunless tanners do not offer nearly as much UV-protection as naturally dark skin. People who use sunless tanners sometimes overestimate this minimal protection and end up damaging their skin.Minimize unprotected sun exposure for the next day or so. DHA temporarily increases the skin's susceptibility to certain kinds of UV damage., You may see advertisements for tanning pills containing the color additive canthaxanthin. Amounts of this chemical large enough to affect skin color can also cause severe damage to your skin, liver, and eyes. These pills are banned in many countries and are not worth their marginal cosmetic benefits."

Cover up tan lines with foundation.,
Apply self-tanner to lighter areas.,
Even them out with a little more sun.,
Exfoliate your skin once a week.",How to Get an Even Tan3," If you already have an embarrassing set of tan lines and were planning on wearing a strapless dress to a big event, don't panic. You can even out your tan for the night with just a little makeup. For the best results:



Match your foundation's color to the tan portion of your shoulder. This will likely be different from your regular face foundation.
Dab a generous portion of foundation both directly onto your tan lines and the surrounding skin. You can use a brush, a makeup sponge, a cotton ball, or even your fingers to apply.
Blend the foundation well. This is the most important step for making your makeup look discreet and natural. Using your preferred application tool, make small circular buffing motions all over your skin until the foundation perfectly blends in.
If you used a liquid or cream foundation, don't forget to finish up with a dusting of colorless setting powder. This will help your makeup last as long as possible and prevent it from rubbing off onto your clothes., This tactic is similar to wearing body makeup but lasts a lot longer. While the main ingredient in most sunless tanners, dihydroxyacetone (DHA), may cause DNA damage in high concentrations,dermatologists consider it to be much safer for your skin compared to sun tanning. Rather than staining your skin directly, DHA interacts with amino acids in your skin, producing pigments similar to those found in suntanned skin.Clean and exfoliate your skin. Wait at least half an hour afterwards to make sure your skin is completely dry. Also be sure to skip the moisturizer; the drier your skin, the better it will absorb the tanner.
Use a clean makeup brush to carefully paint tanner over your tan lines. Be careful to stay just within the pale parts of your skin. Remember that DHA isn't a traditional dye and it may bring already tanned sections of skin to a darker shade than the previously pale portions.
Let the self-tanner dry and check the color of your tan lines. If they're still obvious, brush on another layer. Keep doing this until they match the surrounding skin. This may take a few rounds of application.
To help your tan lines blend in better, before an even, mix a little liquid bronzer makeup into your body moisturizer and apply it all over your shoulders., If you have the time and patience, another sunbathing session or two is the easiest way to help make tan lines disappear. Your paler skin will likely tan quicker and eventually catch up with the surrounding skin over time.


You can also try applying a sunscreen with a higher SPF to already-tanned skin and use a lower SPF on your tan lines., Exfoliation helps to even out your skin tone, including your tan. It's also especially important to exfoliate while tanning because properly exfoliated skin absorbs moisturizers more readily, keeping your skin hydrated and looking great.


Exfoliating is especially great for making a bad sunless tan fade faster. Exfoliating a few days after any sunless tan will help it fade more evenly."

Increase your sun exposure gradually.,
Exfoliate regularly while tanning.,
Use sunscreen.,
Protect your eyes.,
Switch positions when laying out.,
Moisturize at least once every day.,
Stay hydrated.,
Increase your blood circulation.",How to Get a Proper Tan1," First and foremost, when you begin laying out in the sun, only get 1-2 hours of exposure at a time. Skip a day or two before laying out again. Melanin, the pigment in your body that colors your skin, is activated when UVA and UVB rays from the sun hit your skin. When this happens, more melanin is produced as a form of sun block, or protection from sun damage. In this process your skin gets darker, producing a tan.The melanin in your body is not in unlimited supply, however, and takes a couple of days to reproduce enough to protect you from getting burned. So, when developing your base tan, take it slowly, and don’t tan every day.Getting just one blistering sunburn while growing up doubles a person's chances of getting melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. And a person's risk of melanoma also doubles by getting more than five normal sunburns throughout their life.Typically, everyone reaches a plateau in his or her tanning. They simply don’t get any darker.To maintain your tan, continue to regularly lay out and follow the steps discussed below.;
, Exfoliating will remove dead skin, which blocks the sun’s rays. It also reduces your skin’s dryness, and dry skin doesn’t soak up the sun well. When exfoliating, use a loofah, a sponge or a fine-grade exfoliating bar of soap and scrub lightly all over your body while in the shower or bath. Apply a moisturizer after you dry off.Don’t use harsh and abrasive exfoliators, or you’ll end up rubbing off some of your tan or end up with splotches on your body.Don’t exfoliate after getting out of the sun. If you shower after going to the pool, for instance, exfoliate the next morning when you bathe.
And don’t exfoliate every day. Twice a week is sufficient. Much more will strip away natural oils, leaving your skin overly dry., Applying sunscreen before stretching out on your beach towel might sound counterproductive, but using sunscreen will let you tan more gradually and, therefore, make your tan last longer. About 20-30 minutes before you get in the sun, apply a sunscreen of SPF 15-45 when you first start tanning. The SPF factor you use depends on your skin type, or how easily you burn.Once you get a base tan, you can reduce your SPF factor but not below 10.
If you plan to get in the water, make sure you use a water-proof sunscreen, or reapply it after you get out.
Using sunscreen is also beneficial because it will keep you from burning, which can cause serious damage to your skin (not to mention cancer) and almost always results in peeling and flaking. If this happens, you have to start all over again.
Don’t forget to use a lip balm with sunscreen, too.

, When tanning outside, it’s important to protect your eyes by wearing a hat or sunglasses with UV protection. Your eyes can get burned, too, causing serious and lasting damage.

, Flip from your front to your back regularly so you get an even tan.When tanning your back, lay your arms palm-side up and vice versa. If it’s the beginning of the summer and you’re just starting to tan, you won’t (or shouldn’t) be out in the sun for more than two hours at a time. Remember, a gradual tan is a lasting tan. So, switch sides every 15-30 minutes. You'll also want to raise your arms above your head off and on to tan the undersides of your arms and your armpits.


If you start to feel drowsy, it’s time to get out of the sun. Or, if that’s not possible, get in the shade to avoid sunburn.

, Moisturizing your skin may be one of the most crucial elements of getting and extending the life of your tan because it keeps your skin from drying out, which is intensified by UV rays. Moisturize more than once per day, especially before you go to sleep and after showering. Apply a lighter moisturizer to the majority of your body during the day, and lather on a thick moisturizer before bed and on those body parts that move and bend a lot, such as your hands, elbows, ankles, knees and feet.Carry a smaller bottle with you to reapply to these “problem” areas frequently throughout the day.
If you’re prone to acne on your face, use a moisturizer that is oil-free and says “noncomedogenic,” meaning it won’t clog your pores., Here again, you want to avoid letting your skin become too dry so that it can absorb the sun’s rays. It also helps your body get rid of toxins, which will make your skin healthier and help your tan stick around longer. One way to do this is by staying hydrated from the inside. Drink plenty of fluids every day, and increase your water intake if you feel excessively thirsty or if your urine is a dark yellow in color.Regular moisturizing and drinking plenty of fluids is killing two birds with one stone when it comes to keeping your skin hydrated and tan-ready.

, Finally, another trick to getting a great tan is to work out before you lay out. Doing so increases your blood circulation, which then stimulates melanin production.So instead of driving to the public pool, jog or run there before diving right in.


There are also “tingle” tanning lotions you can apply before tanning that claim to bring more oxygen to the surface of the skin, thereby increasing circulation and exciting melanin to darken your tan."

Consider possible health risks.,
Pick the right sunless tanner.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Massage the self-tanner into your skin.,
Allow the self-tanner to dry.,
Minimize sun exposure for 24 hours after using a product with DHA.",How to Get a Good Tan when You Are Light Skinned1," While doctors generally recommend sunless tanning as a safer alternative to UV exposure, these products are not without drawbacks. The active ingredient in most sunless tanners is called dihydroxyacetone (DHA). DHA interacts with amino acids in your skin's outer layer to cause a browning effect. Some scientists have shown DHA to cause DNA damage at high concentrations.However, DHA is safe to use on skin where it is mostly absorbed by dead cells. Minimize your risks by avoiding spray-on products that may be inhaled and rinsing off excess tanner from your hands. Additionally, some individuals are allergic to this chemical, which can result in contact dermatitis., For pale skin, buy the lightest shade of self-tanner your product of choice comes in. Darker tanners contain higher concentrations of DHA. A too-dark sunless tan will look orange and unnatural on a person with naturally light skin.

, Removing excess dead skin before applying sunless tanner will help the color to last longer. Scrub gently with a washcloth or loofah. Pat your skin dry with a towel.







, Avoid areas near your eyes, nose, and mouth. There are two main ways you can avoid discoloring your palms:









Wear exam gloves during application.
Apply the tanner in sections (arms, legs, torso, face) and wash your hands between each section., Wait at least 10 minutes before getting dressed. Wait at least six hours before bathing or swimming. Re-apply the tanner daily until your skin reaches your desired hue., If you must be in the sun, wear sunscreen. While DHA provides transient UV protection, it may also temporarily boost the production of UV-induced reactive oxygen species. These molecules are a major contributor to sun damage, negatively impacting your skin's health and appearance."

Apply self-tanner.",How to Get a Good Spray Tan," It is best practice to exfoliate your skin and shave/wax the day before your appointment to ensure an even tan. You can use a water based exfoliant, a coarse salt or sugar based scrub, loofah, or washcloth to accomplish this.


You should never use an oil-based scrub because it will prevent the spray tan solution from evenly applying to your skin. Make sure to shave or wax at least 24-48 hours before your scheduled appointment in order to allow the pores to close. This prevents a dotted, uneven tan.;
, Make sure you remove these items before your appointment as these will create barriers between the skin and the spray tan solution resulting in an uneven tan.


Many salons will provide wipes with which you can remove makeup or deodorant if you happen to arrive to your appointment straight from work or another function.

, Bring loose fitting, dark clothing and flip flops or slide-ons to your appointment to wear after your spray tan. Tight fitting clothing and shoes might rub off the spray solution. Also bring a hairnet or cap to protect your hair.


Although most spray solutions are water soluble and will come out in the wash, it is best to wear darker clothing that will prevent any visible staining.
Do not wear socks with sneakers, slide-ons, or ballet flats immediately after your appointment. Socks can cause indentations on your skin that will be reflected in your spray tan. Pack appropriate rain gear to wear after your appointment if bad weather is in the forecast since rain can ruin the evenness of the tan.

, If you choose to spray tan with clothing on pack undergarments that you do not mind ruining since the solution may rub off on them. Keep in mind that whatever garment you wear during the session will be reflected in your tan lines.


Before choosing what undergarments you bring, think about what you might wear during the next week. For example, if you are getting married and wearing a strapless dress, you would not want to wear a bra with straps during the session.
Salons will often provide paper garments for you to wear should you choose not to bring your own.

, This will ensure that you have adequate time to remove makeup, deodorant, clothing, and jewelry without being rushed.

, If you have perspired during your ride over to the salon, you should either pack or ask for a towel with which you can wipe down any sweaty parts of your body. This will help reduce blotches and streaks when the spray tan solution is applied.

, If you are spray tanning for a specific occasion or event, you can do a test trial before the big day in order to make sure the tan will turn out how you imagined.


Spray tans generally last 7-10 days so, for example, if you want your tan to last longer for an upcoming event, you may want to have a darker spray to ensure longevity.

, If you have dry skin patches, wounds, or allergies your technician should be made aware so they can give you advice on how to deal with these areas.


Areas of dry skin may fade more quickly following your appointment. You can apply self-tanner to these areas to even out your tan.
If you have open wounds, you should refrain from spray tanning until they have healed.

, To help make sure your technician understands the shade of tan you would like it is helpful to bring along a photograph to demonstrate exactly how you want to look.


Consider bringing a picture of yourself with a tan you once had or a celebrity with the coloring that you desire., It is common to spray tan in either of these ways, so there is no need to feel shy if you prefer no tan lines.

, The technician will have you apply lotion to certain areas before the spray tan and will direct you as to how to stand and when to turn. Be sure to ask for clarifications or repetitions if you are unsure of the process since miscommunication could lead to an uneven tan. A spray tan session should only last about 5-10 minutes.


Either you or your technician will apply lotion or petroleum jelly to certain parts of the body where you do not want the spray solution to accumulate. These areas include nail beds, the spaces between toes, and elbows.The technician will usually begin spraying the front of the body from the top down. They will tell you when to turn so they can spray your backside. Be prepared that the spray tan solution will often be quite cold.
Be mindful of the technician’s instructions on how to stand and when to lift arms as their commands will help prevent any uneven coloring.

, This process usually takes about 10-20 minutes and can be sped up with special drying machines. After you are dry, put on your loose fitting, dark clothing and shoes. It is best not to wear a bra or anything else that may rub and disturb the tan solution.


Some technicians and salons will help aid the drying process with a machine.
Do not carry a clutch or heavy purse or backpack on your shoulders as this will cause unnecessary contact with your skin that could result in the spray tan solution smearing or rubbing off.

, You will want to clear your schedule for these 8 hours to be at home where you can relax in a comfortable, private environment.


Sometimes the spray tan solution will be darker before you wash it off so the technician can see where they have sprayed. If this is the case, you might not want to have to go back to work or a public place before showering.
Lay a dark sheet over your couch or bed during these 8 hours to avoid any residue from getting on your furniture.
Relax by watching television, reading, or another quiet activity while you wait for the spray tan to set. Avoid any activities that might cause excessive rubbing or smearing of the spray tan solution on your skin.

, Following 8 hours of no showering or excessive sweating, you can now take a shower carefully. Take a warm, quick shower in order to prevent any loss of tan coloring.


When showering, do not use hot water or take unnecessarily long baths since these will cause the tan to fade more quickly.
Do not exfoliate your skin excessively as this will cause the tan to fade.
After showering, gently pat your skin dry.

, Following your shower, you should use caution and properly moisturize with lotion in order to increase the longevity of your tan.


Use a lotion that is free of fragrance to moisturize.
Your spray tan salon may have a speciality spray lotion available for purchase that does not disturb your tan through friction of application.

, Chlorine in swimming pools will diminish the length of your tan so try to reduce pool time. Hot tubs are particularly dangerous as the combination of hot water and chlorine is detrimental to spray tans., If choosing to exercise, it is best to wait at least two full days before taking on workouts that will involve heavy sweating. However, be warned that sweating does cause the color of the tan to disappear faster so you may desire to moderate the intensity of your workouts.For example, you may choose to do a gentle yoga workout instead of an intense run.

, Some spa activities might react poorly with your spray tan and cause the color to break down. These include massages, scrubs, masks, manicures and pedicures, or microdermabrasion.Receive any spa treatments at least 24-48 hours before a spray tan appointment if you anticipate wanting these services in the week after receiving your spray tan.
Stay away from any products containing retinols or alcohol.

, Because certain areas of the body, such as feet or hands, might lose their coloring more quickly than others, you can extend the life of your spray tan by using a makeup sponge to apply a gradual self-tanner lotion to these problem areas."

Understand how indoor tanning beds work.,
Determine your skin type.,
Set a tanning schedule recommended for your skin type.,
Prepare your skin for indoor tanning.,
Determine what to wear during tanning.,
Protect your eyes from UV rays.,
Avoid cosmetics and perfumes while tanning.,
Make small adjustments in your body position while you tan.,

Avoid showering immediately after a tanning session.,
Avoid items that can cause a tan to fade.",How to Get a Good Indoor Tan," The natural sun emits 95 percent UV-A and 5 percent UV-B rays at noon during the summer months. Most indoor tanning beds also emit 95 percent UV-A and 5 percent UV-B rays, similar to the exposure of the summer sun.


Comprehend how the indoor tanning equipment tans your skin. The skin's epidermis, or top layer, contains melanocytes, which are cells that produce melanin when stimulated with ultraviolet light. When you sit under a tanning bed or in a tanning booth, the lamps stimulate the melanocytes to produce melanin, which appears as a dark pigment on the epidermis. The melanin is produced by your body as a way to protect you from further sun exposure. The longer the exposure to the tanning equipment's UV rays, the more melanin that is stimulated.;
, Most professionals at indoor tanning facilities can help you determine your skin type. Skin types range from Type 1, which is very light skin that burns immediately, to Type 5, which is dark skin that tans easily. Your skin type will help you determine how long and how frequently to tan indoors.

, Indoor tanning professionals will recommend a tanning schedule using incremental exposure times. These exposure times should be based on your skin type, and will help your skin develop a tan gradually without burning. For most skin types, a few indoor tanning sessions will be required for your skin to oxidize the melanin and result in darker skin.


Start slowly and gradually increase your indoor tanning exposure over time. Some indoor tanning facilities start all new customers off with 5-minute tanning sessions and gradually increase to 12-minute (or longer) sessions. Because indoor tanning lamps differ in UV strength and output, there is no formula for comparing indoor and outdoor exposure times. Consult the facility's staff to help you determine optimum exposure times.
Wait at least 48 hours between tanning sessions to avoid skin damage. Daily UV exposure can cause skin damage. However, if you wait too long between indoor tanning sessions, your tan may start to fade. Most indoor tanning professionals recommend 3 indoor tanning sessions a week until a tan is developed, and then 2 each week after that to maintain the tan. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations prohibit more than 1 indoor tanning sessions in a single day.
Avoid overexposure. You can tell if you have gotten too much UV exposure if your skin starts to sting while tanning. Stop tanning as soon as you feel any prickling or stinging sensations on your skin.

,


Exfoliate your skin daily for 1 week before your first indoor tanning session. Using a body pouf with gentle soap, scrub the skin in a circular motion. You also may use a commercial exfoliating kit, available at most beauty outlets and drug stores. When you exfoliate, you are removing dead skin and creating a smooth surface for tanning.
Apply an indoor tanning lotion. Lotions designed specifically for indoor tanning will maximize your tanning efforts. Apply the lotion in circular strokes all over your body for even coverage. Do not use outdoor tanning lotions, which can damage indoor tanning beds.

, What garments you wear during tanning is personal preference. Some people prefer to wear bathing suits or undergarments, while others choose to wear no clothing. Check with the professionals at your tanning facility to determine if there are any clothing requirements for tanning bed use.


Remove all jewelry before tanning. If you wear a watch or other jewelry, you will have white spots where the jewelry rested against your skin. For an even tan, remove all jewelry before indoor tanning.
Remove eyeglasses and contact lenses prior to tanning. The heat generated from the tanning bed can damage contact and eyeglass lenses.

, The U.S. FDA requires eye protection while utilizing an indoor tanning device. Most indoor tanning facilities provide eye protection free of charge, and all require that customers wear eye protection while tanning. Avoid looking at UV rays from the tanning equipment. Repeated exposure to indoor tanning UV rays could cause night blindness, retinal ulcers and blindness.

, Many cosmetics and perfumes contain ingredients that make you sensitive to light. These photosensitive ingredients could result in rashes, blotching, burning sensations or uneven tanning. Wash off all cosmetics and perfumes before tanning.

, Don't lay completely still in a tanning bed, but move your arms and legs slightly to maximize exposure to all parts of your body.


Do not rest your chin against your chest while you are reclining. This will result in a white spot under your neck because your chin blocked the UV rays. For an even tan, lay your head back, allowing exposure to all parts of your face and neck.

, Skin that is moisturized will retain a tan longer than dry skin. Apply a body lotion immediately after each indoor tanning session, and moisturize after every shower or bath.


Choose a lotion based on your skin type. Select a deep-penetrating lotion for dry skin and a lightweight lotion for normal to oily skin.

, Wait at least 3 or 4 hours after tanning to allow the skin's melanin to become fully stimulated.

, Every 30 days, the skin sheds its epidermis, which means your tanned skin fades naturally every 30 days. Hot water, indoor heating and harsh soaps increase the fading process.


Keep a tan from fading by moisturizing the skin every day, using mild cleansing products, showering in warm water and increasing your daily water intake.

Choose a good tanning salon.,
Decide how to build your base tan.,
Consider using special lotions.,
Wear sunscreen.,
Decide what or what not to wear in the bed.,
Prep your skin before tanning.,
Move around in the bed.,
Maintain your base tan.",How to Get a Proper Tan2," Tanning salons offer a variety of packages, specials, prices, products and use a variety of tanning beds, making it difficult to know which salon to choose if you don’t have a personal recommendation. Here are a few things to look for when deciding.


Ask for a detailed breakdown of their pricing before any specials, so you can see if you can afford their services when the special is no longer offered.
Think about convenience factors, such as how close it is to your home or work, whether or not you have to schedule appointments or if your gym already has tanning beds.
Ask if they use high-efficiency bulbs and how often they are changed. Ask if you can see the beds to get a look at how well maintained they appear.
Look around – is everything spick and span? Do you see employees going in and out of the booths cleaning beds between customers? If the reception area is dirty, for instance, that’s probably not a good sign.
Talk with the staff. Well-trained professionals should help you determine your skin type, which they’ll use to create a tanning schedule so you tan fairly quickly but without getting scorched.

, Getting a base tan will occur with consistent and incremental increases in tanning sessions, tanning times and tanning bed levels. This will all be determined by the schedule you’ve created with the salon you’ve selected. A general rule of thumb is that at first you will only tan every 2-4 days for about 5 -7 minutes and then build from there.Don’t assume that if you have light skin you just need to tan longer. The likely result of doing this will be a bad burn.

, Salons will try to sell you all kinds of lotions designed to make you tan faster and darker, to make your tan last longer and so forth. Many of these lotions – accelerators, maximizers, bronzers, intensifiers – are quite expensive and reviews on how well they work are mixed. Go online and see what others have to say.


If you decide to experiment, try one at a time. If you use more than one, and you find you’re getting the results you hoped to achieve, you won’t know which lotion was responsible. Trying one at a time, then, is the less expensive way to go.
They can also often be purchased much less expensively online than in the salons.
Wait to shower if you use a bronzing lotion. After you tan in a tanning bed, wait 3-4 hours before you take a shower if you use a bronzing lotion that you find is working for you. Also, it is a myth that showering after using a tanning bed will somehow wash away your tan. It won’t., Just as with tanning outside, tanning beds expose your skin to UV rays. If you decide to use a tanning lotion, see if it has SPF protection and a factor of at least 15. If not, get and apply one 20-30 minutes before you bed in the bed.

, Some people prefer to go nude, while others decide to wear the bathing suit they plan to wear in the summer. Either is fine.


Using different bathing suits, however, will leave your tan uneven, and perhaps even with a variety of tan lines jig-jagging across your body.
You will also want to wear the goggles they provide to protect your eyes, or purchase your own. Closing your eyes or putting a towel over them won’t protect them from UV rays, which can cause significant damage to your retinas. Also, to avoid raccoon eyes, move the goggles around on your eyes throughout each tanning session.

, Like tanning in the sun, always make sure you exfoliate prior to tanning in a tanning bed or booth. Moisturize after exfoliation as well.

, Just as you would when laying outside in the sun, you want to adjust your body so that all parts are being exposed to the light for about the same amount of time. In a tanning bed, you don’t have to flip from front to back because the lights are both above and below you, and to one degree or another around you. So twist in different directions occasionally.


Think about the places where your body is bent (like in the crook of your arms or at the base of your neck), or where your skin is bunching up. If you don’t readjust often enough, this will create tanning wrinkles.

, Once your base tan is established, you will likely drop to tanning just 2 days per week. A good salon won’t try to convince you that you need more than that. Also, continue your regimen of exfoliating, moisturizing and drinking plenty of fluids.

Choose a self-tanner.,
Prep your skin, eyebrows and hairline.,
Put on disposable, tight-fitting latex gloves.,
Use a little lotion.,
Apply the self-tanner in sections.,
Begin the drying process.,
Fix mistakes.,
Maintain your tan.",How to Get a Proper Tan3," There are a variety of self-tanning gels, creams, lotions, mousses and sprays on the market from which to choose. You'll also need to select a self-tanner based upon its shade, which is dictated largely by a color additive called DHA (dihydroxyacetone).Choose one with your skin tone in mind, not the desired result. If you have a fairer complexion, go for a medium tone. If you have an olive complexion, go for a darker tone. Here are some more tips.


The best way to select one initially is to go online and read reviews.
Self-tanners that contain green pigments help offset the orange effect.Lotions are often best for beginners because they take longer to absorb, giving you more time to correct mistakes, while mousses and sprays dry faster so are best used by the more experienced.
Gels spread easily and work well for people with normal to oily skin.
Do a skin patch test first by applying some to your stomach, which is usually pale, and let it dry and set overnight. In the morning take a look to see if the color looks good on you., You want to prepare your skin prior to applying the self-tanner you've chosen. So shave or wax, exfoliate from head to foot and make sure your skin is completely dry. The last part is critical. Also apply Vaseline to your eyebrows and as close to your hairline as possible so if you get the self-tanner on your eyebrows or hair neither will change color.If you wax, however, do so at least 24 hours before you put on the self-tanner so your skin doesn't become irritated. Waxing, in fact, might be better than shaving because shaving every day can reduce the life of your tan by stripping it away.
For the same reason, limit your exfoliation. Self-tanners typically only last up to a week, so don't exfoliate until right before you reapply. Avoid exfoliators that are oil-based because they leave residues that can cause streaking., These will keep your hands from getting overly orange or dark while you are applying the self-tanner.Alternatively, you can thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water after you apply the self tanner to various sections of your body., Dab some non-oil-based lotion to your knees, ankles, elbows, around your nostrils and other particularly dry areas to help the self-tanner better absorb into these areas. Some people will put a thin layer of lightweight lotion all over their body before applying self-tanner, but this is not needed and many recommend against doing it altogether.

, To eliminate tan line creases from bending over, start at your feet before moving on to your ankles and legs. Use about 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) at a time and blend using small, circular motions with your hands. Next apply it to your stomach, chest, shoulders, sides, arms and armpits. Remove your gloves and apply a little to your hands, avoiding your palms. Then use a lotion strap, wand, or sponge paintbrush to cover your back with the self-tanner. Finally, apply it to your face by using a dime-sized amount to your cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin, blending outward with your fingertips. Use the remainder around your hairline and jawbone.Wash your fingertips thoroughly with soap and water after applying the self-tanner to your face.
You can buy the items for back coverage online relatively inexpensively. If you don’t feel comfortable using them, you could ask someone to apply the self-tanner to your back for you.
If you’re using a spray self-tanner, you can apply it to your back in the shower. Hop in, look over your shoulder, spray plenty into the air behind you and then step back into the mist. Do this several times to make sure you get enough on your skin., To speed up the drying process, take a blow dryer, and on low heat, blow-dry all the areas that you’ve applied the self-tanner. You only need to apply the heat for a few seconds to each area. After that, it’s a matter of waiting. Even if some claim to dry in 15 or 20 minutes, wait at least an hour before you put on any clothes or go to bed.Before putting on clothing, use a brush to thinly coat your body with talc-free baby powder. This will help prevent any color from getting on your clothes.Because getting wet is your tan’s worst enemy during this time, don’t shower or exercise (sweat) for at least six hours after you apply self-tanner.
Your best bet is to put the self-tanner on about an hour or two before you go to bed. You also might want to wear long sleeves and pants, and put some towels down on your bed, to ensure no color gets on your sheets.

, If you wake up and notice splotches, streaking or uneven distribution, there are a couple of things you can do to help fix the problems: a) add just a little bit more self-tanner and blend it really well (this works best for areas that are lighter or for splotches) and b) rub lemon juice on the area for 1-2 minutes and then buff it with a damp towel (this works better if an area got too dark or for streaking).

, Different self-tanners last for different lengths of time, though typically you will need to reapply once per week. You can help lengthen that amount of time by moisturizing regularly; washing with gentle, non-abrasive cleansers; avoiding acne treatments containing retinol; and not exfoliating more than once between applications.


Remember: Although you look tan, you still need to wear sunscreen when you go into the sun."
"
Get your skin ready.,
Dress appropriately.,
Decide upon your tan setting.,
Apply barrier creams.,
Prepare for your spraying.,
Avoid water, exercise and touching your skin.,
Wait 8-12 hours to shower and wash your face.,
Maintain your spray tan.",How to Get a Proper Tan4," First, wax or shave 24 hours before your spray tan. On the day of your spray tan, use a non-oil-based exfoliator to remove dead skin and to get a more even tan, paying close attention to dry areas and to your neck, chest and face where you’re more likely to streak. Don't use any oils or moisturizers when you're done bathing. Before you get your spray tan, wash your face well to remove any make-up., While you’ll have time for the spray tan to dry before you get dressed, it's still advisable to wear dark clothes. Also, while in the tanning booth you can go nude, in a swimsuit or in a thong/pair of underwear. If you opt for the latter, wear one you don't care about becoming perhaps permanently discolored.


Remember to bring another pair of underwear with you to wear afterward.

, As with self-tanner, you don't want to overdo it. If you have a fair complexion go for a light or medium tan. If you have an olive complexion, opt for medium or dark.


Note: Different spraying machines will have different settings and color options. The key point is to avoid overkill. Subtle changes are more flattering than drastic ones – the charbroiled look simply isn't attractive on anyone.

, After you've stripped down, you'll want to put on either a barrier cream or lotion to areas of your body that you don't want the spray tan to touch, such as your palms, between your toes and fingers and on the soles of your feet. The salon will typically provide these creams., If you go to a salon where a professional does the spraying, they'll have you move into different positions, so tuck away your shyness for a few minutes. Some booths are more like an automatic car wash, in which you go in and are instructed when to turn and so forth. And then there are the self-spray booths, which are much less expensive, but the rate of streaking and splotching also often goes up, too.


During the process, you'll receive the tanning spray itself, and then often a moisturizing mist and an air dry.If you don’t get an air dry and excess solution lingers on your skin, forming clear or brown droplets, you'll need to lightly towel dry them quickly so they don’t run down your body and form streaks. Instead of drying from head to toe, start at your feet and wipe up your legs. Then start at your wrists and wipe up your arms to your shoulders. Finally, finish with your face, drying from your chin to your forehead., Your tan will continue to develop for several hours, and your skin will feel sticky. If you do touch your skin during this time, though, wash only the underside of your hands to get off the tanning solution. Also avoid skin contact with water or don’t exercise (again, sweat) during the developing phase.

, Doing this will allow for your tan to fully develop. When you take your first shower, don’t be surprised if you notice color washing off. This is just bronzer that is part of the tanner. Your tan will still be intact.

, A spray tan typically lasts between 4-10 days. Similar to using self-tanners, do not exfoliate between sessions and limit your shaving as much as possible to extend your tan’s lifespan. Moisturize at least once per day, especially before bedtime, but use one that has a water base to avoid streaking. Here are some other things to avoid, which also apply to self-tanners.

Dermatologists recommend a minimum SPF of 15, but individuals with very fair skin will likely need one with a higher rating., Most sunscreen manufacturers advise to reapply every 2 to 3 hours. However, earlier reapplication is often necessary, especially for people with fair skin. Apply more sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes after any activities that may remove the sunscreen from your skin, such as sweating, swimming, or toweling off., Start out sunning yourself for only about 15 minutes each day. After about a week, work your way up to a maximum of 30 minutes. Stop sessions sooner than planned if you start to burn. While many think that longer, more intense tanning sessions are the quickest way to a great tan, this is not generally true, especially for fair-skinned people. The optimal amount of time in the sun to stimulate melanin production without damaging your skin is only about 30 minutes., Damaging UV rays are at their peak between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm. Instead, tan in the early morning or late afternoon. If you must tan at peak hours, be sure to wear a sunscreen with a high SPF., A wide-brimmed hat will protect your sensitive scalp while letting some diffuse light in to tan your face. Sunglasses will protect your eyes from sun damage, which can lead to cataracts and other vision problems. Don't fall asleep with either on to avoid embarrassing tan (or burn) lines., Your lips can burn just as easily as the rest of your skin. The sun can also dry them out quickly, leading the painful chapped lips. SPF lip balms offer protection against both types of damage."

Keep in mind any medications you are taking.,
Steer clear of tanning beds.,
Refrain from tanning pills.",How to Get a Good Tan when You Are Light Skinned3," Even cautious tanning may lead to health problems down the line. Dermatologists assert that any UV-induced changes to your natural skin tone indicate damage. Be sure to weigh the cosmetic benefits against long-term health risks., Certain medications, such as retinoids and some antibiotics, can dramatically increase your skin's susceptibility to sun damage. Before you tan, carefully read all warning labels and literature for your medications, vitamins, and health supplements. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.If you are taking any unprescribed dietary supplements or herbal medicines, it is very important to do your own independent research. The FDA regulates this class of products much more loosely than conventional drugs. Warning labels are not required, and supplements may actually contain ingredients with different concentrations and even identities than those advertised., Indoor tanning uses high-intensity UV rays that are often too much, especially for fair skin. Although tanning beds are marketed as a safe alternative to natural sunlight, they actually represent a number of added health risks:


Premature aging of the skin.
Blinding eye diseases.Infectious diseases, such as herpes and warts, from improperly-cleaned equipment.

, There are no currently FDA-approved pills for enhancing your skin's color. Tanning pills typically contain the pigment canthaxanthin and are illegal to import and sell within the United States. When ingested in large amounts, this substance commonly causes damage to the eyes, skin, and digestive system. "

Go all natural with sugar exfoliation to even out dark spots.",How to Fix a Fake Tan1," Common problem areas for post-fake tans occur around the jaw line, edges of the face, or on the neck where skin is sensitive and left vulnerable for skin irritation. If you find yourself with fake tan blotches in these areas, instead of removing them, try to cover them first to protect your skin. Use either a foundation or a tinted moisturizer to disguise the blotches.


First, exfoliate your skin by dampening your face with warm water and then gently rubbing your skin in circular motions with a cream or wash cloth.
Then, apply a generous amount of face lotion, again rubbing in circular motions which will help restore your natural tone.
Lastly, apply the foundation or tinted moisturizer, covering your face and neck evenly resulting in a fresh face. Stay away from heavier foundations that may draw attention to any uneven colors.;
, Adding a third shade of tan to your face will only exacerbate the problem. When choosing the right foundation color for you, don't match it only to the tone of your face. It is wiser to match it to the tone of your neck so you do not have two different skin tones visible.


Next time, don't use fake tan on your face. Instead, buy a foundation that matches your skin with the fake tan. You can then play around with your foundation by mixing it with your lighter color to match your fake tan as it fades.

, Sometimes, it can look like you just dipped your arm into a can of orange paint. The best solution for correcting tan lines on hands and wrists are to simply add more tanner and blend them in.


Apply a small amount of additional self tanner onto a cotton ball. Do not apply the tanner directly to your hands or wrists, but instead start from the middle of your arm work your way down to ensure a gradual transition. Use a circular motion as you apply.
Plan where your stopping line will be so you can better blend in the tanner. It should be near where your thumb connects your wrists.
Be sure to tan the top of your hands but not your palms! You do not want tan arms and white hands. Use your finger to make small circular motions around the area where the side of your hand meets your palm.

, A lot of people are afraid of tanning their hands because they don't want their knuckles to turn orange. The skin in this area can be rough and dry, causing it to absorb more tanner and turn out too dark.


To avoid this, simply moisturize your knuckles or any dry, rough area before applying fake tan products. This will prevent rougher areas from looking too dark because the lotion keeps some of the tanner from absorbing.

, These areas have multiple skin types in close quarters which makes it easy for dark blotches. To fix these streaks and spot, gently exfoliate with a warm wash cloth and then add more fake tan.


Put the fake tan on a cotton ball and begin apply midway up your calf. Work your way down using circular motions. The closer you get to your foot, the less fake tan there should be on the cotton ball.
Without applying anymore fake tan, keep applying all around your ankle and feet.
Stop along the bottom sides of your feet.

, Organic sugar scrubs, as will products with lactic acid, AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) or BHAs (beta hydroxy acids), help cell turnover. The best type of sugar to use is organic brown sugar because the grains are softer and smoother. Simply mix one part sugar with two parts water together in a bowl. After you have your mixture ready, softly spread it onto the problem areas with your fingers and rub it onto your skin for about one minute. Let it sit for three to five minutes before rinsing off with warm water.


This sugary fix helps to hide unnatural hues and it’s a safe and natural alternative to lathering your skin with synthetic chemicals that may do more harm than good."

Dab on some dairy.,
Mix lemon juice with aloe juice.,
Combine buttermilk and tomato juice.,
Attack a fake tan with baby oil.",How to Fade Your Tan Fast1," The lactic acid in milk not only combats pigmentation problems, but stimulates collagen to improve your skin’s firmness and refines the appearance of wrinkles and lines. You can receive its benefits by dipping your hands directly into milk or milk mixtures, or by buying skincare products containing lactic acid.



Full-fat Greek yogurt is another popular choice. Massage it into the tanned skin, let it sit for twenty minutes, and then wash it off with warm water. Repeat daily. Its fat content also moisturizes! Lactic acid peels are also available for more extreme, ongoing treatment (in case of irregular, unwanted pigmentation spots in skin), but skin generally takes time to adapt to and fully tolerate the process. Therefore, it's not best for our purposes here.;
, Lemon juice will dry your skin out, but has lightening properties. Adding aloe juice for its moisturizing properties makes for a winning combination. 









Don’t sweat the ratios too much. Mix equal-ish parts aloe and lemon juice, rub it into your skin, and wash the area twenty to thirty minutes later.
You should especially steer clear of the sun with any lemon juice-based mixture on your skin, as it can make your skin extremely sensitive to UV rays. , Tomato is a natural bleaching agent, and we already know about dairy. Apply two parts buttermilk and one part tomato juice to the tan via cotton ball, and wash off after thirty minutes. 








, With spray-on tans in particular, baby oil proves highly effective in helping you slough off that uppermost layer of color. Exfoliation is still the name of the game (and skin cell removal is the idea) so after leaving the baby oil on the area for thirty to forty minutes, take a bath and exfoliate appropriately.

Hydrate your skin and moisturize it.,
Exfoliate your skin before you tan.,
Make sure you prevent sunburn.",How to Get a Darker Tan1," Doing both of these things will make your tan last longer, and you will tan better too. You also shouldn’t shower for four hours after using tanning lotion, so your tan won’t fade.


Working out before you tan is another way that you can tan faster. This is because working out will increase blood circulation, which will allow for better tanning.
To hydrate your skin, you should drink a lot of water throughout the day. Keeping your skin moisturized with lotion will also prevent it from fading after you’ve already gained the tan.;
, This means you remove dead skin cells from the outer layer of your skin, allowing for a better tan.Exfoliating will also get rid of any patches of rougher skin, improving the overall look of your skin. You can exfoliate with a loofah, an exfoliating mitten, and with exfoliating scrubs.Apply the exfoliating scrub in small, circular motions all over to help remove dead skin cells and smooth the skin's surface. This will help to ensure a more even tan and help to make your tan last longer.

, If you tan the wrong way, you’re going to end up with a severe burn, not a dark, good-looking tan. So do it the right way, and protect your skin.Your skin will be less susceptible to burning if you’re already tan or have spent a lot of time in the sun.Watch the degree of time you spend out in the sun. Too much sun exposure can make you sick and result in a severe burn, not a darker tan. Any tan not from a lotion or spray must be obtained gradually and with proper sunscreen.
Don’t use baby oil to tan. It can cause a severe burn. Always use an SPF lotion or spray, preferably factor 15 or over. Contrary to popular belief, this will not stop you from tanning; it will simply help to protect the skin from UV damage, including drying, premature aging and even skin cancer.

Consider simply lying out in direct sunlight.,
Find a way to pass the time.,
Optimize your tanning time.,
Always tan safely to avoid sunburn and permanent skin damage.,
Consider using tanning oil.,
Get an even tan.",How to Get a Nice Tan1," Tanning naturally is safer than tanning beds, and it will give you the most natural results.;
, Sleeping is good because it causes the time to pass faster, while reading a book blocks some of the sunlight while on your back. Carefully time a nap, say an hour to an hour and a half, and set an alarm to wake up after that time has passed. Then, turn over to the other side and fall back asleep. You can potentially repeat this process until you have reached the tan you want.


If you are in a public area while using this method, always make sure to be in a safe environment. Ideally, keep someone near you that you know, who can protect you while you're alone and unconscious. Try not to sleep with music playing in ear-buds or headphones, because if anything happens to your belongings or body while asleep, you want to be able to hear it.

, Lie out between the hours of 10 a.m- 2 p.m, as this is the time of day when the sun is the most intense. Consider lying out when the weather is partly cloudy. This can make for a more powerful tan when the sun reflects off the clouds in the sky, intensifying the amount of sun rays your body receives. Try lying out in or around water. Water is another natural intensifier.

, You must always use sunscreen when tanning, no matter where you are. Apply your suntan lotion 30 minutes prior to going out into the sun so that it can soak into your skin. Re-apply lotion in the shade every hour, and don't just touch it up. Do it all properly again. Make sure you stay in the shade for 10 minutes for every hour that you spend in the sun.


If you are using the napping method, use no lower than 20-30 SPF sunscreen for any sleeping time under an hour, and use no lower than 40-50 SPF sunscreen when sleeping for longer than an hour. Re-apply sunscreen between naps. Sun damage is a very real thing, and it happens whether you see it or not.
Also remember to apply sunscreen every time you exit water. Even though some sunscreens claim they are waterproof, they can easily wear off. Try to apply when dry to make sure that the lotion sticks.
Drink a lot of water so you don't dehydrate.

, You can find it near the sunscreen section of many drugstores and grocery stores. Be careful when using tanning oil, because it can work quickly. It's better to get a base tan and build from there, than to get burned by the sun. Don't use a heavy cream, as it will clog pores and be sticky.

, Contrary to popular belief, lying still for long periods of time will actually make you burn faster. Being active and moving allows for the sun to not be concentrated on to one area for long periods of time. The easiest way to get an even tan while staying active is to flip from your stomach to your back and vice versa, every 5-10 minutes.


Try to get an even tan by making sure no part of your body is in the shade so you don't get any funny white marks on you.
Remember to turn over to get your back as well as your front, as it needs just as much color. You will also need to turn on your sides so you can tan the sides of your legs, hips, waist.
Wear strapless bikinis or tops to avoid strap marks. Consider tanning topless.

Combine sugar and fresh lemon juice to remove botched fake tans.,
Turn to baking soda and lemon juice for a gentle scrub.,
Remove any dark, over the lip mustache spots.,
Use an astringent toner or toothpaste to smooth out a patchy application.,
Try peroxide or anti-dandruff shampoos to strip off the streaks.,
Head to your nearest drug store and pick yourself up a bottle of hair removal cream.,
Use a scrubbing mitt to remove fake tan quickly.",How to Fix a Fake Tan2," Lemon juice is naturally acidic and it acts like a mild bleach. It works to remove unwanted color from patchy and flaky tans. Make sure you use fresh lemon juice because already squeezed lemonade that you buy at the store may have different chemicals in it that you may not want to apply onto your skin. Simply cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice out into a bowl.


Then, mix one cup of raw sugar with 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.
Dip a cotton ball into your mixture, and wipe the streaky orange areas using circular motions. Your candy corn discoloration should be diluted after several minutes of light massaging.Use a loofa or other scrub brush with the lemon juice and sugar mix for a more aggressive way of completely removing your fake tan.

, Sugar is course and can be rough to scrub against your skin. If yours is too sensitive for the sweet solution, try baking soda instead to strip the fake tan right off. It is nonabrasive and leaves your skin feeling incredibly smooth. However, it may take a little longer to get rid of the streaks.Grab a bowl and mix equal parts baking soda with fresh lemon juice. Mix together until the powder becomes a paste. If your mixture seems more like a liquid, add more baking soda. You want the spread to stay on your skin and not run right off.
After you have developed your desired consistency, spread it on your skin and begin rubbing in soft, circular motions. Focus on the areas of extreme streakiness until the unwanted tan disappears. Don't scrub for more than three minutes.
When you are finished, clean off with water and a wash cloth or jump in the shower.

, Many people attempt to tan their face only to find that it doesn’t spread evenly or forgivingly. If your face is oily, sweaty, or dry, you will end up with dark patches that refuse to blend in, especially over your lip where fine hair grows. When blending in this undoubtedly tricky area, or anywhere on your face, you have to be very gentle because the skin on your face is sensitive and you can easily break capillaries if you scrub too hard.


To lighten above your lip, wet a wash cloth with warm water and gently rub for about 30 seconds using circular motions. The area will lighten up quickly because you are simply cleaning off the tanner that is attached to the fine hair above your lip.
Pull your lips in tight, hiding them while you apply the tanning spray or cream.
Do not apply the fake tan directly around your mouth because it will stick more easily here than in other facial areas. Instead, bring down existing tanner from your cheekbones and lightly rub on thinner amounts.

, If you have streaks in areas where you skin is dry or rough, you need to exfoliate your skin before you apply more fake tan to even out your first job.


Take the astringent toner or toothpaste and apply them on a dry washcloth. Gently massage your patchy areas in a circular motion until you can see the fake tan rubbing off.
Then, wash off your skin with warm water and apply the fake tan again. After you give the tan enough time to develop, you can determine if it is dark enough. If you want a darker look, or if you still see streaks, repeat the procedure.
You may need to repeat this step up to three times in order for it to look the way you want it to.

, These products are designed to take off the top layer of skin and change the DHA in skin, essentially lightening the fake tan. However, they may also irritate sensitive skin, so exercise caution. If you decide to use them, dilute the chemicals with moisturizer and avoid your face and neck at the very least. Never apply them immediately after shaving or exfoliating.


Cut either the peroxide or anti-dandruff shampoo with half parts moisturizer cream and apply the mixture to a wash cloth. Gently rub your skin in circular motions for a couple minutes.
Stop rubbing your skin once it becomes irritated or it starts to burn.

, A quality hair removal cream should help to erase those disastrous fake tan spots.


Simply apply your hair removal cream, let it sit for the recommended time in the directions on the package, and wipe off. While this may work like an eraser, beware of skin irritation. Hair removal cream works by using strong chemicals that strip off dead skin cells.
If you have sensitive skin, this may not be the best method for you., If you notice shortly after application that your tan is headed in the wrong direction, the fastest method is to slough it off with a specialty exfoliator mitt. These mitts are double-sided for easy access to areas that are hard to reach. Before using, it is important to soften your skin in the shower or bath first and dampen the mitt.


Squeeze any excess water from the mitt and use reasonable pressure to rub your skin in a rapid vertical direction. You should see folds of dead skin and more importantly, fake tan, begin to roll away.Soak in a bath to remove self-tanner pigment. This is a great way to loosen the top most layer of dead skin cells before you use your mitt.
Add in a body wash to your bath to create bubbles that will also help exfoliate your skin."

Understand the process of fake tans.,
Prep your skin beforehand.,
Wait to get in the shower.,
Try using tinted self-tan products.,
Stay away from that orange glow.,
Keep your fake tan from premature fading.,
Use gloves to prevent orange palms.,
Wait to get dressed.",How to Fix a Fake Tan3," Sunless tanning products work on the top layer of skin which are the dead skin cells you rub off during exfoliation. The dihydroxyacetone (DHA) in the fake tan products reacts with the amino acids in the dead skin cells to produce melanoids, which result in increased pigmentation in that top layer. This means that a sunless tan only goes as deep as the top layer of your skin, and does not extend any further.To create a good fake tan, you have to start with an even top layer of skin.

, Total body exfoliation and moisturizing are a must for even fake tan results. Shave your legs, exfoliate your body and face, and moisturize everywhere you apply the fake tan. Start exfoliating a few days before you self-tan, and avoid over-moisturizing immediately before you apply the product.


When you do apply the tanner, do it slowly and be sure to rub it in completely, paying extra attention to the knees, elbows, feet, and neck, all parts of the body that will absorb the tanner more readily.

, You need to let the tanner set for the recommended length of time before you get your skin wet. If the fake tan has not completely set and dried on your skin, water will create streaky lines. When you have waited long enough and you are ready to shower, do not use body wash or a luffa to scrub your skin immediately after. This will tamper with the tone of your tan. Simply wash your body with your hand and warm water.


When you dry off, make sure you are pat dry dry instead of rub dry with a towel. Rubbing will remove your tan because your skin will be wet and soft.
After your shower, be sure to moisturize your entire body.

, These fake tanners are most fool-proof because you can see the distribution of the sunless tanner before it develops. Using tinted products usually produce better results. Opt for a lotion instead of a quick-drying foam, for a better window of opportunity to correct any uneven spots before the DHA starts reacting with your skin and sets., When trying out a new brand of self-tanner, always start with a light to medium shade, rather than a dark one at first. You can always go back and apply the darker shade, but it is difficult to undo the damage once you've turned bright orange. For the first time using a fake tan, you can even try diluting your self tanner by mixing it with equal parts lotion.


If you do decide to dilute the fake tan, make sure you mix them completely together so you don't end up with streaks and spots.

, Since you can exfoliate to fade an uneven tan, you can also exfoliate away a perfect tan. To keep your beautiful glow around as long as possible, avoid shaving your legs for 48 hours after you've applied the product. Also, for the first few days after application, don't take long baths or go in chlorine-filled pools, because they will rub off the top layer of skin and interfere with the DHA reaction., Nothing says faux tan like orange palms and feet. To make sure this does not happen, apply the tanning lotion or cream with latex or plastic gloves. However, it can be slightly more challenging to apply the tanner with gloves on, so if you think it will cause more harm than good, skip the gloves and just make sure you wash your hands many times during the application process.


Work on one body part at a time, and wash your hands before moving on to the next area.

, You don't want to smear your tan or stain your clothes by getting dressed too soon after your application. Wait at least 15 minutes after you've finished applying it to get dressed. To ensure that the self-tanner has set, dry your skin with a blow-dryer on a cool setting. Be sure to stop blowing if you start to sweat because that could create streaks on your skin.


When you are ready to dress, don't wear tight clothes or thick fabrics. Instead, put on cotton so your skin can breath. The best thing to wear would be a cotton bath robe for a couple hours.

Stay indoors.",How to Fade Your Tan Fast2," You can’t go overboard here if you’re trying to stay as pale as possible! 30 SPF is the baseline advised by the American Academy of Dermatology, though going higher doesn’t hurt. 









It’s easy to forget about the brief, incidental sun exposure we all incur just going about our daily lives. Remember to apply every day if you’re looking to avoid gaining color; you walk under the same sun when you get your mail as you do when you stroll along the beach.

, Long sleeves may not be too fun in the heat, but you’ll need to cover as much skin as you can while you’re outside. Clouds make very little difference in the sun’s effect on your skin, too, blocking a mere 20% of UV rays. And if you thought you were safe on the ski slopes, think again: snow actually reflects 80% of UV rays, increasing exposure. So if you were planning on skiing shirtless for some reason… maybe don’t.

, Admittedly, you might feel a little silly at first, but it’s a surefire way to block out the sun during your walk down the block. Consider a parasol if you’re looking for something a little more chic.



Don’t entrust it all to an umbrella at the beach, however. As you might’ve guessed after learning of snow’s powerful reflective potential, sand, too, reflects UV rays. Not as bad as snow—only 17% from sand—but still enough for the sun to make its mark. , When it comes down to it, staying inside will keep you the palest. Full-on hermit life isn’t an option for everyone, though, and keep in mind it’s not a requirement to keeping your skin lighter if you can abide by the above steps.



The body does requires Vitamin D, though, and nutritional guidelines for vitamin D (600 IU from ages 1-70) are generally set with the assumption that a person will be receiving some regular sunlight. Fatty fish, beef liver, eggs, cheese, and mushrooms provide some vitamin D, and U.S. milk is often fortified with it.

Exfoliating while you’re burned will be ineffective and extremely painful.



Apply aloe vera to ease pain and hydrate your scorched skin.
Revisit this guide once your burn has healed or peeled.

, You don’t want to be rough on your skin, per se, but the overall idea here is to speed up the process by which your body sheds its skin cells. Your body wants something good for scrubbing.



Good exfoliants for this purpose will have retinoids or alpha hydroxyl acids. These ingredients specifically help in skin-cell turnover rates and get rid of color. , Loofahs are dried, tubular gourds, the fibrous fruit of the loofa plant. The pouf, on the other hand, is a synthetic scrubber, made to be a gentler scrubbing tool with maximum lather-up potential. We don’t want gentle for this task—we want the tougher loofah.


, Take a shower and then pat yourself (mostly) dry, or use a wet washcloth on your skin.


, The exfoliant and loofah will be providing the grit, so don’t use an overly aggressive technique. Simply rub your skin in small circles, rinse it off with cool water, and repeat daily. "

For a natural exfoliating scrub, try coarse sea salt, granulated sugar mixed with honey, or coffee grounds mixed with olive oil.;
, Choose a rich lotion and apply it all over your skin, focusing on spots that tend to get dry easier. Also drink plenty of water to keep your skin and entire body hydrated. This will allow your skin to get darker over time because each layer of darkened skin will not get dry and flake off as easily.

, Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that is 15 SPF or higher, and rub it into your skin evenly and all over your body. Have a friend apply it to your back or other areas that you can’t reach easily yourself. You should apply sunscreen 30 minutes before you go outside.Water-resistant sunscreen is great for many outdoor activities for which you’ll be getting wet or sweaty. You still need to reapply it regularly.
Don’t listen to the common myth that you will tan better or faster without wearing sunscreen! Getting a sunburn from lack of sunscreen actually kills the skin cells that you are trying to darken, prohibiting you from getting a dark tan and increasing your risk of skin cancer., Buy a tanning accelerator lotion or pill to increase your tan. Use sparingly before going out in the sun, and test it for a small amount of time to make sure there are no adverse side effects., Spend a brief time outside around 12:00 noon for the most exposure to the sun and greatest chance to tan.Remember that you can still get burned or tanned throughout the daylight hours, and even in cloud cover or shade., Pass the time in the sun by laying out with a good book or music, playing a sport, or simply getting outdoor chores like mowing the lawn done.

, Ideally you should be out in the sun for only an hour or two at a time, but if you are out longer, reapply sunscreen every two hours and after every time you get wet (from swimming, showering, or sweating a lot). Drink plenty of water to keep hydrating the skin so you don’t lose your tan.

, If you’re lying down or in a chair, change positions between your front, back, and sides every 15 to 30 minutes so you get darker all over.When lying on your back, place your arms above your head and your head tilted slightly back to expose your inner arms and neck. When on your front, put your arms out so the top of your shoulders and forearms get sun.
Remember that if you’re playing a sport or doing anything else standing up, your nose, shoulders, arms, and back of the neck will likely get more tan than anything else, as they are facing the sun more directly.

, Hop in the shower after you spend time in the sun to remove excess sunscreen, sweat, or sand and dirt.

, Keep drinking plenty of water and apply lotion topically to fully hydrate your skin for the best tan. Use aloe vera gel for a good way to soothe the skin. Continue to apply lotion regularly, both right after sun exposure and before bed.

, Spend just an hour or two in the sun per day, but do this every day. Build up your tan more gradually for a safer, longer-lasting, and more consistent dark tan.

Wear a UV-tracking bracelet.,
Stay indoors during the sunniest hours.,

Keep an umbrella handy.",How to Eliminate Sunscreen and Not Burn," It’s pretty obvious that the more skin you conceal from the sun, the more skin you’ll be protecting from sunburn. If you live in a hot climate, it can be tempting to throw on a tank top or a short sleeve shirt. However, you can find long sleeve shirts that offer more coverage but still keep you cool in hot environments.Colored shirts offer more sun protection than white shirts. In fact, the darker the better.Fabric with tighter weaving protects from the sun better than loosely-woven clothing. The more light you can see through the fabric, the less sun protection it offers.;
, The more skin you can possibly cover, the better. Jeans, athletic pants, leggings, and maxi skirts are all great options. If for whatever reason, you cannot wear clothing over your entire legs, consider wearing high socks to protect as much as possible.


If you aren’t wearing long pants and you find yourself in the sun, try to cover them with a beach towel or find shade by sitting with your legs under a table. Be resourceful. Bare legs are a target for the sun, and it’s vital to protect your vulnerable skin.

, While wearing a basic long sleeve shirt and long pants can be great protection, there are also clothing created with SPF that can ensure you’re getting the best protection possible. Check out companies that make clothing specifically for sun protection. Companies like Solumbra offer doctor-approved sun protection., Find something with a broad brim to keep your delicate face covered.Make sure you wear your hat anytime the sun is out, even if it’s not peak sunny hours. Start a collection, so you have a hat to pop on for any occasion. The more you like your hats, the more likely you’ll be to wear them.

, Not only do sunglasses help you see comfortably when it’s sunny outside, they can cover up your face. If you’ve ever gotten a sunburn on your eyelids, you know how important this is! Look for sunglasses with wide lenses that will completely cover your lids and under eye skin. The thicker the arms of the sunglasses, the better.When you’re buying sunglasses, look for ones that protect against 99 to 100 percent of UVA and UVB light. Not all sunglasses are created equally when it comes to skin (and eye) protection.

, A few studies have recently suggested that increasing the amount of lycopene and astaxanthin in your diet can actually help to protect you against sunburn. Lycopene is found in high concentration in tomatoes, particularly in tomatoes that have been cooked or in tomato products. Astaxanthin is found in algae, so it might be a bit more difficult to get into your diet. However, you can dine on animals that eat algae, like salmon and shrimp.


The research on the sun protection offered by lycopene and astaxanthin are optimistic, but not 100% proven. Even if you start eating tomatoes and shrimp at every meal, you should still use a second form of sun protection.

, If you want to take the guesswork out of your sun protection, download a mobile app like Sunvisor. With Sunvisor, you can check your UV exposure risk, set countdowns to apply more sunscreen, and get an alert when you’ve been exposed beyond safe levels. It’s easy to start having fun outside and lose track of time, so apps like Sunvisor can keep track of things for you., It’s no surprise that in the era of the FitBit and the Apple Watch, there’s also a gadget for your wrist that can help keep you safe in the sun. There are several, in fact! Some are high tech, and some are simply wearable reminders to be safe and thoroughly protect yourself while outdoors.


One of the more high-tech options is the JUNE by NetAtmo. It syncs with an iPhone app to track your UV exposure and give you personalized suggestions to protect yourself. It is sold for about $50.00.For a cheaper, no nonsense option, you can get a simple UV color-changing wristband for $2.50. When it turns purple, it means you’re getting some strong rays and should take precautions to protect your skin., The sun is strongest during the hours of 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM.If you can avoid spending extending periods of time in the sun between these hours, do it. Go outdoors in the early mornings or in the late afternoon/evening. You still need to protect your skin from the sun during the early morning and evening, but you’ll be less likely to get burned by the most powerful rays.

, When you’re outside, always be in the shade when possible. This is particularly crucial during the peak hours when the sun is most dangerous. If you’re at an outdoor restaurant, request a table in the shade. Sit under a tree, enjoy the beach under a canopy, and keep making sure that you’re fully covered by shade. Sitting in direct sunlight without sunscreen is dangerous, even if you aren’t getting a visible burn.If you are going to be outdoors, do whatever you can to be out of the most powerful rays.

, In an ideal world, everyone would don sun safe clothing daily, shade would be readily available, and it would be possible to always stay indoors during the sun’s peak hours. Of course, that’s not always possible. It’s useful to keep a UV protection umbrella with you whenever possible, whether that’s in your car, your purse, or stashed in your office.The UPF (or the Ultraviolet Protection Factor) will be listed on the umbrella. Choose one with a UPF of 50 or more.
These travel sun umbrellas can be purchased on Amazon, or at most stores that sell outdoor equipment and sun safe clothing.

Try a self-tanner as it's one of the tanning methods least associated with risks.,
Apply a tan accelerator to your skin.,
Opt for a spray tan instead.,
Use a tanning bed to tan faster.",How to Get a Darker Tan2," These days, many self-tanning products that you buy at stores won’t give you an orange look and instead mimic the look of a natural tan.


The best part about self tanners is that you won’t damage your skin like you will in a tanning bed or by tanning in the sun. And you won't risk inhaling chemicals as you might in a spray tan. Choose a self tanner in a bottle.These come in many forms and different products work better for different people. Experiment on a small patch of skin first to work out what works best for you.
Use tingle creams. Tingle creams can have a temporary reddening effect on the skin, but help to create maximum natural color in a short time. Bronzing lotions can also help to accelerate the creation of a natural tan, and include self-tanning agents to give a light artificial color while your real tan is building.You can buy products that you put in your tanning lotion to create a darker look. There are many of these products on the market., You can find many tanning products that promise to accelerate a tan you're trying to achieve in the sun or a tanning bed. Look for products that specifically promise a darker tan or label themselves tanning accelerators.


These products will also perfect the shade of your tan, such as giving the tan a more golden hue.
Lotions are designed to hydrate your skin. This makes it easier for the skin to absorb UV light. Some tanning accelerators also contain cosmetic bronzers., Spray tans are becoming less expensive, and many tanning salons offer them for monthly fees, reducing the cost. A spray tan will give you a dark tan without damaging your skin.


Some tanning salons have people who will actually spray the tan on you. In others, you will stand in a machine that will spray your body with the spray. Do be aware, though, that some researchers have raised safety concerns about spray tan, especially when the spray is inhaled or ingested.Spray tans can last between three and seven days. You can ask for different depths of color. If you want a dark tan, ask for the darkest hue possible. If you do spray tan, it's extremely important that you wear appropriate safety filters and protective gear over eyes, lips, mouth and other recommended areas of the body., If you want a dark tan fast, it’s quicker to use a tanning bed to get one than to sit in the sun.That’s because five minutes in a tanning bed is the equivalent to sitting in the sun for two hours.You will get a fast tan if you spend a couple minutes in a tanning bed each day. The key to tanning is getting the body to produce melanin, and usually it takes five to seven days to create a tan in people whose skin tone allows them to tan.
A daily tanning bed session can speed this up (but as with all tanning, it can cause skin damage or skin cancer). Once you have built up a base color, you can increase the darkness with small bursts of sunbathing or sunbed use every few days. Overdoing it and trying to achieve a very dark tan straight away can end up leaving you dry and peeling, which is not a pretty effect!
It can be dangerous to use a tanning bed because you could be at greater risk for skin cancer as well as premature aging. If you are determined to go this route, do it under the guidance of a tanning industry professional. Don’t exceed their recommended tanning times or you could end up with a burn. The best way to get a tan from a tanning bed is to do it gradually.

Use sea water to get a darker tan.,
Use an after-tan lotion to keep the skin moisturized.,
Spend more time outdoors.",How to Get a Darker Tan3," Some say that sea salt can help boost your color because it draws the sunlight. So, if you’re at the beach, you might want to take advantage of it.


Go into the ocean, immerse yourself in the salt water, and then get back out to tan. Do this a few times, and you will see your tan deepen. You could also try using olive oil.As with any tanning, be very careful that you don’t burn. Drawing more sunlight to your skin can have damaging effects.
You could also draw more sun to your skin using a reflector.

, After tanning, you should always use an after-sun lotion. This will help to cool and calm the skin.


An after-tan lotion will eliminate any soreness or redness, as well as moisturizing the tan to keep it lasting longer. You can use baby oil after your tan to soften the skin (don’t use it to tan, though, or you could burn).

, Exercise or work out outside. Walk or bicycle instead of going by car. (But remember to use sunscreen.)


Do not stay in the sun if your skin starts to feel sore; burning will not make you darker. Instead, your existing tan will start to peel and end up patchy.
As always, remember to use SPF if you want that golden tan instead of a bright red burn.

Consider tanning indoors if you can't tan in the sun.,
Invest in a tanning package and lotion.,
Visit a salon and sign up for a tanning bed.,
Be patient.,
Consider your health.",How to Get a Nice Tan2," This is similar to outdoor tanning, but it may be a more preferable option in the colder months. It's best to start out tanning for short periods of times (less than ten minutes) because the UV rays are closer than the sun, and they can burn you much more quickly.


Like sunbathing, you still need to stay active in a tanning bed. The best way to do this is to frequently lift your rear, legs, and shoulders off of the bed for about thirty seconds each.

, Make sure to use an indoor tanning lotion, not an outdoor lotion. Many salons carry good options at varying price ranges. It will be pretty expensive, but it's cheaper to buy a bottle of lotion than individual packets each time.

, Choose your package based on how much you plan on tanning. Take advantage of any student, new client, or seasonal discounts.


It is best to tan nude, if you are comfortable doing that. If you're not comfortable tanning nude, wear undergarments that don't leave undesirable tanning lines.
Stand-up tanning is more sanitary, but tanning beds are also cleaned between each use, so it's fine either way.

, Start with a short time, 5-7 minutes, just to find out how your skin handles the tanning. Up your time gradually after the first tanning session.

, Tanning beds can significantly increase your risk of develop cancer. Carefully weigh the risks and the benefits before you step into the sunbed. Tanning beds are especially hazardous to young people. People who use sunbeds before age 30 increase their lifetime risk of melanoma.If you absolutely must use a tanning bed, use it as little as possible, and consider using sunscreen.
Consider tanning in the sun instead, if you must tan at all. Consider using fake-tan products to limit your exposure to UV rays."
"
Consider getting an artificial tan.,
Prepare your skin.,
Find the right shade.,
Find a product that's easy to apply.,
Use a fine spray-mist tan.,
Use tanning lotion.,
Try using a mousse tan product.,
Consider using tan wipes.,
Consider getting an instant tan.,
Consider using a tan extender after tanning.",How to Get a Nice Tan3," Types of artificial tans include spray tans, self-tanners, and bronzers. These are good options if you only need to be tan for a few days, or if you have very sensitive skin that easily burns. You can receive spray tans at the same tanning salons that you would visit for indoor tanning beds, and you can buy various self-tanners and bronzers at any drugstore.


Read reviews on the product before you buy. Some products will make you look more orange than tan.
Gradual tanners typically work better because it gradually darkens your skin slowly and you can stop at whatever shade you're most comfortable with. If you are going for the spray tan, a professional will help you pick the perfect shade to match the look you want to the skin tone you already have.

, It's always a good idea to prep your skin before tanning, as prepared skin will look healthy and radiant and not dull and dry. Be sure to exfoliate the night before your tan with a loofah in the shower, moving in circular motions to get rid of any dead surface skin as tan will sit on the outer layer of the skin. It's also best to moisturize your whole body once you have exfoliated, as this will keep your skin nourished and silky smooth for the following day.


Try to avoid exfoliating with grainy and gritty products, as this may cause tiny abrasions on the skin. The tan may seep into these abrasions, leaving you with an unprofessional finish.
Once you are tanned, it's a good idea to gently exfoliate every day with a loofah to help the tan to fade evenly over the course of the week. The tan will fade away from certain areas of your skin faster than other places, and you don't want to leave your skin looking patchy and uneven when the tan begins to fade. Exfoliating your body daily will also help if you decide you want to maintain your tan. You can reapply over the course of the week and never be without your tan again.

, If you are thinking of applying your own fake tanning products, its best to shop around and find one that is going to be the right shade for you. Tan generally comes in three shades: light, medium and dark. Some have slightly more bronze tones, and some have a shimmery effect which reflects light and gives you a glow.


If you have fair skin it's probably best for you to use a more natural looking tanning product–one that is made for fair skin, so that the tan looks more subtle–unless you are looking for a noticeably dark result.
If you have medium skin you can use a tanning product for either fair skin or medium, olive skin.
If you have dark skin and want the tan to really show up, it's best to use a dark tanning product so that it really makes a difference.

, Aside from choosing the right tone, its also important that you find a tanning product that's easy to apply, especially if this is your first time tanning and you don't have the assistance of another. Remember to always wear a tanning mitt when applying fake tan, otherwise the solution will stain your hands orange. It won't be easy to remove without ruining the rest of your gorgeous tan.

, This is the most common type of self-tan product that you will find in drugstore or beauty shops, and it is generally regarded as the easiest to apply solo.

, Lotions tend to go on just as any other lotion would. However, reaching your own back and spreading the tan over other areas evenly can be more difficult.

, Mousse tans can be quite hard to apply, depending on your experience with self-tanning products, as they dry very quickly. This is great if you're a pro and you want to go about your daily business while the tan develops on your skin, but not so great if you need the extra time to spread it onto your skin evenly.

, These are relatively easy to use, however this method is most likely to stain your fingers, as wipes are much harder to hold with a tanning mitt on your hand. You will also probably need quite a few packets of these wipes. They are generally sold in singles and one won't be enough to give your entire body the two coats to really show up your tan.


Generally, you should apply one coat, allow that to dry, and apply a second coat for a higher intensity and a deeper tan. Allow it to develop for 3-24 hours before taking a shower in lukewarm water.
Wearing old black or dark-colored clothes is best, as any excess tan may rub off and stain light-colored clothes. Avoid rinsing with any soaps or shower gels, as the ingredients in these products can break down the tan.
After your shower, try to avoid any moisturizers that contain oil, as they can break down the tan and cause it to fade rapidly.

, These products are pretty much just body make-up, and they wash off completely after you take a shower. You should always apply these while dry. Instant tan is a great alternative if you only want to look tan for one day or for a specific event before you need to wear any clothing, as they will stain your clothes.


You can also find tan products with bronzers and shimmer. If you want to appear extra dark immediately after tanning with the help of a cosmetic bronzer, look for a bronzer lotion rather than an intensifier, or ""pure"" lotion.

, This is like a moisturizer, except with special ingredients to preserve, protect, and extend the life of your tan. These extenders usually lack certain ingredients that will strip your color, such as sulfate. Use a tan-extending body wash in the shower, as well, for the same reason, and then use the tan extender after your shower.

Spend time outdoors.,
Sunbathe for better tanning exposure.,
Wear sunscreen at all times.",How to Darken Your Skin1," Spending time outdoors isn't only a great way to get a tan, it's also beneficial to your health. Being outside is the most natural and healthy way to tan your skin, which is why you'll get the most natural results. Whether you're taking a walk, playing a sport, or having a picnic, you're still under the sun.


The appropriate amount of sun exposure is the best way to increase your Vitamin D levels. Vitamin D fights infections, including colds and the flu, and is thought to minimize your chances of chronic illnesses and cancers.
If you're worried about getting the dreaded farmer tan (or any other undesired tan lines), remember to wear different cuts of clothing. Exposing different areas of skin will help to even out your tan.;
, Sunbathing means lying or sitting in the sun with the goal of getting a tan. When lying in the sun, be sure to wear an SPF sunscreen to protect your skin.


It's important to increase your time sunbathing gradually. It's generally safe to start at 10-30 minutes a few times a week, depending on your skin color. As you spend more time in the sun, you'll have more ability to absorb the sun’s rays, and will be able to sunbathe for longer periods of time. Never stay out long enough to get red or sunburned., Contrary to popular belief, you can easily get a tan while wearing sunscreen. Overexposure with no SPF sunscreen can cause sun burn, dehydration, and huge potential health risks, such as skin cancer.


A minimum of 15 SPF sunscreen is recommended. If you're very fair skinned, wear at least a 30 SPF sunscreen.Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before you go in the sun, and reapply 15 to 30 minutes after being in the sun. Reapply if you have done any water activity, such as swimming, where your sunscreen could have been removed.
If you choose to use a tanning lotion or oil, use one that contains SPF."
"
Stay out of the sun, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.,
Wear sunscreen with a sunscreen protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher.,
Dress appropriately.,
Limit the amount of time you're in the sun.,
Stay in the shade.,
Talk to your health care provider.",How to Cope With Sun Sensitivity," This duration of time is when the sun is the strongest and brightest in most locations.;
, While SPF 30 may protect certain people decently, it may be a good idea to get a higher SPF depending on how severe your sun sensitivity is. Be sure your sunscreen protects against UVA and UVB rays and reapply frequently.


Protect your lips. Get a lip balm that offers SPF protection to protect those lips from getting sunburn. Remember to apply it frequently!

, Wear UV protective clothing or at the very least cover up with breathable fabrics. Don't forget your hat and sunglasses!

, Along with going out during hours the sun is less intense staying out for shorter periods of time lessens your sun exposure.

, Shady areas that don't allow the suns rays to penetrate will also limit your exposure to the sun. If no shade is available consider carrying a sun umbrella.

, While doing the steps above will help you greatly with your sun sensitivity, talking to your doctor will help determine how severe your sun sensitivity is and what other steps you can do to lessen the symptoms.

Look at the SPF value.,
Choose a sunscreen that offers “Broad Spectrum Protection”.,
Read the list of active constituents on the bottle.,
Select a sunscreen that is hypoallergenic.,
Pick out a waterproof or water resistant sunscreen.,
Keep in mind that adult sunscreens can be used on children too.",How to Choose Sunscreen for Children1," ‘SPF’ stands for ‘Sun Protection Factor’. The SPF describes the amount of time that the sunscreen will protect your skin from the sun before you start to burn, versus the time it would take your skin to burn without the sunscreen. Doctors recommend that SPF 30 be used for most children, though children with especially pale skin can use 40 if need be.Dermatologists do not recommend using SPF 75 or higher, as they will not protect your child from the sun’s UV rays anymore than an SPF 30 sunscreen would.
Do not use a sunscreen that is lower than SPF 15, as this will allow too many damaging rays to come into contact with your child’s skin.;
, Broad spectrum protection sunscreens will protect your child’s skin from both UVA and UVB rays, both of which are radiations that can cause your child’s skin to burn., Good sunscreens continue certain active ingredients that are more effective against the sun’s rays than other ingredients. One of the most important ingredients is Avobenzone, which is a chemical that has the ability to absorb UVA rays.


Your sunscreen should also contain Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide, which are both natural minerals. They are soothing substances in the sunscreen that make it comfortable for your child to wear, while also acting as UVA and UVB blockers. These minerals are not absorbed by the skin, which means that they can protect your child’s skin until they are washed away. Your sunscreen should be made up of at least 5% of each mineral.

, Look for sunscreens that are fragrance free and PABA free. PABA stands for “para amino-benzoic acid”, a chemical that can irritate sensitive skin. Both fragrances and PABA should be avoided if your child has sensitive skin, as both have been known to cause rashes and skin allergies.


The chemicals used to create the fragrance of the sunscreen can be very harsh, and may irritate your child’s skin.

, Water resistant means that the sunscreen is still effective 40 minutes after being exposed to water, while waterproof means that the sunscreen is effective 80 minutes after being exposed to water. Both have the same effect, but one just lasts longer.


Regardless of which type of sunscreen you use, you should reapply the sunscreen after your child gets out of the water and dries off.
Waterproof and water resistant sunscreens are not just meant for days spent by the pool; they properties also help to keep the sunscreen effective when your child sweats.

, You do not have to look exclusively at ‘kid-friendly’ sunscreens; adult sunscreens can also be used to protect your child’s skin from the sun.


One good thing about kid’s sunscreens is that they often come in fun bottles, which may help to make your child less fussy about having to put the sunscreen on.

Choose an SPF number.,
Avoid parabens and harmful ingredients.,
Look for broad spectrum sunscreen.,
Use water-resistant sunscreen if you will be swimming.,
Avoid sunscreen sprays and choose creams instead.,
Find additional ways to protect your skin.,
Consider the amount of time you will be spending in the sun.,
Keep in mind what activities you will be doing.,
Pay attention to your skin type.,
Factor in age.,
Consider any skin sensitivities.,
Consider any other preventative measures you will use.,
Go to a store.,
Compare many different sunblocks.,
Decide which one best suits your needs.,
Make an informed decision.",How to Choose a Sunblock," The SPF number tells you what percentage of UVB rays are absorbed by the sunblock. For instance, SPF 30 absorbs approximately 97 percent of UVB rays, while SPF 50 absorbs approximately 98 percent of UVB rays, while SPF 100 can block nearly 99 percent of UVB rays. Because of this, SPFs are quite misguiding. You might think that if you spend more on a SPF 100 product, then you will be absolutely safe in the sun, when in reality, its protection against UVB rays is only 2 percent higher than that of SPF 30.SPF only refers to blocking UVB rays, not UVA rays, and both of these can damage your skin. High SPFs have been shown to allow more UVA rays to reach your skin while not providing much better protection against UVB rays. Additionally, high SPFs do not last any longer than lower SPFs.;
, Make sure that in protecting your skin from the sun, you aren’t exposing yourself to other harmful elements. Many sunscreens contain parabens, which may increase rates of breast cancer and facilitate the development of melanoma!Oxybenzone can break down skin and cause hives and other problems.Retinyl palmitate can increase your risk of cancer when exposed to the sun.Watch out for ingredients like those to make sure that your sunscreen isn’t doing more harm than good.Consider using mineral-based ingredients such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These sit on top of the skin rather than being absorbed. These ingredients are able to reflect UV rays and have been shown to be safe and effective ingredients in preventing negative effects of the sun.If using chemicals, choose ones that protect against both UVA and UVB rays. Mexoryl SX, Mexoryl XL and Parsol 1789 are some chemicals that protect against UVA rays. Octinoxate, Octisalate and Homosalate are chemicals that protect against UVB rays. Look for a sunblock that contains these chemicals for the best overall protection from both types of rays.
Avoid sunblocks that contain extracts of fruits or nuts. They have not been shown to block the sun and many of them can cause allergic reactions.

, “Broad spectrum” means that it protects from both the sun's UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays cause wrinkling and aging of the skin, while UVB rays cause sunburn, but both UVA and UVB cause skin cancer. It is best to be protected from both, however, many sunblocks only protect against UVB rays. Looking for a sunblock labeled “broad spectrum” will help you to avoid this., Sunblocks are no longer allowed to be labeled “waterproof” because they all wash off in water after a while. But water-resistant sunscreen can allow you to stay in the water for about 80 minutes before needing to reapply. If you plan on swimming or sweating, you will probably want a sunblock that is water-resistant. But keep in mind that it will need to be reapplied just like any other sunscreen., Sprays and creams are not the same. Try to avoid sunscreen sprays and choose a cream instead. With sprays, it is very easy to miss a spot and they also raise concerns about inhaling the product. Creams are more likely to ensure full coverage and you aren’t at risk of inhaling them., While a good sunblock is an important measure for protecting your skin, it is only one part of this. Some people think that as long as they apply a sunblock, they are free to go soak up the sun’s rays without any consequences. But one study showed that people using sunscreen were at a higher risk for developing melanoma.This is likely due to increased time sunbathing when applying sunscreen. No sunscreen can protect from all sun rays. To truly take care of your skin, limit your sun exposure and protect yourself with clothing, hats, or umbrellas., Your sunscreen for a day at the beach versus a quick 15 minute walk doesn’t have the same requirements. For prolonged sun exposure, which you should try to avoid, make sure to use a higher SPF and to reapply often. There’s no need to go above SPF 50, but make sure it is broad spectrum to guard against all UV rays. For a lighter sunscreen, you can go as low as SPF 15 if you will only be out in the sun for a few minutes.


To limit your sun exposure, try taking breaks. For example, if you are going to the beach for a day, spend an hour swimming and then go inside somewhere to eat lunch and reapply sunscreen.

, Look for a water-resistant sunblock if you plan on being in the water or if you sweat a lot. It can take about 80 minutes for a water-resistant sunblock to wash off of you. A water-resistant sunblock will ensure that you have protection from the sun even when you are enveloped in water. If you won’t be exposed to water, consider other factors of your activities, such as altitude. If you are high in the mountains skiing or hiking, you will need a higher SPF because of increased sun exposure, even if it’s cold out!


Another factor to keep in mind is your location. If you are in Mexico versus Canada, your sun exposure will be quite different! Protect yourself accordingly.

, While all skin types benefit from sunscreen, fair skin can be especially cancer prone. If your skin is light, use a stronger sunscreen like broad spectrum SPF 50. But even if you tan easily or have very dark skin, you are still at risk for sun damage! Just because you don’t burn, doesn’t mean your skin is safe. Protect yourself by using a lower SPF.Certain skin types are more at risk for skin cancer. Fair skin with light hair or red hair tends to be most at risk for sunburns and cancer. Be especially careful if any family members have had skin cancer. Make sure to protect yourself with appropriate sunscreen and other protective measures such as dark clothing., This is especially important for young kids. It is not recommended that children use sunscreen sprays, sunscreens with oxybenzone, or sunscreens containing nanoparticles. Sunscreens with metal oxides such as zinc and titanium are safest. Find ones that are broad spectrum for best UV protection. Use SPF 30-50 for safe, quality protection.For very young kids, those under 6 months old, sunscreen is not recommended. Instead protect them by keeping them in the shade, limiting their sun exposure, and having them wear a hat and protective clothing.

, If you know of ingredients that irritate your skin, definitely avoid those in sunscreen. If your skin is acne-prone, look for oil-free sunscreens. If you aren’t sure whether a sunscreen will irritate you, try applying a little bit on a small area before applying it to your whole body. Wait a few minutes and if any irritation occurs, you know not to use it. Additionally, fruit and nut extracts and fragrances do not improve UV blockage and can cause irritation., This is one of the most important ways to protect your skin and will also influence your choice in sunscreen. By limiting your sun exposure, wearing protective clothing, sitting under an umbrella or tree, and wearing a hat and sunglasses, you can greatly help your skin and you will not need as strong of a sunscreen. This way you can think of sunscreen as one part of protecting your skin rather than relying on it alone. This is important for a well-rounded approach to safe skin.Try to limit time in the sun between 10am and 4pm when the rays are strongest., You could try a supermarket or a skincare store. You could even look at stores online. This will give you access to a wide variety of sunscreens so that you can familiarize yourself with your options.


If you aren't sure where to start, try looking at a general marketplace such as Amazon.com. They have many sunscreens and also list the ingredients so that you can learn about them.

, Don’t just look at the way they advertise themselves, but take the time to read through each ingredient. Be on the lookout for any potentially harmful ingredients and for helpful ones. A sunblock isn’t as good as its label; it’s as good as its ingredients. Think about which ingredients you want ahead of time so that you won’t get lost reading list after list of indecipherable chemicals. Perhaps you are looking for something with zinc oxide and no oxybenzone. Focus your search on these criteria to find the best sunblock for you.If you find one that you like but you aren't ready to buy it, write down its name so that you can read up on it later. This can help you to make an even more informed decision.

, After narrowing down your search, find which one most closely aligns with your needs. There will likely be at least a couple of options that meet your criteria. Take the time to look at these more closely and factor in other requirements that you might have. Which one is water-resistant? Which one is broad spectrum? Which one has fewer chemicals? Which one costs less? Look at any aspects that are important to you and there will likely be one that stands out.If there are a few that seem about equal, go ahead and just pick one and give it a try. If you have enough money, consider buying two so that you can try them both and see which you prefer.

, Whatever you do, make sure to educate yourself before you choose a sunscreen. This is an important decision that can help protect you from cancer! Don’t just choose the cheapest; try to find the product that is highest quality and best for you. This is an important preventative measure that can save you a lot of money and pain in the long run by avoiding cancer.If you need a sunscreen immediately and don't have time to conduct a lot of research, go for a cream that is SPF 30, broad spectrum, paraben free, with zinc oxide and no oxybenzone or retinyl palmitate.

Get a spray tan.,
Use a tanning bed.,
Take care of your skin.",How to Darken Your Skin2," Spray tanning is a form of sunless tanning where a fine mist that includes tanning ingredients is sprayed onto your body (the same ingredient in self tanning lotion). Spray tans are growing in popularity because they are safe, easy, and fairly long-lasting (typically 7 days). The biggest drawback of spray tanning is the cost - usually $25-$50. There are a few things you should do to prepare yourself before getting a spray tan.


Shave or wax before your appointment. This will help the tan to better soak into your skin.
Exfoliate your skin prior to your appointment. Getting rid of as much dead skin as possible will get you better results.
Don't apply lotion, deodorant, or makeup prior to your appointment. Clean skin will soak in the tan much better.
Wait 8 hours after your spray tan to shower or apply any lotion / moisturizer., Tanning beds use ultraviolet light to create UV radiation. This UV radiation creates a glow to tan the skin, just like UV light from the sun. Although tanning beds have become fairly popular, there are many health risks (including skin cancer) associated with them, and you must be careful if you choose to tan this way.If you decide to use a tanning bed, a time of 7-11 minutes is recommended. Even if you tan often, never go in a tanning bed for more than 20 minutes at a time. Tanning 1-2 times per week is the recommended amount.
Always wear tanning lotion and goggles to protect your skin and eyes from the potential harm of the UV rays.
Most cities have tanning salons, so go online to find the tanning salon closest to you. Prices will vary from salon to salon, but member packages are usually available to help you save money if you plan on tanning multiple times.

, It's easy to miss the sun in the dead of winter, which is one of the reasons many people choose to tan. If you decide to tan under UV rays and sun beds, it is imperative that you take care of your skin.


These methods of tanning come with a high risk of skin cancer and speed up your skin's aging process.
Always wear tanning lotion with an SPF when tanning, and moisturize your skin daily to keep it hydrated."

Use make-up to get a bronzy glow.,
Consider self tanning products.,
Lather on self tanning lotion.,
Spray yourself with self tanning spray.,
Don't overdo it.",How to Darken Your Skin3," There are plenty of makeup tricks to give you the gorgeous tan you've been looking for, many of which are easy to do. Using makeup is the safest, but also most temporary, way to darken your skin. One great method is using bronzers and shimmer powders. You'll need a few simple products to create your new tan look, all of which can be found online or at any makeup department or convince store.


You'll need a cream bronzer, a powder bronzer, a highlighter or shimmer powder, a small powder brush, and a regular powder brush.
Start off by using a small powder brush to sweep a cream bronzer across both cheeks, under your eyes, and across the bridge of the nose. The key is to apply it where you would naturally get tan on your face.
Next, take your powder bronzer and apply it to your cheeks and temples with your regular powder brush. Blend both bronzers thoroughly to avoid makeup lines.
Lastly, take your highlighter or shimmer powder and apply it along your cheekbones, above your upper lip, and along the outside of your eye / eyebrow area with your regular sized rider brush.
Be sure to blend your bronzers and shimmer powders to avoid makeup lines., Sunless tanning products, also known as self-tanners, are a great way to give your skin a beautiful tan without being exposed to harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Self tanners are easy to use and come in many different types and shades, making them the perfect option for many people. You can purchase self tanning products online or at your local convenience store. Your tan from a self tanning lotion or spray will typically last 3-5 days.


Try a self tanning lotion at home for a speedy tan. This lotion isn't difficult to apply, but it's easy to miss a spot or two. Be sure to keep some extra lotion to dab in spots you may have missed.
Use a gradual self tanning lotion. Gradual self tanners are the most natural looking and easy to control, but will take a 4-7 days to get you the results you're looking for. If you're not in a hurry, a gradual self tanning lotion is recommended.
Get a self tanning spray. This may be the easiest to use out of all at-home tanning products, but it can be hard to get those hard to reach places. If you have an at-home spray tan assistant, give this tanning method a try.Always be sure to exfoliate your skin before applying your self tanner. Exfoliating your skin will remove your dead skin cells, and allow the tanner to soak into fresh skin. This will help your tan last longer.
Let your self tanner soak in for at least 10 minutes before getting dressed, and wait until the following day to shower.

, For best results, follow the instructions on your self tanning package very closely. Get the right shade for your skin complexion, if you get a shade that's too dark, you will not be hoary with the results.


Apply the lotion in sections to be sure that you're entirely covered, and use a circular motion to apply the product to your skin. Start by applying the lotion to your arms, then your legs, and lastly your torso. Wash your hands after each section to avoid excessive tanning on your palms. Lightly apply the product to your ankles, feet and hands.
Wipe down your joint areas, as they tend to absorb the lotion more quickly. If you notice quick darkening on your joint areas, gently wipe them with a damp towel., As with any self tanner, follow the instructions on the package carefully.


Remove any jewelry and tie up your hair, otherwise you may end up with some strange markings.
Prior to spraying, apply an oil-free moisturizer to any dry areas.
Apply your spray sparingly around high absorption areas: knees, elbows, and feet. To ensure you get an even application, bend your knees and elbows when spraying those areas.
Hold the can at arm’s length away from the area to which you are applying the product, and spray a layer over your entire body. It's easiest to start from your feet and work your way up., Putting on too much self tanning lotion or bronzer will leave you looking orange and unnatural. Apply your tanning products in moderation, and start with a small amount. It's easier to apply another layer than to take one away.

Do a patch test to be sure that your child’s skin will not be irritated by the sunscreen.,
Apply the sunscreen 20 minutes before you plan to go outside.,
Rub the sunscreen on to all of the exposed areas of your child’s skin.,
Use a generous amount each time you apply the sunscreen.,
Avoid using spray-on sunscreens.,
Do not let young children put on their own sunscreen.,
Use sunscreen throughout the year.,
Use sunscreen in conjunction with other forms of protection.",How to Choose Sunscreen for Children2," A patch test is when you rub the sunscreen on a small part of your child’s skin, such as on the inside of his wrist, and wait several minutes to see if his skin becomes irritated. If your child’s skin becomes irritated as the day goes on, you will know that you cannot use that sunscreen on your child.


Skin irritation usually means that your child’s skin will become red, bumpy or itchy.

, Sunscreen takes a little while to get absorbed by the skin, so it is generally a good practice to rub the sunscreen on to your child’s skin at least 20 minutes before he will be exposed to the sun.


After the initial application, reapply the sunscreen every two hours to keep your child’s skin fully protected.

, In order to make sure that your child does not burn, it is important to apply the sunscreen to every part of your child’s skin that might be exposed to the sun. In addition to this, there are some areas that tend to burn more easily than others. In particular, make sure to apply sunscreen to your child’s:


Ears.
Face (and in particular the nose).
Front and back of the neck.
Shoulders.
Hands and feet.
Lips (you can use an SPF lip balm for this).
Along the edges of your child’s swimsuit.

, There is no need to be liberal when applying your child’s sunscreen; in this case, too much is always better than too little. As mentioned above, pay particular attention to spots like your child’s nose and ears.

, While you may find that sunscreens make it easier to apply protection to your child’s skin, they are also less thorough in their coverage of your child’s skin. With a spray on sunscreen, it is hard to tell if the spray got on to every part of your child’s exposed skin.


In addition to this insufficient coverage, your child can also accidentally inhale the sunscreen while you spray him, which could cause a serious problem for asthmatic children.

, Make sure to put the sunscreen on for them so that they do not accidentally ingest it or get it into their eyes or nose. However, while you put the sunscreen on your child, make sure to explain what you are doing so that they will learn and will be able to apply sunscreen on their own when they are a little older.

, Sunscreen should not exclusively be used in the summer, especially if your child has sensitive skin or if there is a history of skin cancer in your family. UV rays exist all year, though winter clouds can filter some of them. Keep in mind that snow has the same power as water does; both water and snow can reflect and amplify UV rays.


In general, try to apply sunscreen to your child’s skin every time he goes outdoors on sunny days, regardless of the season. In particular, use extra caution if your child is playing outside during the hours of 10 AM to 3 PM.

, While sunscreen can help to protect your child from the sun, taking extra precautionary measures can help to protect your child even more. These measures include:


Having your child wear a hat and sunglasses during the middle part of the day.
Bringing an umbrella to the beach or park to provide some shade.
Keeping your child hydrated to compensate for any fluid your child might lose through his sweat.

Work in an area near a large mirror.,
Shave your back, if necessary.,
Exfoliate first.,
Dry your skin completely.,
Tan areas you can reach using your hands.,
Tie a tanning mitt on the end of a wooden spoon.,
Apply more tanner to the mitt.,
Sweep the spoon in up and down motions.,
Use a mist formula to adjust harsh lines.,
Let the tanner dry completely.,
Fix up any patches you notice after tanning.",How to Apply Self Tanner to Your Back," It's a good idea to work near a large mirror. This way, you can turn your back to the mirror and keep an eye on what you're doing.;
, Hair can make self-tanner less effective. If you have hair on your back, shave or wax it off prior to applying self-tanner. This will help the self-tanner apply evenly to your back.As it can be difficult to shave or wax your own back, you may want to have your back shaved professionally before applying self-tanner.

, Exfoliating your skin is important before applying self-tanner. This will help your tan look smooth and even. Use an exfoliating body rub and a brush or sponge. Rub the body scrub into your skin to remove dead skin cells and leave your skin fresh. Rinse the scrub off when you're done.Exfoliate any areas where you plan to apply self-tanner.
When exfoliating areas like your back, it's easiest to exfoliate in the shower.
As reaching your back can be difficult, try using a shower brush with a long handle.

, Self-tanner needs to be applied to dry skin. Make sure to dab your back dry with a towel after exfoliating. For best results, wait about 20 minutes after getting out of the shower to apply self-tanner., It's always best to apply self-tanner with your hands as this allows you the most control. Apply the self-tanner to any areas on your back you can easily reach first. Put a tanning glove o one hand. Add a pump of self tanner to a tanning glove and rub down areas you can reach like your shoulders, lower back, and upper back with the self-tanner., Take a wooden spoon from your kitchen. Tie the tanning gloves around the wooden spoon using a rubber band., Add two generous pumps of tanner to the mitt to apply the tanner to your back. As it can be difficult to precisely control the mitt when applying self-tanner using a spoon, a little extra tanner is important. You can expect some tanner to smear and fall during the process., As you apply the tanner to your back, sweep the spoon in up and down motions. Go over every area of your back you cannot cover with your hands a few times. This will help the self-tanner spread on in smooth, even layers, leaving you with a realistic-looking tan.It can help to stand with your back to a mirror and look over your shoulder. This will allow you to see where you're applying the tanner.

, After you apply your tanner, look at your back in a mirror to examine your work. When applying tanner using a wooden spoon, you may notice harsh lines. To adjust harsh lines, use a mist formula that you can spritz on. Bend forward and bow your head down. Then, spray the tanner from side-to-side, holding the bottle just above your head. The formula should disperse throughout your back. This should remove any harsh lines that were left on during the up and down motions you made previously with the tanning mitt., Before you put your clothes back on, it's important to let the tanner dry completely. Do not dress until the tanner is completely dry to the touch. Times vary depending on the type of tanner you used.To speed up the process, take a blow dryer and blow it on your skin over areas where you applied the tanner.

, The following day, after showering, you may notice some patches, especially in hard to reach areas like your back. Add a little more self-tanner to any patchy areas. Let it dry just as you did before. This should make your tan look more even and natural."
"
Choose your product.,
To prepare for your tan, exfoliate thoroughly and remember to shave or wax the day before.,
After applying the tan, wash your hands and wait at least a couple of minutes before getting dressed into loose clothing and avoid water for a couple of hours until the tan has completely sunk in.

,
Reapply the product every day and a light, even tan should develop after 2-3 days.

,
To maintain your tan, exfoliate and moisturise every day.

",How to Apply Gradual Tanner," Most big skincare brands now make a gradual tanner, so you have a lot of choice. The main products are Dove Summer Body, Johnson's Holiday Skin, L'Oreal Nutrisummer, No7 Naturally Sunkissed Gradual Body Tan, Garnier Summerbody and Palmer's Natural Bronze. Most products come in two versions, one for pale skin and one for dark skin, so choose the right one for your skin tone. Some Gradual Tanners also come with a hint of shimmer, so are ideal for taking on holiday.;
, On the day of application, shower, then apply a light coat of a thin moisturiser or body lotion to your skin and allow it to be absorbed. Make sure your skin is completely dry before taking a small blob at a time of the tanner and applying it to your skin. Remember to rub it in thoroughly and apply it everywhere.

Go to your local tanning salon and ask about the programs they have.,
Take a tour.,
Fill out a skin analysis form.,
Get goggles.,
Avoid tyrosine-based tanning accelerators, lotion, tanning enhancers/tingles or pills.,
Go to your room.,
Put on your safety goggles.,
Get inside the bed and shut the lid.,
Get out of the tanning bed.",How to Use a Tanning Bed," Most salons have a variety of beds available with many packages to choose from:


Low pressure. This is the traditional tanning bed. UV rays are emitted in a spectrum that is similar to natural sunlight. The lamps produce fast color (instant gratification) but the risk of sunburn is highest in this kind of bed.If you burn easily, it's not recommended that you use this bed.
High pressure. These beds emit a higher proportion of UVA rays (versus UVB rays). UVB rays are the ones that cause sunburn.In this kind of bed you'll get a deeper, longer-lasting tan, but it will be slow to build.Usually this bed is more expensive.
Booth. This is basically a vertical tanning bed. Instead of laying down, you stand up. Parts of the skin that would normally be hidden don't come in contact with surfaces that other people's skin has touched (and sweat on, perhaps naked). Plus, it's the best option for those suffering from claustrophobia.
Whole body spray. Your body gets sprayed by a substance that darkens your skin through a chemical reaction. UV rays are not involved, so this is the least cancerous way to go. Keep in mind that this tan might fade away in a blotchy, unappealing way if you don't keep coming back for more.;
, Visit a few salons and ask to see the beds. Is everything clean? Look closely at the beds. If you see any dirty buildup, like where the glass meets the edge of the bed, leave and never return. Otherwise, ask what kind of cleaner they use on the beds (glass cleaner doesn't remove or kill bacteria). Shop around, compare salons, and choose the one you like most.

, Any decent salon will make you do it (they should also refuse to (UV) tan all fair-skinned customers.) The form is used to determine your skin type (so they don't accidentally fry your skin by putting you in a bed for too long). It should only take a minute or so.


One important thing to be open about is what kind of prescription medication you're using. Some can affect the way your skin reacts to tanning beds...in a very bad way.

, Again, any decent salon will make sure you have goggles. If they don't insist, then they don't care about your safety (and they might be just as nonchalant about cleaning the beds in between uses). Don't worry, these funny-looking goggles won't give you raccoon eyes. They just make sure you won't go blind.

, (""“Tanning accelerators” are not approved by the FDA"") Don't listen to any rumors about tyrosine. Yes, tyrosine is an amino acid that your body uses to produce melanin, which is the stuff that makes your skin look darker. That part is true. But there's no evidence (none!) that tyrosine is absorbed by your skin (or through your gut, if you're tempted to buy the pill form) and finds its way to the melanin factory. Learn How to Resist a Sales Pitch if they get pushy, or just leave.

, Strip down as low as you want to go. You can keep your underwear/bra on, or you can wear a swimsuit, or you can go nude. Use the same precautions you would take in a public shower. Remember that even though the surface of the bed should be cleaned between uses, the rest of the room probably isn't, so don't sit on the chair naked unless you're 100% sure the person before you didn't have crabs. Keep your socks on unless you're 100% sure the person before you didn't have foot warts. You know, things like that.


If you're really paranoid, and you don't mind the staff looking at you like you have ten heads, ask for a bottle of the cleaner so you can wipe things down yourself. Don't bring your own cleaner, though, because some cleaners (e.g. ammonia-based ones) can damage the finish on the glass in the beds, or irritate your skin in surprisingly unpleasant ways when you expose it to UV rays right after sitting on a chair that you wiped down in bleach.
Ask a staff member to give you a tanning bed crash course. Find out what all the buttons do. How do you shut the whole thing off? How do you control the fan? If there are separate bulbs for the face, how do you turn those on and off?

, This is a must. Don't even think about getting into that bed unless you have goggles or some kind of approved eye protection (sunglasses don't do the trick, no matter how stylish they are). Who cares how goofy you look?

, Press the button to flip the lights. There should be a timer, and the staff person should have assigned you a small time (like 4-5 minutes), no matter how much you argued that you don't burn, or that you want to get the most bang for your buck. A good tanning salon employee will know better and will start you off with a ""low dosage"" and increase it gradually (depending on your skin responded) every time you return. As you're laying there, pray that your DNA will prove resilient. Beg the tanning gods to spare you a sunburn. Visualize your cells producing melanin and lots of it. Or take a power nap (unless you're in a booth; napping while standing is not recommended).

, If you're all sweaty and slick, wipe yourself down with a towel (which should have been provided). Put your clothes back on and swagger out of the salon.

Apply a tinted oil or cream.",How to Accentuate Your Tan," White is the most common color worn to accentuate a tan. It is the best color to make your skin appear darker than it really is. Bright white is best for cool skin tones. Off-white is best for naturally golden skin tones., Blue is a great choice to complement your tan. Any shade of blue accentuates your tan, but some shades of blue make tans stand out more than others. Colors of the sea are the best shades. Choose warm blue-greens to make your tan glow. To make your tan appear darker, wear lighter shades of blue., Colors like orange, yellow, and lime green look great on people with golden skin tones. Citrus colors will enhance the glow your skin has picked up from a tan, whether you got the tan naturally or unnaturally. Fruity colors like watermelon, melon, and berry will also do a good job of contrasting your tan., Coral and warm pinks do a good job of adding a rosy glow. Consider these colors if you do not like wearing too bright of colors, but want to accentuate your tan., Choose a shade of nail polish that will go well with your clothing. Corals, white, orange, light blues, and bright reds are some good choices to accentuate a tan. O.P.I, Essie, and China Glaze produce these shades, though you can find tan complementing shades in just about any brand., Certain types of jewelry can make a tan stand out more than others. Gold bangles, chains, and hoops are good choices for summery jewelry that complement a tan. White accessories like cuffs, braided leather bracelets, and pearls will also make your tan stand out. Diamond or fake diamond jewelry will attract attention to your tan because of its pale color and shiny quality., Applying bronzer is a good way to get a glow even if you do not have a tan. With a tan, bronzer will enhance your glow and slightly deepen the tan on your face. To use bronzer, get a big fluffy brush, and dip it into the product. Then, apply it to your cheekbones, temples, and and across your nose.Make sure not too apply too much bronzer. Lightly apply the product.
Some shades of bronzers may not be right for your skin. Get the advice of a makeup consultant before purchasing a bronzer.
A few recommended bronzers are: Clinique True Bronze Pressed Powder Bronzer, bareMinerals Warmth All-Over Face Color, and E.L.F Bronzer.

, It is not necessary to change your hair color, but you can think about changing your hair color or adding highlights. Some shades of hair color complement tans better than other colors. Blonde shades are probably best known for complementing a tan. For golden skin tones, choose warm shades of blonde, like golden blonde. Ash and platinum blonde works best with cool skin tones. If you do not want to go blonde, you can choose a medium golden brown, or golden beige highlights to accentuate your tan.Pink is another shade that surprisingly goes well with a tan. Bright or a faded color of pink are the best shades to complement a tan.

, You may already be tan, but if not, you will need to get a tan. There are many ways to get a tan. Some are more dangerous than others. A few ways to get tan are:


Lay out in the sun. To do this, you will need to find a sunny spot, wear a bathing suit, apply sunscreen, and lay out for at least thirty minutes. Don’t lay out in the sun too long or too much. Too much exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer.
Go to a tanning bed. Using a tanning bed is a quick, but potentially dangerous method. You can find a tanning salon in your area, pay for a subscription, and then use the tanning beds as much as you please. Tanning in a bed, however, can increase your chances of skin cancer more than any other method of tanning.
Get a spray tan. This is a safe way to get a tan. You can go to a tanning salon in your area that does spray tans, and pay for their service. Spray tans typically do not last longer than a couple of weeks, and they may rub off on your clothing and sheets. But, they do not risk your health.
Apply a self-tanner. This is the cheapest and safest way to get a spray tan. You can purchase a spray or cream and apply it in your home. It is inexpensive and safe for your health, but it can produce an unnatural color and come off on your clothing.

, Moisturize at least twice a day. You need to moisturize to keep your tan healthy and lasting. Apply moisturizer in the morning and at night. In the morning, apply a cream that has SPF in it. At night, use a hydrating face and body cream.Eau Soleil Body Milk is recommended for the morning. After sun exposure, Biotherm’s Crème Nacrée After Sun is recommended.

, Along with moisturizing, use a tinted oil or cream. Use a cream or oil with SPF in it for added protection from UV rays. Tinted products will add an extra glow to your skin, keep you moisturized, and protect you from skin damage.BB creams are a good and common choice. You can also find tinted creams for specific needs, like oily skin, anti-aging, and dry skin.

Drink a lot of water.,

Use witch hazel.,
Apply apple cider vinegar to the area.,
Apply potato slices to the area.,
Apply live cultured yogurt.,
Wear loose and dark clothing.,
Use make-up to cover the redness.",How to Reduce the Redness of Sunburn1," Try to drink at least 10 full glasses of water each day for a week after your sunburn. This will help your body to re-hydrate which will, in turn, aid in the healing process. Drinking water while you are out in the sun will also help you to avoid heatstroke and other heat-related medical conditions.At the same time, make sure to avoid consuming any alcohol during your recovery period. This will only dehydrate you and dry out your skin even more.;
, This is the traditional go-to remedy when dealing with a burn. The gel of the aloe vera plant has natural anti-inflammatory properties and can speed up the healing process if applied correctly. You can buy a store-brand aloe, but it is best to use the gel directly from a plant when possible.To remove the gel from a plant, break off a single full stem. Cut the stem open lengthwise. Open the stem and scrape out the gel using a spoon or your finger. Apply the gel to your skin between 2-3 times a day.For extra relief, you could also fill up an ice cube tray with aloe vera and freeze it, making aloe cubes that you can rub on your burn. (Wrap the cubes in a light hand towel before touching them to your skin). You can also apply aloe gel to your face in an overnight mask., Get out a small bowl and mix equal parts baking soda and cornstarch. Add cool water until it reaches a thick enough consistency to apply to your skin. Both of these primary ingredients may take some of the redness out the burned areas. Rinse the paste and reapply as needed to soothe your skin., You can use the leaves and bark of the witch hazel plant for medicinal purposes. The “tannins” contained in witch hazel may help to repel bacteria and promote healing. Look for a vial of witch hazel extract at your local natural foods store. Use a cotton ball to apply the extract to your skin., You can fill up a bottle and spray the vinegar directly on your skin for relief. Or, you can soak cotton balls in vinegar and place them on your skin. Vinegar is a known anti-inflammatory, so it may speed up the healing process.Be aware that some people react badly to apple cider vinegar. It is a good idea to apply a small amount on the back of your hand, via a cotton ball, before putting it all over your body. This will allow you to watch your body’s reaction on a small scale to make sure you will be okay.

, Many natural healers swear that potatoes can reduce pain and inflammation. Get a few potatoes and use a knife to cut them into thin slices. Then, place these slices on the burnt areas of your skin. Rotate the slices until you feel some relief.You can also dice or shred a potato and place it into a blender. Blend for a few pulses and then apply the resulting paste (being careful to include the potato juices) onto your skin.
Make sure to carefully wash the potatoes before slicing or dicing.

, This one is a bit of a long-shot but, if nothing else, the cool temperature of the yogurt may soothe your skin. Get out a cup of plain, probiotic yogurt and apply a light coating to your burned skin using a cotton ball. Let the yogurt sit on your skin for around 5 minutes before wiping off with a clean damp towel., Light, cotton garments that fall away from the skin are your best options during your recovery period. These items will let your skin breathe, preventing stagnation and lessening the possibility of infection. Stick to darker colors as they will draw less attention to your skin. Avoid whites and neon colors as they will create contrast with the redness, making it more noticeable., Apply a green-tinted primer to the burned areas to counterbalance the appearance of redness. Don't apply blush as it will only increase the red look. Use a light hand with make-up, however, as you can run the risk of skin irritation."

Understand how tanning works.,
Always apply sun protection before tanning.,
Know when and how long to tan.,
Use a tanning oil to help accelerate the tanning process.",How to Tan Safely1," Tanning is the process of cells in your skin protecting you from harmful UVA and UVB rays that come from the sun, not simply a pretty glow you get in the summer time.


UVA and UVB rays are a type of radiation linked to cancer. Prolonged exposure can greatly increase the likelihood of cancerous cells growing in your skin.
A tan works as a shield from radiation. Imagine thousands of tiny umbrellas in your skin; they open more the more they are exposed to the sun, which in turn makes your skin look darker.
A tan does not cause cancer but is rather the visible evidence that damage to your skin cells has already occurred. ;
, Going into the sun without using sunscreen greatly increases your risk for cancer.


Sunblock is a product that uses titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to completely block out UV rays from the sun. This means you will get no tan while wearing it.
Sunscreen is a product that allows some UV rays to penetrate to the skins surface, which gives you the ability to get a slight tan.
Sun Protection Factor (SPF) refers to the amount of UV radiation that can saturate your sun protection to reach your skin. For example SPF 30 means that 1/30th of the sun’s UV rays are in contact with your skin.
Use an SPF no lower than SPF 30.
Use a shot's glass worth of sunscreen or sunblock on your entire body, concentrating on the areas most in contact with the sun (shoulders, nose and face, arms, back).
Sunscreen and sunblock must be reapplied every two hours, or after entering water., UV radiation is at it’s highest between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM, so be extra cautious during these times. Try to tan in increments to minimize damage; one hour a day is a safe amount of time.

, Tanning oils contain certain chemicals that intensify UV rays, which darkens your skin faster.


The purpose of a tanning oil is not to block out sun like sunscreen, but to concentrate the radiation from the sun to expedite the “shielding” process of your skin.
Only use tanning oils which offer some sun protection; SPF 15 or higher is best.
Like sunscreen, coat your entire body in tanning oil and reapply often to ensure an adequate amount of protection.

Use a cream-based cleanser if you have dry skin.
Use a oil-based pH-balanced gentle cleanser if you have normal skin.
Use a foaming cleanser if you have oily skin.;
, After you’ve washed your face, it’s time to hydrate and protect your skin. Massage in a quality moisturizer with an SPF and apply eye cream.To make sure your face is being protected by the sun, get a moisturizer that protects against UVA rays., It’s crucial that you create an even base before applying your bronzer, and that starts with concealer. Apply concealer to the areas of your face that seem to have discoloration.

Use green concealer for red spots and blemishes.
Use peach concealer for bluish gray under-eye circles.
Use yellow concealer to even skin tone., Once you’ve put on concealer, apply an even coat of liquid foundation over the entirety of your face. This will smooth out your complexion and create a blank canvas for your contouring.You can put your foundation on with a makeup sponge, a makeup brush, or by using your fingertips.

Be sure to blend the foundation down your neck slightly for a more natural look.
Don’t apply blush until after you apply your bronzer.

, Since the purpose of a bronzer is to darken the complexion subtly, the one you choose will depend on the color of your skin. Generally, it should only be two shades darker than your natural skin tone. Test a little on your wrist to make sure it ""warms"" your skin tone without making it look fake.









If you have fair skin, look for a honey-colored bronzer.
For a medium complexion, choose a rose-bronze or gold flecked bronzer.
Dark skin is best enhanced with a tawny or amber bronzer., If your brush is too small or stiff, it may cause blotches and streaks to form when you apply the bronzer. There are specialized bronzer brushes available on the market, although any large blush or foundation brush will work equally as well.








, It is best to apply your bronzer in light, even coats to build up color rather than adding a single dark layer at once. Therefore, just lightly coat the end of your brush in the powder and tap off the excess onto the lid of the container.







, Your bronzer should be applied in the shape of a “3” from the top to the bottom of your face on both sides, starting with your forehead. Lightly sweep the brush along the outer sides of your upper forehead and along your hairline., Next, make a fish face and apply your bronzer to your cheekbones. You can also do this by smiling, starting at the apples of your cheeks, and sweeping slightly up toward your hairline., Finally, complete the “3” shape by sweeping your bronzer along your jawline. This will add definition to your face., As you’re applying bronzer, you’ll want to focus on covering the areas of your face that sunlight tends to hit. Do a final dusting of your bronzer on the higher points of your face, such as the bridge of your nose and your chin. Complete the natural glow by applying bronzer to your neck so that it matches the coloring of your face., Take out another fluffy, clean brush and softly blend everything in so there aren’t any unnatural lines or blotches. It’s especially important that you blend the neck area.To blend most effectively, work the brush outward in small, circular motions., If you’ve blended and your complexion still doesn’t look smooth and subtle in color transition, swirl your blending brush in a translucent powder, tap off the excess, and blend again., After you’re done, make sure to spray your entire face with a makeup setting spray to keep your face looking radiant all day."

Take a pain medication.,
Apply a cool cloth to the area.,
Take a cool bath.,
Soothe with cucumber.,
Drink some tea.,
Avoid applying ice.,
Do not pick at the affected area.,
Consult with a doctor.",How to Reduce the Redness of Sunburn2," As soon as you get out of the sun, take an over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatory medication, such as Aspirin. Go ahead and ingest the highest recommended dose for at least the first 24 hours to kick-start the healing process. Keep taking the medication until the immediate discomfort from the burn has subsided.


No matter how much pain you feel, it is critical that you follow the dosage instructions for OTC or prescription pain medications. Taking more than the proper dosage can cause serious medical injuries, such as liver damage. Read the label carefully to determine how many pills to take and at what intervals.
Make sure that you are also aware of any possible pain medication side effects or drug interactions. These are often also listed on the bottle’s label or you can contact your doctor with any questions. For example, people with bleeding issues are often advised to avoid consuming Aspirin.
You can also get a small bowl, drop one or two aspirin tablets into it, and crush them into a paste (adding a little water, if needed). Then, apply this paste to the most burned areas. Wipe off after a few minutes. However, for health safety reasons, do not crush and use more pills than the recommended dosage on the bottle or apply this paste while also taking a pain medication orally., Pull out a soft cotton washcloth and dip it into cool, not cold, water. Wring it out slightly and then place it on your skin. Re-soak the cloth and repeat as necessary. You can also dip the cloth in whole cold milk. This will let you get the cooling benefits and the restorative effects of vitamin D., Run a bath for yourself using cool, not cold, water. Soak for a bit. For even more benefit, fill up a clean sock with 2 cups of uncooked oatmeal and tie it off at the end. Place the filled sock in the tub with you and squeeze it to release the juices. The oatmeal’s polysaccharides will coat and calm your skin.You can also, of course, dump the raw oats directly into the tub with you, but expect more of a clean-up this way.
Resist the urge to scrub off with soap or a body cleanser while in the tub. This will only dry your skin out and extend the healing process., Add a bit of cucumber to your water for a relaxing way to hydrate. Place thin slices of cucumber on your burn. Or, blend cucumbers to create a mask that you can then apply to your face or elsewhere. All of these approaches will maximize the antioxidant properties found in cucumbers.Feel free to mix the cucumber paste with aloe vera gel for even more of a healing boost.

, Make yourself a cup of green tea. You can either drink the tea directly or dip some cotton balls into it and apply it to your skin. The antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties of the tea may reduce redness and swelling, allowing your skin to heal., It is very tempting to pluck a few cubes out of the freezer and place them directly onto your skin. Resist this urge as that type of extreme cold can actually damage your skin even more, killing the skin cells in the process. Instead, if you really want to use ice, wrap the cubes in a soft, clean washcloth before touching them to your skin.

, Resist the urge to run your fingers over your skin, removing flakes as you go. Your dead skin will fall off in due time without your direct assistance. Forcibly exfoliating your skin too early can lead to scarring or infection. This is especially the case if you puncture any raised areas or sores.Once your skin has returned to a close-to-normal color and is pain-free then you can spend some time exfoliating it with a soft sponge or scrubber.

, Make an appointment to see a physician if your sunburn develops blisters or seems to be swelling. If you see any pus coming from the burned areas, it can be a sign of possible infection. You can also see a doctor if your burn is simply making you miserable and the home remedies seem to have no effect.Depending on your specific situation, your doctor will most likely give you a corticosteroid cream. They may also prescribe an antibiotic if your burn shows signs of infection.

Apply sunscreen before going out.,
Reapply sunscreen on a regular basis.,
Wear a hat.,
Pay attention to your body’s signals.,
Ask your friends to check you out.,
Be very careful when recovering.",How to Reduce the Redness of Sunburn3," Purchase a broad-spectrum (also called a full-spectrum) sunscreen that will block both UVA and UVB rays. Get a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 50, the higher the better. Then, apply the cream to your skin at least 20 minutes before heading outside. This allows the sunscreen to begin working before you are actually exposed to the sun, thus preventing burning.As you consider various sunscreen brands, consider what activities you’ll be doing that will require protection. If you will be in the water, then you’ll want a sunscreen that is water-resistant. If you are hiking, you may need a sunscreen that includes insect repellant.

, You should aim to reapply your sunscreen at least every 90 minutes. This interval may need to be shortened if you are sweating heavily or spending time in the water. When you reapply, don’t rush. Make sure to coat all exposed parts of your body.For each application you can estimate using a nickel-sized portion on your facial area and two shot glasses worth of lotion on your body.

, It is almost impossible to apply sunscreen to your scalp and that makes this area very susceptible to burning. To prevent a painful head burn, wear a solid hat when venturing outdoors for extended periods of time. This will also offer some protection for your face as well., Your body will often tell you when it has had enough of the sun. Pause in your activities for a moment and evaluate your condition. Does your skin feel overly warm? Are you starting to notice feelings of tightness? Are you experiencing any pain at this point? If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, head indoors.

, If you are outside with other people you can always ask them to look you over. However, the reflection from the sun on your skin can often mask the visual signs of a burn, so it may be difficult for them to accurately gauge if you are headed in that direction.

, It can take up to six months for your skin to fully heal after a sunburn. If you are burned again during this interval, the healing process can come to a standstill. While you are healing, be careful with your body and limit your time in the sun."

Use a self-tanner.,
Avoid tanning pills.,
Maintain your tan.",How to Tan Safely2," These are lotions, creams, and sprays that dye your skin to give the illusion of a tan.


Sunless tanners use a chemical called dihydroxyacetone which dyes the dead skin cells on your body. This means that it is only temporary, as it will last only until your body sheds the dead skin.
For an even tan, use an exfoliant to rub off dead skin cells prior to applying your sunless tanner.
Give your body an all-over even coating to avoid streaks and spots of color.
Self-tanners may not contain sunscreen. You can still get skin damage with a sunless tanner if you spend prolonged periods of time outdoors. Be sure to apply a sunscreen in addition to your self-tanner to keep your skin healthy.
Be sure the self-tanner you choose does not require time in the sun in addition to the lotion. Some self-tanners blend in with the other sunless options, but are not sunless at all.

, These contain a chemical dye that, over time, can turn your skin orange and damage your liver. , Apply lotion regularly to reduce the number of dead skin cells you shed, and increase the longevity of your tan.

Be wary of tanning beds.,
Look for alternatives to a spray tan.",How to Tan Safely3," They may not use real sunlight, but they still expose you to the UV rays that cause skin damage.


Tanning beds work by simulating the radiation put off by the sun. This means that they don't reduce the risk of skin damage at all compared to natural sunlight.
Using an indoor tanning bed before the age of thirty increases the likelihood of getting skin cancer by 75%. , The spray-tans available at these salons are not FDA approved, and may cause damage to your body if ingested through the nose and mouth. "

Ensure to completely scrub the tan off at the end of the week, or when you feel you need to re-tan.",How to Apply Self Tanner," There are so many self tanning products out there, it can be difficult to choose one that will work for you. Some formulas allow you to build a tan gradually over the course of a few days or a week, while others immediately stain your skin bronze. Some are long-lasting, while others wear off after a week or wash off at the end of the day. Figure out which product is best for your needs:



Gradual self-tanning formulas. These come in the form of creams, gels, sprays or foams. Gradual self-tanning formulas usually contain either dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and Erythrulose, both of which work by reacting with the amino acids on the skin surface to create a darker complexion. One application will darken the skin by just a shade or so, but you can keep applying the product over the course of several days to achieve the color you want.

Instant tanning formulas. Most instant tanners are sprays that you can apply immediately for a sun-kissed look. Some stay in place for about a week, while others can be washed away at the end of the day. Instant formulas are trickier to apply than gradual formulas, since they stain the skin right away and might leave streaks.

Face tanning formulas. Look for a self-tanner designed for use on the face if yours is on the sensitive or oily side. While most self-tanners work on the body and the face equally well, you'll want to get one specifically for the face if your skin is a little finicky.

Pick the right color. If you have fair skin, choose a light to medium color. If you have olive skin, choose a dark formula. You can always reapply the self-tanner to deepen your tan if your first application looks too light.;
, Thick hair can get in the way of self-tanner when you're trying to apply it evenly. You might want to shave or wax your legs (and arms, if necessary) to ensure you'll be happy with the final appearance of your tan.


If you have fine hair on your legs or arms, there's no need to remove it before tanning unless you want to.
Guys might also want to shave or wax the chest or back before applying self tanner.

, No matter what your skin type, is, it's best to exfoliate well in the shower before tanning. When your skin has dry, flaky patches, it's a lot harder to apply self-tanner evenly, and you'll end up with a patchy look instead of a pretty finish. The chemicals in self tanner react with amino acids in the upper layers of your skin. By removing the uppermost layer (which would've sloughed off on its own soon anyway) you're ensuring that the tan develops in a fresh layer that's going to be around longer. Also, dry skin tends to absorb more color, increasing the likelihood of an uneven tan. To exfoliate, use a washcloth, a scrub brush or scrub gel to thoroughly exfoliate all of the areas you're tanning.


Focus on rough spots like your elbows and knees. The self-tanner tends to darken these areas more than other parts of your body, since it soaks in faster. Rough skin will cause the application to look even more uneven.
Moisturize the skin after exfoliating, particularly if your skin is dry. Pay attention to areas like the knees and elbows where tan can build up. Use lotion or oil to trap the moisture in your skin after your shower. Allow it to fully absorb into your skin over an hour or so before you apply the self-tanner.

, It's important that while you're applying the self tanner, your skin is completely dry. If you're going to be in the bathroom, wait for any humidity from the bath or shower to subside. Make sure it's cool enough wherever you are so that you don't sweat for the next few hours.

, A rushed self-tanning job is immediately obvious. You'll miss some spots, have streaky areas or stain your clothes and hands. Do yourself a favor and set aside several hours so you can make sure you have enough time to thoroughly and evenly cover each area you're planning to tan.

, This will protect your palms from turning 'orange'. The palms of your hands don't naturally tan, so if you get self-tanner on them it'll be a dead giveaway that your tan came from a bottle instead of the sun's rays. If you don't have latex gloves or a tanning mitt handy, you can wash your hands with soapy water throughout the process to remove self-tanner.


You may also want to protect your bathroom surfaces by putting down an old sheet or a plastic tarp and applying the self-tanner while standing on it. Keep nice towels and other items out of the way. Self-tanner is known for creating tough stains.

, Working from the ankles up toward your torso will result in a natural-looking tan. Squeeze a small amount of tanning product into the palm of your hand. Spread the tanner over your skin in broad circular motions. Follow the instructions that came with your formula to determine how long to rub it in. Apply it to one body part at a time so you can be sure not to miss any spots.


If you're using a spray tanner, follow the directions regarding how far you should hold the can from your body and how long you should spray any given area. Holding it too close or spraying too long could result in an uneven tan.
Around your feet, spread the tanner from your legs onto your ankles and the tops of your feet, and use as little as possible in this area. Don't apply any to your toes, heels, or the sides of your feet, since these areas don't tan much naturally. It may be a good idea to use a makeup brush for this step, so you can really blend it in well.
If you're applying it to your back, use a strap or a band for even application. Better yet, ask a friend to help you out.
If you aren't wearing gloves, use a timer and make sure you wash your hands every five minutes, scrubbing under and around the nails.
While most people don't have tanned underarms, avoiding that area can be difficult, so it's better to apply self tanner there and lightly wipe with a damp washcloth about five minutes later.

, Blending the tanning lotion with a regular lotion around the ankles, wrists, knees and elbows will result in a lighter, more natural-looking application around these areas. Any type of regular moisturizing lotion works well.


Apply a very small amount of regular lotion to the tops of your feet (if you are using gloves, rinse them in water and dry them to ensure no additional tan will mix in with the moisturiser, or wash hands afterwards) and blend it with the tanner that you've already applied around your ankles.
Apply a small amount of regular lotion around your knees, especially just below the knee.
Do the same thing to your elbows, especially the part that puckers when your arm is straight.
Use plenty of lotion on your hands, and blend it into your wrists.

, Apply the tanner sparingly on your face and neck because that skin will darken easily. Start by applying it to the places where you naturally tan: your forehead, the apples of your cheeks, your chin, and the bridge of your nose. Using a steady circular motion, smooth the tanning lotion outward to cover the rest of your face as well.You might want to apply some petroleum jelly to your eyebrows before you begin, that way the tanning lotion won't collect there and darken the area too much.Be careful not to get too much tanning lotion on your upper lip, as this spot absorbs more lotion than other areas on the face.
Don't forget to apply it behind your ears and the back of your neck, especially if you have short hair.

, Avoid contact with anything or anyone for the first 15 minutes, and don't get dressed for an hour. If that's not convenient, you can put on a loose article of clothing, but make it something you don't mind staining. Avoid contact with water or doing anything that'll make you sweat for the first three hours after application.

Try to wait 8 hours before showering or bathing again. Avoid exfoliating or using retinol on your skin for several days.
Wait at least 8 hours before deciding to apply more tanner. It takes awhile to work, and if you act too soon you might end up too tan!
If you feel sticky, you can apply baby powder with a large body powder puff 30-60 minutes after applying the lotion. Don't rub it in, though, or it could affect the finish of your tan.

, If you missed a spot or two, don't worry! You can easily correct the problem with a little extra tanning lotion. Put on a fresh pair of latex gloves, rub a dime-sized amount of tanner in your palm, and lightly apply it to the bare spots. Be sure to blend it around the edges so it'll look even when it begins to show up.


Be extra careful not to use too much tanner this second time around. If you accidentally spread too much on your skin, wipe it off with a tissue right away.

, Remove tanner from places that are too dark. If you have streaky spots or patches that are darker than the surrounding areas, you'll need to take a bit of the tanner off. This can be tricky, but luckily there are a few different methods to choose from:



Scrub the spot in the shower. Use a scrub brush or a washcloth to firmly scrub the spot in question. The tanner should fade a little in that spot.

Use lemon juice. Dip a tissue in lemon juice and dab it on the affected area. Let it dry completely and sit for about 20 minutes, then wash it off.

, As your top layer of skin dries and begins to flake, your tan will begin flaking away and fading, too. To make it last longer, keep your skin moisturized by rubbing lotion on it every day. Use sunscreen when you go outside, since even bottle-tanned skin needs to be protect from the sun's drying and damaging rays.

, If you want to go a few shades deeper, or your tan is beginning to fade, re-apply the self-tanner using the same method you used to begin with. Be sure to apply it evenly so you don't end up with some faded spots and some freshly tanned spots. Gradual self-tanners can be reapplied every few days to subtly deepen your tan.

, Use an exfoliating body scrub and/or exfoliating gloves with warm water to really remove the tan. It may take a few washes. Remember to keep moisturising. Then start the whole process again. By forgetting this step, your tan will build up in certain areas, collecting inbetween the fingers or elbows. Eventually it will become harder to scrub off if you miss this part, and will begin to look patchy. Focus on creating a nice, smooth base for your tan to develop onto."

Opt for navy.,
Go with a denim shade.,
Try an electric blue lipstick.,
Decide on a formula.,
Line your lips.,
Apply the lipstick.,
Plan for regular touch-ups.,
Dab on some shimmery blue eyeshadow.,
Keep eye makeup simple.,
Use a light coverage foundation.,
Add a some bronzer and highlights.",How to Wear Blue Lipstick," Navy blue lipstick is flattering on almost everyone. It is also the most popular and easy to find color. If you are new to blue lipstick, then a navy shade might be the best place to start.Navy lipsticks are usually matte, but you can apply a clear gloss over the lipstick if you prefer a shiny lip look.
You can find navy blue lipsticks in different shades, from lighter shades to navy blues that look almost black.;
, Denim shades are more complex and may not work with all skin tones. Try pairing a denim shade with a light smoky eye or a little bronze eyeshadow. This is a great shade to wear on a night out.Denim shades are more of a true or royal blue color.

, If you are feeling extra bold and adventurous, then you might consider wearing an electric blue lipstick. This shade is lighter and brighter than a navy or denim lip, so it will definitely make a statement.Electric blue lipsticks might work best for a spring or summer look, since they are light and bright.
You can wear electric blue lipstick with bare skin or amp up the drama with a bold cat eye look.

, Depending on what shade you choose, you may have the choice of a liquid or creamy formula lipstick. Each of these formulas will give you a different result. The liquid lipstick may create a wet or shiny look, while the creamy formula may give you more of a matte look.


Keep in mind that some liquid lipsticks will provide a matte look as well. Be sure to check the tube for details about the lipstick, such as whether it is matte or shiny.

, Start by lining your lips with an eyeliner or lip liner in a color that is similar to your blue lipstick. For example, you can use an eggplant lip liner if you are planning to wear a navy lipstick. Or, you can just use a navy blue eyeliner as a lip liner.Line your lips along the outer edge of your lips, but keep it on your lips. Don’t apply the liner outside of your lip line.

, Next, apply the lipstick evenly. Be sure to stay inside the lines. Depending on the lipstick, you may need to apply two coats to ensure even coverage.Press your lips together after applying the lipstick to distribute the color on your lips.

, Blue lipstick looks best when it is bold and even, so it is important to touch it up regularly. Plan to touch it up once every hour or so, and after eating or drinking anything.Keep a compact mirror handy so you can touch up on the go.

, Blue eyeshadow can add some extra shimmer and dimension to a blue lip look, which can be a nice touch. If you want to add some shimmer to your blue lip look, then choose a blue eyeshadow that has some shimmer to it. Use your fingertip to dab some of the eyeshadow onto the center of your lips.Apply a layer of clear lip balm over the eyeshadow to keep it in place.
Don’t apply blue eyeshadow if you are going for a matte look.

, Wearing too much eye makeup with blue lipstick can look too dramatic. Unless dramatic is what you are going for, keep your eye makeup simple with a thin line of black liner on your top lash or a swipe of some shimmery gold or silver eyeshadow. Then, finish your eye makeup with a couple of coats of mascara.You can experiment with bold eye makeup looks while wearing blue lipstick, but keep in mind that the blue lipstick is already quite bold. You don’t need to do too much.

, Too much foundation can also be detrimental for a blue lip look. It may cause you to look overdone since the blue lipstick is already so bold. Try wearing a light layer of your usual foundation or use a light coverage foundation, such as a BB cream.If you wear powder foundation, then just sweep on a light layer. Don’t apply multiple layers.

, Wearing such a dark color may cause your skin tone to appear lighter than usual. To avoid looking washed out or pale, contour your face with some bronzer and highlight in a few areas as well, such as on your cheekbones and forehead.Skip on the blush while you are wearing blue lipstick. It’s best to avoid adding too much color to your face because it will compete with the blue lipstick.

Exfoliate and moisturize your lips.,
Line your lips.,
Fill in your lips.,
Add a second layer.,
Top with gloss.,
Keep your black lipstick on hand in case you need to reapply.",How to Wear Black Lipstick1," Black lipstick starts to look streaky and flaky more quickly than other colors. To prevent this from happening, it's important to prep your lips before you apply it. Make sure you remove all skin flakes and moisturize your lips so they're soft and supple. If your lips are chapped, you might want to save the black lipstick for another time.


Exfoliate by brushing your lips with a soft toothbrush, or use a lip scrub.
Moisturize with a rich lip balm or coconut oil.;
, Apply black lip liner around the outline of your lips, taking care to draw the exact shape you want. This will keep your lipstick looking defined and intentional. Without liner, black lipstick tends to run outside the lines of your lips, which can make you look smudged and messy.


If you don't have black lip liner, you can use a black eye pencil instead.
Always use a shade of liner that's a little darker than your lipstick.

, The best way to apply black lipstick is with a lipstick brush. If you don't have a lipstick brush, spread out your lips. This will help ensure that the lipstick gets into all of your lips' tiny creases. Run a lipstick brush (or another small makeup brush) over the lipstick, then use it to carefully apply black lipstick to completely fill in your lips.After you're finished, smile in the mirror. Fill in any creases that didn't get coated.
Keep a cotton swab handy in case you accidentally go outside the lines.

, This will keep your lipstick from fading and streaking as you go about your day. You can apply the second layer using your lipstick directly on your lips. Take a look in the mirror to make sure the lipstick is nice and neat.

, Black lipstick can look a little flat, so try adding a layer of clear gloss to finish your look. The extra shine will give your lip color extra depth. It also serves to help keep your lipstick from fading or streaking.

, Black lipstick will probably need to be reapplied each time you take a drink or eat something. If you're wearing it to a cocktail party or another event at which you'll be eating and drinking, don't forget to bring along your lipstick. Faded black lipstick tends to look gray and drab, so you'll probably need to do a touch-up at least once before the evening is over.

Keep your face clean and neutral.,
Use black eyeliner to balance your lip.,
Add some colored eyeshadow.,
Try a dark plum or berry color for a less severe look.,
Add a layer of shimmer for a striking nighttime look.",How to Wear Black Lipstick2," Black lipstick makes a big statement, and you don't want to distract from that by wearing too much other makeup. Create a clean palette by using a neutral foundation the exact color of your skin. Use just the barest hint of blush, bronzer and other face color so as not to overwhelm your black lipstick.

, Completely bare eyes might look too naked in contrast to your lips. While you don't want to go overboard with eye makeup, using black liner and mascara adds a nice touch. Try a light cat-eye look, or simply rim your top and bottom lids with a sleep of eyeliner.


Use black eyeliner to match your black lipstick. Using a different color could cause your face to look to busy.
Avoid piling on the liner or doing a smokey-eye look. This could take your face from looking striking to overly goth.

, Using a hint of color will brighten your face and keep your look from getting too dismal. Apply a light layer of jewel-toned eyeshadow to your lids, brushing the color out toward the corners of your eyes. If you're feeling daring, sweep a little color under your eyes as well.

, If you love a dark lip but don't want to wear jet black, there are still plenty of options that will cause heads to turn. Dark purples, reds and browns are a little easier to pull off than full-on black. All dark lipsticks should be applied with the same care as black, since streaking and flaking will show up more easily than with lighter shades.Don't forget to exfoliate and moisturize your lips first.
Use lipliner a shade darker than your lip color.
Apply two layers of color, then top with gloss if you'd like.

, If you want to add another gorgeous dimension to your black lipstick, try topping it with a layer of clear shimmery gloss. Your lips will sparkle under the low lights at the club or bar where you'll be hanging out. Since this look can take on a costume makeup appearance, save it for special occasions that call for getting dressed up in style."

Contrast your lipstick with a preppy outfit.,
Go totally goth.",How to Wear Black Lipstick3," Black lipstick is a natural fit with dark jewel-toned clothes that you start to reach for in late fall and throughout the winter. It looks great with sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green and dark fuschia. Try black lipstick with one of these looks:A dark blue velvet dress with black lace trim.
A green silk blouse paired with a black pencil skirt.
A ruby red coat and black riding boots.

, Black lipstick doesn't have to be relegated to the winter months; it looks fabulous in the summer as well. Black looks particularly striking when paired with bright neon shades; the contrast is truly eye-catching. If you like neon, try one of the following looks paired with black lipstick:

Add a complementary blush.",How to Wear Berry Lipstick," There are a wide variety of berry lipsticks on the market, which run the spectrum from light to dark and highly opaque to sheer. Determine how intense you want your berry lip color to be, so you can choose the appropriate lipstick.Dark, opaque berry lipstick can look very harsh if you have fair skin. That doesn’t mean you can’t wear a dark berry lipstick if you have pale skin. Just choose a sheer formula.
If you have medium skin, you can opt for a darker, more opaque berry lipstick because it won’t look as harsh with your complexion.
For dark skin, you want to choose a very dark, rich berry shade so it won’t blend in with your skin.;
, When you’re choosing a berry lipstick, it’s also important to consider your skin’s undertones to find the most flattering option. Some shades will look better with warm skin, while other shades are more complementary for cool skin. Neutral skin will typically look good with any berry shade.To determine your skin’s undertone, look at the veins at the inside of your wrist. If they have a greenish color, you have warm skin. If they have a blue or purplish color, you have cool skin. If your veins seem to be a bluish green color, you have neutral skin.
Another quick way to determine your skin’s undertone is to consider whether you look better in gold or silver jewelry. Gold typically flatters warm skin, while silver is more complementary for cool skin. If they are both flattering with your skin, you probably have neutral skin.

, Once you know what undertones your skin has, you can choose the most flattering berry lipstick for your complexion. Warm skin looks best with berry shades that have the same warm undertones, while cool skin pairs best with lipstick that has similar cool undertones. If your skin is neutral, you can usually choose any berry lipstick that catches your eye.If you have warm skin, opt for shades that have orange undertones, such as maroon, burgundy, or deep red berry shades.
If you have cool skin, opt for berry shades that have blue undertones, such as wine, deep plum, or oxblood berry shades.
Mahogany and plum berry shades tend to look good on every skin tone.

, The finish of your berry lipstick can affect how it looks and wears. A matte berry lipstick will usually provide the most opaque color and wear longer on your lips. A cream berry lipstick will have fairly intense color but provide more moisture and not last as long on the lips. A glossy lipstick will usually provide sheer color, significant moisture, and a fairly short wear time.If you want to ensure that your berry lipstick looks rich all day, choose a matte shade.
If you have dry, chapped lips, opt for a cream or glossy berry lipstick. You’ll likely need to reapply your lipstick throughout the day, but your lips won’t look as dry or cracked.

, Deep, rich lip colors like berry tend to emphasize any dry, rough patches on your lips. To make sure that your lips are smooth and soft, use a lip scrub to get rid of any flakes before you apply the lipstick.To use a lip scrub, massage a small amount onto your lips with a finger, working in circular motions. Wipe the scrub away with a warm washcloth.


Some lip scrubs may have different usage instructions. Be sure to consult the packaging to determine the proper way to apply and remove the scrub.
You can also make your own lip scrub from items in your kitchen. Mix an equal amount of sugar and olive oil to form a paste, and massage it over your lips as you would with a store-bought scrub.

, After you’ve exfoliated your lips, it’s important to lock in the moisture so your berry lipstick applies smoothly and evenly. Use your favorite hydrating lip balm to moisturize your lips and ready them for the lipstick. Allow it to sink in for at least 5 minutes before applying your lipliner and lipstick.If you’re concerned that the lip balm will sheer out the lipstick, be sure to blot your lips with a tissue before applying the lipstick.

, Lip liner helps keep your lipstick from bleeding outside the lip line and provides a base for the lipstick to stick to. Use a nude liner that matches your natural lip color or a berry liner that matches your lipstick shade to trace your natural lip line and then lightly fill in your lips.If you want to ensure that your berry color is as rich and intense as possible, use a liner that matches the lipstick.
For a softer look, opt for a nude lipliner.

, If you have fair skin or are wearing the berry lipstick during the day, you may not want the color to be too intense. To soften the look, apply the lipstick to your finger and then lightly tap your fingertip against your lips to create a stain.Be careful when you’re applying the lipstick near the edge of your lips. It’s difficult to be precise with your fingertip, so you may want to use a matching lipliner and only tap the lipstick on the center of your lips.

, You’ll get the richest, most opaque berry color if you apply the lipstick directly from the tube. Smooth it over your lips, taking care around the edges to prevent the lipstick from bleeding outside your lip line.If you feel like you can’t be precise enough with the lipstick bullet, you can use a lip brush to apply it. The lipstick won’t be as opaque, but you’ll still get rich color and more precision.

, Your berry lipstick will last longer if you apply multiple layers. However, you don’t want to apply too much lipstick and have it bleed outside your lip line. Before applying a second layer, use a tissue to blot your lips and remove any excess lipstick.If you have oil blotting papers, which are typically used to blot oil away from the face without disturbing your makeup, you can use those to blot your lips. They’ll remove the excess emollient left behind by the lipstick without removing any of the pigment.

, After you’ve blotted your lips, apply a second layer of lipstick. Be just as precise as you were with the first layer so your lipstick appears neat and even.If you apply the first layer of lipstick directly from the tube, you can switch to a finger or a brush for the second. That’s because that first layer will provide a rich base so the color will look opaque.

, Wearing a rich berry lipstick with heavy, matte foundation can give you a harsh, almost goth-like look. Instead, pair the lipstick with a sheer, dewy foundation that will keep your skin looking fresh. A tinted moisturizer or BB cream is a good option too. You can cover up any imperfections that show through your foundation with a concealer.Unless your skin is extremely oily, you may want to skip setting powder when you’re wearing berry lipstick. It can sometimes make your makeup look too heavy.

, When it comes to eye makeup, you don’t want to wear bold colors that will compete with your berry lipstick. Opt for neutral shadows in shades such as beige, gray, or brown. Pair the shadow with black or brown liner to keep the look natural.To ensure that your eyes still look finished, apply two to three coats of mascara to really build up their volume and length.

, A deep lip color like berry can often make you look washed out. To keep yourself from looking sickly, dust a blush in a shade that complements the lipstick over your cheeks. A neutral pink or rose shade will work with most berry tones.If you can’t seem to find a blush that works with your lip color, you can use the lipstick itself to double as a blush. Run your fingers over the lipstick bullet, and then blend the lipstick over your cheeks like a cream blush.

Apply the product to the center of your lip.,
Sweep the product to your outer corners.,
Even out the color with a second coat.",How to Use Lip Powder," Just like with any other lip color, it’s important to start with a smooth base. Dry, flaky lips will make the lip powder look patchy and uneven. To exfoliate your lips, you can purchase a lip exfoliator at a beauty supply store.If you’d rather go the DIY route, you can whip up an easy batch of homemade lip exfoliator with some sugar (brown or white) and a bit of honey, coconut oil, or olive oil.Dab your exfoliator onto your lips, and gently scrub them with a clean toothbrush or your finger. Let it sit on your lips for a bit, and then rub it off with a damp towel.;
, After exfoliating your lips, it’s good to moisturize them with a thin coat of your favorite lip balm. This will also keep your lips looking smooth and nourished through your lip powder. Make sure to only apply a small amount, so that your lips are hydrated but not overly slick. If you do want to apply a generous amount, make sure to dab the excess balm off right before you’re ready to apply your lip powder., It can be a bit tricky to achieve crisp borders with lip powder, but using a reverse lip liner can help you. A reverse lip liner is applied to the outer perimeter of your lips. When you go in with the lip powder, the reverse lip liner will act as barrier to prevent the color from budging outside of the lines. You can find reverse lip liners at beauty supply stores or online., The first thing you need to do is select the best color for you, which depends both on your natural lip color and the occasion. If you have light colored lips, look for colors like red and coral. If you have bright red lips naturally, try rocking bright pinks and oranges. Dark-lipped people look great in deep wine colors, as well as bright red.Typically, lighter shades work best during the day time, and the dark, bolder colors can come out to play at night.

, Most lip powders will come with a doe foot applicator, the same applicators that typically come with lip glosses. Because this product is obviously a bit different than liquid or cream products you’ve used, you may want to swatch a bit on your hand before applying it to your lips. The “powder” is actually a hydrogel that turns into a creamy texture when it makes contact with skin, so get a feel for it., Once you’ve loaded the applicator with product, it’s easiest to start applying in the middle. If there is any extra product, you will blend it outwards.Carefully fill in the middle of your lip, using the very tip of the applicator to create a stark border, meeting the reverse lip liner you’ve already applied.

, The best way to apply lip product is to work in small sections at a time. The trickiest place to apply lipstick is the outer corners of your lips. Get close to your mirror, and take time to apply it carefully all the way into the corner., Powdered lip product, like many lip stains and liquid lipsticks, can appear a bit patchy and uneven after one coat. If this is the case, apply a second coat just like you applied the first, focusing on areas that look light. If you are headed somewhere, throw the product into your pocket or purse for touch-ups."

Fill in your lips with your lipstick.,
Remove excess lipstick by blotting.,
Brush gloss onto the center of your lips.,
Dab your gloss with your fingertips to spread it evenly.,
Bring your gloss with you.",How to Wear Holographic Lip Gloss," The holographic lip gloss phase is still brand new, so you probably can’t stroll into any pharmacy or beauty supply store and grab one off the shelf. Your best bet is to look online where you can find different shimmer colors, from a more hot pink sheen to a dramatic green. Then, pick out a lipstick that you think will work well with the gloss you’ve purchased. The holographic lip gloss will reflect multiple different colors (almost like an oil spill reflecting light), so don't get too wrapped up in the color of the packaging! The color advertised will mostly reflect the general color scheme you will be able to achieve.There are no set-in-stone rules about pairing lipstick and holographic lip gloss, and the lip gloss will really look like a mixture of colors. However, think about combinations you love, like a red lipstick with a pinkish holographic lip gloss, or a deep purple lipstick with a light blue holographic lip gloss.
You don’t necessarily need to wear a lipstick under your gloss, but it will magnify the effect of the gloss. Putting it on bare lips will be less noticeable than putting it over, say, a dark red or a deep violet.;
, This type of product works really well with the holographic lip gloss. In general, liquid lipsticks adhere more firmly to your lips than regular lipsticks. This will allow the gloss sit on top, rather than mixing with the base lip product. The flatter your lipstick dries, the better!, Once you’ve chosen your lipstick and holographic lip gloss combo, it’s time to apply the lipstick. There’s no big trick to this – apply it like you normally would. Begin in the center of your top lip, carefully moving outwards to the outer corners of your mouth. Then, do the same on the bottom.


If you have trouble staying in the “lines” of your lips with a lipstick, use a small lip brush to paint the product on. This will ensure you have a crisp, clean border, the holographic gloss get all the attention.

, Once you’re satisfied with the coverage of your lipstick, it’s time to blot it. You don’t want any extra lipstick on your lips, especially since you will be layering it with the gloss. Excess product will mix with the gloss and muddy up the beautiful holographic effect. Gently kiss a piece of tissue or lightly dab the tissue over your lips. Make sure the color doesn’t look patchy or faded afterwards.If you have oil blotting sheets, this work well for this step!

, Once you’ve applied your lipstick and it’s dried completely, it’s time for the fun part. Grab your holographic lip gloss and carefully start applying it in the center of your lips. Fill in the entire center, and then carefully move outwards, bringing the product to the outer corners., You don’t want your gloss to look goopy or super heavy. After you’ve used the applicator to put the product on your lips, gently dab it with your fingertip so that it spreads evenly and the excess gloss is removed. Make sure to use a very light hand so you don’t disturb your layer of lipstick at all., Whether you’re heading for a night on the town or to a friend’s house, you definitely want to bring your holographic lip gloss with you. The effect created by the lip gloss is magical, but it also isn’t the most long-lasting. Throw the product in your purse or pocket so you can swipe on a bit more every time you notice the shine start to dull. Enjoy your dazzling holographic lips!

Stay hydrated.",How to Remove All Traces of Red Lipstick," A good way to see what you’re up against is to plant a firm smooch on the back of your own hand. If some of the lipstick transfers to your hand, it’s a good sign that you’ll be able to deal with the rest of it without a lot of hassle. If you’re still wearing a thick, dark coat after the kiss test, you probably have your work cut out for you.


Long-lasting lip colors are resistant to smears and smudges and in most cases will have to be removed through other means.Don’t forget to wash your hands afterwards so you don’t accidentally leave stains on anything else.;
, Take a washcloth or durable paper towel and blot at your lips. Use a light swirling motion to break up the lip stain. Go over your mouth a few times until the washcloth or paper towel stops collecting color.The more lipstick you can strip off beforehand, the easier it will be to get rid of the rest.

, If the lipstick you’re wearing is particularly stubborn, you might need to give your lips a preliminary cleaning before you can remove the bulk of it. Wet a clean washcloth and lather it up with warm water gentle hand soap. Dab your lips with the corner of the washcloth, then rinse. When combined with the heat of the water, the surfactants in the soap should start to wear down the lipstick.Choose a soap that is non-drying and suitable for facial use. Most liquid hand soaps and body washes will work just fine. Avoid soaps with harsh fragrances, as these normally contain chemicals that can cause rashes and allergic reactions.
You may also have success using facial cleansers that contain gritty exfoliants., Rub a thick layer of moisturizing chapstick or lip balm onto both lips. The moisturizing agents will saturate and plump up your lip tissue, forcing more of the lipstick to the surface and making it easier to wipe away. It will also keep them soft and protected from dryness and damage.Don’t be afraid to get heavy-handed with the lip balm prior to removing your lipstick. More is better.
Use an old chapstick that you’re not worried about ruining with your lipstick shade.

, Invest in a good liquid makeup remover or box of cleansing pads. Most makeup removers contain oils and other solutions that are very effective at dissolving caked on cosmetics. Simply wipe your lips clean if you’re using a pad, or wet a paper towel to apply a liquid product.Modern makeup removers are formulated to get the job done without relying on harsh chemicals, but buying name brand cleansers might cost you more.
Be careful not to ingest liquid makeup removers when using them near your mouth.

, Look into exfoliating products that are designed specifically to be used on the lips. Scoop up about a dime-sized amount of the exfoliant with your finger and gently scrub away at the lipstick. Lip polishes and scrubs are the beauty equivalent of taking sandpaper to an old coat of paint.If you’re looking for a homemade, natural lip exfoliant recipe, try combining a tablespoon of brown sugar with a couple ounces of raw honey., This is a time-honored removal method among lipstick devotees. Dip a cotton swab into a jar of Vaseline or Aquaphor. Coat your lips with a generous amount of the jelly and allow it to sit for a minute or two. After it’s had time to work, you’ll be able to wipe away your lip color as easily as if it were never there.Petroleum jelly is an alternative to more specialized makeup remover products that you can find at the corner drugstore or in your own medicine cabinet.
As an added benefit, products like Vaseline and Carmex make excellent moisturizers.

, Take the holistic approach and use coconut oil in place of chemical-based removers. This potent miracle product will melt the color right off your kisser, making it one of the most effective and least labor-intensive home remedies yet discovered. Best of all, it can be bought in large quantities for cheap almost anywhere, and has multiple uses.Rub the semi-solid coconut oil between your fingers until it becomes a liquid, then slather it directly onto your lips. Let it sit for a few moments before wiping it away.With its recent explosion in popularity, coconut oil can be readily found at most supermarkets and specialty grocers.

, Give your lips a break from time to time if you’re the type that tends to wear lipsticks and stains on a regular basis. Cosmetics can affect the quality of your skin after a while, especially when they’re not properly removed. Lip color is also bad about infiltrating the tiny cracks and crevices of your lips where it can be hard to get out later.Going natural more often will make your lipstick appear more vibrant on occasions when you do wear it.
If you’re worried about your lips drying out, switch to a tinted lip balm or non-matte liquid lipstick., Get in the habit of applying chapstick or nourishing lip balm daily. Look for brands like Carmex, Burt’s Bees and EOS that contain moisturizing agents. Not only do chapsticks and balms form a protective layer on your lips that safeguards them from dry conditions and prevent painful cracking and splitting, they’ll also soften them, meaning your lipstick will look better once it’s on.Keep chapstick handy in your purse, car or bedside table so you’ll never be caught without it.
There’s no such thing as too much chapstick. You’ll be glad to have it if you wear lipstick a lot or live somewhere with cold, windy weather!

, Make sure you’re drinking plenty of water throughout the day. When it comes to moisturizing, water is the obvious choice and should be your go-to nutrient not just for luscious lips but for healthy everything else. When you’re sufficiently hydrated, your lips will appear thick, full and rosy, and will serve as a better base for your lipstick.Most physicians and nutritionists recommend that you drink 8-12 glasses of water a day."

Then, dip it into the tinted lip balm and get a small amount of the lip balm on the brush. Apply the lip balm to your bottom lip. Then, dip the brush in the balm again and apply the lip balm to your top lip.
Clean your makeup brush after you are done using it with brush cleaner or a dry, clean tissue. You may try to use the same makeup brush to apply the balm so you do not mix products on your lips.

, To add something extra to your tinted lip balm look, you may go for full makeup coverage on the rest of your face. Try wearing foundation or a tinted moisturizer on your face to go with the tinted lip balm. You can apply the foundation with a makeup brush or with clean fingers.


You may also wear bronzer on your face to create a nice glow. Opt for a bronzer that compliments your skin tone and your foundation.
You can apply bronzer with a makeup brush, making sure you apply it subtly to key areas of your face.

, For some added color to your face, you can also apply blush over the foundation. Use a makeup brush to apply the blush to the apples of your cheeks. You may choose a blush that will compliment your tinted lip balm. For example, if the lip balm is a rose tint, you may choose a blush that has a rose or pink undertone to complement the lip balm.You may also opt for very subtle blush if you are wearing a bold tinted lip balm, such as a wine or bright pink shade.

, To complete your look, you may decide to do your eye makeup. Go for an eye makeup style that will complement your tinted lip balm so your makeup look is put together. Go for a color combination for your eyes that will work well with your tinted lip balm so your makeup pops.For example, if you are wearing a dark red tinted lip balm, you may go for a taupe eye shadow. Or if you are wearing a peach tinted lip balm, you may go for an emerald eye shadow.
Another fun option is pairing a pink tinted lip balm with a violet eye shadow or a bright red tinted lip balm with a gold eye shadow.

, You can use lip balm, chap stick, lip Vaseline, beauty oil, facial moisturizer, etc. whatever your favorite product is., Do not take it all off, only if there is too much because it will make the application and blending process harder., Choose a color that will compliment your skin tone as well as a color dark enough to be able to ombre and make lighter. In this case, we are using a red color.

, It is helpful to have a lip liner for the base color to help sharply outline and darken the shape of your lips., Choose which color you would like to use to ombre and blend with to make lighter. In this case, we are using a nude with pink undertone., Line your lips all the way around, trying your best to keep a sharp line and avoiding smudging at all costs. If you do smudge your liner, try and gently wipe with a Q-tip. Or you can wait until the finishing touches stage to conceal any mistakes.


If you would like to over line your lip, now is the time.

, Start to shade in slightly with the lip liner, without coloring in the whole lip. This will help amplify the color of the base on the outside of the edges of the lips.

, Very carefully, apply the base (darker) color all over your lips. Do not apply too many coats. Remember, you are adding another color on top. We want to avoid having an excess of layering.

, If you are working with matte colors, you want to do this step quickly to be able to blend before drying occurs. Apply the lighter shade onto the center of the lip only, both lower and upper lips., First step of blending is to gently rub lips together slightly. Only do this once or twice. Try to only rub the center of your lips because by rubbing it all, you will simply blend both colors together and we want them to be distinct yet fade into each other. Then begin to pat lips together. This will help the edges of the two colors, where they meet, fade and blend together.

, This step is optional. If you feel you need further blending, use a lip brush, Q-tip, or even your finger to blend the two colors only where they meet by gently patting and rubbing in. Again we want the two colors to be distinct however, we need them to fade together naturally.

, Sometimes, lipstick can get on your teeth. Gently wipe it off with your finger., Wrap your lips around your finger, press gently, then pull your finger out. This will remove any excess lipstick on the inside of your lips and you will avoid getting any more lipstick on your teeth., If you messed up the lip liner, or smudged the edges, here is where you can fix it.

",How to Make Your Lips Naturally Red," The first step to getting red lips is getting rid of dry, flaky skin that builds up and hides their natural color. Sloughing away the dead skin brightens your lips, brings out their inner red color and prepares them to take on a stain. Here's how to make and use your own scrub:Mix 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon brown sugar.
Scrub the mixture into your lips in a circular motion.
Rinse the mixture away with warm water.
Repeat as necessary.;
, Sometimes a basic lip scrub isn't enough to get rid of the dead skin. Using a soft-bristled toothbrush will do the trick. Choose a clean toothbrush, wet it with warm water, and gently scrub your lips in a circular motion. Rinse your lips. They should be left bright, plump and renewed.








, Increasing circulation to your lips makes them look plumper and redder. You can naturally make your lips a little plumper by using cinnamon or another spicy household item on your lips. Just rub a little on, wait a few minutes, then rinse your lips. You can use any of the following as a natural lip plumper:









1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper mixed with a few drops of water
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon mixed with a few drops of water
5 drops of peppermint essential oil or peppermint extract
A piece of fresh ginger rubbed over your lips

, Now that your lips have been exfoliated and plumped, it's time to make them soft and supple. This will help them keep their color longer and prevent them from drying out. Use any of the following ingredients as a lip serum; just rub it on your lips and wait a few minutes for it to absorb:









1/2 teaspoon coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon almond oil

, Choose any kind of bright red fruit, nick it with a knife, and rub it over your lips to coat them in color. After the first coat dries, you can add more layers to deepen the red color. Keep going until you like the way your lips look, then add a layer of clear lip balm to seal it in for a few hours. Here are a few fruits that will do the trick:









Cherries
Strawberries
Raspberries
Cranberries
Pomegranate seeds

, Little kids eat red, blue, green and orange popsicles without worrying how their mouths will look when they're finished, but now that you're older you want to choose a bright red. Look for a cherry or berry-flavored popsicle. Rub it over your lips to coat them. Apply more layers until you like the hue of your lips, then seal the stain with clear lip gloss.









For a more precise application, melt the popsicle into a bowl. Dip a cotton swab in the melted juice and use it to apply it to your lips, making sure to stay in the lines.
If you don't want your teeth and tongue to get stained red, avoid eating the popsicle.

, This trick was popular back in the fifties, and it has remained a great way to create a natural-looking lip stain ever since. Choose cherry or another red-colored Kool-Aid powder. Pour it into a bowl and stir in enough water to make a thick, spreadable paste. Apply it to your lips and let it sit for three minutes, then rinse it away.








For a brighter hue, repeat the process as many times as you'd like.
To create a custom color, try mixing red powder with orange or purple.

, This natural powder is made from dried beets, which have beautiful deep red hue. Mix beet root powder with enough water to make a thick paste. Spread it on your lips and let it sit for three minutes, then rinse away the excess paste with warm water. Repeat until your lips are as red as you'd like.








, Food coloring is concentrated and very bright red, so it's a good choice if you want to go bold with your look. Squirt some food coloring into a small dish. Use a cotton swab to apply it carefully to your lips, taking care to stay within your lip lines. Red food coloring stains easily, so try not to get it on the rest of your skin.








, Your lips are prone to getting dark spots from the sun, just like the rest of your skin. Protect them by using lip gloss with SPF of 15 or higher. That way your lips won't get sunburned and dark when you enjoy a day outside.








, Chapped lips tend to look dull and washed out. If you want bright, pretty red lips, take steps to prevent them from getting dry and flaky. Drink plenty of water to keep your body hydrated. Use coconut oil, almond oil, or a good healing lip balm to keep your lips moist throughout the day.








, Dry winter air can chap your lips much more quickly than normal, so you'll probably want to carry lip balm with you wherever you go to keep your lips healthy. You may also want to sleep with a humidifier to keep the air in your house from getting too dry. Your skin will thank you., Smoking can cause lip discoloration and wrinkling, which is the opposite of what you want if you're going for red lips. Avoid smoking cigarettes or other tobacco products.,"

Clean up your lips of any foreign particles (even peeling skin, even though that's not foreign) with cool water.,
Apply a single coat of red lip color, using medium pressure.,
Survey yourself.",How to Rock Red Lipcolor," Dab until just dry (rub in some lip balm if your kissers are chapped, and let sit until lips are moist and smooth).;
, Rub it in so that your lips look perfectly red, the colour not too faint and not too brash either. A lip brush, if you have one, will work wonders, but your fingers should do too. Just make sure you have all the creases filled in.

, How do you look? Are your lips too bright for your face? Do you look like a vamp? Do you look unnatural? Do you look really pretty? Do you look retro or modern? Does the red lip colour define your features? Does it make your big lips look little? Or does it make your normal lips bloat up into Angelina Jolie smoochers? Or does it bring out the pink in your cheeks? Or does it even out the difference between the colour of your skin and the colour of your lips?


If your lips have gone huge, you need to tone them down and make them dark. Not bright, dark. So pick up the brown lip colour (or lip liner, personal choice) and just rub it on around the edges. Then grab some cotton or a tissue, and blot. You'll be left with a lovely burnt-cranberry lipstain that you will instantly fall in love with. Burnt-cranberry lip stains do amazing things to your face - they tone up your features, making them look well-defined, they bring out the colour of your eyes, the red in your cheeks, they sharpen your cheekbones, and shape up your lips. They are adorable. NOTE: You want lip STAIN, not lip LAKE, so blot away if it's looking gaudy. You do not want to look like you just made out with a cup of dirty blood.
If the red lip colour is making your lips look a bit too teenie-tiny, then, well, pick up a tissue, and BLOT. Leave behind the slightest tint of red, and add in some pink. Rub it in. Ooh la la, strawberry girl! Who hates pink lips? Add in a little shine with some fruity, clear lipgloss or lip balm, and flaunt those candy-pinks! If you want to go subtler, blot just a little bit more, and let the spectators enjoy the new-rosebud look. You'll look amazing.
Scarlet kissers suiting your face wonderfully? Well then, go girl! Pucker up and strike a pose! You are lucky.

Scrubbing your lips not only removes the dead skin to reveal new skin beneath, it increases circulation to bring more color to your lips. Try a homemade brightening scrub using the following ingredients:


1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon lemon juice;

Tinted balms look darker with each application. If you want a brighter pink look, apply more than one layer.
Tinted lip gloss is another good choice if you want a slight pop of color, but nothing too extreme.

, This is another natural-looking choice that lasts a bit longer than balm. Lip stain actually dyes the top layer of skin and blends with your natural skin tone to make it look a bit pinker.

, Smoking darkens the lips over time, in addition to causing them to get wrinkled and thin. If you're after full, pink lips, it's time to kick the habit for good.

, Lips that are cracked and chapped look unhealthy and feel painful. To avoid this problem, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. When you're dehydrated, your lips are often the first place it shows.


Switch out your coffee and tea drinks for water whenever possible.
Avoid overdoing it with alcohol, which can cause dehydration and dry lips.

, In the winter months, when the air is very dry, staying hydrated by drinking water doesn't always cut it. If you have dry skin that easily chaps and flakes, consider sleeping with a humidifier in the room. This is a machine designed to add moisture to the air and keep your skin soft and supple.

Drink enough water.,

Apply a moisturizing balm to your lips.,

Avoid products that may cause allergic reactions.",How to Make Your Lips Bigger2," When your lips are dry and chapped, they will appear thinner. You can make your lips appear plumper and healthier simply by taking better care of them; the first step to doing this is to drink enough water.


A popular method for calculating how much water you should drink each day is to take your weight in pounds and divide it in half; the result is how many ounces of water you should drink each day.,


A 150-pound woman should drink roughly 75 ounces (about 2,200 ml) of water each day.

, When you lick your lips, your tongue spreads acidic saliva on them. This can remove your lips’ natural oils and cause them to become irritated.







, Smoking can irritate and discolor your lips; it can also cause wrinkles around your mouth. If you smoke and do not want to quit, at the very least try switching to an e-cigarette, which will not be as toxic to your lips as a regular cigarette.


You may be able to reduce smoking-related discoloration by massaging almond and coconut oil on your lips each day., If your lips are dry or chapped, use a lip balm regularly. Even if your lips are not chapped, consider using a lip moisturizer that contains an SPF to protect your lips from the sun’s damaging rays.









If your lips are sensitive, it may take some trial and error to find a lip balm that works for you. Some people use natural balms containing ingredients like coconut oil and honey, while others find that medicated balms containing menthol are best.
Unless your lips are already well-hydrated, avoid beeswax lip balms. Beeswax lip balms are too heavy to actually impart moisture to your lips; they can only seal in the moisture that’s already there.

, If you only put one thing on your lips, it should be SPF. The sun’s rays can cause your lips to chap and become dry, making them look smaller than they are.


Shiny products such as lip glosses can actually magnify the sun’s rays, causing them to harm your lips more than if you had nothing on your lips at all.
Dermatologists warn that wearing lip gloss without an SPF can do more than damage your lips: it can actually cause skin cancer., Exfoliating your lips might help them feel smooth in the short term, but it can actually damage your lips if you do it regularly. Instead of exfoliating your lips, work on keeping them hydrated.


Unlike your regular skin, your lips are made of a sensitive mucous membrane. When this membrane is healthy, it’s naturally smooth., If you are taking good care of your lips and they are still always chapped, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to something you’re using on or near your lips:Citrusy and salty foods can irritate lips.
Some toothpastes can irritate lips. If you think your toothpaste may be causing problems for you, try switching to one that doesn’t contain sodium laurel sulphate or alcohol.Be mindful of heavily scented facial products, which can wind up on your lips and can cause irritation.

Aim for at least a few minutes of lip exercises 1 to 2 times per day. You can pick and choose from the exercises in this article, or do an online search for more exercises.
There are many instructional videos on lip-plumping exercises, if you’d like someone to follow along with.
While many people swear they’ve seen a difference, there is insufficient scientific research to suggest that lip exercises actually work.

, Doing lip exercises with dry, chapped lips, will likely cause them to tear and/or bleed.


If your lips are quite chapped, drink lots of water and apply a good lip moisturizer, then wait a few days until they’re in better shape before starting lip exercises.

, Holding your hand close to your face, press your lips against it as if you’re about to blow someone a kiss. Hold your lips against your hand for several seconds. Repeat 5 to 10 times.








, Do this for 15 seconds, then relax. Next, pucker your lips, pushing them out as far as you can into an exaggerated kissy face. Do this 10 times.









After smiling and puckering your lips, hold the puckered position for at least 30 seconds, then relax and pull your lips inside your mouth, letting your teeth gently clamp down on them. Hold this position for 10 seconds.
Repeat the whole process 5 times.

, Hold this position for at least 10 seconds. Repeat 10 times.








, Create a resistance to this movement by imagining that there’s something trying to prevent you from pressing your lips together. Work on holding your lips together against this resistance for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.








, Gently move your lips from left to right as you inflate each cheek with air. It should look kind of like you’re using mouthwash. Repeat this process 10 times.









Try to move your lips in the shape of a figure 8, in both directions.

, Hold this position for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.








, Inhale deeply, then puff up your cheeks and form your lips into an “O” shape as you prepare to exhale. Exhale gradually, taking 2 to 3 blows to get all of your air out.







, Do this in an exaggerated motion, stretching your lips out as far as you can. Relax your lips and repeat 5 times.







, If your mouth, face, or lips become sore from these exercises, take a break. As with any muscles, the muscles in your face can become fatigued; if you push your muscles too hard when they’re already tired, you might even injure yourself.

Enjoy your lipstick!",How to Make Natural Lipstick1," The pigments may be trickier to find in a shop, but they’re easy to purchase online.


1.5 tsp Castor oil (thickens and adds shine)
1 tsp Jojoba oil (hydrating and antibacterial qualities)
1.5 tsp Grapeseed oil (anti-aging)
1.5 tsp Beeswax — pearls are preferable (seals in moisture)
Pigments of your choice (make sure they’re lip safe)
Flavoring of your choice (optional);
, Pigments come in a variety of colors and materials. You can use a single pigment on its own, or combine a few different ones to make your own unique color:


Cinnabar mica, red oxide, and zinc oxide combined at a 2:1/4:1/4 ratio will give you a rich, slightly shimmery brownish-red color.
Carmine, titanium dioxide, and pearl white mica combined at a 1:1:1/2 ratio will give you a vibrant, shimmery red color.
Red oxide, yellow oxide, and titanium dioxide combined at a 2:1/4:1/8 ratio will give you a lovely coral color.Just how much of each pigment you use will depend on how rich you want your color to be. Two to three teaspoons should be enough, but you can always add a bit more or less to get the color richness that you desire.

, If you combine pigments, you might like to blend them together in a coffee grinder or with a mortar and pestle. Doing this can help keep the color evenly distributed once it’s blended with the oil and wax.

, You won’t add the pigment(s) to the oil and wax mixture until it’s melted, but it’s good to have it handy. That way you can quickly mix it with the melted mixture while it’s still warm.

, In this step you combine everything except for the pigments (and the optional flavoring) in a container. Use a small spatula or popsicle stick to mix the ingredients together.

, You can do this in either a double boiler (heat-proof container placed in hot water) or the microwave. With both methods, be sure to stir the mixture regularly until no lumps remain.


For the double-boiler method, place the heat-proof container (with the mixture inside it) into a saucepan that is 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) full of water. The water should be hot but not boiling. The heat-proof container should sit securely (i.e. it shouldn't be floating) in the saucepan.
For the microwave method, place the heat-proof container (with the mixture inside it) into the microwave and heat it in 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring in between.

, Mix in about 1/4 tsp of pigment at a time, stirring the mixture quickly as you add the pigment to ensure that it’s well blended.

, Use a small spatula or popsicle stick to apply a small amount of the lip color on the back of your hand. If it’s not rich enough, add a little more pigment to the mixture.


Continue to add pigment to the mixture and then test it on your hand until you achieve the color you want.
Before you do this, make sure the mixture isn’t so hot that you burn yourself.

, This is where having a container with a spout/beak comes in handy, since it will make pouring much easier.


If you’re using a bullet-style lipstick mould, use a cotton swab to swipe some oil around the insides of the moulds. This will ensure that the finished bullet-style lipsticks don’t stick to the mould when you remove them.

, You can put the lipsticks in the fridge for 30 minutes or in the freezer for at least 10 minutes. Some experts recommend leaving them in the fridge for up to an hour.


Give them ample time to cool. If you take them out too early they may be soft and more likely to break.

, If you used a bullet-style lipstick mould, your final step will be to remove the bullets from the mould with a lipstick tube.


To do this, remove the top of the mould. The bottom of your lipstick bullet should now be exposed. Twist the base of your lipstick tube to expose the lipstick holder.
Next, gently place the lipstick holder over the bullet-style lipstick and press down very gently — just enough to make contact with the base of the lipstick.
Gently lift the lipstick tube as you twist the holder back into the tube. The holder should attach to the bullet-style lipstick and bring it back into the tube with it.

, That’s it, you’re done. Depending on the size of your moulds, lip balm holders, and bars, you should be able to make at least four sticks and several small jars from this recipe.

Makeup artists suggest that in order of longevity matte formulas have the most staying power, followed by cream formulas, then liquid lipsticks, with lip glosses coming in last.It is unlikely that you'll find a lip gloss that lasts all day. The formula is designed to be slippery and shiny. It may feel comfortable and luxurious on the lips but it will need to be reapplied frequently throughout the day.;
, These are specially designed products that prime the lips for lipstick application and help the color adhere to the lips. They are available from many different brands.


Some makeup artists use concealer or foundation over the lips to similar effect. This has the added benefit of canceling out the natural color of your lips so that the true color of the lipstick shows up., This is a colorless product that provides a barrier around the edge of your lips.Apply it to the skin just outside the outline of your lip to prevent feathering.
Feathering occurs when the lipstick bleeds into the fine lines around the edge of your lips. These fine lines get more pronounced as we age.

, The key to long-wearing lipstick is to apply several thin layers. This is best achieved with a lip brush, which also allows for greater precision and control.


A lip brush can help you apply the product neatly and precisely. It also ensures a more even distribution of product than when lipstick is applied right from the bullet., Experts recommend using a lip liner with a lipstick on top or a liquid lip stain underneath a lipstick. Then as one layer wears off, the base layer remains intact.Make sure they are similar colors!

, This will get rid of all the dead skin sitting on top of your lips that prevents the lipstick sinking in.It will also create a smooth, blank canvas for the lipstick to ensure even application.Use a lip scrub. Many brands offer these types of product. You can also make your own with sugar and honey.Gently scrub your lips with a soft toothbrush. Don’t go too hard, you just want to remove the top layer of dead skin.
Use a damp wash cloth on your lips, moving it in soft, circular motions to lift the dead skin., This ensures that the lips are moisturized. Applying lipstick to dry, cracked lips, especially a matte formula, can make lips look patchy and flaky.


Use a balm with waxy consistency not a slippery or oily one which will cause the lipstick to move around.Allow some time for the lip balm to absorb before going on to the next step. Make this the first step in your makeup routine and do the rest of your face while the balm is absorbing., Lip liner typically has a drier consistency than lipstick, so it serves as a layer for the lipstick to grip onto.Start by drawing around the outline of your lips. Use the point of the lip liner pencil for this.
Get a sharp cupid’s bow by drawing an x in the center of your top lip.Fill in the whole lip. This step is important because if the top layer of lip color wears off it won't reveal a sharp line. Use the side of the lip pencil to fill in the whole lip area. , You can do this either straight from the tube or with a lip brush.

, Using a folded tissue, open your mouth and place it between your upper and lower lips, then press down on the tissue.This removes any excess product and prevents lipstick transferring onto your teeth or clothing.

, Professional makeup artists use this trick to set the lipstick without moving any of the color.Get a tissue and separate the layers out.
Place just one thin sheet over your lips and apply loose, translucent powder with a big fluffy powder brush on top of the tissue.
You can apply powder directly to the lips to set if you don't have any tissues at hand.

, Repeat the previous steps of blotting and setting with powder. This should give your lipstick real staying power. Finally, you can use a setting spray if you have one., It is inevitable that your lip color will fade slightly over the course of the day.Bring your lipstick and apply another thin layer to top up the color after meals.
Carry a compact mirror to check for smudging or movement. Remember to check the lipstick hasn't transferred to your teeth.

, You may find your lips require hydration as the day goes on, especially with drier formulas such as mattes. However, the oil in lip balm actually breaks up the color, causing it to wear off and fade.


If you find your lips get dry through the day, opt for a more moisturizing lipstick formula and make sure you don’t skip the crucial step of hydrating before application.
Avoid licking your lips. Not only will this make your lip color fade, it actually makes your lips drier over time.Finally, if you do apply lip balm, allow it to absorb for a minute or two, blot any excess off with a tissue and then follow up with another layer of lipstick. This gives your lips some much-needed moisture without the lip color fading., Once you have a solid grasp of the application technique you can begin to try different combinations to figure out which lipsticks offer the best longevity."

Think before you buy.,
Know what lip augmentation is.,
Know what lip augmentation involves.Augmentation is a relatively quick procedure that can be completed in your doctor’s office with little to no downtime:


Your lips will likely be numbed before the injections.,
Know the risks.Hyaluronic acid fillers are unlikely to cause allergic reactions because they’re made from substances similar to those found in the body; however, reactions are still possible.,
Discuss any possible allergies with your doctor.",How to Make Your Lips Bigger4," If you’re determined to have bigger lips and nothing else is giving you the results you want, it may be time to look into lip augmentation.


Before choosing lip augmentation, read about the different methods, read online reviews and personal experiences, and consult a few different doctors.
Because lip augmentation is a relatively short and non-invasive procedure it may be tempting to make the decision lightly. As with any cosmetic procedure, however, it’s a decision that needs to be well thought out, as it can have lasting effects on your health and appearance.

, Lip augmentation usually involves the injection of a dermal filler into your lips and around your mouth.


The most commonly used dermal fillers today contain substances similar to hyaluronic acid, which occurs naturally in your body.Collagen was once the most common dermal filler, but it is no longer the No. 1 choice as there are now safer and longer-lasting options.Fat grafting involves transferring fat from one part of the body to the lips through liposuction.It requires a longer healing time than other methods, as it is the most invasive.,
The doctor will then mark the areas that he/she will inject before injecting them with fine needles.
After the injections, ice may be applied to ease discomfort and swelling.
You’ll need to avoid putting any products on your lips immediately after the procedure. Ask your doctor for advice on what’s okay to put on your lips, and when.
The exception to quick lip augmentation procedures is fat injection, which requires some liposuction to remove fat from one part of your body before injecting it into your lips.,


Common side effects include bleeding, redness and tenderness at the injection sites, and swelling and bruising.
More serious side effects include severe and prolonged swelling and bruising lasting longer than a week; lip asymmetry; lumps and irregularities in the lips; infections; and ulcers and scarring that can cause the lips to become stiff.
The specific ingredients contained in your dermal filler will depend on the product used. Some contain lidocaine, which can cause an allergic reaction.

, If you think you might be allergic to a filler ingredient, discuss this with your doctor before the procedure.

",How to Make Your Lips Bigger5," To make your lips look bigger using makeup you’ll need a lipliner or lip crayon; a lipstick or lip crayon that is the same color as the lipliner, but a shade lighter; a lip gloss; a highlighting balm or powder; and a lip exfoliator (a toothbrush will do).


For a more natural look, use two nude shades of lipliner and lipstick; for a more dramatic look, use vibrant reds or pinks.
Dramatic colors will immediately make your lips look fuller and more prominent.
Some makeup manufacturers sell double-sided lip crayons in complementary shades of the same color. These are great options.
You may find that matte lipsticks and crayons are easier to work with, particularly when going for a naturally bigger lip.

, Using a soft-bristled toothbrush, spend approximately 20 seconds gently massaging the dead skin off your lips. This will cause your lips to swell up a bit; it may also cause them to feel dry.









You can also exfoliate your lips with a damp washcloth or sugar.
Some dermatologists advise against exfoliating one’s lips, as this can cause them to become dry and chapped over time.Exfoliating your lips is fine to do once in a while if your lips are flakey and you need to wear lipstick (for example, if you’re going somewhere formal); just avoid it whenever you can!

, Any balm will do: just be sure to avoid waxes or anything too heavy, which will not moisturize your lips, but only seal in existing moisture.









Be sure that you’ve saturated your lips with the balm, and that you let it sit for a couple of minutes before applying the liner.

, Lining your lips is a great way to make your lips look larger. To keep it looking natural, line the outer edges, or just outside of the outer edges, of your lips.









Don’t go too far outside the natural lines of your lips otherwise you may look like a clown!

, Use the darker pencil to fill in the corners of your lips, and the lighter shade of lipstick/crayon to fill in the middle part of your upper and lower lips.









Some people recommend filling in your entire lips with a lip pencil to create an even base. Experiment with different ways of lining your lips to see what you like best!

, You don’t want an unattractive border around your lips. Blend everything together so that it looks more natural. You can do this with your finger, a cotton swab, or a lip brush.








, You can use a clear gloss or a gloss in the same color range of the color you’ve put on your lips.








, Place a small amount of highlighting cream, balm, or powder on your finger and dab it lightly on to the middle of your upper and lower lips.









A shimmery eyeshadow will also work as a highlighter.
After dabbing the highlighter on to your lips, rub your finger lightly over the dabs so that they’re nicely blended.

Exfoliate your lips with a toothbrush.,
Apply a DIY exfoliating mix.,
Try a baking soda mix.,
Rub some cinnamon on your lips.,
Purchase a store-bought, lip-specific product.",How to Make Lips Look Bigger1," Most often, the first place you should turn to when looking for answers is a good homemade solution; in the case of skin and lip care, there's nowhere better to start than with exfoliation. Like the rest of your body and face, your lips build up dead skin particles; these reflect less light than the rest of your lips, and may have the effect of making your lips look smaller. Using a toothbrush and lightly scrubbing in small, circular motions for two minutes will remove the excess skin matter, leaving your lips looking brighter, and feeling softer. Refrain from using anything more abrasive than a toothbrush for this kind of exfoliation. Lips don't hold up well to a body loofah!;
, If you're looking for a perfect, simple homemade exfoliator for your lips, a basic mixture of brown sugar and honey is just the thing for adding radiance and moisture.First, get a teaspoon of brown sugar, then proceed to slowly add the honey until there is enough to make a thick paste. Once this easy mixture is prepared, dab it with a washcloth and rub your lips in a gentle, circular motion. The grainy texture of the sugar will scrub away the dead flakes, and the beneficial chemical properties of the ingredients will give your lips a more radiant shine.


Coconut and olive oil work in the place of honey for this mixture, if you have a supply or preference favouring one over the other. Apply some unscented lip balm after you've cleaned off the paste. This will help immediately soften your lips post-exfoliation.

, If you're looking for another DIY exfoliator to work with, try adding a small amount of water to a teaspoon of baking soda. Baking soda ranks among the most versatile home ingredients out there, and its benefits can be geared to apply to lip care as well. Making and using a baking soda mix follows a similar method to the coconut oil:


First, add enough water that the baking soda becomes a thick paste, much like a brown sugar exfoliator.
Once complete, dab the solution with a washcloth or your finger, and spread over your lips. This will soften to lips and get rid of any dead skin that may have built up.

, Beyond its granular texture (which helps to exfoliate in much the same manner as brown sugar) cinnamon has chemical properties that stimulate blood flow, making your lips naturally fuller. Keep in mind, however, that cinnamon's spicy properties will agitate any open sores, so it's not recommended if you have any healing in progress around the lips and mouth. To follow through with this:


First put some Vaseline on your lips, and rub it around until it evenly covers your lips.
Next, apply some cinnamon to your lips; the Vaseline will make the cinnamon stick.
Rub the cinnamon around so that it has a chance to cover the entire surface of your lips, and let it sit for a few minutes.
Afterwards, wipe it away with a damp washcloth. Following this, you'll find your lips plumper, and looking more colourful than before.

, Although exploring homemade options is arguably the better place to start, it's worthy to note the number of products designed specifically for lip exfoliating and moisturizing. Luckily, many of them tend to be generally cheaper than other cosmetic products. Scrubs, balms and lip exfoliators are all available to this effect; check your preferred cosmetics brand for options.

, Add a 1/2 tsp to the sugar. This is a rough estimate as the amount you add can be altered depending on how liquefied you want your scrub to be.

, It should look an opaque peach. Continue stirring this mixture until you are satisfied that all the virgin-oil is absorbed by the sugar.

, If you feel that there is not enough lip-scrub, add more sugar and more virgin oil and continue to add small amounts until you are completely satisfied that there is enough to fill your container.

Keeping your face clear of any gunk is a sure way to improve a general healthy appearance, as well as prevent many factors that may play into weakening the lustrous appearance of your lips.

, Much like exfoliating, there are plenty of homemade solutions you can conjure up for moisturizing your lips. Among the more popular of these recipes is a combination of glycerin and rosewater. Add the two in equal measure to a small bowl, and apply the solution to your lips. Leave it on overnight; that way, your lips will have ample time to absorb the nutrients. Rosewater is well-liked by makeup artists as it is a mild astringent; it is perfect for cleansing your lips of impurities like dirt and old makeup. As you might imagine, this has the effect of making your lips look fuller.


If you aren't the DIY type, prefabricated rosewater and glycerin mixtures can be found in a pharmacy or health section of your local supermarket.

, While coconut oil may be used in tandem with brown sugar as a great exfoliator, by itself it can be a great lip balm.Coconut oil contains many nutrients, such as vitamin E, which are great for moisturizing. Coconut oil is anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and full of antioxidants; with so many benefits, it has grown popular as a beauty tool as much as a cooking ingredient. Applying a teaspoonful to your lips will help to moisturize and soften them. Because coconut oil is a solid at room temperature, first you'll need to heat it a little for it to become soft and pliable.

, Much like coconut oil, honey has a lot of great nutrients and antioxidants, which help prevent aging and UV damage. In other words-- a great choice when it comes to skin care! Take a dab and apply gently to your lips as you would with coconut oil or a conventional lip balm. Look for raw honey, as unpasteurized honey has more active nutrients and enzymes that will help keep your skin moisturized and radiant. Put it on before bed, and leave it on while you sleep; that way, it'll have the time to work its magic.

, The next time you're drinking green tea, extract the bag once the tea has steeped. Hold the teabag between your lips while you're waiting for your drink to cool. Done on a semi-casual basis, this little trick can go a long way towards revitalizing the look and feel of your lips!

, Massaging your lips regularly is a great way to encourage blood flow, thereby making your lips fuller. Massaging them gently for a few minutes each day is a great way to achieve bigger lips naturally. One of the best ways to do this is to rub your lips with ice cubes. This will relax the lip muscles and promote a redder, more radiant pigment.


If they're too cold to contact the skin directly, wrap the ice cubes in a clean washcloth.

Choose the right sort of makeup.,
Apply a full coverage concealer.Before using lipstick and lip liner, you should make sure you start with a good canvas.,
Draw on bigger lips with a lip liner.,
Apply lipstick, following the newly drawn lip lines.,
Underline your bottom lip with some eyeliner.,
Give your lips an added shine, using lip gloss.",How to Make Lips Look Bigger3," Though makeup is one of the best (and certainly most popular) ways to improve the look of lips, it is imperative you choose the right kind of makeup for the job; otherwise, the makeup might actually work the opposite way you want it to! As a rule, you'll want to avoid darker lipsticks when aiming for bigger lips. Clear or nude shades of lipstick are a much better match in this case. Moreover, picking a concealer and lip liner that works for your skin tone can make or break the cosmetic approach. Knowing what will, and will not work for your lips is a crucial first step. Generally speaking, you want to choose a colour that won't conflict with your natural tone. If you're not certain what might work or you specifically, enlist the help of a sales associate in a cosmetics store; most often, they'll know specifically what shades are best suited to each skin type.

, A good concealer will erase the natural lip lines, allowing you to draw your own. Spread the concealer carefully, making sure you get it on and around your lips evenly.

, A lip liner is used to distinguish the boundary between your lips and the rest of your face. If you want to make your lips appear larger, draw on the lip liner slightly beyond the edges of your lips. When paired with lipstick, this larger canvas will give the impression of fuller lips. Once you have purposefully overdrawn your lips, lip stick and gloss should be applied evenly to the newly defined area.


A blunt-tipped pencil will not apply color as evenly as you want, while a sharp-tipped pencil will result in clean, crisp lines.
Don't try to get away with too much! Overdrawing lips only works well in moderation; going too far will make the effect look inauthentic.

, With your lip liner as a guide, apply lipstick to the extended area evenly. With a concealer in place, the overdrawn lipstick should create the illusion of fuller, plumper lips. Again, using nude tones like peach and pale pink are best-suited to this end., Making a slight, fake 'shadow' underneath your lips is a helpful trick to give them a deeper look. Pencil the underside of your bottom lip with a brown, or white eyeliner. Make sure to keep the line very subtle; this technique is best kept as an accent. If you're using a white eyeliner, another subtle line across the top of your upper lip will add to the impression.

, With the lipstick evenly applied, using a bit of lip gloss will give your lips an authentic shimmer. There are many different textures to lip gloss, including translucent, lacquer, milk, transparent, and iridescent. In this case, a neutral tone is most recommended. That way, you'll get a striking smoothness to your lips without losing any of their natural appeal.

Whistle!Like most other parts of your body, you can actually train your lips to become stronger.,
Exercise your lips with puckering.,
Try breathing exercises to work out your lips.,
Use a lip pump.",How to Make Lips Look Bigger4," One of the best ways to do this is by whistling. Whistling puts pressure on your lips, and encourages blood flow. Try whistling whenever you've got a moment to spare. As well as making for a pleasant musical distraction, casual whistling will help you get fuller lips in the long run.

, Puckering is the go-to exercise for building up strength and lustre in your lips. Pucker up your lips as though you were about to kiss someone, then press your hand up against your lips to meet that kiss. Withdraw your hand after a few seconds, and release your pucker while exhaling. Following these steps count as one 'rep' of the exercise. Repeat as many times as you desire in a session; between 10-20 should be fine to start.


Although such frequent puckering may feel strange at first, you'll find your lips getting stronger after a few sessions of this exercise.

, Breathing exercises can also help plump your lips, provided your lips are given some strain in the act. Pucker up your lips, inhale air through your nose, and exhale while holding your pucker. This will stimulate your lips and help in giving them a plumper look. Between 5-10 reps should make a good workout session for your lips. Repeating these sessions daily, or bi-daily will ensure the appearance of more lustrous lips.

, For a quick-fix for bigger lips, there are many simple lip pumps and 'cups' that plump your lips via suction. Placing a lip cup on your mouth and creating suction will create pressure and blood flow, giving a temporary boost to the size of your lips. Many of these cups are quite cheap and easy to use, and they're suitable for bringing with you to social events, to use when you need some freshening up. "

Consult a doctor.,
Do your research.,
Schedule and attend your surgery.",How to Make Lips Look Bigger5," While getting surgery isn't recommended in the face of so many potentially effective alternatives, it remains an option for someone wanting fuller lips. Most surgeries take the form of injecting material into the lips, and usually work on a semi-permanent basis, subsiding after a period of several months. As everyone's lips are a unique case, it is important to first consult a trusted doctor about a surgery if it's something you're looking into. The doctor will be able to offer specific advice relating to your situation, as well as details relating to the chosen surgical procedure.


Make absolutely sure that the doctor is trusted and well-reputed. Operations like collagen injections have gone famously wrong in the past, and it's important to enlist a doctor who knows what they're doing.

, Look into hyaluronic acid filler (HAF) injections. Compared to some of the longer-used methods for lip augmentation, hyaluronic acid is the safest and best-recommended type of filler for your lips. The filler in these injections approximates natural compounds found in the body, and unlike fat grafts, require no liposuction. HAF injections are used to improve the shape, structure and volume of your lips. Although fairly expensive (running between 500-2000 dollars) and uncovered by most insurance plans, reception to these injections is generally very positive.


Collagen is a less common lip filler now than it used to be, but it still plays a significant role in the world of lip augmentation. Take some time to look into collagen if you're exploring surgical options.
Another widely used method of lip augmentation is fat grafting. This procedure transplants fat from another part of your body (extracted via liposuction) and injects it into your lips. While this means you won't have any foreign matter in your body, the process is longer, more uncomfortable, and carries greater risks than a HAF injection.

, Although the word implies a high level of severity, most lip augmentation surgeries actually happen fairly quickly. Despite any anxiety you may have, a lip augmentation is virtually painless. A topical agent will often be placed on your lips to reduce the discomfort of the injections. While the operation should be short and reasonably simple, you'll have to plan another appointment in half a year if you want to keep the same look to your lips. Don't worry if there any uneven bumps in your lips post-surgery; these concentrations of filler will soon quickly dissolve, leaving your lips looking lustrous and consistent.

Try a lightening cream.,
Use an exfoliation treatment.,
Take a break from waxing.,
Wear sunscreen.,
Make a lightening mask.,
Try some other home remedies.",How to Lighten Dark Upper Lips1," Dark skin on the upper lip is caused by excess melanin in the skin. You can reduce the appearance of this dark pigmentation by using an over-the-counter or prescription skin lightening cream.









The most effective skin lightening ingredients include kojic acid, azelaic acid, arbutin and vitamin A, so you should look for creams containing a combination of these.
Hydroquinone is a very effective bleaching product for dark skin. Although it is available in the USA, it has been banned in many Asian and European countries due to its potential carcinogenic properties. Therefore, you should speak to your doctor before using this product.;
, Exfoliation can help to slough off the upper layers of dark, pigmented skin and reveal the newer, lighter skin underneath.









Use a facial scrub three or four times per week to exfoliate the skin above your lip. You can use a store-bought product, or make your own scrub using sugar or salt.
Alternatively, you could consider getting a microdermabrasion treatment, which is usually performed by a dermatologist using a rotating brush with a crystal head which effectively removes the upper layers of dark skin.

, Dark skin on the upper lip may be caused by aggressive hair removal techniques, such as regular waxing.


Therefore, it's a good idea to take a break from waxing for a couple of months, to give your skin a chance lighten on its own.
If you're concerned about the dark hair that grows on your upper lip, consider bleaching the hair or using a gentler hair removal method, such as threading.

, Harmful UV rays are one of the biggest culprits behind dark and discolored skin -- on the upper lip or anywhere else on the body.









Therefore, it is very important to protect your skin from these harmful rays by wearing a facial sunscreen everyday -- even when it's not sunny. To make it easy, try applying a moisturizer with an SPF of at least 15 every morning.
Dark pigmentation on the upper lip can be caused by the use of tanning booths and beds. Tanning booths are harmful to the skin and can lead to premature aging, in addition to brown spots and discoloration. Try using a self-tan lotion instead -- it's kinder to the skin.

, Some people have had success in lightening their dark upper lips using a homemade facial mask made from gram flour, turmeric, lemon juice and honey.









Mix an equal amount of each of these ingredients (e.g. 1 teaspoon) together in a small bowl until it forms a smooth paste.
Apply the paste to the dark skin on your upper lip and leave it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the paste is dry.
Rinse the paste away with some warm water, then pat the skin dry. Use this mask 2 to 3 times per week until the skin becomes lighter.

, There are many home remedies for lightening skin on the upper lip, most of which vary in terms of their effectiveness. So if you're interested in getting a lighter upper lip naturally, you can experiment with the following:



Honey and lime juice: Mix a little honey and lime juice (you could also use lemon) and apply it to your upper lip. The citric acid in the lime juice bleaches the skin, while the honey softens and moisturizes.

Almond oil: Almond oil is a good product for lightening the skin, as it nourishes and hydrates the skin, while also encouraging skin rejuvenation. Heat up a small amount of the oil and massage it into your upper lip.

Carrot juice: Carrot juice can be used to lighten dark skin on the upper lip thanks to high levels of vitamin A and an anti-oxidant called beta carotene. Grate a carrot, then blend in a food processor. Press the pulped carrot through a sieve to extract the juice, then use a cotton ball to apply the juice to the skin of your upper lip. Leave for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing off.

Start clean.,
Apply a lubricant.,
Create your mixture.,
Apply your mixture.,
Let the mixture sit.,
Apply lip balm.You can use a plain lip balm or even a tinted lip balm, if you’d prefer that.",How to Make Lips Plumper (Cinnamon Method)1," Wash your entire face and scrub your hands well, since you’ll be using your fingers during this process. If you’re wearing any lipstick or lip gloss, remove it before proceeding. You want to begin with completely clean lips. Take a damp washcloth and rub it gently over your lips, going back and forth over them several times. This will remove any dead skin cells.;
, You can use Vaseline, Aquaphor, or even your favorite lip balm for this. Apply a thin layer on your lips, making sure to get full coverage. Stay within the lines of your lip during application. Doing this will protect your lips from over exfoliation and give your lips a dose of moisture before applying the ground cinnamon.

, Take a clean bowl and mix half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon with a pea sized dollop of Vaseline until you have a paste. Load some of the paste onto your clean finger. You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush, if you’d prefer.


You can use cinnamon sticks, if that’s all you happen to have in your kitchen - just make sure to crush them first. You don’t have to pulverize the sticks into a powder – the consistency of sea salt or table salt will do the trick.
A modification to this method that will provide additional exfoliation is adding salt to the mixture. Take a clean bowl and mix half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon with a half a teaspoon of salt. Then add a tablespoon of Vaseline and mix well.Proceed with the remaining steps of this method (there are no other changes to the process).

, Using your finger (or soft-bristled toothbrush), coat the entirety of your lips with the mixture. Once your lips are fully coated, press your finger (or soft-bristled toothbrush) softly to your lips and rub gently with small circular motions all over both the top and bottom lips for 30 to 40 seconds.


You’ll feel a slight tingling sensation, which is normal. Cinnamon mildly irritates the skin on your lips, causing them to redden and swell slightly.Take care not to swallow any of the cinnamon because it can irritate your throat.

, You’ll want to leave the mixture on your lips for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. After the time is up, use a damp washcloth to gently wipe the mixture completely off your lips. You’ll notice that your lips now appear rosy, fresh and plump.


Do not leave the ground cinnamon mixture on your lips longer than a few minutes. The plumping effect happens within this time frame. Leaving the mixture on longer than a few minutes or overnight does not increase the plumping effect and increases the likelihood of swallowing and over-irritation.

, Vaseline or Aquaphor will also work for this. Make sure you don’t skip this step – your freshly plumped lips need the moisture after going through this process, and moisturized lips look even lusher!

Clean out old lip gloss containers.,
Place 3 tablespoons of petroleum jelly and honey in a microwave-safe dish.,
Stir to combine the two ingredients.,
Transfer the petroleum jelly and honey to the container(s).,
Place the lid on the container.",How to Make Lip Gloss with Honey1," Wash them carefully with soap and water, and then sterilize them with rubbing alcohol.

, Microwave for 30 seconds.


Vaseline is the most common and easy-to-find brand of petroleum jelly.Honey is great to use in homemade lip glosses because it's a humectant, meaning it attracts and retains water. It also adds a nice shine and tastes great, too!You can also use a double boiler if you don't have a microwave. A double broiler consists of a bowl placed on top of a pan of simmering water. The bowl does not touch the water, but creates a seal with the bottom pan to trap the steam produced by the simmering water. This prevents the substances being melted from burning.
Another way to melt the ingredients is to put them in a plastic bag and then float the bag in hot water. Do this until the ingredients are melted. Then snip off a small corner of the bag to pour out the melted petroleum jelly and honey., If the ingredients are completely melted you can remove them from the microwave or double broiler. Otherwise, heat them again for another 30 seconds.


Be careful with the melted ingredients. If very hot, they can cause a burn.

Look for the type of undertones you may have to your skin, this will guarantee a natural relationship between your lipstick shade and overall skin tone.


Look at the veins on your forearm. If you have blue veins, it means that you have cool, pink undertones. If you have green veins, you have warm olive or golden undertones. A mix of the two vein types means your undertones are neutral and most colors will work for your complexion. ;
, Now that you have found your skin undertones, picking a shade that matches will provide a flattering color contrast on your face. When looking at lipstick colors, try to distinguish the main base color.


If you have cool, pink undertones, then choose a shade that has a red base such as berry or plum.
If you have a warm, olive or golden undertones, choose a shade with a blue or brown base, such as burgundy., With darker shades, both matte and gloss finishes can look both dramatic and calm. Matte lipsticks are more durable and they last a considerable amount of time, especially if you choose a liquid to matte formula. Or choose a lipstick with a more glossy finish, which can look very elegant and does not require as much of a flawless application., When wearing darker shades, any creases or caves on your lips will stand out. Drinking enough water throughout the day will help your lips look fresh and smooth, since dry, cracked lips are a sure sign of dehydration., In order to guarantee smoother lips, massage an exfoliant to your lips to get rid of any flaked or dead skin on or around your mouth. You can find lip exfoliating products in drugstores and online.If you don’t want to spend the money or don’t want to wait for a product, you can make a simple and gentle exfoliant with equal parts sugar and olive oil mixed together., Moisturizing after exfoliating will make sure your lips don’t lose all of their hydration after application of your lipstick. Matte finishes are more likely to rid your lips of moisture throughout its wear.Apply Aquaphor or Vaseline to your lips before styling your hair or applying your other makeup. This allows for enough time to let the moisturizer set into your lips. Make sure to wipe off whatever moisturizer you have on before applying lipstick., Lining the lips will give a more flawless look to your lipstick. It guarantees the color will not feather to outside your natural lip line. Use matte lip liners for matte lipsticks, and gloss lip liners for gloss lipsticks.


When choosing a lip liner, decide on whether you want a nude shade to make your color pop, a similar shade to your lipstick for a natural application, or a darker shade to create a creative bold, ombre look.If you are trying to give yourself a fuller lip, try lining a little outside of your natural lip line, either by the cupid’s bow or at the base of your bottom lip.

, Whether or not you use lip liner, applying your lipstick is a process that only improves with practice. Especially with darker shades, mistakes made during application may be obvious.


Use a lip brush for precise application and also to make your lips the shape you prefer.
For a more natural application, use the actually lipstick or wand (if liquid lipstick). With gloss formulas, you can use your finger to apply.
To make sure lipstick does not end up on your teeth, curl your index finger into a hook shape and insert your hooked finger into your mouth, keeping your lips slightly pursed. Move your finger along your lips to your opposite cheek, and “pop” it out from your mouth. All the leftover lipstick on your finger shows what would have been on your teeth., A finishing powder works well to keep your lip color in place throughout the day or evening. It will make sure your darker shade does not fade, especially after eating or drinking.


To apply the finishing powder, place a tissue on your lips and using a large makeup brush, gently wipe a layer of finishing powder over the tissue. This should be done after your first coat of lip color. Apply a second coat of color if wanted, or leave as is for a more matte finish.Baby powder can be a cheaper alternative to most finishing powders.


Finishing powders may not be necessary for liquid to matte, or “long-lasting” formulas since these lipsticks usually dry instantly.

, Darker shades on the lips are more likely to draw color away from your complexion. To put more life into your face, lightly brush some blush on the top of your cheeks or bronzer along your cheekbones. Not only will it add some definition to your face, but it will also stop you from looking sickly."

Simply cut a slice from a potato and rub the exposed flesh over the lips.Honey and rose petals: Take 4 or 5 pink or red rose petals, wash them, then crush them using a mortar and pestle. Mix in just enough honey to form a paste, then apply the paste to the lips twice a day. The honey will moisturize the lips, while the rose petals will stain them a pretty pink or red.

Glycerin: Glycerin can help to prevent dark lips and eliminate dry spots caused by dryness. Use a cotton bud to dab a couple of drops of glycerin onto your lips every night before bed.

Beetroot: Beetroot juice helps to restore a bright, healthy color to lips thanks to its vibrant purple color. Simply dab the juice directly onto the lips, then apply a light moisturizing lip balm."

If you have dry and flaking skin on your lips, you may want to try a soothing mask instead, as the exfoliating one may be too harsh for you.To make this exfoliating mask, you will need:


1 teaspoon of avocado oil, olive oil, or sweet almond oil
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon coconut oil, shea butter, or Vaseline

, You can use any liquid, food-grade oil, but the best types of oils for this recipe are avocado, olive, and sweet almond.Here are the benefits of each:









Avocado oil soothes and heals the skin.Because it is so light, it sinks quicker into the skin than other oils. It is also rich in vitamin E and has great hydrating and antioxidant properties.Olive oil is great for dry, chapped lips. It is also moisturizing and nourishing.Sweet almond oil is great for softening chapped skin., It may not be great for your teeth or health, but it makes an excellent, gentle exfoliator. It will help buff away flaky skin and dead cells.








, Honey is one of the best things you can put on your skin. Not only does it have antiseptic properties and kill off bacteria, but it is also a natural moisturizer. When applied to your lips, it will help pull the moisture back in.







, Both coconut oil or shea butter are solid at room temperature. If you find them too difficult to work with, you can warm them up for a few seconds in the microwave (enough so that they soften, but not melt) or you can simply whip them with a fork. Here are the benefits of each:








, You want to end up with a thick paste. If the paste is too runny, then add some more sugar; if the paste is too thick, then add some more of your liquid oil.








, Scoop up a small amount of the scrub and apply it to damp lips. Gently massage your lips with the scrub for a few minutes; this will help exfoliate away the flaky skin and reveal the soft skin underneath.








, For best results, use this scrub once to twice a week. Because it is made from natural ingredients, you will have to store it in the refrigerator and use it within two weeks, or it will go bad.

If you have very dry and flaky skin on your lips, consider skipping the exfoliating treatment and jumping straight to making and applying the mask. If you do choose to use the exfoliating treatment, be sure that you are gentle, so that you do not worsen the condition. Here is a list of what you will need for each part:To make the exfoliating scrub, you will need 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of olive oil.

Water not only hydrates your body, it nourishes your skin and promotes new cell growth. In fact, dry lips can be a sign that your body is not getting the amount of water it needs.

Exfoliate your lips.,
Moisturize them well.,
Protect your lips from the sun and cold.,
Use a humidifier in the winter.",How to Have Beautiful Lips1," You probably already exfoliate your face, but do you include your lips in your routine, too? Lips tend to get dry and flaky, so they need to be exfoliated every few days to stay in good shape. You can exfoliate your lips the same way you'd exfoliate your face, using a gentle scrub or brush to remove the dead skin cells that have built up.


Be gentle with the skin on your lips, which is fragile like the rest of your facial skin. Don't use a harsh body scrub. Choose one that's formulated specifically for use on the face.
If you want to make your own gentle lip scrub, mix 1 teaspoon of honey with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar. Rub it on your lips to smooth away the dead skin, then rinse it off.;
, After exfoliating, apply a gentle moisturizer so that your lips stay smooth and supple. Look for a nourishing lip balm made from natural and organic ingredients like shea butter, almond oil, aloe, tea tree oil and beeswax. When you wear lip balm, you end up licking your lips and ingesting a little, so you want to choose one with ingredients aren't harmful if ingested.


Avoid lip balms that contain alcohol. Alcohol is often used as a preservative in cosmetics, but it's drying to the skin. If you apply lip balm that contains alcohol, your lips will actually dry out more quickly than they otherwise would. Alcohol-free lip balm keeps your lips in good condition without making the problem worse.

, The skin on your lips is susceptible to getting damaged during extreme weather. A sunburn or a bout of cold weather can leave them dry and cracked. Be sure to protect your lips all year round to keep them looking soft and supple.


When the sun is strong, wear a lip balm that contains sunblock with SPF 15 or higher.
During the winter, protect your lips with a lip balm that contains a thick humectant such as shea butter or coconut oil. This will keep moisture in and protect your lips from dry, cold air.

, If your lips tend to get extremely dry and chapped in the winter, you may want to consider using a humidifier to add moisture to the air, especially while you sleep. During the winter, the combination of cold air outside and dry, hot air indoors wreaks havoc on lips (and the rest of your face, too). Do yourself a favor and use a humidifier to keep your lips moisturized all winter long.


If you don't have a humidifier and don't want to buy one, you can add moisture to the air by boiling a pot of water on the stove. Let the steam from the boiling water travel throughout your house.

You can use a store-bought lip scrub or make your own. To make your own lip scrub, mix a tablespoon of brown sugar with just enough honey or olive oil to get it to stick together.
Once a week (twice at the very max) rub the scrub onto your lips, vigorously enough to loosen the dead skin. Let it sit for one minute, and then wipe off with a damp washcloth.;
, Take a clean toothbrush and brush the flat part of the bristles back and forth on the lips, much as you would brush your teeth.Do this for 30 or so seconds per lip, and stop if they start to hurt. Flaky lips are dry lips. The “flakiness” is dead skin. It needs to be exfoliated off.
Rinse your brush and your lips with water. You could also use a washcloth to exfoliate lips.

, Using small crystallized sugar molecules, you can softly scrub away the dry flaky skin around and on your lips.


Apply like a facial scrub and enjoy the immediate removal of any dead skin on your lips.
Be careful not to eat or swallow the mixture because petroleum jelly is not edible.

, You’ll notice that your lips will feel softer and look better too. You could use a Q-tip or your finger.Some lip balms leave your lips moist and soft temporarily or leave a layer of product on the lips, giving the illusion that the lips are moisturized. Petroleum jelly penetrates the lips to actually moisturize them. It also leaves them with a shine.Apply about triple the amount of a normal application. Your lips will look and feel greasy, but don't smother it on. It shouldn't look like you have a paste on your lips.
You should be able to rub your lips together comfortably. Let this sit for around 3-5 minutes, until the dead skin is soft. Petroleum jelly helps you get rid of flaky lips just as long as you use it constantly! It’s a byproduct from the production of petroleum, which means it's very cheap. It seals your lips like a barrier, letting nothing in (including cold air or environmental toxins).

, The next morning, the flakiness will peel away along with the petroleum jelly. Continue to hydrate yourself, and apply lip balm to prevent your lips from drying out again.


The petroleum jelly treatment is recommended to be done about 3 times a week in the winter and once a week in the summer (or when it is a rainy season). Your lips might look pinker as petroleum jelly can reduce dark patches on lips.Depending on how you sleep, you may wake up with the crusty remains of the jelly around or on your lips. This can easily be removed by wetting a soft washcloth and rubbing softly off.

, You should drink plenty of water and keep yourself hydrated as much as possible. Sometimes chapped lips are the result of a poor diet. People sometimes forget how important water is to the body.


Lips often get chapped, cracked, dry and unsightly because of how little we care for them. Like the rest of our skin, lips require moisture to stay healthy and beautiful. In fact, because the skin on our lips is so thin, we need to keep them moisturized even more than the rest of our skin.
The key to smooth lips is hydration. You need to drink plenty of water or other healthy fluids to keep your skin healthy, and even more so your lips.

, Apply it regularly in addition to using the jelly now and then.


A good rule of thumb is to apply the lip balm once every 3 to 4 hours or so. Over usage could lead to dark patches on the lips.
Lip balms with ingredients such as mint, peppermint or eucalyptus can be used and a variety of brands are available at supermarkets or pharmacies.

, Some people are concerned about the environmental and health consequences of constantly using petroleum jelly. A substitute could be natural oils.


Coconut oil is a great option. It's good for the hair, the skin and the lips too. Simply apply it as you would have applied the jelly. Olive oil can work too.
The Vaseline lip therapy line could be a replacement for any lip products you already use. It has a small range of colors also.

, Don't lick your lips. The saliva will dry them out and chap them.


Don't touch your lips a lot with your hands. Biting your lips also can lead to dryness and sore lips.
Applying sunscreen to your lips is a good idea to protect them in the summer from the rays of the sun."

Choose a texture that works well with your skin and preferences.,
Apply lipstick, stain or gloss.,
Skip the lip liner.,
Try a lip plumping product for fuller lips.",How to Have Beautiful Lips2," Lipstick comes in every color of the rainbow, and choosing just the right shade can be a little confusing. Trendy colors are fun to experiment with, but if you want your lips to stand out in a good way, you need to know what colors complement your complexion instead of clashing with it. Have a few staple colors in your collection that you know make you look beautiful, and rotate in some trendier colors now and then to keep your look fresh.


If you have warm yellow undertones (your wrist veins appear green), go for warm colors like reddish browns, mauves, orange-reds, and so on.
If you have cool pink undertones (your wrist veins appear blue), go for cool colors with blue undertones, like berry colors, pinks, and purples.

, Lip shades are available in every texture from wet glosses to thick, waterproof sticks to barely-visible creams. The texture of your lip shade really makes a difference in your appearance. For example, if you're going for a knockout look, you'll want a long-lasting, matte lipstick in a very rich hue. For a subtler affect, a tinted lip gloss that provides just a hint of color works very well.


Lip color that's extremely glossy, shiny, or glittery makes you look more youthful, but it can also be a little overwhelming.
Matte lipsticks are the go-to choice for a mature, classic look that never goes out of style.
Lip stains and tints are great choices for times when you don't want people to stare at your lips. Just a swipe of a neutral lip tint can make your lips appear more full and alive.

, Start with clean, recently exfoliated lips so that your color won't flake off. Make sure your lips are well moisturized, but don't apply lip balm right before you put lipstick on or it might smear. For beautiful, colorful lips, apply your color like this:


Start from the middle of your bottom lip and work toward the corners, applying a little color at a time.
Press your lips together to transfer color to your upper lip. Use your finger to cover your lip more completely.
Blot using a tissue to mop up extra color.
Repeat and blot once more. Applying your color twice will help it last longer, since the first layer provides a base for the second.

, When lipstick first became popular, it was formulated with ingredients that tended to bleed past the lip line, so people used lipliner to keep the color in place. Today's advanced lip color formulas don't bleed, so you can skip the lip liner unless you want to drastically change the shape of your lips.


If you're worried about your color staying in place, apply powdered foundation around the edges of your lips.
You can also use a lip liner to touch up just one part of your lips where you tend to bleed, like the corners. Using lip liner around your entire mouth may look too severe., If your lips are a little thin, you might consider trying out a lip plumping product. Lip glosses and balms containing ingredients that temporarily plump your lips are available at beauty supply stores. They usually work by slightly irritating your lips to temporarily cause them to swell. Too much irritation can cause your lips to get flaky and dry, so don't plan on using these products every day.You can make your own lip plumper using ingredients you probably already have in your pantry. Many commercial lip plumpers contain cinnamon, cayenne pepper, or peppermint, all of which slightly invigorate and plump the skin. To make your own, mix your favorite lip balm with a pinch of cinnamon, a smidge of cayenne pepper or a few drops of peppermint essential oil, then apply it to your lips.
For longer-lasting results, many people decide to get lip fillers. Collagen and other ingredients are injected into the lips to give them a fuller appearance. If you want lip fillers, be sure to find an experienced technician who comes highly recommended."

If you do not want to use primer, consider using a water-based face lotion instead.
There are primers made specifically for your eye lids, do not use normal face primer on your eyes.
A light layer of corn starch is another potential alternative to a primer.;
, Foundations come in a variety of types including: liquid, gel, cream and powder. Liquid and gel foundations hold up better on your face in hot and humid weather than cream foundations. Powder foundations do well in warm weather (than cream foundations). All types of foundations will do well in “normal” weather conditions.BB creams, which are quite popular right now, may melt if worn in really hot and humid weather.

, Your skin type should dictate which type of foundation you use on a regular basis. If you have dry skin, for example, you may wish to select a liquid foundation or a powder that contains a moisturizing ingredient. If you have oil skin, select only powder-based foundations or products that leave your skin looking matte., Many people attempt to select a foundation colour based on the current colour of their face. When applied, this colour will make your face look quite different from the rest of your body. If it is the summertime and you have lots of exposed skin (e.g. tank top, shorts, etc.) the difference in shade will be quite obvious.Instead, select the colour of your foundation by matching it to your neck, arms and chest. This colour will blend nicely into your neck and make the colour of your skin look consistent everywhere.

, When applying liquid foundation to your face, drop a small amount onto your fingers or a makeup sponge. Then dab the foundation onto your forehead, nose, chin and cheeks. Keeping dabbing outwards and downwards from these central areas until the foundation has been applied to your whole face.Applying foundation using this method helps ensure your facial hairs are lying flat on your face and not sticking up and out.
Note, this is the opposite of how you should wash your face and apply moisturizer.

, People with normal-to-dry skin shouldn’t need to use powder as part of their regular makeup routine. However, if you have oily skin, powder foundation is highly recommended as a way to keep the shine on your face from becoming too bright.A fluffy brush or powder puff are the best methods for applying powder as they ensure more even coverage.

Double up on eyeshadow and eyeliner.,
Curl your eyelashes with a clamp tool.,
Use powder to make your eyebrows look thicker and fuller.",How to Wear Makeup3," Eyeshadows that have a matte finish will result in an overall smoother makeup look. Colours such as brown and taupe can work well on just about everyone. And mauve and plum can help give you a very classic look., Both eyeshadow and eyeliner can fade throughout the day or evening as you wear it. One solution to this problem is using two types of eyeshadow and eyeliner at a time to ensure it lasts longer.For your eyelids you can add an eyeshadow primer underneath your eyeshadow to help it last longer.
Instead of a primer, you can apply cream eyeshadow first and a powder eyeshadow over top. This makes the eyeshadow last longer and can make the colour stand out more.
For eyeliner, use a gel eyeliner as the first layer and add some powder eyeshadow on top make it last longer.
If you do not want to use two different colours, use an eyeshadow colour that matches the lightest part of your face as the base layer. Apply your coloured eyeshadow on top., An eyelash clamp tool is that strange looking things that’s a cross between a pair of scissors and a guillotine. If you decide to use a clamp tool to curl your lashes even more than they are naturally, use it before you apply any mascara. You should clamp each set of eyelashes three times — once at the base, again mid lash and finally at the ends., If your eyebrows have thinned out, or they need more definition, try using an eyebrow powder that is 2 shades lighter than your hair colour. Use an angled brush to apply the powder to your brows until they’re at the thickness you like.If you have white or grey hair, choose taupe instead of a colour to match your hair.
If you’re a redhead and can’t find any eyebrow pencils or powders in the right colour, try using a lip liner or eye shadow instead.

Change your lipstick type with the seasons.",How to Wear Makeup4," Unless you’re dressing up for a special party, or the Oscars, select a lip colour that naturally enhances your natural lip colour.

Create your own custom foundation.",How to Wear Makeup5," It might be called a lip brush, but you can use it on more than just your lips. Retractable lip brushes are great because you can put something on the brush portion and retract the brush to protect it. If you’ve used concealer as part of your makeup routine, put some of that concealer on a retractable lip brush and bring it with you for the day or evening. When you need to do a touch-up, simply roll out the lip brush and apply., Makeup setting sprays can be great when you’re wearing a lot of makeup and need your look to last a long time. These sprays can also help keep your makeup in place if it’s hot, humid and sweaty. However, it can be quite difficult to remove your makeup after wearing a setting spray, so be careful when you choose to use it., It can be tempting to use your loose or pressed powder foundation to remove or cover up shiny parts of your face, but unfortunately this may result in your skin looking cakey with the more powder you add. Instead use blotting papers to absorb the excess oil and protect the makeup that’s already there.You can try wrapping a blotting paper around a powder puff to make it easier to use.
You can also alternate between using blotting paper and applying powder throughout the day or evening, rather than just one or the other.

, Mascara, unfortunately, tends to dry out really easily, making it harder and harder to apply as it comes out in clumps on the brush. Instead of replacing your mascara sooner than the recommended 3-4 months, add a couple of drops of eye moisturizing drops to loosen it up., When you’re ready to throw out a mascara, keep the brush. Wash it off to remove any leftover mascara and then use it for other makeup applications. Some can be used as an eyebrow brush. Others are great to comb your eyebrows., Foundation can be mixed with other products to subtly change how it will appear on your face, and add useful features.

Lighten up your foundation to let your skin breathe.",How to Vary Your Makeup Look by Season," The best canvas for makeup is healthy skin, and it’s vital to keep skin healthy with SPF. Before you head out into the sunshine, apply a sunscreen with an SPF between 30 and 50. Allow it to absorb into your skin for three to five minutes before applying any of your makeup.


To learn more about using sunscreen in your makeup routine, check out the article here.;
, Summer is the time to let your skin breathe. Instead of putting on a base of full coverage foundation, simply use concealer on any blemishes or spots. In the hot temperature of summer, you don’t want to sweat through thick foundation. Keep it light, and you’ll be happy.If you’re hesitant to part with your beloved foundation, find a happy medium by using a tinted moisturizer over your entire face.

, When your skin changes color, even with a tan, it’s being damaged. Get a beautiful bronze without the skin damage by adding a bronzer to your beauty routine. Brush the bronzer on areas where the sun would naturally hit, like your cheeks, temples, and the bridge of your nose.Summer is the season to pull off a bronzed, shimmery face, so embrace it!


To finish your bronzed look, add a swipe of bright pink blush to the apples of your cheeks.

, In warm, humid weather, regular mascara can smudge and run. Waterproof mascara will stay in place. It will even last through swimming and sweating, and all other summer water activities., Shimmery pinks, peaches, and golds look especially great against bronzed skin. If you want to create a smoky eye, look for a copper color rather than the typical black and silver.Summer is a great time to rock those warm, glittery shadows.

, Just like your skin, you want your lips to be able to breathe in summer weather. Instead of packing on a heavy, opaque lipstick, try out bold lip stains and moisturizing balms. If you have a favorite summer lipstick, apply it lightly with your fingertip, rather than gliding it on thickly.During the summer, just remember that less is more for everything except sunscreen.

, Get eye makeup inspiration from the autumn leaves. Think warm, soft reds, rich browns, golds, and even deep olives. Fall is all about dimension, so ditch the shimmery bright colors for richer hues. Line your eyes with browns and golds during fall days, and intensify your eyes with black liner at night.Fall is the time to bring out your heavier winged eyeliners and cat eye looks as well.

, Don’t underestimate the power of a little bit of eyebrow grooming to change your look. As your clothes get thicker in the fall, let your eyebrows follow suit! Fill in sparse, thin brows with brow powder or pencil. Keep your eyebrows well-groomed, but beware of over-tweezing., Instead of brushing on an instant tan, focus more on enhancing your facial features with contouring. Brush the darker contouring shade on your temples, across the top of your forehead, on your jaw line, and down the bridge of your nose. Blend it thoroughly with a fluffy brush to make sure the lines are soft, rather than bold. As your summer tan fades (natural or not!) and your skin lightens, subtly highlighting your feature with contouring will keep your skin from looking dull., Fall is the perfect time to wear your deeper shades of lipstick, from berry colors to burgundy to deep purple. Just like summer is all about simple, light makeup, fall is about warmer, and slightly heavier looks. Pair your dark lips with light, neutral eyes for a beautiful and balanced look., Winter is the time for full coverage foundation, but it’s important to keep it from looking cakey. By adding a bit of water to your foundation routine, you can help your foundation go on smoothly and evenly. You can find both applicators at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store., After you’ve evened and smoothed out your skin with a foundation, lightly dust a contour shade along your temples, cheekbones, forehead, jaw, and the bridge of your nose. You want to use a light hand to apply the contour, because a heavy contour will look unnatural in the winter. Add a touch of a warm, rose blush on the apples of your cheek for the final bit of warmth.

, When you’re choosing eyeshadows and eyeliners for the winter, you can’t go wrong with any shade of brown. Add a deep gray and earth tones with a bit of sparkle, and you’ll be stocked for the season. By wearing more neutral colors on your eyes, you can wear bold, dramatic lips.


Make your eyes big and bright in the harshest winter days by curling your eyelashes and adding a coat of dark, volumizing mascara.

, Winter is the perfect time for deep lipsticks in festive colors like wine, chestnut, and even bright red. Bold lips will warm up your face in the dead of winter, when it needs it most! Choose lip products with moisturizers, because lips are bound to get chapped in the cold, dry winter weather.


Add a gloss over your deep lip color for added dimension.

, As the snow melts and the sun comes back out, it’s time to also lighten up your makeup. Put the bold, dark colors away, and get excited for fresh, softer looks. You can also swap out your powder products for creams to rejuvenate your skin after winter weather., Whether you want to invest in some pastel eyeshadows or soft pastel lipsticks, spring is your chance to do it. These softer colors will brighten your skin after the darker colors of winter. Sheer colors work beautifully on the eyelids, and pink lips and cheeks are always a good idea. Just think light!, The fresh air of spring feels great for you and your skin. Swap out your full coverage foundations for medium or light coverage, or ditch foundation all together. Tinted moisturizers work well in the spring, and you can also simply conceal blemishes or spots."

, Instead of using plain water as you normally would, you can use the baking soda solution to wet your nose for the strip. Use a cotton ball to transfer some of the solution to your nose.







, Read the instructions on the pore strip so that you know how to properly apply it. Stick it onto your nose and flatten out any wrinkles with your fingers.








, Let the pore strip dry and then slowly remove the strip from top to bottom. This will extract the blackheads from your nose.

, Before applying the grapeseed oil, splash your face with warm water and blot dry with a washcloth. Apply about ½ teaspoon of grapeseed oil into the palm of your hand. Gently rub and distribute the oil between both hands, particularly on your fingertips., After you have coated your fingertips with the grapeseed oil, gently rub the oil onto your skin. Make circular motions with your fingertips, and apply to your cheeks, forehead, chin, and nose. Be sure to rub the oil onto your skin for about 2 minutes.The oil and the circular motions will help break up dirt, oil, and residue.

, Simply washing your face with water may not remove the oil completely. To wipe away all the oil, rinse your washcloth with warm water and wring out the excess water. Gently sweep the damp washcloth over your entire face to lift away the grapeseed oil., To lock in moisture, use a drop or two of the grapeseed oil on freshly cleansed skin. After you have completely removed the oil that helped lift the dirt and residue from your skin, apply a few fresh drops onto your fingertips. Sweep the oil over your face and allow it to soak into your skin. Do not remove., Cleanse your skin with grapeseed oil a few times each week. As you begin to establish your cleansing routine, you may wish to cleanse with oil each evening.You may notice more oil production during the first few days, but this will balance as your skin adjusts to the new routine., When you are browsing for grapeseed oil, opt for oil that has not been chemically extracted.

Wash the affected area gently twice a day using a mild soap such as Dove or Cetaphil.Washing too frequently, rubbing the skin too vigorously, or using facial masks or other hydrating facial cleaners can make acne worse.,
Apply over-the-counter acne treatment products that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.,
Apply tea tree oil to the skin to fight whiteheads naturally.,
Give the medication time to work.",How to Treat Whiteheads1,";
, It's important to wait 5-15 minutes after you cleanse your skin before applying any topical acne medication. If you apply the medication immediately after washing your face, it may actually irritate the skin and result in whiteheads.Benzoyl peroxide destroys the bacteria found in the pores when acne is present.It is included in a wide range of products, including face washes, lotions, and ointments. Be careful when applying, as it can stain or remove color from your clothes.Salicylic acid helps the skin shed dead cells, which helps open pores. It also dries up the excess oil that causes whiteheads. Because it is an acid, it may cause some tingling when you apply it.With either of these medications, stop using them and contact a dermatologist if you experience any of the following: skin rash or intense itching, blisters, redness, or swelling.
Don't over apply! Applying more than the recommended dose of these medicines not only won't clear your skin faster, it can actually irritate your skin and cause redness, inflammation, and more whiteheads., Use a product containing at least 5% tea tree oil. Saturate a cotton ball with the oil and dab it on the affected area once a day. Although it may take longer to work (approximately three months), studies have shown that tea tree oil is as effective over time at fighting inflammation as benzoyl peroxide but has fewer side effects.If you have eczema or another skin condition, tea tree oil may further irritate your skin. Do not swallow tea tree oil as it is toxic when consumed.For slightly faster results, apply tea tree oil to skin twice a day for 20 minutes each time, then wash off with gentle cleanser.

Ask your dermatologist about comedo extraction.,
Ask your dermatologist about isotretinoin.,
Remember that whitehead treatments take time to work, and maintenance is required.",How to Treat Whiteheads2," Whiteheads are small, white bumps on the surface of the skin. They are usually the least severe type of acne, but may also occur alongside other types. Whiteheads and other acne breakouts can have a variety of causes. Understanding how whiteheads form can help you decide on treatment.


Hormonal changes in the body, such as those that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, can cause breakouts. Nearly 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 develop acne of some sort. Changes in medication such as hormonal birth control and certain psychiatric drugs can also trigger a breakout.
Excessive sebum production contributes to whiteheads and other types of acne. Sebum is an oily substance produced in hair follicles that can cause whiteheads and other acne breakouts when too much is absorbed by your skin. Most of the hair follicles on your body produce sebum, so it is possible to get whiteheads on other areas of your skin besides your face.
Some people are more genetically likely to develop whiteheads. Caucasians are more likely than people of other races to develop whiteheads and other acne, and the tendency to get whiteheads can also be passed down in families.
Whiteheads have many causes, not all of which you can treat on your own. If your skin does not respond to at-home treatments, it's best to see a doctor even if your condition isn't severe. You may have other underlying health issues that are contributing to your whiteheads.

, If you've been treating your whiteheads at home and haven't seen improvement after 4-8 weeks of using topical medication, it is probably time to reassess your situation. The American Academy of Dermatology has an online guide to help you understand your acne symptoms, but this should not replace professional advice.

, If your whiteheads are severe or do not respond to home treatment methods, your general practitioner can prescribe both oral and topical prescriptions that are stronger than over-the-counter medications. These usually work in a few weeks. If your whiteheads continue to be a problem, talk to your physician about getting a referral to see a dermatologist.

Your general practitioner can prescribe medications that also include antibiotics to decrease the presence and growth of acne-causing bacteria (P. acnes) on your skin. Some common oral antibiotics include erythromycin, tetracycline and derivatives, and (for women) oral contraceptives. Your doctor may also prescribe topical antimicrobials such as benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid.Some health insurance programs in the US require a physician's referral for you to see a dermatologist, and dermatologists are usually more expensive than visiting your general practitioner. To avoid surprise costs, check with your health insurance provider before scheduling a visit.

, Topical retinoids are derived from vitamin A and unclog pores, which helps to clear whiteheads and prevent them from recurring. Minor side effects like skin irritation may occur, and some of them (such as tazarotene) should not be taken by pregnant women..

Some over-the-counter skin creams contain retinoids, but your doctor can prescribe prescription-strength topical medications that are specifically for fighting whiteheads and other acne. It’s best to seek a physician’s advice.

, If your whiteheads do not respond to at-home or general prescription treatments, you will need to visit a dermatologist. You should also visit a dermatologist if you find acne nodules or cysts. Nodules are hard, raised bumps under the skin, and cysts are blocked pores that are usually large, red, and sore to the touch.Both can cause permanent scarring if left untreated by a professional.

A dermatologist has many treatment options that are not available for at-home treatment. In addition to topical and oral medications, your dermatologist may recommend laser treatments, chemical peels, or even surgical procedures, depending on the severity of your acne problem., Your dermatologist can physically remove whiteheads and blackheads using a sterile extraction device to dislodge the material clogging the pores. They may also provide a microdermabrasion peel to help remove dead skin and open smaller clogged pores.You should never try to remove whiteheads on your own. Squeezing, picking, popping, or using an at-home extraction device on your own can worsen your whitehead problem because it may force the contents of the whitehead further into the skin. Attempting to extract whiteheads at home can also cause serious infection and result in permanent scarring., Isotretinoin is a prescription medication that works by reducing your body’s production of facial oil (sebum), one of the substances responsible for clogged pores that cause whiteheads.It also reduces inflammation and the presence of the skin bacteria P. acnes.In about 85% of patients with severe acne, isotretinoin treatments produce permanently clear skin in 4 to 5 months.

Isotretinoin goes by the brand names Absorica®, Accutane®, Amnesteem®, Claravis®, Myorisan®, Sotret®, and Zenatane™. It is also available in generic form and is usually administered orally.Isotretinoin has some possible severe side effects, such as the development of inflammatory bowel disease or psychiatric disturbance, that present potential risks. It is likely only to be prescribed in severe cases.Because of the severity of some side effects, people who are prescribed isotretinoin must enroll in the ipledge™ program created by the FDA. Among other things, women who take isotretinoin must not become pregnant, and they should not begin isotretinoin treatments while pregnant. People taking isotretinoin should also not donate blood while being treated and should stay out of the sun., Even oral and topical whitehead treatments prescribed by a medical professional take time to work. Comedo extraction is faster, but also rather expensive. In all cases, you will need to continue to maintain your treatments in order to keep your skin clear.

Stay out of the sun.,
Continue your skincare regimen.",How to Treat Whiteheads3," Scrubbing, especially with an ""exfoliating"" sponge or washcloth, can actually make your whitehead problem worse because it irritates your skin. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that you just use your fingertips and wash with a gentle, non-abrasive cleaner.Massaging the soap into your skin with your fingers will still provide a deep clean.








, Skincare products such as astringents, masks, toners, and exfoliating soaps can actually irritate your skin and make it more prone to developing whiteheads.


Applying rubbing alcohol can also irritate your skin and cause whiteheads to develop.
Skincare products that contain oil are also not a good idea if you have acne-prone skin. Many cosmetics and sunblock lotions contain oil that can clog pores and lead to whiteheads. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that you use products that say ""oil-free,"" ""will not clog pores,"" or ""noncomedogenic.""Avoid heavy foundations and cream cosmetics if possible. These tend to be the worst culprits for blocking pores., Oil-free makeup is better for your skin than the oily stuff, but it can still cause trouble if it blocks your acne medications from working. Apply your medications first, then your makeup, for the best effect.








, In addition to avoiding skincare products that contain oil, you can also help prevent breakouts by not using greasy or oil-containing hair products and not touching or picking at your face (your fingers have natural skin oils and bacteria on them that can cause breakouts).

, While it can be hard to resist wanting to eliminate whiteheads by picking or popping them, doing so can actually further inflame the skin, make the whitehead problem worse, potentially cause infection, and delay skin healing. Keep your fingers away!, You can find oil-absorbent blotting paper at many pharmacies and beauty supply stores. If you have very oily skin, using blotting paper can help absorb some of the excess oil without causing irritation.








, Tanning beds and laying out to tan are popular, but they're not good news for your skin. Using tanning beds can increase your risk of skin cancer by 75 percent. In addition, certain acne medications make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, which can increase skin damage if you tan., It might be tempting to stop using topical acne medications once they've done their job. Dermatologists recommend that you continue using at least one topical medication even after your skin clears to prevent further breakouts. Remember: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!"

Choose the right shampoo for your hair.,
Select the right conditioner.,
Determine how regularly you should wash.,
Wash your hair.,
Condition freely.,
Comb your hair when it's dry.,
Massage your scalp.",How to Treat an Oily Scalp and Dry Roots1," For as straightforward as it may seem, this task can feel insurmountable when the entire, inscrutable shampoo aisle is looming down upon you. Often, shampoos which treat both an oily scalp and dry hair are marketed ""for combination hair.""


Dandruff commonly co-exists with an oily scalp. If you're also dealing with dandruff, there are several dandruff shampoos available that should be appropriate for you.
Don't hesitate to step away from your usual brands if they're no longer getting the job done for you at any point during this process; many find that proper management of their hair requires occasionally, or even routinely, shaking up their shampoo status quo.;
, Although effective 2-in-1 products do exist, use of both shampoo and conditioner is recommended to properly care for your hair. Dealing with both ends of the spectrum (both an oily scalp and dry roots) will be much easier for you when you're able to separately change the amount of shampoo that you use and the amount of conditioner that you use.


A telltale visual: conditioners for dry hair are often creamier, and not quite so clear as others.

, This will vary depending on your hair's thickness, coarseness, and curliness, among other qualities, but every head needs to be rid of the dead skin, dirt, and oils it accumulates. Regularly may mean twice a week, daily, or even every other week. If your scalp is too oily, though, this is because the sebum--that is, the oils and dead skin--that your scalp is producing is not being washed away at proper intervals.


But here we come to what seems like a paradox in haircare: because the human body strives to attain homeostasis (the state of remaining the same) if you wash your natural oils away too frequently, your body will actually produce more and more of them. This renders your scalp and hair even oilier due to washing it too frequently, and you were washing it frequently in the first place so that it wouldn't be so oily! Defining ""regular"" washing will require some experimentation, but if you're washing anywhere close to daily, err on the side of washing less frequently at first. In Western culture, it's been ingrained in many that they need to wash more often than they actually do. If you've been washing your hair often, washing less frequently may leave your hair and scalp oilier than usual for a few days while your body acclimates.

, Thoroughly dampen your hair in the shower, then squeeze about a half an inch to an inch (in diameter) of shampoo into your hand. The actual amount will vary depending on the length of your hair. Your shampooing technique should be similar to a gentle scalp massage, followed by thorough rinsing. Bath soap can occasionally be used in place of shampoo. This method, however, should be employed weekly at most, and not repeatedly performed for extended periods of time. Bath soap provides a powerful clean for an oily scalp, but is too harsh on hair to use often.

, Conditioner should be regularly applied after washing out the shampoo, and followed by another rinse. While the amount of shampoo you use should be very carefully doled out, conditioner can be applied much more liberally to dry hair. Conditioner is essential to moisturize your dry roots and hair after shampoo washes their natural oils away.
Consider dry conditioners if your hair is feeling dry between conditioning sessions. These are sprayed outside the shower on dry hair, then brushed through for a mid-week moisture boost.

, Combing or brushing your hair distributes its natural oils evenly, which will help combat your oily-scalp-but-dry-roots situation. Brushing while it's dry is preferable to brushing it right when you exit the shower; hair is more elastic when it is wet, and breakages can more easily occur during this time. , It's part of proper shampooing technique, and it's helpful outside the shower as well. Gentle massage stimulates hair follicles and improves blood flow, generating more of the oils essential to keep your hair healthy.This may feel counterintuitive, prompting your head to make more oils when you're already dealing with an oily scalp. Used in combination with all of these other, proper techniques, however, those oils will be nourishing your dry hair, not sitting around and clogging up your scalp.

Mix aloe vera into your shampoo.,
Whisk up an egg yolk conditioner.,
Knock back a beer (over your head).,

Has the bonus of being topically soothing for a dandruff sufferer's itchy scalp.
Aloe juice or gel can also be combined with lemon juice and applied separately, before shampooing, but it should be noted that lemon juice can have a drying effect on your hair.

, There are plenty of different recipes to be found, but a basic one employs two egg yolks, beaten well, with two tablespoons of olive or coconut oil.


After beating the two egg yolks together with the oil, apply it to your hair and let it sit for five minutes.
Wash your hair thoroughly so that no residue remains.
Utilize instead of shampoo according to your wash schedule, alternating egg washes with regular cleanings. , Really! After the liquid evaporates, the two ingredients remaining from the beer are malt and hops, proteins which can revitalize your dried out roots. Although some opt for the fun of simply pouring a beer over their head mid-shampooing, you can also mix boiled (but not currently boiling) beer with a mild shampoo and use that in the shower. This should be incorporated occasionally (it'd get a bit expensive, otherwise), in addition to your normal wash.
This will, quite predictably, cause your head to smell like beer; interpret this as positively or as negatively as feels appropriate to you.

, The oil will tighten up your blood vessels and act as an astringent, drying out your scalp, so take care to use this more on your scalp than your dry hair. "

Put down the bottle of bleach.,
Check your hairsprays and pomades for alcohol.,
Eat mindfully.,
Change your care with your environment.",How to Treat an Oily Scalp and Dry Roots3," Habitual hair dyeing can take a toll on your hair, especially when bleach is involved. If you regularly dye your hair and continue to have issues with dry roots, consider taking a break from the color regimen.


Any heat processes or chemical treatments can have an adverse effect on your hair's health over time. Limit blowdryer and flat iron use if you're having issues with dry roots.

, Styling products containing alcohol should be avoided if you have dry roots, as it can be harsher on hair. Alcohol has often been added so that the product dries faster after normal use, but it causes the product to function like an astringent on your already too-dry roots. Care should be taken to work your pomades, gels, mousses, and waxes into only the tips of your hair, if you choose to continue using them. Too much at the base of your follicles near the scalp can exacerbate oiliness.

, Hereditary factors are not alone in deciding the state of your scalp. Deficiencies of riboflavin and vitamin B12 specifically have been shown to have a hand in an oily scalp. Seek out supplements if you're unable to incorporate foods that are richer in these into your diet.


Dairy, dark green leafy vegetables, and whole grains provide riboflavin.
Meat, poultry, eggs, fish, milk, and cheese are excellent sources of vitamin B12. , Humidity can cause scalps to be oilier than usual, in which case you may need to abstain from products, or perhaps even rinse your hair more often. Summer months can over-moisturize hair, whereas winter months will require diligent conditioning to keep your dry roots from getting even drier.


When you know you'll be out under the hot, midday sun for any considerable period of time, consider hats or scarves to protect your hair from its moisture-thieving rays.

Mix together equal amounts of sugar and honey (or olive oil), then rub onto your lips in a circular motion with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Let this sit for a few minutes, then wipe off your lips as described below.;
, Soak a soft cloth in lukewarm water for a minute, then gently wipe your lips. This prevents tiny tears in your lips, which can make them turn pink or sore. Follow this method whenever you are removing old lip products, or when your lips feel covered in dead skin or food.

, Use ChapStick, Vaseline, or a similar product to keep your lips moisturized. Apply and leave in until there are no major cracks or flaking areas visible on your lips.


If you plan to apply makeup, use the lip balm 1–2 hours in advance if possible, then continue on to that section.
Drinking enough water will minimize cracks and chapping.

, This full makeup treatment can create the most natural and customizable pale lips, but it involves putting concealer and foundation on your lips. While a base of lip balm helps keep this safer and less dehydrating, it can still cause chapping if used too often. If you want pale lips in day-to-day life, just use a ""nude"" or pale lipstick instead of the full bevy of products, or try a home recipe.


To check whether a makeup product is safe for use on lips, use the EWG cosmetic ingredient database.

, For the most natural results, pick a concealer very slightly darker than your skin tone. After applying lip balm, dab the concealer in tiny amounts onto your lip, and continue to dab with your finger until it blends evenly across your lips.


Avoid rubbing the concealer on, which can make it look caked on and strange.

, Select a pale liquid foundation, or use the one you typically use for your face. Dab a raisin-sized amount onto the skin next to your lip, and blend it in. Blend a very small amount onto your lips themselves, and the rest around them.


BB cream is more moisturizing and transparent, making it a good choice for this purpose.

, Blend in the foundation by applying a pea-sized dab to each cheek, your forehead, and your chin. Brush this with your fingertips toward the sides of your face, until it is blended in and your skin is an even tone.

, Take a look in the mirror under white light, and decide whether you want a more striking, paler look. If you're satisfied with the current look, skip ahead to the powder step. Otherwise, put on a ""nude,"" pale pink, or pale peach lipstick (or lip gloss for a glossier look) over the other products.


You can use bright white lipstick instead, but be aware that this will look unnatural.

, Cover your lips with a tissue, then brush on a powder makeup through the tissue. This sets the makeup beneath, making it stay on longer, and adds a matte appearance.


If you prefer a glossy look, apply an additional tiny dab of lip gloss on over the powder.

, There are quite a few home recipes people use to give themselves pale lips. These are generally safer and less dehydrating than cosmetic products, although they may not last as long or allow fine control. Try applying one of the following to your lips, rinsing off after 20 minutes, or leaving them on for a less subtle effect:


Rice flour mixed with just enough water to make a thick paste
One part all-purpose flour mixed with two parts water
Crushed rose petals in milk

, Mix white flour with vaseline to create your own tinted lip balm. This will keep your lips hydrated and make them appear paler at the same time.

, Use a cotton swab to wipe a couple drops of lemon juice across your lips, removing dark, dead skin and perhaps making your lips slightly paler. Wash this off and moisturize after a few minutes, as the lemon juice can cause chapping if left on too long.


If you have chapped lips, dilute the lemon juice with lukewarm water to avoid hurting yourself.

, For short-term solutions, stick a spoon in the refrigerator until it feels cold to the touch. Take it out and press it against your lips until it warms up. For a short time, your lips will look paler due to the reduced blood flow. This may only last a few minutes in warm weather.

, There are a few good brands that will literally plump up, smooth out and moisten your lips. You could also use pucker up lip balm or any type of lip balm.


Check the ingredient label before purchasing a lip plumper. Many of these products use food-based additives, like cinnamon or wintergreen, which may cause your lips to swell and itch. Some lip plumpers also contain ephedrine, which could cause serious allergic reactions.
Apply the lip plumper the same way that you would apply lipstick or lip gloss. Make sure that you avoid applying the plumper to skin outside the edges of your lips.
Wipe off your lip plumper before putting on your lipstick, lip gloss or lip balm. You can imagine what might happen to your partner's lips if you kiss them while wearing lip plumper.
For a natural alternative, cayenne pepper or salt can be used - but these can be irritating and drying to the lips. Apply a very small amount of the powder across the lips, and top with your favorite lip gloss. The cayenne will plump and color the lips by making the blood flow increase (the same action the lip plumpers create), and the gloss will provide shine and moisture.

, Highlighting a feature by using a lighter color will bring the feature forward from the background.

Use the tip of your finger or a makeup sponge to gently blend the lip liner into your skin. The lip liner should not produce a stark line, but it should still be visible enough to highlight the area that you intended.
Fill in your upper and lower lips with your favorite lipstick, lip gloss or tinted lip balm. While you should use a product that makes you feel comfortable with your look, shinier or glossier lipstick will produce the illusion of fuller lips.

For a successful application, it’s important to start off with freshly scrubbed and well-moisturized lips.

Carefully draw the line down toward the bottom of your lip.Try to follow the contour of your lip rather than drawing a straight, one-dimensional line in the negative space.

, Press your lips together lightly. Make sure the line starts between where your lips meet, so that the illusion of a ring is created. Likewise, ensure the line extends down past your lower lip line slightly. It needs to appear as though it connects there, on the skin under your lip, where a real piercing would be.

, This look is typically rocked with a highly pigmented lip color, like bright red or pink. However, if bright lipstick isn’t your style, try drawing the metallic stripe onto bare lips. The faux ring won’t pop visually in the same way it does next to a bright lip color, but it will look more natural and create a similar effect., Don’t limit yourself to typical red and pink lipstick shades. Liquid lipstick formulas come in many experimental hues, such as deep royal blue, orange, purple, gray, sky blue and a lot more. Apply them just as you would a regular lipstick color, leaving the vertical line open for the metallic “ring.”, Try a blue or purple metallic shade instead. Choose a lipstick in a complementary color to create an interesting contrast. To tie it all together, apply that same blue or purple metallic shade on your eyelids."

It would not work if you put down your lighter colors first.








First, trace your lips with a black lip liner. This will help you create the perfect shape, while giving yourself a neat border to fill in later with your lipstick. Lip liner can also reduce the risk of your lipstick smudging outside the borders of your lips.Carefully fill in your lined lips with black lipstick.

, Applying super dark lipstick can be tricky, and unfortunately one mistake sticks out like a sore thumb. However, don't worry if you notice a jagged edge or a bit of lipstick out of place. Once you've applied your lipstick, use a small concealer brush and concealer to clean up the perimeter of your lips. With just a few smooth strokes, your lips will look flawless.







, Apply a bit of purple liquid lipstick along the inner rim of your lips, where the top and bottom lip touch. Paint a bit of the purple lipstick directly onto your lips, and then use a small fluffy brush to blend the color outwards. You want it to look almost sponge painted, with no stark edges between the purple and the black lipsticks.








Continue applying purple lipstick and blending it out until you are satisfied with the look. It should look as if the purple seamlessly flows into the black.

, Apply a bit of pink liquid lipstick anywhere you want on your lips. For example, you can do one spot on the corner of your top lip and one on the opposite corner of your bottom lip. Let the pink lipstick sit on your lips for a moment, and then start blending it out with a small fluffy brush once it gets a bit tacky. These will look almost like pink shadows on your lips, mimicking the surreal colors in space.








There are many different colors in space, and adding many colors on the black will make this look more realistic. The trick is to fully blend everything, so that the colors seem to blend into one.

, Just like you applied the pink lipstick, apply a bit of dark or royal blue liquid lipstick. Then, blend the blue product out with a small brush.The final result should look like a beautiful, abstract blend of black, purple, pink, and blue – like the fantastical space photos you’ve certainly seen!








, This is most effective when you apply it against the lighter pink areas of your lips. Gently stipple it on small sections of your lips – there is no exact science to applying it. Additionally, it’ll start to lighten up places of your lips, as if by starlight!








The light lipstick will create sections of your lips that are very light against the black base, adding an insane amount of dimension.

, Add a bit of light powder, or highlighter, to areas of your lips that you want to lighten up even more. Use a small powder brush, and remember that a little goes a long way! When it comes to creating the stars, you can be very creative. Lighten up your lips wherever you see fit!







, Use a very tiny brush to paint tiny stars on your lips with the white liquid lipstick. You can paint one as an accent, or add several – it depends on both your personal preference and the size of your lips. Instead of creating your typical, five point stars, try creating more realistic stars. Create a plus sign, and then thicken out the center to create the body of the star. Have fun with this step! It’s a very creative lip look, and it will never turn out the exact same way twice.You can also create clusters of tiny white dots to look like far away stars. You can also stipple a bit of white lipstick onto your lips and skip the blending – that can look a bit like the Milky Way!

Start off by softening your lips.,
After exfoliating, moisturize your lips with petroleum jelly or a good lip balm.

,
Begin to line your lips with a lipliner.,
Put eyeshadow base on your lips so it would hold the colours in place.

,
Now to begin your rainbow lips, keep in mind that it doesn't have to be like a real rainbow with primary and basic colors.,

Don't smack your lips together!",How to Do a Rainbow Lip," You can't expect to pull off a bold lip look if your lips are chapped and cracked. You want to make sure your lips are extra smooth. The first thing you want to do is exfoliate your lips. This may seem tedious and pointless, but it's really a lot of help. You can make your own lip scrub by mixing together sugar and honey and spreading it on your lips with a toothbrush. After rubbing it in well, wipe it off with a tissue.;
,, Make sure it matches or is darker than your lip's natural color. Make the lines very thick and precise.

,, Don't be afraid to use candy colors and metallics. Also, there are many ways to do a rainbow lip. You can do horizontal or vertical stripes. So start by getting a very small tiny lip brush and your eyeshadow palette.

, It can be stripes, swirls, or even tie-dye. Look at the pictures for ideas. Don't forget to clean your brush after each color.

, For example, if half of your lips are blue, line that side of your lips with blue. If the other half of your lips are red, line that side with red. This is a really simple and easy trick because it's much better than going out to the store and buying multiple lip liners for one look. You can also use wet wipe to wipe away any color that is out of the lips.

,, That might ruin and smear the design. Smacking or rubbing your lips together in this look is only okay when you want the colors to be swirly.

Apply the base lipstick color.,
Apply the black lipstick on top.,
Inspect the color, then add more layers, if desired.,
Make any touch ups, if needed.",How to Do Smoky Lips1," A smoky lip is a sheer black layered on top of a flat or matte, opaque lipstick. The black layer often has some shimmer as well.Some companies, such as Lipstick Queen, sell kits that include a nude colored lipstick and a sheer, black, shimmery lipstick. You can use such a kit, if you prefer, or you can use lipstick from you own collection.


The opaque lipstick can be any color your want. Red and purple are great choices, but you can also use a pinky nude as well.The black lipstick must be sheer, preferably with some shimmer to it.;
, You can apply it straight from the tube or using a lipstick brush. Keep in mind that the black lipstick will darken this color by several shades.You do not need to blot the lipstick, but you can smack your lips to help ""spread"" it more evenly. Having a little excess lipstick on you lips is actually a good idea, because it will help the sheer layer blend in better.








, Once again, the black lipstick must be sheer, or the final color will be too dark. It is best to apply this shade straight from the tube. This way, you will have more control over the layering.







, Sheer black lipstick will never come out pure black, which is the point of the smokey lip look. A single layer may be too light for you, however. If you want a darker shade, add another layer or two of sheer, black lipstick.







, Use a lipstick brush to help blend out the color and layering. Take a close look at the outline of you lips, especially the corners. If something looks uneven, use a lipstick brush to fix it.Once you are happy with the look, you are ready to go.

Keep blending until you have a smooth gradient.,
Add touch of lip gloss to center of you lips, if desired.",How to Do Smoky Lips2," For a classical look, choose a bright, flat red color. This look is different from the traditional smoky lip look in that it is more ombre. It is reminiscent of the smoky eye look.








For a twist, try a different color, such as bright purple or pink., Use an angled lipstick brush to smooth out your base coat, especially around the outline and corners of your lips. You are not using lip liner for this look, but you still want it to be as sharp and neat as possible.








Do not clean off your brush just yet. You will use the residual lipstick on the brush to blend everything together towards the end.

, Start at the very corner of your lips and go inward towards the center, about ¼ to ⅓ of the way. Don't worry if it looks weird at the moment; you will fix it in the next step.








You can also use black lip liner instead, if you can find it.
If your base lipstick was a lighter color, such as bright purple or pink, use a darker shade of the same color, such as plum (for purple) or maroon (for pink)., Gently sweep the brush across your lips, starting from the outer corner, and going inwards towards the center. Alternate between using the wider part of the brush on your lip, and the narrow part of the brush on the outline.







, You want your lips to be darker at the corners and brighter towards the center. This will give your lips a smoky, vampy look, perfect for nighttime.







, This look is already very pouty, but if you want to step things up a little add a dab of clear lip gloss to center of your upper and lower lip.

Clean up your lip line with concealer.",How to Create the Perfect Highly Pigmented Lip," When you wear a bold, highly pigmented lip color, every dry flake in your lips is emphasized. Before putting on your lip color, use a lip scrub to remove any dead, dry skin from your lips. Rub it in in circular motions, and wipe it away with a damp washcloth.If you don’t want to buy a lip scrub, you can make your own with ingredients from your kitchen. Mix ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of olive oil with 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar, and rub it over your lips to exfoliate them.
You can also use a clean, wet toothbrush or washcloth to exfoliate by gently rubbing it over your lips.;
, To ensure that your lips are soft and smooth for the lip color application, moisturize with a lip balm after exfoliating . Allow the balm to sink into your lips for 5 to 10 minutes to ensure that it’s fully penetrated before moving on to your lip color.After you’ve allowed the lip balm to sit on your lips for several minutes, blot away any excess with a tissue. Having excess balm on your lips can sheer out your lip color when you apply it.

, If you want your lip color to stay in place all day and go on as pigmented as possible, it helps to use a lip primer. It is usually a clear balm-like product that provides a sticky base for the lip color to grab onto and prevents the lipstick from bleeding outside your lip line. Apply a thin layer before lining and filling in your lips.If you don’t have a lip primer, you can use a little foundation primer. Apply it around the outside of your lip line, though, to keep your lipstick from bleeding beyond the lip line.

, Lining your lips before applying your lip color helps create a sharp edge and prevents feathering along the lip line. However, to ensure that your lip color is as pigmented as possible, you should also fill in your lips with the liner to create an extra layer of color.For the most pigmented lip color, use a lip liner that matches the lip stain and lipstick that you plan to use. That will add the most depth to the color.
Your lip liner doesn’t have to match your lip stain and lipstick exactly. As long as it’s in the same color family, it will work.
If you can’t find a liner that’s similar to the lip color that you’re going for, use a nude liner that matches your natural lip color.

, To avoid having to reapply your lip color constantly, create a base for your lip color with a lip stain or liquid lipstick. These are extremely long-wearing products that will cling to your lips even when a creamier lipstick wears off. Apply the stain or liquid lipstick to your lips, and allow it to dry for 3 to 5 minutes before moving on to lipstick.Choose a lip stain or liquid lipstick that is similar to the lipstick color that you plan to wear to ensure the most pigmented lip color.
Before applying your lipstick, blot your lips with a tissue to ensure that stain or liquid lipstick is completely dry.

, While using a lip brush to put on your lipstick offers more precision, you’ll get the most pigmented color if you apply it directly from the tube. Carefully smooth the lipstick over your lips in a thin, even layer.If you feel like you can’t get a clean edge when you’re applying the lipstick from the tube, use a lip brush to apply the color to the edge of your lips. Use the tube for the center part of your lips, and blend the areas together with the brush or a finger.

, To help the lipstick set, you want to remove any excess from your lips. Press a tissue between your lips to blot them. Next, let the lipstick sit for 2 to 3 minutes to allow it to fully set.If you have blotting papers, usually meant for blotting oil from the face, you can use those to blot your lips. They’re particularly effective because they remove the emollient layer from your lips while leaving the pigment behind., After your lipstick has set, apply a light layer of translucent setting powder to your lips with your finger. It will provide a base for the next layer of lipstick to stick to, and help keep your lip color in place all day.If you’re not concerned about making your lip color last all day, you can skip this step.

, Once you’ve powdered your lips, smooth on another layer of lipstick directly from the tube. Take another tissue to blot your lips once more, so you don’t have to worrying about your lipstick smearing.If your lip color isn’t as pigmented as you’d like, you can repeat the blotting and lipstick application process again. Just be careful not to apply too many layers of lipstick or your lips may start to look cakey. Three layers is usually enough.

, When you’re happy with the intensity of your lip color, take a small, precise concealer brush to apply concealer that matches your skin tone along the outside edge of your lips. That will help clean up any smudges or mistakes, so your lips look perfect."

Dot concealer under the eyes and on blemishes and discolorations.,
Dust a finishing powder over your face.",How to Make Makeup Look Airbrushed," For your makeup to look flawless and airbrushed, you must start with smooth, clean skin. Use a mild exfoliating cleanser or scrub to ensure that your face is clean and any rough, dead skin is removed. Apply the exfoliator in a gentle, circular motion for the most effective exfoliation and rinse it well.Follow the instructions on your exfoliator’s packaging to ensure that you use it properly.
Don’t scrub your face too roughly with the exfoliating cleanser or you may end up with red, irritated skin that will be more difficult to cover up.
Pat your face with a clean towel after rinsing the cleanser to avoid irritating your skin.;
, To keep your skin looking smooth and supple, it’s important to apply a moisturizer after you exfoliate. Use a lightweight formula that absorbs easily into the skin, though, so your makeup doesn’t wind up looking cakey.If you have oily skin, choose an oil-free moisturizer to help keep your foundation and other face makeup from fading and melting off.

, While moisturizer can help hydrate your skin to eliminate rough patches, you should still apply a primer before your foundation. It will fill in pores, fine lines, and wrinkles so you’ll have a smooth, even canvas to apply the foundation to. Look for a primer with silicone in it for the smoothest finish.As with the moisturizer, choose an oil-free primer if you have oily skin.
If you have dry skin, look a primer that says it is hydrating or moisturizing on the product. It will add even more moisture to your skin so your makeup won't cling to dry patches.

, For an airbrushed finish, choosing the right foundation finish is key. A matte foundation is usually your best bet because it reflects less light, which makes pores less obvious and gives your skin a smoother look. It also cuts down on shine, so your makeup will look smooth and flawless as long as possible.If you have dry skin, you may prefer a demi-matte or satin finish foundation. That will help keep your skin from looking too dull or flat.

, For your skin to look airbrushed, you probably want all the discolorations and imperfections covered up. You’ll be able to apply less foundation if you use one that offers at least medium coverage to even out your skin tone and cover up most flaws. Using a lighter layer of foundation will help keep your makeup from looking cakey or heavy.If you have a lot of discoloration, scarring, or acne that you need to cover up, you may prefer using a full-coverage foundation. You won’t need to apply as many layers or as much concealer if your foundation covers well.

, If you use your fingers to apply your foundation, you can wind up with streaks and patchiness. Instead, use an egg-shaped sponge to gently bounce the foundation onto your skin. That will help press it into your skin for a seamless, airbrushed look.Be sure to dampen your sponge with water before using it to apply your foundation. That keeps it from absorbing too much product and allows it to really diffuse the makeup for a flawless look.
Use the sponge to apply the foundation in a light layer over your entire face, even areas that are fairly even and clear. You can bounce the sponge over problem areas a second or third time for extra coverage, though.
When you’ve finished applying your foundation, roll the sponge over your face on its side. That will pick up any excess makeup so it doesn’t look cakey.
If you aren’t a fan of makeup sponges, you can use a dense foundation brush to buff the foundation into the skin. Just make sure to blend well to avoid streaks and achieve a smooth, even look.

, Obvious dark circles can spoil the look of flawless makeup. Using a peach or orange color corrector counteracts the blue tones in dark circles because blue and orange are opposites are the color wheel. Carefully pat the corrector under your eyes, and use your finger to gently blend it in.For fair and light skin tones, use a peach color corrector.
For medium and darker skin tones, use an orange color corrector.
The warmth of your finger helps blend the corrector more seamlessly into your skin than a brush does.

, Even with a medium coverage foundation, there may be spots on your face that show through the makeup. Use a concealer that matches your skin tone exactly, and apply it over the corrector under your eyes and on discolorations and blemishes. Use the same sponge that you used for your foundation to blend and press it into the skin for an airbrushed look.While the color corrector can cancel out the darkness under the eyes, its orange or peachy tone doesn’t always blend completely into the skin. Adding the concealer on top helps camouflage it.

, When you’ve perfected your face makeup, you want to make sure that it looks airbrushed all day. A setting powder can help lock your foundation and concealer in place. Use a lightweight, translucent formula, and apply it with a large, fluffy brush that will deposit a light layer.If you have dry skin, you don’t necessarily have to apply the powder all over your face. Dust it over any areas where you applied concealer and possibly your T-zone, or forehead, nose, and chin, which is most prone to getting shiny.

Kylie often colors in her entire lip with lip liner.",How to Get Kylie Jenner Lips1," To make your over-lined lips look natural and convincing, it’s important that your natural lip line isn’t visible. Grab your favorite concealer, and start blending it along the outline of your lips. You don’t need to cake it on – just put enough that your lip line is less visible., Using your fingertip, apply a powder foundation to set the concealer around your lips. It’s important to layer this between your concealer and lip products in order for your lips to look clean and precise. The outline of your lips should now be fully covered.







, This is the most important step of this trick, and also the one that takes the most practice. Over-lining your lips entails creating a new outline for your lips, so that it looks like your lips are larger than they actually are. There are a few ways to do this.









Many makeup gurus choose to over-line their cupid’s bow, or the arches in the middle of your top lip, as well as the middle of the bottom lip. To do this, follow the natural shape of your cupid’s bow, but draw it above your actual lip line. Do the same thing on the bottom, over-lining your lip in the center. Then, line along your natural lips to the corners of your mouth. With the over-lining only done along the center, your lips will look a bit more natural.For the more dramatic Kylie lips, you will overdraw the entire lip, from your cupid’s bow into the outer corners, on both the top and bottom., To get the quintessential Kylie Jenner look, apply a smooth, matte lipstick. Make sure that your lip liner and lipstick are the same color, so that there is no distinction between liner and lipstick. Fill in your lips carefully within the lines you created.

You can over-line your lips if you want them to look even more full, but it’s not required.

, Double check your lip liner and make sure that everything looks clean and even. Then, use your same lip liner to color in your lips entirely.

Do the eyes.,
Line the eyes.,
Use the eye pencil.",How to Do Your Makeup Like Kate Middleton," Kate Middleton has gorgeous peachy skin with nice definition around the eyes. She has a very natural but glossy appearance.;
, Use a hydrating moisturizer and add a bit of illuminator for a nice sheen on the skin. Prep the skin with a little bit of foundation over the top. Keep the tones warm, for creaminess and ""peachiness""

, This will remove any sort of redness or tiredness. You can use it on its own or it will help to make eyeshadow stay on better.


Add a tiny bit of concealer under the eyes. You want it to be nice and bright, and you don't need to use too much.






Put it just right in the corners and just blend down into the darkest point of the eye. Simply dab that on and blend it in smoothly with your fingers. Create a gorgeous skin, bright and fresh.







, You want it to look quite glowing still, so dab a little bit of a cream blush and that just gives that real dewiness to the skin. The best way is if you just smile and just go for the apples of the cheeks; blend that up like you would if you were applying a normal blusher but just working that all the way around and blending that until all the colours disappear, until the edges are blended in, and that just gives a dewy, peachy effect.


If you’ve got slightly oily skin, you can still do this but just add a little bit of powder to set it. This will ensure that your lovely peach is a colour that’s very natural-looking. Blend it in using a slightly smaller brush in circular motions working your way up.







, Put a little neutral base around here. Work both the eyebrows to have gorgeous full eyebrows like Kate's. If you’ve got a nice shape already, then get an eyebrow pencil and fill in any little gaps to really define the eye and give it a nice shape.


Do it in a little sort of feathery strokes – you don’t have to go too much but make sure that any little gaps there are filled in and that the line comes down.







, Use a nice liner all the way around the eyes, with little flicking motions all the way round the eye; it’s quite a thick line and you can work that upwards. Most of the time Kate wears a sort of black eyeliner but she has also defined her eyes using a blue liner to match her royal blue dress.


Make it a bit darker and put a bit of blue over the top.






Look up, and add quite a thick line underneath. You can coat that with a little bit of mascara to define the lashes a bit more. Then, clean it up.







, It can be a little bit smudgy, so if you make a mistake, you can use a water cleanser on a cotton bud and just gently dab over the area; you’ll see that it will slowly disappear. If you dab it in the area, it will disappear. Clean up so you don’t have to do the whole thing again. If you prefer a softer line, this is also a good way of blending the line down a little bit. And that’s how you get a Kate Middleton makeup look.

A primer can also help minimize pores, wrinkles, and blemishes, so it’s an important first step to your skin routine. Kylie's face looks flawless in every photo she takes, and primer will help you be ready for your close-up too.








Apply primer over your entire face using your fingertips. Working the primer into your face with your fingers has the added benefit of getting blood flowing to your skin, helping to brighten it.
Face primer is especially important when you want your makeup to last in more extreme weather conditions, like blazing heat or freezing cold.;
, This will even out your skin, conceal redness and blemishes, and create a flawless base for the rest of your makeup. Kylie is the queen of flawless skin, so a great foundation routine is key to achieving her look.Blend it thoroughly into your skin using a makeup applicator sponge or a large stippling brush.








Don’t forget to bring your foundation downwards, so there isn’t a stark contrast between your face and neck.

, It is absolutely crucial to choose a shade much lighter than your bare skin. Kylie's make up artist chooses a concealer one or even two shades lighter than her natural skin tone to set up the base for the contoured look she rocks daily.








Apply the light concealer under your eyes to brighten them and conceal dark bags. This will make you look younger and more alert.
Then apply the concealer on the forehead, bringing it down the center of the nose.
Finally, add a dot to the cupid's bow, or the arch above the center of your lips. This light concealer will brighten the face, slim the nose, and accentuate your pout, all things that Kylie is known for.

, A perfectly contoured face is part of Kylie's signature look, so this may be one of the most vital steps to mimicking her makeup routine.Apply the dark color to the hollows of your cheeks, the highest point on your forehead along your hairline, your jawline, and the bridge of your nose. The highlight should complement the darker color. Apply the highlight to the center of your forehead, under your eyes, your chin, and under your cheek bones. This will give your face a sun kissed look, while enhancing your bone structure and natural features.








Using a blending brush, dab at the products until they are fully blended into your skin. It is important to dab rather than sweep the brush, so the products are not transferred to other areas of your face.
Continue this dabbing motion until there are no harsh lines, and the contour lines are seamlessly blended into your foundation., The best way to do this is to smile, and then apply blush to the areas that are lifted. Apply it in a circular motion, and then sweep it slightly outwards to make it look most natural. Blush comes in both powder and cream forms, so choose the product that you can work most comfortably with.








, The primer creates a smooth base for the eye shadow and eyeliner you will be applying, and it will ensure your makeup stays perfect all day. Kylie wouldn't be caught with smudged eyeshadow or ugly lines from creasing, so neither should you. Primer will prevent both problems. If your eyelids are oily, find a primer with a matte finish.








Use a concealer brush or your finger tips to apply.
You can purchase primers in gels, creams, and powders, so experiment to find the one that works best for your skin.

, Kylie typically opts for a beautiful, bronzed look, so a smoky brown eye will be perfect. Use a small fluffy eye shadow brush for this step. Blend it all over your lid and slightly upwards over the crease.







, Use a blending brush for this step. This second shade will act as a transition color on your eyes, and it’s important to blend it out fully. There should be no harsh lines or borders between colors when you are finished.








Gently wipe up any makeup that accidentally falls under your eye, or place tape underneath your eye to block fall-out from eye shadow.

, Use your smallest brush for this step. Apply this shadow in the shape of a sideways “V.” To envision this, imagine one line extending down from the crease and one line going along the lash line, meeting in a point away from your eye.








Blend, blend, and blend some more. The three colors should seamlessly transition.

, Kylie Jenner has gorgeous, lush lashes, and applying eyeliner to your lash line will help your own lashes appear full and dark.Liquid eyeliner will create a sleek, dark line, but powder or gel work as well. Extend the eyeliner past the end of your lash line, creating a sexy cat eye.









The cat eye can be a difficult trick to master. You can get some tips and tricks here, or skip that step all together.

, If you choose to use falsies, apply them before your mascara. Hold the lashes in your fingers and apply a thin layer of lash glue. Once it becomes tacky, press them into your lash line as you look down. Then use your favorite black mascara to blend your false and natural lashes together.Make sure that the wand is evenly coated in product. Beginning at the base of the lashes, gently wiggle the wand back at forth as you move it toward the ends of your lashes. This will coat your lashes without creating clumps, and also give your lashes intense volume. Allow the product to dry, and then apply a second coat for extra drama.








, Kylie’s eyebrows are perfectly arched and sleek, so this step is crucial. First, use a spoolie to brush out your brows so that the hairs are neat and in place. Then apply your product to any areas that appear sparse or lighter than the rest. Finally, use a concealer and a small brush to outline the top and bottom of the brow. This step cleans up the brow, creating an intense border and giving them the sleek, groomed look that Kylie’s have.







, Kylie’s big lips have become her trademark, so the goal of your lip products should be to enhance the size of yours. Choose a lip liner that is a shade darker than your natural lip color. To make this look natural, overline your lips only in the center, and line them naturally as you move towards the corners of your mouth. In other words, exaggerate your cupid’s bow and the center of your bottom lip by applying lip liner outside of your natural lips.








To make the overlined areas look natural, focus on following the natural curve of your lips. Your overlined lips should have the same shape as your natural ones— just bigger!
Make sure to completely fill in the area between your natural lip line and your lip liner.

, Kylie typically rocks matte lips without any shimmer, so follow her lead. Apply the lipstick carefully, making sure to stay within the border of the lip liner. Rub your lips together to smooth and even out the color, and check the mirror for any places where it looks uneven.








If you’d like, you can first color in your entire lip with the lip liner you used to overline them. This will ensure there aren’t any strange color variations going on, and it will also provide a smooth base for your lipstick.
If you really want to recreate Kylie’s look, you can purchase a lip kit from her new cosmetics line. She recently came out with a set of lip liners that are sold with their corresponding lipsticks., Use your finger to gently apply is so that you don’t overdo it. By adding highlighter to these spots, you are creating the illusion of a fuller pout. It will look like your lips extend farther from your face, and it will create a gorgeous effect when the light hits them. Just remember, a little highlight goes a long way!

",How to Get a Bold and Bright Look with Makeup," Use your usual cleansing routine, which consists of washing your face with a gentle facial wash/cleanser, a toner to close up pores after cleansing and a rich moisturizer to leave skin feeling smooth and supple. Doing this regularly is one of the best things you can do for your skin, as it will keep your skin in perfect condition and can even help to prevent breakouts! Afterwards, pat face dry with a soft towel.
, Smooth on so it looks natural and fresh, not like you're orange! Conceal any imperfections(such as spots or dark shadows under the eyes) with concealer. Get rid of any unwanted shine by applying powder(with a powder brush)over your t-zone(forehead, nose and chin). To avoid looking overly done or even orange looking, make sure all the shades you choose are exactly your skin color., There are two ways to emphasize them, by either sweeping one whole color over the whole lid, or by doing some smokey eyes. You will need the correct brushes, so having a good quality brush set is essential. A couple which are handy to have while doing your eyes are an eyeshadow tipped applicator(the ones with a foam/sponge tip on each end), a small eyeshadow brush and a large eyeshadow brush. They should be soft and easy to use, not rough and raggedy. If going for one color, take your eyeshadow color and use the applicator or brush and sweep the color over closed eyelids. Blend in well to avoid obvious lines and if using a light color you can bring it up to your brow bone. Keep on just the lid. Some good colors for just one color are dark browns, pinks, purples, baby blue, pink, greens and lilacs. Keep it light but so you can see it clearly to make an impact., Choose a color theme(colors in the same color range, such as a sliver, grey and black) and make sure your brushes are clean. Always start of with the lightest color, and blend in the center. Next, take the second darkest and use in the crease and outer corners. Finally, use the darkest color in the inner corner and also in the outer area. Blending in well is vital, as the point of creating smokey eyes is also about not being able to tell where certain colors begin or end. Remember, it isn't just blackish colors that can be used for smokey eyes, combinations of greens, pinks and purples and baby colors look just as amazing!, Match the color to the eyeshadow for a cool and coordinated look. But you can also be a bit bolder and mix and match! Great combinations are: purple and blue, brown and golds, black and pinks and blue and green. Gently(and not tugging) draw a fine line in the outer corners and smudge slightly to achieve a smokey look. Mascara are good too. Be really brave with bright colored mascara and again, coordinate this time, as colors of the same sort will look the best together if matching., Go for either bold eyes and neutral lips, or bold lips and neutral eyes. Never go for both at once, as it will probably just look clash, not cool. A clear lip gloss or one with just a hint of shimmer will do well. If lips are the parts you want to play up, you could even try a lipstick or a brighter shade., Any color looks great, like pink, red, purple, etc. Paint three strokes on each nail and allow to dry. Now your make up is bold and beautiful!,"

",How to Do Your Makeup Like Tori Vega," If you are in a hurry, going without concealer is not a ""biggy."" To apply concealer and make it look like Tori's, it is simple. Mostly, just do your concealer as you would usually do it. Apply especially on blemishes, and even it out to get a fine and natural-looking skin tone. You can apply concealer with your fingertips or a foundation/concealer blush.;
, Swirl mostly on cheekbones, forehead, and your chin. That is all you will need for your foundation. Then, carefully blend out foundation to the rest of your face. It is best to use a brush made for foundation to blend this out and apply to the rest of your face, and your whole face in general. Also, if you apply foundation, you don't need to apply concealer. However, if you apply concealer, it is pretty (almost) vital that you apply foundation. Foundation balances out the concealer, helps you get the appearance of an even skin tone, and holds the concealer all together throughout your face.

, If you want to wear this popular eye makeup, consider wearing light blue, gray, light purple, and neutral colors.

, You can also use dark brown eyeliner, and black eyeliner, pencil, on the upper lid.

, Don't wear colored eyeliner if you want to wear it like hers, and try to stick to black and dark brown mascaras on a regular basis.

, Try them on your cheekbones and blend them out without being too overwhelming.

, You can try dark lipsticks, orange, or pink lip liners. You can fill in your lips, color the outline, add lip gloss, or even just add some lipstick! ;)

, Stay away from colored and glittery glosses. Try sticking to shiny and glossy!

Many rotating makeup mirrors have two sides, one an ordinary mirror and one a ""zoomed-in"" lens.;
, This will help hide dark circles and brighten up your eyes. Lightly dab it into the area under your eyes using a brush or your ring finger. Blend it downwards in a V shape.


Go for a yellow-tinted concealer under the eyes. This will work against the bluish, grayish colors, and help hide them further., You can apply the foundation all over your face, or just on the trouble spots, such as your nose and cheeks. Be sure to blend in well.

, Focus on the areas beneath your eyes and in the T-zone (the nose, forehead, chin, and cheekbones). This will help set the makeup, and keep it from smudging throughout the day. Put extra powder on the bridge of your nose where your glasses rest, as sweat tends to gather here.


If the extra powder doesn't do the trick, reduce the amount of makeup in that area to make smudging less obvious.

, Using a large, fluffy brush, dust on some bronzer across your nose and forehead, chin, and the tops of your cheeks., A light dust of blush is fine, but it's easy to go over the top when glasses already make your face stand out. If you do use blush, apply it on the apple of your cheeks. Blend it back towards the top of your ear, and down towards your jaw line.


If your glasses are made from wire or colored plastic, try a matte blush.
If your glasses have a tortoise shell pattern, try a blush with a slight shimmer. Apply on top of your cheekbones instead for a more angled look.

, The general rule for makeup is that you either pair bold eyeshadow with neutral lips, or bold lipstick with neutral eyeshadow. Since glasses accentuate your eyes, the right choice is usually a clear gloss, nude lipstick, or another subtle shade. If your glasses have thin frames and you'd like to minimize the attention on your eyes, you can try a bolder lipstick, but this is more difficult to pull off.


If you're feeling extra bold, you can pair cat-eye glasses with a deep berry or wine lip color for a ""sexy secretary"" look.
Consider lipstick that matches or complements the color of your glasses frames.

, The eyeshadow primer will help the eyeshadow stick on better. It will also help make the colors stand out better, a must for those who'd like a bolder look.

, This counteracts the effect of nearsighted glasses, especially at the corner of your eye. If you'd like a neutral look, choose a creamy color that is a few shades lighter than your skin tone. If you'd like something bolder and more colorful, choose a color that matches the lightest tone on your face. In general, people with glasses should avoid vibrant eyeshadow colors.


Most makeup artists agree that the thinner and more delicate frames you have, the softer and more natural your eyeshadow should be.
Use a fluffy eyeshadow brush to apply this all over your eye, from lash line to eyebrow. Keep it to a light touch, since your glasses will already draw attention to your eyes. This is especially important if you are far-sighted, as reading glasses magnify the eyes.

, If you have thick, chunky frames, such as tortoise shell frames, consider going darker and bolder.One approach is to use a light color as your base over the entire lid, then a darker color just on your upper lids. If you'd like a more natural look, choose a brown that is a few shades darker than your skin tone. If you are going bold and colorful, choose a color that is a few shades darker than the base color.


Apply the darker color from the lash line to the crease using an angled brush. Blend it in upwards, just past the crease, towards your brow bone., Your eyes can get easily lost behind thick glasses, so a darker eyeliner, ideally black, will help them stand out better. If you have thin, delicate frames, consider using a lighter color, such as dark brown or espresso.

, Glasses draw attention to your eyes already, and make it easy to overdo your makeup. ""Tightlining"" outlines your eyes in a thin, nearly invisible band of eyeliner, and is one of the few looks that works with any frames. If you're interested in other styles, keep reading for alternatives.


Tightlining may not be the right choice if you are far-sighted and trying to counteract the ""shrinking"" effect reading glasses have on your eyes.

, Start at the inner corner of your eye, and end at the outer corner. Make the line thicker as you get towards the outer corner of your eye. Consider finishing off with a slight flick.


Exaggerate this effect with a cat eye for a bold look that pairs well with square glasses.

, The general rule is that the thicker your glasses are, the thicker your eyeliner should be. Start on the inner corner of your eye, and finish on the outer. Black will offer the most contrast, and really make your eyes pop. This will also help if you are near-sighted and unhappy with how your glasses make your eyes look smaller


If you have really chunky frames, consider applying some dark brown/espresso eyeshadow on your lower lashes. Apply it with an eyeliner brush, and make it meet the top line with a slight V shape.
Even with thick eyeliner, avoid a smoky look, which can look sloppy through your glasses lens. Keep everything neat and well-defined.

, If you plan to put on mascara, it's best to curl your eyelashes first. Without curling, your eyelashes may brush up against your lenses, smearing them with mascara.


If you skip this step, use little to no mascara.

, The thicker your frames are, the heavier your lashes should be. Lower your lids, and bring the mascara wand as close to the base of your lashes as possible. Slowly bring the wand upward. Most people find that it is easiest to start in the center of your lash line, and then to do the sides.


Use smooth, upward strokes for thin frames. This also works for tortoise shell frames.Use a zigzag or side-to-side motion for chunky frames., You don't have to go out and wax them, but you want to make sure that they look nice. Eyeglasses draw attention to your eyes, after all. Tweeze out any stray hairs, then comb your brows upward towards the arch using a brow brush.

, Try to match your natural eyebrow color as best you can. Define your brows with short strokes of the eyebrow pencil. Brush straight up to blend the color into your eyebrows.


If you have really light-colored eyebrows, consider going one or two shades darker.
If you have black eyebrows, use a very dark brown or charcoal color, never black.
Tone down the eyebrow makeup if you have really thick or chunky frames., Make sure your makeup is dry to the touch so your glasses don't smear it. This is particularly important with mascara.

If you know you’ll be spending time outdoors in the bright sunshine, bump up your protection to an SPF of 50.It’s important to remember that even if you aren’t in direct sunlight or getting a sunburn, you are still receiving radiation from the sun. Don’t wait until you have a blistering sunburn or premature wrinkles to start slathering up!


There are sunscreens on the market that boast SPFs of up to and even over 100. However, SPFs above 50 offer minimal benefits.;
, Don't forget your ears and neck! Use a generous amount, about half of a teaspoon, and apply more if you don’t feel fully covered. This is the most important product you’ll use on your face, so don’t skimp. Use a mirror to make sure you don’t miss any spots.


Experiment with different types of sunscreens from the drug store or even your local beauty supply store. While some may feel heavy and thick on your skin, there are also lightweight lotions and serums on the market that are perfect for makeup wearers., It may feel like more product than you’re used to applying to your face, but keep patting!By patting the sunscreen into your skin, rather than rubbing it, you will avoid irritating your skin. It will also ensure that your sunscreen is applied evenly over your face.Give your sunscreen three to five minutes to soak in fully before beginning your makeup routine.If you want to use a tinted SPF, layer it on top of a normal sunscreen. Cosmetic products with sun protection aren’t as effective as products geared solely toward sun protection. Use a tinted SPF product as extra protection, rather than your sole protection.

, Trade in your powder foundation for a liquid or cream foundation. This will blend most naturally with the texture of the sunscreen and prevent you from getting the dreaded “cakey” appearance.You can use a liquid bronzer and blush for a full, sun-kissed look– without the sun damage! Apply your eye makeup as you normally would.


If you have to find new makeup products that you work better with your sunscreen, make the sacrifice. It’s a minor expense now, but you’ll be rewarded with taut, young-looking, and cancer-free skin as you age.
It's not recommended to mix your sunscreen with your makeup or moisturizer. It may save you some time, but there is always a risk that two products won't react well to each other. You can also dilute the sunscreen and reduce the amount of coverage you are getting., For sunscreen to work most effectively, you need to apply it straight to your bare skin. In other words, you need to apply it before your makeup. If you have a face of makeup on and are going out into the bright sun, you’ll need to remove your makeup, apply sunscreen, and then re-apply your makeup if you like.


This can be time-consuming and inconvenient, but it’s the only way your sunscreen will be fully effective. Take the time to apply your sunscreen properly now and avoid yourself the hassle of covering wrinkles and sunspots later.

, Most sunscreens on the market are chemical, which means that chemicals in their formula actually prevent sun from hitting the skin by absorbing the rays. Physical sunblock, however, works by creating a physical barrier between the skin and the sun.Because the makeup won’t allow your skin to absorb chemical sunscreen, it won’t be effective protection. Physical sunscreen can still work over your makeup to deflect the sun’s rays. Physical sunblocks come in powders, creams, and sprays, so choose whichever will be easiest for you to apply., Because your makeup is already applied, a spray sunblock will be your best bet to avoid ruining it. To apply it properly, close your eyes and hold your breath. Press down on the nozzle, and apply it by spraying back and forth over your entire face. Spray more than you think you need, because spray sunscreen don't cover quite as well as creams and lotions.Don't touch your face at all while the spray dries. If you touch it, you risk rubbing it off in spots and compromising the sun protection.
Another spray option is a makeup setting spray with SPF. Like the spray sunscreen, this shouldn't be used as your only form of sun protection, but it's great for touch-ups. Not only do makeup setting sprays with SPF protect your skin from the sun, they can actually mattify and moisturize your skin at the same time., This is another option that you can apply on top of makeup. Unlike sunscreen spray, however, you will need to touch your skin directly, which may or may not mess up your makeup. By dusting the powder over your entire face, you block the sun from reaching your skin. Additionally, the powder can even be applied to the hairline to ensure there are no gaps in protection., Physical sunscreen rubs off more easily than chemical sunscreen. Because it physically protects your skin from the sun, your face needs to be totally covered for it to work. Cream and powder sunscreens should be reapplied over your makeup every two hours, while mists and sprays should be reapplied every single hour."
