Wear talc-based cosmetics.,
Use talcum powder sparingly.,
Avoid using talcum powder on your underwear if you are a woman.,
Avoid breathing in any powder.,
Refrain from sprinkling talcum powder on your baby directly.,
Keep all powder in a child-safe container.",How to Use Talcum Powder Safely1," Talcum powder appears to safe for males to use for genital sweating and chafing. It has not been linked to any cancers of male genitalia.Talcum powder can keep you dry if you have issues with chafing or other friction irritation.


If you are a male using talcum powder on his genitals, do not use it before having sex with a woman. Talcum powder may be linked to ovarian cancer, and so you should make sure you are not exposing your partner to it. Wash the powder off before having sex or consider using an alternative product.;
, Little evidence shows negative side effects occurring when wearing cosmetics or makeups with talc in them. The FDA regulates the use of talc in cosmetics.Recent studies by the FDA have found no asbestos in talc cosmetic products.
Talc can be found in face powders, eye shadows, and blushes.

, If you use talcum powder on your body, use it sparingly. Don't cake it on your body in thick layers. Use it in products where an alternative isn't available, but use it with caution.


Make sure to shake out talcum powder in small doses. Don't shake a lot out at once because it can introduce talcum spores into the air. Inhaling talcum powder can cause respiratory distress.

, Talcum powder has been linked to ovarian cancer in women. The risk occurs when the powder enters the vagina and makes its way up to the ovaries. Research has reported mixed findings, but most medical professionals advise caution with the use of talcum powder on genitals.Prolonged exposure seems to be the greatest risk factor for ovarian cancer; therefore, if you are female, avoid using talc in underwear because it will be on the skin for a long period of time.Women should also refrain from putting talcum powder on sanitary napkins, diaphragms, condoms, or genitals.

, Talc can cause multiple health problems when breathed in, including respiratory problems. If you want to use it, try not to breathe it in.This may be difficult since talc can be a very fine powder. To keep from breathing it in, use small amounts.
Refrain from shaking the talc container vigorously. Be gentle and avoid spreading the talcum powder around and dispersing it in the air.
Inhaling significant amounts of talcum powder can cause a type of chemical pneumonia and is considered a medical emergency.

Then rub it onto your baby.Make sure you shake the powder out away from your baby’s face. The biggest concern for babies is negative side effects due to inhalation.

, If you keep talcum powder in your home, keep it safe from your children. You can store it somewhere out of reach with the top tightly secure.

Purchase an alum block.,
Wet face with cold water.,
Wet the alum block in cold water.,
Glide alum block across face.,
Evaluate your shave.,
Dry your alum block.",How to Use an Alum Block1," Alum blocks are becoming more common in the US. You can now find them at many drugstores and beauty supply stores. If you're not sure where to look, ask an employee.You can also purchase an alum block online. Typically, they cost around $20. Many people consider this a good investment, as an alum block can last for years.
Make sure to purchase a block that is pure alum. You do not want additional ingredients.;
, After you shave, you need to prepare to use the alum block. This means getting your face (or legs) wet. Splashing your face with cold water helps close pores and allows the block to easily glide over your face.


Alum blocks are most effective as a post-wet shave product.
Make sure to thoroughly rinse all of the soap or shaving cream from your face.

, This will further make it easier for the block to glide over your face. Simply run the stone back and forth under the faucet. Make sure the entire surface is wet.Some people like to soak the alum block in ice water before use. Beware: this can increase the tingling feeling you will feel during use.

, Rub the block onto the areas of your skin that you’ve shaved. You can also apply the block to other areas of your face or body. Remember, an alum block is known for its astringent qualities.You can expect to feel a little bit of tightness and perhaps some tingling. Don't worry, this is normal.
While most people just use alum block on the face, you can apply it elsewhere on your body. For example, you could rub it on your legs after shaving.

, If you’re new to shaving the block can be a good indicator of areas where you might want to improve your shaving technique. The alum block has a tingling or stinging feeling so areas where the stinging are high usually indicates that too much pressure is being applied in that area with the blade. Take care to be more gentle on those areas next time.Rinse off with cold water and pat face dry with towel.
Some people prefer to skip the rinse and just leave the alum on the face. You'll continue to feel the tightness for a few hours, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable.

, It is essential that you allow your alum block to dry completely before putting it away. Your block won't be effective anymore if you put it away wet.It can take several hours for your block to dry. Try leaving it on the counter to air dry while you are at work.

, A professional reflexologist is trained in giving reflexology to address a patient’s particular health concerns. You can also give reflexology treatments to yourself, which can save you money and allow you to do these treatments daily or with short notice.


You may want to combine self-treatments with professional treatments to maximize the benefits you’ll achieve.

, A reflexology treatment doesn’t need to take more than 10 or 20 minutes. But it will be more effective if you are able to relax during the treatment.


If you feel a migraine coming on, try some reflexology as soon as possible to reduce the intensity of the headache.
For example, it’s better if you’re not in a hurry.If you’re hungry, eat before your treatment. You don’t want to spend the entire treatment thinking about your stomach growling.

, Create a tranquil environment for yourself by sitting in a quiet room and turning down the lights. This should be a room where you will not be disturbed while you are giving yourself a reflexology treatment.


You might want to put on some calming music as well.

, Your treatment will be more comfortable if you are not poking your skin with long fingernails. Trim your fingernails before doing a treatment on yourself or on someone else., Use a comfortable chair or lie down so that you are able to relax. Take some deep breaths so that your body relaxes. Quiet your mind from stressful thoughts.

, Have a small glass of water before beginning the treatment. Some experts believe this will help the treatment be more effective., It can be complicated to remember which part of the hand or foot corresponds to which part of the body in reflexology. Having a chart handy will keep you on track to giving yourself the right treatment.

, There are certain tools that can be useful during a reflexology treatment. These include wooden or rubber rollers, wooden balls, and other items. These can be useful in rolling against the bottom of the foot, for example.Reflexology tools can be especially helpful for people whose fingers and hands are not strong enough to push hard on pressure points.

, The third eye point is located above the bridge of the nose between the eyebrows. Pressing this point can relieve headaches, as well as eye strain and ulcers.

, There are a number of points that curve over the ear on both sides of the head. These points must be activated together in order to be effective. They start at the top of the ear, about a finger-width above the ear. These points include:


Hairline Curve
Valley Lead
Celestial Hub
Floating White
Head Portal Yin

, There is a spot behind each ear bone where the neck muscles meet the skull. Pressing these points will relieve migraines, along with low energy, eye fatigue and cold and flu symptoms., One spot on your foot will help treat pain that occurs in the temporal area of your head (along the sides or temples of the head). This spot is located between your big toe and your second toe on the inside of your big toe.If you have pain on the right side of your head, you’ll want to use the spot on your left foot. Similarly, use the spot on the right foot to treat pain that centers on the left side of your head.

, The Four Gates points, which include the Tai Chong on the foot and the He Gu on the hand, are commonly used to treat headaches.Tai Chong: This point is located on top of the foot. Locate the webbing between the big toe and the second toe. Then follow the bones of these two toes along the top of your foot. Find where these bones intersect. Then move back toward your toes about one thumb-width. There is a depression here, which is the Tai Chong point.
He Gu: This point is located on top of your hand. Find the webbing between your thumb and index finger. Press your thumb and index finger together so that the muscle in between bulges up. This point is located at the top of this muscle bulge.

, Feel for the bones of your pinky toe and next toe. These bones intersect on the top of your foot. The Zu Ling Qi point is just above where these bones meet. There is a depression here., There is a point on the top of your big toe that can treat pain in your face. The entire top of the big toe, from the base of the toenail to where the toe connects to the foot, is the pressure point area for treating facial migraine pain., Your migraine may be most intense on one side of your head or across your forehead. Start your self-treatment by applying pressure to the corresponding reflexology point that will address this most painful part.

, Pressure points on the left foot or hand can treat conditions that occur on the right side of your body. Energy meridians cross over your neck, which is especially important when you are treating pain above this point (pain in your head). The energy will initiate in one side of your body and it will flow up through your neck to the opposite side of your body.If you only have pain on one side of your head, then you only need to do reflexology on the opposite foot or hand.

, When you are accessing the energy points, you need to press hard enough to stimulate the point. You should not feel pain, however.

, Keep in mind that if certain parts of your body need healing, some of the pressure points may be tender or sensitive. If you have a tender spot, keep working this area. Try a more gentle approach but keep some pressure on the spot.Breathe through the sensitivity or discomfort. Use gentle pressure but keep working this point.If the point is painful, then ease up and work on it later.

, Use a circular rubbing motion to work the pressure point. Press for about 7 seconds and release the pressure. Then press again for another 7 seconds. , Find the He Gu point between your thumb and index finger. If your headache pain is on the left side of your head, press this point on your right hand with your left thumb. Keep your right hand still. Relax the rest of your left hand while your thumb rocks back and forth slowly on this point. Each rocking motion should last about 4 seconds.Try 3 sets of five rocking massages on this area of your hand.
Try this method every day to help prevent or lessen migraine symptoms.

, Even though you may have pain only in one side of your head, you should work points on both hands and/or feet. This will ensure that your energy will be balanced throughout your body., Reflexology can be very powerful and you may experience some negative effects if you have a longer treatment. Reflexology releases toxins from your body, which can manifest in your body as nausea, light-headedness or dizziness. You may experience these if you overdo your treatment.If you are elderly or in delicate health, you should aim for a shorter treatment of about 10 minutes.

, It is always advisable to drink plenty of water after a reflexology session. It is even more important to do so when you have concentrated on your liver reflex. Extra water will help flush out the liver.

, Allow yourself to rest quietly when you have finished your session. If possible, try to take a short nap.

, Reflexology is the application of pressure to certain points on the hands and feet that correspond to areas of the body. There are a number of theories about how pressure on these points can relieve pain and discomfort. Some experts believe that reflexology disrupts pain messages from the brain and central nervous system.This technique also allows the body to relieve tension, which can reduce pain.

, Reflexology doesn’t “heal” your body. Instead, it’s a technique that helps your body repair itself. Energy is moved through the body. Maintaining a positive attitude towards reflexology can help improve your condition as well.

, According to reflexology, energy flows in the body along energy meridians. You may be able to feel this movement of energy as pressure points are activated.

, Reflexology is useful for bringing the body back into alignment through relaxation and tension release. These things will help relieve the body of excess stress, which can exacerbate physical conditions. , Many clinical studies have observed the positive impact that reflexology has on the body. Reflexology has been shown to make a positive contribution to the following:Improvement of symptoms (such as improved kidney functioning)
Relaxation for patients (such as reduced anxiety and lowered blood pressure)
Reduction in pain (such as osteoarthritis pain and pain from kidney stones)
In one study, about two-thirds of patients reported significant migraine relief after undergoing three months of reflexology treatments. Nineteen percent of these patients stopped taking headache medication altogether.Reflexology has also been shown to reduce symptoms associated with cancer treatments, diabetes, post-operative symptoms, and many other medical conditions.

, Keep track of the activities and other factors that lead up to the time you get a headache. This will help you identify some of the things that might trigger your migraines.Count up the frequency and duration of your migraines. Most migraines last for a few hours. Severe migraines can last for several days. Migraines may happen frequently, such as every few days, or they may happen a couple of times per month. Other people get migraines just once a year.
Also track the severity of your headaches. Do you get more severe headaches after you eat chocolate, for example? Do your headaches last longer if you have been really stressed out?

, One of the most common migraine triggers is emotional stress. This might come in the form of anxiety, worry, excitement, and other emotions. When you have these stressful feelings, your muscles may become tenser and your blood vessels may dilate. This can cause more severe migraines., Having too much coffee, chocolate, or other foods that contain caffeine can increase the possibility of getting a migraine.

, Many people have sensitivities to certain preservatives and additives used in foods. These include monosodium glutamate (MSG), nitrates (used in preserved meats, for example), alcohol, and aged cheeses.

, Weather changes, especially when the air pressure changes, can have an effect on a person’s migraine likelihood. When a storm is moving in, for example, you might start to feel tension in your head.

, Women are more likely than men to suffer from migraines. Many women get migraines just before or during their period. Track the occurrence of migraines alongside your menstrual cycle to identify if you are more prone to getting migraines at certain times of the month.

, Certain medical ailments may increase the risk for migraines. Some medical conditions that may contribute to migraines include:Asthma
Chronic fatigue syndrome
Hypertension
Stroke
Sleep disorder

, Serious migraines, though rare, can affect you more intensely than regular migraines.Some of these might include:


Hemiplegic migraine: You may experience temporary paralysis or nerve changes with this headache. You should check with your doctor to make sure this is not a stroke, since some of the symptoms can be similar.
Retinal migraine: You may experience loss of vision in one eye and a headache that starts behind your eyes.
Basilar artery migraine: You might experience dizziness or confusion and pain in the back of your head. You may also experience vomiting, ringing in the ears, or an inability to speak properly. Experts attribute this type of migraine to hormonal changes.
Status migrainosus: This migraine is usually so severe that people end up going to the hospital. This migraine is often caused by certain types of medications.
Ophthalmoplegic migraine: You may experience pain in your eye, double vision, droopy eyelid, or muscular paralysis around the eye. This is a very serious condition that requires immediate attention.

Try cornstarch or tapioca starch.,
Try other types of powders.,
Add some powdered herbs.,
Make your own powder.",How to Use Talcum Powder Safely2," Cornstarch and tapioca starch are possible alternatives for talcum powder. They help absorb moisture and protect against chafing. Cornstarch and tapioca starch are both readily available in supermarkets. Many brands even sell safer cornstarch-based baby and body powders.


Cornstarch and tapioca starch can serve as “food” for skin bacteria and yeast, especially Candida. If you or your baby have a yeast rash, refrain from using this alternative because it can make a yeast infection worse.These yeast rashes tend to show up in the folds between the thighs and the groin.
If you are concerned about talc-based makeup, you can even face powder, eye shadows, and blushes made with cornstarch.

, If you don’t want to use cornstarch, try a different kind of powder. You can also use certain kinds of flour as a talcum powder alternative.Rice powder and chickpea powder will absorb moisture and help keep you dry. They are good alternatives to cornstarch or talc.
Try corn flour or oat flour. They also work well to absorb moisture.
You can find these flours and powders at the grocery store. Make sure you keep them in airtight containers so they stay fresh.

, If you are using an alternative powder, add some powdered herbs such as lavender, rose petals, and chamomile flowers. These herbs can help deodorize and soothe the skin.Make sure to grind the herbs into a fine powder. You can use a coffee or spice grinder. Before using, sift the ground herbs to separate any larger pieces.

, You can combine any of these alternatives and make your own powder. Additionally, you can use use arrowroot powder and white kaolin clay powder for the base instead.Use equal amounts of arrowroot and kaolin clay. Add three drops of lavender essential oil for every four tablespoons of the arrowroot and clay mixture and mix well.
You can substitute any of the talc alternatives listed for either the arrowroot or the clay. For example, try mixing ½ cup of rice powder with ½ cup of oat flour.
You can substitute dried herbs for the essential oil if you have a young baby or your baby has sensitive skin.

Learn talcum powder’s connection to ovarian cancer.,
Know the risks of talcum powder on babies.,
Understand the connection between talc and asbestos.",How to Use Talcum Powder Safely3," A recent study concluded that while rare, the frequent use of talc around a woman’s genital area can be associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer by about 20-30%.An opinion prepared for a civil lawsuit concluded the same.Overall, the use of talc is a smaller risk for ovarian cancer as compared to obesity, the use of hormone replacement therapy, and family history, but is does appear to be real.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer, a division of the World Health Organization, has talc listed as a possible carcinogen., Talcum powder is found in many baby powders and may pose a risk for your baby. The main danger for children is inhalation of the talcum powder dust, which can cause problems. Infants are especially at risk.Inhaling talcum powder may cause coughing, eye and throat irritation, difficulty breathing, wheezing, shallow breaths, chest pain, lung failure, diarrhea, vomiting, and even urinary or circulatory problems. In severe cases, comas or fever may occur.
You can buy talc-free baby powders, use an alternative, or skip the powder all together and use creams or ointments.

, Decades ago, some talc products also contained asbestos, a known carcinogen. Today, products sold in the US and in many other parts of the world are not allowed to include asbestos as an ingredient and are tested to determine if asbestos is a contaminant.Since the 1960’s, there have been concerns that asbestos-contaminated talcum powder may be associated with cancer, particularly ovarian cancer in women who used talc around the genital area.
Recently, a study was conducted by the FDA to survey “currently marketed cosmetic-grade raw material talc, as well as some cosmetic products containing talc” for contamination with asbestos.The study ran for a year, and the results found no talc products contaminated with asbestos.
The FDA, however, was only able to test four separate talc suppliers, and a larger number of personal care products. The results were considered informative but not definitive.

Drink the juice plain.,

Create an acai popsicle.,
Marinate chicken or pork with acai juice.,
Make a glaze to use with ham.,
Use acai juice to make a salad dressing.,
Add a splash of acai juice to fruit-based desserts.",How to Use Acai Juice," There is not enough scientific evidence to determine how much acai juice makes a helpful, safe dosage, but it is recommended that you start small. Straight acai juice can upset stomachs that are not used to it. Measure 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of acai juice into a small glass. Consume 1 ounce of acai juice once a day for three to four days. If you do not notice any negative side effects, increase the amount to 6 tablespoons (90 milliliters) each serving, limiting yourself to one or two servings per day.;
, Diluting the acai juice can make it easier on your taste buds and on your stomach. Mix 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) of chilled acai juice into 8 ounces (250 milliliters) of cold water. Drink the mixture immediately to prevent it from separating. You can gradually add more acai juice, up to 6 tablespoons (90 milliliters), depending on your taste preferences.

, Acai juice tastes especially good with other berry juices. Mix 2 teaspoons to 6 tablespoons (10 to 90 milliliters) of acai juice into an 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glass of mixed berry juice, blackberry juice, or blueberry juice. Acai also tastes great when mixed into pomegranate juice or mango juice.

, While the acai juice won't make your soda any healthier, you will still receive the benefits of acai juice by mixing the two. Add 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) of acai juice to a standard cola. Standard colas work better than lemon-lime sodas or other flavored drinks. The strong flavor of the cola can mask the taste of the acai if you do not care for it, and the acai will add a hint of berry taste to the cola to create greater depth of flavor.

, Milk absorbs other flavors remarkably well, and the chocolate undertones of the acai berry make it a healthier substitution for chocolate milk. Adding 2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons (10 to 30 milliliters) of acai juice can really create a strong flavor. If you cannot drink milk or choose to stay away from dairy for diet or health reasons, you can also add the same amount of acai juice to soy milk or almond milk.

, The potency of acai juice can compete with the strong taste of coffee, so you only need to add about 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) to get a strong effect. The berry flavor creates a unique coffee experience, while the chocolate undertones make the taste just familiar enough to work with coffee. Acai juice is also a healthier choice than standard cream and sugar.

, Just 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of acai juice in an 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glass of your favorite tea can completely transform your beverage. You can mix acai juice into black or green tea, much like you would mix in raspberry or lemon. Acai juice goes especially well with white tea and fruity herbal teas, however, especially those that are blueberry, strawberry, or mango flavored.

, Try blending together 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of acai juice with 1 cup (250 milliliters) of milk, 1 banana, 1/4 cup (56.7 grams) of frozen strawberries, 1 tablespoon (14.15 grams) of butter, and four or five ice cubes. You could also simply add 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 milliliters) of acai juice to your favorite smoothie recipe, especially if the smoothie has a banana, apple, or pear base and uses other berries like blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries.


Alternatively, you can blend 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of the juice with vanilla or chocolate ice cream to create a simple acai shake.

, Instead of reaching for the caramel or chocolate syrup, pour 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon (milliliters) of acai juice over plain vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry ice cream to add a boost of nutrition an otherwise unhealthy treat.

, Simply pour the acai juice into a popsicle mold and freeze until it hardens to create an easy, healthy treat to enjoy during hot weather. A popsicle made with nothing but acai juice may be a bit potent for some tastes, however, so you can also dilute 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of juice with equal parts water or mix in another juice, like orange, grape, or mango, before freezing.

, Acai juice is not acidic enough on its own to break down meats, so you may need to mix 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of acai juice with about 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of lime juice or apple cider vinegar, along with 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of olive oil. You can add other spices and seasonings, or you can leave the marinade as is since the acai juice will thoroughly flavor the meat. Acai-based marinades work best with pork and chicken.

, Ham is one meat that tastes notably good with a glaze. While glazes made of pineapple and orange tend to be the most popular, an acai glaze packs a nutritious punch while bestowing a truly unique flavor to the ham. Mix 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of acai juice with 1 cup (225 grams) of brown sugar. Spread the mixture over the ham and bake it in the oven as you usually would.

, Create a simple vinaigrette 2/3 cup olive oil (167 milliliters) with 1/3 cup (83 milliliters) red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of acai juice and a pinch of salt and pepper to transform your dressing into an acai berry vinaigrette. Drizzle the dressing over a simple loose-leaf salad.

, When preparing the filling for a blueberry pie, strawberry shortcake, or peach cobbler, mix in 2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon (10 to 15 milliliters) of acai juice. The juice will not affect the consistency much, but it will add a little extra complexity to the flavor as well as added nutrition.

Acknowledgments:We would like to express gratitude to our teachers Dr. Mukund Baheti M.D.,
Author: Dr.Deepak Vyas M.D.",How to Understand the Correlation Between Vata Dosha and Nitric Oxide," In this way, Vata Dosha may become better understood.;
, Out of Tridosha Vata is more critical because it governs the other two Dosha i.e. Pitta & Kapha in order to perform various physiological functions .Vata word is derived from the Sanskrit root word “va gati gandhanayoh” that means Speed /movement (gati) , knowledge (Gyan) & Acknowledge (Prapti) Panini. It is psychic nature Rajasic . In Ayurveda there are so many characteristics of Vata Dosha are described like dry, cold, light, penetrating, mobile, transparent, rough, and responsible for all the types of movement at macro cellular & micro-cellular level. According to Acharya Sharangdhar without other Dosha (Pitta & Kapha), Dhatu & Mala becomes paralysed like in external nature the air is responsible for the movement of cloud .It is present in all over the body but at gross level it is present below the umbilicus. The major site of Vata Dosha is colon, lower back, calf muscle, ear, bones, and joints out of these colon is the main site of Vata Dosha . the vata Dosha is present all over the body it single & very minute .for easy to understand it is divided in to five sub types on the basis of their residing site & function i.e. Prana ,Udana, Saman ,Vyana & Apana . It is very important Dosha in body because it performs much important function in our body like inspiration, expiration, movement at gross, organic, cellular & at microcellular level, movement of Dhatu, it is formed by the combination of Akash & Vayu Mahabhuta .

, It is gaseous in state; it is highly defuse-able, inorganic, radical gas & has been known for many years as a harmful pollutant in car, exhaustive fumes, fossil fumes & cigarette smoke. It binds cytochrome oxidizes the terminal enzyme in mitochondrial electron transport chain. It is the biological mediator. It controls large number of functions in human body. It plays important role in the formation of memory, coordination between neuronal activity & blood flow and in the modulation of pain .in peripheral nervous system it mediates some form of neurological vasodilation & regulates certain gastrointestinal, respiratory & genitourinary function. NO is synthesized from the amino acid L- arginine by the enzyme termed NO syntheses (NOS) .In central nervous system it acts as a neuromediator with many physiological functions, in involves formation of memory , coordination between neuronal activity & blood flow ,& modulation of pain .In peripheral nervous system it performs neurological vasodilation & regulates certain gastrointestinal , respiratory & genitourinary functions. It play an important role in immune physiology also ,it is generated in large amount during host defence & immunological reactions. It also play an important roles in penile erection ,bladder control ,lungs ventilation ,peristalsis .no is not stored at any part of body it diffuses freely to its site of action where it binds to its effectors . In human body its half life is only about 3-5 seconds.

, “Avyakto Vyakta karma ch.” It is also true for nitric oxide also. The action of Vata Dosha is quick & only when required i.e. “Ashukari muhuchari.........” the biological system half life of nitric oxide is about only 3 – 5 sec. The working area of both vata & Nitric oxide is whole body.As per Acharya shusrut, Vata Dosha is responsible for all the types of pain vatadrute nasty ruja ........... & nitric oxide is also responsible for modulations of pain .Like Vata Dosha nitric oxide play an important role in bladder control, peristalsis & lungs vasodilation & in control of blood pressure.

, So it is possible to correlate Vata Dosha with nitric oxide

Use turmeric for just about everything.,
Try fenugreek seeds as an all-over remedy.,
Eat more ginger for heart and digestive health.,
Include fennel seeds in your diet for your heart and stomach, too.,
Go for garlic.,
Use cardamom, thyme or anise for an expectorant.,
Use sesame and oregano to fight blood pressure.,
Try more chili or cayenne pepper for an energy boost.,
Go for more cumin for your blood and brain.,
Use more sage for your memory.,
Garnish everything with cinnamon.,
Use more saffron and rosemary.",How to Use Spices to Boost Your Health," This spice contains a yellow compound called curcumin that is enriched with antioxidant properties. It makes turmeric versatile and indispensable as each and every organ in the body benefits from this compound. Because of these properties (that are also anti-microbial), it speeds up the healing of wounds and gets your body on track.Turmeric milk or tea can provide relief from cough and colds, arthritis and dental problems. It also powerful in preventing and treating liver and stomach related ailments, and shields the body against cancer and tumors. What's not to like?
It doesn't stop there. Turmeric is consumed on a daily basis in India and is also included in almost every dish. Scientists believe it is the reason why Alzheimer’s affects less than 25% of people in India than that in the US. It has brain-boosting powers too!
There's still more. Turmeric is one spice which is an excellent hormone regulator and can help you avoid succumbing to your food cravings for sugar and carbohydrates. In other words, it'll help prevent weight gain.;
, These are enriched with vitamin C, fiber, potassium, protein, iron, niacin and alkaloids. Sounds powerful, huh? With all these nutrients, these seeds have the ability to reduce LDL cholesterol levels, can aid in reducing the risk of heart attack and other heart related diseases, and even enhance milk production in nursing/lactating mothers owing to the presence of diosgenin.They can also help you lose weight by suppressing appetite, treating indigestion and constipation, and slow down the rate at which sugars are absorbed (this helps diabetes, too). The components saponins and mucilage present in fenugreek prevent and can also flush out any build up of toxins in the body
Let's not forget that the presence of mucilage ensures the seeds provide relief from fever, cough, heart burn and sore throat, too.

, This is an excellent solution for inflammation. It enhances absorption of food by assisting the quick movement of food from the stomach into the small intestine and is a potent blood thinner. This makes it a natural and effective way to prevent strokes because it is equipped to prevent the formation of blood clots.


It also contributes to lowering triglyceride levels, aiding in lower cholesterol and blood pressure.
Zingerone, a powerful antioxidant found in ginger, has very potent brain shielding/protecting properties, too. It's good for your blood and brain.

, The nitrites and nitrates present in fennel seeds enable the blood vessels to relax, thus improving the efficacy of cardiovascular system, and giving your heart a little break. They are also effective in treating stomach related problems, as they are an excellent solution for keeping the gastrointestinal tract clean and clear.


Because of their digestive powers, they are effective in reducing colic in babies and infants. Moms too can find relief from menstrual cramps as those same digestive powers work well with stomach pain.

, Fluctuating and unstable blood pressure and high cholesterol can prove very lethal to the health and functioning of the brain. Thank mother nature, because garlic is potent enough to keep a check on both blood pressure and cholesterol. The wonderful properties of garlic prevent or slow down the aging of the brain, too.The sulfur compounds and plenty of antioxidants present in garlic act responsibly to preserve the health and condition of the brain. It is highly effective in eliminating the cancer cells in the brain as well.
2 to 3 pods every day will do a wonderful job of controlling your blood pressure levels and also treating any problems related to blood pressure -- the natural way.

, Battling a cough? These two spices are the way to go. Cardamom is good for keeping blood pressure under control, can break down the blood clots, and can be effective for clearing the phlegm.Thyme is good for coughs, too.Anise, on the other hand, is effective in treating bronchial symptoms, coughs with phlegm, and also helps to clear congestion in the respiratory tract.

, Oregano consists of compounds such as thymol and carvacrol that are highly effective in fighting the fluctuations in blood pressure. To be specific, oregano is very good in reducing the irregularities in systolic, diastolic and arterial blood pressures.


The ingredients sesaminol and sesamin in sesame have the power to reduce inflammation in the arterial walls. This means your blood flows easier and blood pressure can be controlled and lessened.

, These are spices you definitely want more of you're looking to lose weight. They boost the body's metabolism thus ensuring that excess and redundant body fat gets burnt. The ability of capsaicin (an element of both) to burn the fat helps the body control its LDL (bad) cholesterol, too.Capsaicin can also reduce the risks posed by ulcers by preparing the stomach cells to counter/resist any ulcer inducing bacteria.
Coriander and black pepper has similar metabolism-boosting powers to chili.

, Cumin seeds are rich in thymol, an enzyme that boosts the digestive system in the body, has extraordinary fiber content and amazing laxative properties that can be a cure for constipation. There is also a component called cuminaldehyde present in cumin that can fight cancer and tumors.Cumin is also great for maintaining memory and mental faculties owing to the presence of minerals such as vitamin B6, riboflavin, niacin and zea-xanthin.
Consumption of cumin seeds is the most natural way to cure anemia as cumin seeds are rich in iron, too. They are also rich in potassium which is capable of promoting the flow of fluids in the body, helping to maintain blood pressure., Sage is a spice that is rich in memory enriching compounds called phenols. These phenols prevent or slow down the aging of the brain by breaking down the chemicals that normally lead to aging, preventing them from having any effect.Sage is also effective in controlling the initial symptoms of Alzheimer’s by preventing destruction and exhaustion of the brain chemical acetylcholine which is involved in preserving the normal memory functions of the brain.

, Why? It's practically a wonder spice. It can boost the memory immediately! Include cinnamon in your diet before you go to study or take a test. It can help with weight loss, too.How does it do it? Cinnamon does a great job of stabilizing the sugar and glucose levels in the body. When this spice is combined with a food rich in carbohydrates it ensures that the brain gets a steady dose of glucose instead of the glucose-bombardment carbs normally provide.
Consuming about ½ teaspoon of cinnamon daily can reduce your cholesterol and triglyceride levels by up to 30%.This is a near-to substitute for sugar and can be used in drinks, cereals, desserts and muffins.

, A small amount (as low as 1/10th teaspoon) of saffron daily is enough to keep you away from depression. This spice offers stiff resistance to depression by aiding the brain in the production of serotonin which is known to act as a natural mood booster.


Rosemary should also be taken in moderation. Carnosic acid, a substance found in rosemary, has been found to protect the brain from any damage that might be caused by free radicals. This protection means the risk of Alzheimer’s, stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases can be kept at bay. It is also highly effective in improving concentration and memory when used in aromatherapy.

Determine if you have been at risk.,
Identify the symptoms.,
Get blood and spinal tests.",How to Treat Powassan Disease1," You may be worried about whether or not you are at risk. Powassan virus is spread through bites from infected ticks. The areas of known cases include the northeastern and Great Lakes regions of the US. You are at risk if you have been bitten by a tick in one of these areas.Ticks are most active during the spring, summer, and fall. You are at the greatest risk in wooded or brushy areas.;
, Often, Powassan virus does not present any symptoms. The symptoms that are associated with the virus include neurological problems, like memory problems, lack of coordination, confusion, problems speaking, and seizures.You also may experience vomiting, fever, headache, a stiff neck, or muscle and joint aches.

, If you think you have Powassan virus, go to the doctor. They will do a physical exam and talk to you about your symptoms and recent travel and outdoor activity. If they suspect Powassan virus, they will take blood and spinal fluid samples. Then they will test these samples for antibodies consistent with the virus.It may take up to two weeks to get the results.

Avoid known triggers.,
Use antihistamines.,
Treat the hives with creams or cold presses.,
Be gentle with your skin during a breakout.,
Diagnose vibration hives.",How to Treat Vibration Induced Hives1," One of the easiest ways to treat vibration hives is to avoid things that cause a breakout. Once you determine what causes hives to appear, make a note of it so you can try to stay away from it in the future.This might mean changing your routines. If you get vibration hives from playing the drums or trumpet, you may have to stop that activity.
You may also have to get other people to do certain things for you, like mowing the grass.;
, Antihistamines may be an effective treatment against vibration hives. Over-the-counter medicines like Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, Claritin, Allegra, and Zyrtec may be helpful.Depending on the severity of your reaction, your doctor may prescribe prescription antihistamines.
Your doctor may recommend you to take antihistamines regularly to help prevent hives if they are reoccurring. You may also take antihistamines if you know you are going to do an activity that will lead to vibration hives.
Some antihistamines may not work if the hives are delayed., Depending on the kinds of hives you have, you may be able to apply a topical treatment. These treatments are aimed at stopping itching or painful symptoms.Try an anti-itch cream or salve. You may also place a cold compress on the affected area.

, Since breakouts can be painful, itchy, or uncomfortable, you can learn how to ease some of that while you are facing a breakout. Treat your skin gently when you are experiencing a breakout. Refrain from touching it roughly, aggravating it, or scratching it too much.Use warm water instead of hot if you take a shower.
Wash with mild soaps. If possible, avoid soaps for as long as possible.
Wear loose clothing over the affected areas.

, If you believe you have vibration hives, you can see an allergist to diagnose the condition. The doctor will do some tests to the skin to see how it responds to vibration stimuli.The doctor may place a vibrating device against your skin to see how it responds. If your skin breaks out in hives, it’s a positive diagnosis.
Your doctor may advise you to combine treatments or use preventative treatments to manage the hives.
Talk to your doctor about the severity of your vibration-induced hives. Some urticaria causes severe symptoms, like breathing problems, swollen throats, light-headedness, and even loss of consciousness. If you react this way, talk to your doctor about getting an EpiPen."

Sign up with a personal trainer.,
Do all exercises with proper posture.,
Choose the right theraband.,
Find a stationary point from which to secure your theraband.,
Go slow with your resistance bands.,
Do overhead extensions.,
Incorporate chest presses.,
Combine side planks with a pull down.,
Do the side step shuffle.,
Incorporate knee raises.,
Do a combination of a bridge with a kick.",How to Use a Theraband," Although resistance band workouts are becoming more popular in gyms and fitness classes, therabands can be tricky to figure out how to use. Sign up for a session with a personal trainer. Not only will she be able to teach you how to use resistance bands, she will also be able to tell you what types of exercises to do with them.


Find a personal trainer at your local gym. Generally the first consult is free — especially when you first sign up for your gym membership.
You may also be able to find some good videos online on how to use resistance bands and what types of exercises to do.;
, Proper position is essential to help make sure that you do not injure yourself and get the most benefit out of your exercises.


You will need to ensure you can stand with your back straight, shoulders and hips aligned and stomach muscles engaged. However, this will vary depending on what type of exercise you're doing.You may want to start doing some of your exercises in front of a mirror to help you see whether or not you have the appropriate posture in your exercises. It might also be helpful to stand with your back against a wall as you assume the proper posture.

, Resistance bands come in a variety of resistance levels. You can adjust the resistance as needed.Therabands, in particular, are coded according to their color, working from beginning to advanced use in the following order: tan, yellow, red, green, blue, black, silver, and gold.Other systems also color code their bands based on resistance level.
It's typically advised to start with thinner bands or those with the least resistance. As you get stronger or heal from an injury, you can advance to a higher resistance level.

, When you're doing exercises with resistance bands, many will require that you secure one end of the band to a secure and stationary object.


You can buy anchor points for walls, or you can use square knots to secure the bands to door handles or heavy machinery. Make sure it is not a movable structure.Also, objects need to be heavy and sturdy enough to resist the exercise. Tables, cabinets, or chairs are not appropriate objects to use.

, Use slow, steady movements whenever you use the theraband. This will help ensure you're staying in preparer alignment and isolates the muscles you're targeting.It is the quality of the movement, rather than the quickness with which it is performed, that counts here. Make sure you resist the urge to move quickly upon the return movement, because this works different muscles than the movement away from your body.
Also rest for about a minute between each type of exercise.For example, rest after working your triceps and before you start working your chest.

, This exercise tones your shoulders and your triceps.To do this exercise:


Anchor the center of band in doorjamb or tie to a sturdy object at chest level.
Kneel down on one knee with the other knee bent in front of you. Face away from the door or object. Hold one end of the band in each hand.
Extend your arms over your head making sure your palms are facing each other. Keep your elbows facing up toward the ceiling and away from your face. Bend your arms and lower your hands down behind your head.

, This exercise helps to target your chest and biceps.To do this exercise:


Anchor the center of your band in doorjamb or tie to a sturdy object at chest level. Stand with your back facing the anchored part of your band.
Hold one end of the band in each hand. Bend your arms at a 90 degree angle at your elbows. Keep your fists in front of your chest.
Step forward a bit until you feel resistance in the band. Then position your legs into a small lunge while leaning forward slightly (one leg in front of the other).
Press both of your hands forward in a straight line until they are fully extended. Then slowly release until your arms are in the starting position.

, This is a combination exercise that works a large variety of your upper body muscles including abs, shoulders, triceps and back.To do this exercise:


Anchor the center of your band in doorjamb or tie against a heavy object at chest level. Hold both ends of the bands in one hand (you will switch sides eventually).
Get down into side plank position. Place your forearm on the floor with a 90 degree angle at your elbow. Try to keep your elbow in line with your shoulder.
Lie on the floor so that the top of your head is facing toward the door. Extend the arm holding the ends of the bands towards the ceiling with your palms facing down toward your feet. Slowly pull your arm down to your hip while keep it straight.
Flip sides by rolling over and holding the side plank on the other side and switching the ends of the bands to your other hand.

, This particular exercise targets your legs, but specifically your inner and outer thighs and glutes.To do this exercise:


Tie your resistance band together in a loop or use an adapter to connect the ends together.
Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart with your resistance band down around your ankles.
With your knees bent slightly step one leg out far enough away that you feel resistance in your thighs.
Follow this step with your other leg. Take a few steps in one direction and then switch directions to work both of your legs. Make sure to keep hips square; don't cheat by twisting from the hips.

, This exercise works the front of your legs, thighs and abs.Start by:


Tie your resistance band together in a loop or use an adapter to connect the ends together.
Place one end of your looped resistance band under one foot and loop the other end of the resistance band over the top of your other foot.
Lift the foot with the resistance band on top of your foot off the ground. Keeping your foot flexed, raise your knee up to hip level. Make sure to keep the resistance band looped across the top of your raised food.
Pause at the top and then slower lower your leg back down to the starting position. Switch legs after one set.

, This exercise targets your entire leg — your butt and thighs. In addition it uses your shoulder muscles.To do this exercise:


Lie on your back face up. Bend your knees at a 90 degree angle and keep your feet flexed.
Loop the middle of the band around the bottom of one of your feet foot and hold the ends of the band with your arms bent.
Lift your hips off the floor into the typical bridge position, pushing your pelvis up towards the ceiling. Kick out your leg keeping your knees aligned while at the same time pulling your arms up over your head.
Slowly bring your arms and knees back to their starting position.

Go to the hospital.,
Get a shot of tetanus antitoxin.,
Be prepared to take antibiotics.,
Expect to be given muscle relaxers or sedatives.,
Prepare for supportive care.,
Ask your doctor about other potentially helpful medications.,
Get vaccinated.,
Quickly treat wounds.,
Wear appropriate footwear.",How to Treat Tetanus," In addition to stiffness and spasms in the neck and jaw muscles, tetanus also causes abdominal and spinal tightness/cramping, widespread muscle twitching, difficulty swallowing, fever, sweating and rapid heart rate.If you have symptoms of tetanus, you will need to be treated in a hospital — it is a serious infection that cannot be treated at home.


Tetanus symptoms can appear anytime from a few days to several weeks after the bacteria enter your body — often through a puncture wound of the foot, such as stepping on a contaminated nail.
The doctor will rely on a physical exam, as well as a medical and immunization history, to diagnose tetanus. No lab or blood tests are helpful to detect tetanus.
Diseases that cause similar symptoms to tetanus that your doctor will want to rule out include meningitis, rabies and strychnine poisoning.The medical staff will need to clean the wound as well, removing any debris, dead tissue, and foreign objects.;
, Depending on the time between your injury and when you start to show obvious symptoms, your doctor may give you a tetanus antitoxin injection, such as tetanus immune globulin.This is not a cure, however, and can only neutralize ""free"" toxins that have not bonded to nerve tissue. Any toxins that have already bonded to nerve tissue will not be affected.


As such, time is of the essence. The sooner you get to the doctor (once you notice symptoms) the more effective the immunoglobulin will be in preventing the severity of symptoms.
You will be given a dose of 3000 to 6000 units intramuscularly as soon as the diagnosis of tetanus is made. In countries in which IG is not available, equine antitoxin is used.
Don't wait for symptoms. If you get a deep injury (such as a puncture wound) from something sharp that appears contaminated with soil, rust, feces or other debris, then clean the wound and get a tetanus shot shot from your doctor or an urgent care clinic as a preventative strategy.

, Antibiotics kill bacteria, including C. tetani, but the problem with tetanus has more to do with the toxin produced by the bacterial spores.The powerful toxin produced by the bacterial spores (once in your body) causes the vast majority of symptoms because it attaches to nerve tissue and causes excitation, which explains the widespread muscle contractions and spasms.


If you catch tetanus in its early stages, then antibiotics can be effective because they can kill the bacteria before they release much toxin.
If your condition is advanced, antibiotics may be relatively useless, so their potential side effects may not outweigh possible benefits.
You will be given IV antibiotics. Metronidazole 500 mg every six to eight hours is the preferred treatment for tetanus. Treatment will last seven to ten days.

, The symptoms associated with tetanus that are often most noticeable and potentially fatal are severe muscle contractions — referred to by doctors as tetany.If tetany strikes the muscles needed for breathing, then death is likely, so taking strong muscle relaxers (such as metaxalone or cyclobenzaprine) can be life saving as well as helpful to relieve the pain associated with spasms.


Muscle relaxers don't impact tetanus bacteria or toxin directly, but they can reduce the impact that the excited nerves have on muscle fiber contraction.
Tetany can be so powerful that it causes muscle tears and avulsion fractures — where contracting tendons rip away bone.
Sedatives, such diazepam (Valium), are also helpful in relieving muscle spasms, as well as the anxiety and increased heart rate associated with moderate-to-severe cases of tetanus., If your case is severe, you may need breathing assistance with an artificial respirator machine or ventilator.Even if the tetanus toxin doesn't affect your breathing muscles too badly, you may still need a breathing ventilator if you're on strong sedatives, since they often trigger shallow breathing.


In addition to airway obstruction and respiratory arrest (the most common reason people with tetanus die), other possible complications that can occur include: pneumonia, heart failure, brain damage and bone fractures (the ribs and spine are most common).

, There are some other drugs sometimes used to ease the symptoms of tetanus, such as magnesium sulfate (reduces muscle spasms), certain beta blockers (helps regulate heartbeat and breathing) and morphine (strong sedative and painkiller)., Tetanus is preventable by getting immunized (vaccinated).In the U.S., virtually all infants get vaccinated with a series of DTaP shots, which contain protective antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. However, protection generally lasts only about 10 years against tetanus infection, so booster shots are needed in early and later adulthood.


In the U.S., tetanus boosters are recommended every 10 years, starting at the age of 19.
People who get tetanus usually get vaccinated as part of their treatment because getting the condition does not provide immunity from it in the future.

, Cleaning and disinfecting any deep wound, especially punctures of your feet), is important to kill any C. tetani bacteria and prevent them from producing toxin in your body.After the bleeding has stopped, thoroughly rinse your wound with clean water or saline solution if you have any. Then clean the wound with some antibacterial alcohol-based sanitizer before covering it up with a clean bandage.


Antibiotic creams, such as Neosporin and Polysporin, also work well. They don't promote faster healing, but they discourage bacterial growth and infection.
Change your dressing / bandage regularly, at least once a day or whenever it gets wet or dirty.

, Most cases of tetanus develop due to stepping on something sharp that's covered in animal feces or contaminated dirt that contains spores of C. tetani bacteria — nails, glass and splinters, for examples. As such, wearing sturdy footwear with thicker soles, especially while on farms or in rural areas, is a good preventative strategy.Always wear flip-flops or sandals when walking on the beach and wading into shallow water.
Don't forget to also protect your hands when working outdoors or in shops. Wear thicker gloves made from leather or a similar material.

Go to the hospital for severe symptoms.,
Undergo supportive care.,
Get medication to help with brain swelling.,
Get plenty of rest and fluids.",How to Treat Powassan Disease2," If you begin to experience severe symptoms, such as lack of coordination, confusion, or trouble speaking, you should go to the hospital. You should also go to the hospital if you start having seizures. This could mean the Powassan disease is causing neurological problems.

You should also go see a doctor if you have a fever or muscle and joint aches.

, Unfortunately, there is no treatment or vaccine for Powassan virus. If you become infected, the doctor will treat your symptoms. This may include fluids through an IV to help with dehydration and ensure that you get proper minerals. They will give you respiratory assistance to make sure that your breathing is regulated.Around 10 to 15 percent of cases of Powassan virus with encephalitis is fatal. Around half of the survivors have long-term neurological problems and complications.

, If you develop encephalitis because of the Powassan disease, the doctor may give you antiviral medication to treat the virus.Side effects may include digestive trouble like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, along with muscle and joint pain.

, Some mild cases of encephalitis caused by Powassan can be treated at home with plenty of bed rest. You should also make sure that you get enough fluids, since dehydration is a major concern."

Cover yourself when outdoors.,
Walk only on cleared paths.,
Use tick repellent.,
Pretreat clothing with permethrin.,
Search your body.,
Bathe after being outside.,
Wash or tumble dry your clothes.",How to Treat Powassan Disease3," Ticks can easily get on your skin if you bump into a limb or walk through grass where they live. If possible, wear clothing that covers your skin as much as possible when outdoors. This includes long sleeves, pants, socks, and boots.Some of these items may not be feasible depending on the climate or activity, but try to cover up as much as possible.

, You may enjoy walking through the woods, but make sure you stay on cleared paths. This helps reduce your risk of being exposed to ticks. Don’t wander off clear and mowed trails into tall grasses or brush. This increases your risk of exposure., When you go outdoors into areas where you may be exposed to ticks, use a safe tick repellent. DEET-based tick repellents can be effective. Make sure the concentration is 20 percent or more. Place the repellent on your skin and clothing., If you are going camping or are going to be outside in a tick-infested area for long periods of time, treat your clothing and gear with permethrin. You should treat boots, pants, socks, and tents. Do this two weeks before you wear the clothes or use the gear. Don’t reapply, and don’t put permethrin on your skin., As soon as you get back from being outdoors, check your entire body. Use a handheld or full-length mirror to check parts of your body you cannot see. Make sure to check common areas that ticks will bite you, such as under the arms, around the ears, in the navel, behind your knees, between your legs, along the waist, and in the hair., You should take a bath or shower within two hours of being outdoors in an area where you may be exposed to ticks. This can help remove ticks crawling on you and help you find any that may be on your skin., Remove your clothes immediately when you come home. Throw them into the washing machine and use hot water. If you don’t want to wash them, place them in the dryer and leave them for at least 10 minutes on high heat.If you cannot wash or dry the clothes in hot water or high heat, place the clothes in the dryer and tumble on a lower heat setting for around 90 minutes.

Learn what vibration hives are.,
Learn what causes vibration hives.,
Recognize the symptoms of vibration hives.",How to Treat Vibration Induced Hives2," Vibration hives, also called vibratory urticaria, are a type of physical urticaria, which means they are hives caused by a physical stimulus. The hives occur on the part of the skin that have contact with the vibration.Most of these hives only last for a short period of time, but can last up to 72 hours.They can appear as quickly as a few minutes after exposure.New studies have found that this type of hives is due to a genetic mutation.

, Vibration hives are caused from some kind of physical vibration to the skin or body. The body confuses the vibrations as an attack, and the immune system reacts by causing welts or other inflammation on the body.These vibration hives occur most often from machinery, such as lawn mowers, moving cars, and jackhammers. They can also be caused by drums, loud bass beats, and even hand clapping., When a person has a negative reaction to vibrations, large itchy or painful welts or bumps occur on the skin. These bumps can be read or skin colored.The condition may also cause a red flush to the skin.Additional symptoms include blurry vision and a metallic taste in the mouth.
You may also experience some burning and pain.Symptoms typically occur a few minutes after exposure. They usually go away an hour or two later."

Get screened before you get pregnant, if possible.,
Research your family's medical history.,
Get your partner tested, if necessary.,
Choose between at-risk and expanded carrier screening.,
Weigh the pros and cons of undergoing genetic screening.",How to Undergo Carrier Genetic Screenings1," Ideally, undergo carrier genetic screening before you get pregnant. Your doctor should offer you and your partner this at your preconception visit; if they do not, ask about it specifically. Learn your family health history so that you can understand your risks. That way you can choose whether to pursue pregnancy and can proceed in the safest way., Some serious illnesses can be passed to your child even if you don't have symptoms; often, someone else in your family has had the illness. Find out the medical history of your parents, grandparents, and siblings. Look for the following conditions in your family history:Cystic fibrosis
Sickle cell anemia
Thalassemia
Tay-Sachs disease
Canavan disease
Familial dysautonomia
Familial hyperinsulinism
Gaucher disease
Fragile X syndrome
Klinefelter syndrome
Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Turner syndrome

, Carrier genetic screenings check for diseases that are recessive – for your child to inherit the illness, they have to get the disease gene from both parents. This means that if both you and your partner carry the gene for an illness, even if you have no symptoms of it, then your child has a 1 in 4 chance of being born with the disease. Both parents can get tested together, if you’d like.A common approach is to screen one partner first, then screen the other only if the first carries any disease genes. If only one parent is a carrier, the child will not inherit the disease.

, Usually, people are only screened for those diseases for which they are at higher risk. This is based on ethnicity and family history. However, this approach is limited because many people are mixed-ethnicity, adopted, or do not know their family history. In this case, consider expanded carrier screening. You’ll be tested for over 100 different diseases, rather than only for what you’re specifically at risk., There are pros and cons to undergoing genetic screening, and it is important to consider them carefully before you decide.

Some of the benefits of getting tested might include reducing your anxiety about passing on a certain disease to your offspring, having the opportunity to change your lifestyle if you know you are at risk, and helping you decide if you want to move forward with family planning.
Some of the negatives may include having a strong emotional reaction, such as anger, guilt, depression, or anxiety about getting or passing on a certain disease. You might also see the financial aspect as a negative since many insurance companies don’t cover the testing."

Use tea tree oil on psoriasis.,
Rub tea tree oil on acne.,
Relive itchy rashes.",How to Treat Skin Conditions with Tea Tree Oil1," Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that creates an extra layer of skin especially on the scalp, nails, and sometimes joints. There is no cure. Tea tree essential oil has been known to reduce the spread of psoriasis because of its anti-inflammatory properties.No published research exists to support effective of use tea tree oil for psoriasis, though it may still be worth a try.
Mix a few drops of tea tree oil with a few drops of a carrier oil like coconut or almond oil. Rub this mixture on the affected skin, leaving it on for a few moments before washing off with soap. Pat it dry and rub on a tea tree lotion that treats psoriasis.;
, Many people use tea tree oil to treat outbreaks of acne. One study compared tea tree oil to using benzoyl peroxide as acne treatment. The study showed that while the peroxide worked slightly better, the tea tree oil had fewer side effects.Mostly tea tree oil is used because of its ability to reduce the redness and inflammation associated with acne.First wash your face. Then soak a cotton swab, cotton ball, or cotton pad in water before applying one or two drops of tea tree oil on it. Rub the affected skin with this cotton, leave it a few minutes, then wash it off and pat it dry.
This same anti-inflammatory property of tea tree oil is used to treat eczema and soothe the redness of rosacea.
You can find acne washes and lotions containing tea tree oil at the store, or you can make some yourself.

, Outbreaks like scabies, hemorrhoids, and contact-allergies like poison ivy and poison oak or sumac all make you suffer with itchy rashes, and all may benefit from tea tree oil. Tea tree oil’s antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties combine to relieve the itching and swelling that comes with these rashes.Make your own rash treatment by mixing 5-6 drops of tea tree oil with one tablespoon of coconut oil and store it in a colored glass jar at room temperature. Massage a small amount onto any rashes, then wash it away after a few minutes.
If you believe you have come in contact with poison ivy or its brothers and sisters, wash your skin with soap and water to minimize your reaction."

Eat antioxidant-rich foods.,
Look for foods that contain lots of flavonoids.,
Drink cabbage juice.,
Consume cranberry products.Cranberry is known to fight H. pylori.,
Eat white sweet potatoes.,
Use more honey.,
Take licorice supplements.Licorice root has anti-H. pylori properties, so it can help heal your ulcer.,
Eat more bananas.,
Switch from butter to oil.,
Follow a bland diet.,
Eliminate alcohol from your diet.,
Don’t drink milk for relief.Drinking milk can provide some temporary relief from pain caused by ulcers because it will coat the stomach; however, drinking milk will also encourage your stomach to produce more acid, worsening your symptoms in the long run.

,
Avoid spicy foods.,
Don’t eat fatty foods.Deep fried foods, fast food meals, and other high-fat foods should be avoided.,
Stay away from garlic.People who have ulcers, or who are prone to them, should avoid garlic because it can irritate existing ulcers and possibly cause new ones.

,
Quit tobacco products.Regular use of tobacco has been shown to slow or prevent the healing of ulcers.,
Stop taking NSAIDs.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen.,
Avoid stress.It is still thought that stress can aggravate ulcers and worsen symptoms, even if it has now been shown that stress does not cause most ulcers.",How to Treat Ulcers Naturally," Free radicals in your stomach can break down your stomach lining, making your ulcer worse.Antioxidants are known as free radical scavengers — they destroy the free radicals that could cause you harm. Because of this, you should eat foods that contain antioxidants. These include:Red wine
Pomegranate juice
Grape juice
Buckwheat
Barley
Beans and lentils
Nuts (walnuts, peanuts, hazelnuts, almonds, etc.)
Chocolate
Berries (blueberries, cranberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, etc.)
Certain spices (including clove, allspice, cinnamon)
Certain herbs (including peppermint, oregano, thyme, sage, rosemary)
Tomato products (sauces, sun-dried tomatoes);
, Flavonoids are found in many plants and are defined as organic compounds of biological pigments. Flavonoids also fight free radicals, meaning they are protectors of your stomach lining, just like antioxidants.Foods rich in flavonoids include:


Blueberries
Strawberries
Peaches
Apples
Oranges
Celery
Black beans
Black, green, and oolong teas
Beer

, While it is an uncommon drink, cabbage juice is very effective in curing stomach ulcers. Cabbage is naturally rich in bacteria that produce lactic acid; these bacteria are essential in fighting and destroying the bacteria that causes ulcers.You should drink 50 ml of cabbage juice twice a day when your stomach is empty.
Cabbage juice can be made at home using a juicer, or can be purchased from some markets and health stores.

, Research has also shown that cranberry juice is powerful when it comes to preventing bad bacteria from fusing to the lining of your stomach.


You can drink cranberry juice, eat fresh cranberries, or take cranberry supplements (available from pharmacies and vitamin stores).

, Research shows that powerful wound-healing agents are found in white sweet potatoes.Eating these may help heal your ulcer. You can find white sweet potatoes at many markets and prepare them in several ways, including steaming and baking.

, Research and tradition demonstrate that honey is a powerful natural antibiotic. For this reason, it can help fight the H. pylori bacteria that cause ulcers.Try to consume a couple spoonfuls of honey each day to combat your ulcer.

, Licorice extract is available from many markets, pharmacies, and health stores.


Talk to your doctor before starting a licorice regimen and discuss other medications you may be taking. Licorice supplements taken with with diuretics, corticosteroids, or other medicines that lower the body’s potassium levels could reduce potassium to dangerous levels.Take licorice supplements as instructed by your doctor.

, Research indicates that eating bananas can help treat the symptoms of stomach ulcers by helping to protect the lining of the stomach.Though it will not heal an existing ulcer, eating bananas may help treat your symptoms.


Dried unripe plantains may also help, but ripe plantains do not seem to have a positive effect., When you would normally put a pat of butter in the frying pan to cook your eggs or vegetables in, you should instead use olive oil. These oils contain healthy fats that are processed more easily than the heavier fats found in animal products like butter.You can also try cooking with coconut oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil or safflower oil

, A bland diet concentrates on easily-digestible, low-fiber foods. These are gentle on your stomach and are less likely to irritate ulcers.You should talk with your doctor about whether or not a bland diet is a good treatment for your ulcer, and how long to follow it if it is. Foods you can eat on a bland diet include:


Low-fat dairy products (milk, yogurt, etc.)
Cooked, canned, or frozen vegetables without seasoning
Fruit and vegetable juices
Applesauce
Hot cereals
Lean, tender meats such as boiled chicken or baked fish, without seasonings
Creamy peanut butter
Tofu

, While alcoholic drinks like wine can have some health benefits, alcohol can irritate the lining of your stomach. When you have an ulcer caused by H. pylori, alcohol only makes the situation worse.,, Spicy foods might make ulcers more painful if you already have one, but they won’t cause one.It is best to avoid all spicy foods (hot peppers, hot sauces, etc.) if you have an existing ulcer or are predisposed to them.

, These fats are hard to digest, which can irritate ulcers.

,, If you are addicted to tobacco products, talk to your doctor about treatments that can help you quit so that your ulcer can heal.

, These common pain relievers, fever reducers, and anti-inflammatory medications may cause ulcers in some people, especially if taken for extended periods of time or at high doses. If you are taking NSAIDs for an existing condition, talk to your doctor about other medications you can take instead (such as acetaminophen).

, If you are suffering from one, avoiding or reducing stress factors can help you heal faster. Meditation and breathing exercises are easy, natural ways to relieve stress and treat ulcers."

Find ways to relax.",How to Treat Pain Disorder," For many people, the diagnosis of pain disorder occurs once every other reasonable explanation is ruled out. If your pain is determined to be legitimate (not feigned) but not directly explicable by an existing medical condition (an illness) or substance (such as a medication), pain disorder should be considered as a distinct possibility.A psychiatrist or other mental health professional is often involved in the diagnosis of pain disorder. He or she may do so in part by asking a series of questions, such as:

Is an existing medical condition causing the pain? If no, …
Is the patient falsely claiming pain (feigning) for any number of reasons? If no, …
What is the precise nature and severity of the pain?
What are the psychological factors contributing to the pain?

;
, Because pain disorder is defined at least as much by what it is not as by what it is, each individual case is distinctive. In general terms, pain disorder is created out of a combination of physical and psychological factors, but the precise balance of these factors can vary widely. As such, each case should be considered closely by medical professionals in both the physical and psychological fields.In the most simplified categorization, there are three types of pain disorder: pain disorder with significant medical and psychological factors; pain disorder without significant medical factors; and pain disorder without significant psychological factors.
If your pain disorder trends more towards psychological factors, so too should your treatment; if it is more physical, the same holds for the treatment. In all cases, though, coordinated physical and psychological treatment is warranted.

, The pain associated with pain disorder can occur in any part of the body, so long as it does not align with any causative condition. So, if you have a broken foot but pain in your abdomen, that could possibly be pain disorder, but so too could abdominal pain that does not align with the stomach ulcer you have.


Although the pain can present anywhere in the body, the most common pain sites seem to be the lower back, head, abdomen, and chest. The severity and duration of the pain can vary widely, from short bursts of intense pain to lingering amounts of moderate pain, and everything in between., Regardless of the precise location, duration, or severity of your pain, one of the hallmarks of pain disorder is that it almost invariably causes emotional distress and changes in behavior. Such changes occur in large part because the pain seems inexplicable and easy to doubt as real (by other people, some medical professionals, and even the patient). Identifying such changes can help with the diagnosis of pain disorder and the determination of its specific nature in your case. People with pain disorder often develop strong feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, since there often seems to be no way to explain or do anything about the pain. This can in turn cause the person to become inactive and passive and develop conditions like insomnia, chronic fatigue, anxiety, and depression, as well as cause disruptions in normal social relationships.

, People with pain disorder often struggle to convince themselves and others that their pain exists in spite of the lack of a clear physical cause. Many have probably heard someone say that the pain is “all in your head,” as if it is imaginary. Actually, though, the pain experienced by all people has a mental component to it, so pain is in fact “in all of our heads.”All pain, whether caused by pain disorder or a bump on the head, is in part a “psychological response to noxious stimuli.”Both body and mind are involved in the experience of pain, and both areas need to be addressed in order to effectively treat pain disorder.
Addressing your mental health is not a sign that your pain disorder is imaginary, then; it is instead a critical element of managing the condition.

, The ongoing physical discomfort and emotional anguish of pain disorder causes many sufferers to feel hopeless about doing anything about it. A coordinated effort among the patient, physician, and mental health professional, however, can develop coping skills to better identify, manage, and overcome both the pain and the hopelessness.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), under the guidance of a psychiatrist or other mental health professional, produces positive results for many pain disorder sufferers. CBT can help patients recognize the environmental and emotional factors that make the pain worse; develop both tension-reduction and confidence-building exercises; and formulate motivational strategies to overcome the pain and passivity that inhibit normal activities.

, People with pain disorder are invariably anxious and stressed out due to the condition. The constant physical and emotional barrage caused by the disorder creates tension that must be released, ideally in a healthy and helpful manner. Utilizing tension-reduction techniques under professional guidance is therefore a key element in the treatment of pain disorder.Work with you mental health professional to determine the techniques that are most effective for you. Options include (but are not limited to) progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, talk therapy, biofeedback, and hypnosis.
Pain diaries, in which you take note of the details of your daily pain experiences (and responses to them), can also be very helpful. The simple act of recording (and legitimizing) what you are experiencing can help you to “let go” of stress and anxiety.

, The longer a person suffers from pain disorder, the more difficult it becomes to treat. This is the case largely because the disorder creates a vicious cycle of pain and worry — you feel pain, you worry about the pain you felt and what will be coming next, and soon the disorder seems to take control of your life. One of the critical elements of managing pain disorder is reinforcing the patient’s drive and desire to live a full and active life.There is a fine line to be drawn here. Pain disorder sufferers shouldn’t feel as though they are being told to “suck it up,” toughen up, and pretend the pain doesn’t exist. Rather, in combination with coping and motivational techniques under the guidance of a mental health professional, the patient can break the pain-and-worry cycle and limit the disorder to a more manageable state.

, Pain disorder often creates feelings of isolation and loneliness, as if you are the only person who can know how real and how inhibiting your condition is. Family counseling can often help loved ones better understand the condition and give the patient more confidence that he or she has a caring and involved support network.While it is hard to find even general estimates in regards to the number of people living with pain disorder, it does affect children, and teenage girls seem to be particularly susceptible. Children with pain disorder (and their loved ones) will usually derive particular benefits from family counseling. No child should feel like he or she has to deal with pain disorder alone.
Consider joining a support network with others facing pain disorder. Sometimes it’s simply best to talk to someone who really understands what you’re going through.

, A great deal of the treatment regimen for pain disorder involves learning to understand and cope with the condition. Direct treatment of the physical pain experienced due to the disorder is also a normal and important treatment component, though. Once again, coordination between your physician and mental health professional is of critical importance.Usually, pain treatment begins with acetaminophen or NSAIDs prescribed by your doctor. Other, more powerful painkillers may be considered as needed, but will usually be prescribed with caution, out of fear of dependency and other concerns. Take all medications as prescribed and discuss their effectiveness and any side effects with your doctor.
Sometimes, depending upon the nature, location, and severity of your pain, your doctor may prescribe nerve blocking agents or surgical ablation, which removes certain nerve pathways in the affected area.

, Antidepressants are commonly prescribed to individuals with pain disorder, as a means to help deal with the emotional impacts common to the condition. Such medications should be taken under the close supervision of a medical professional, and in tandem with counseling. This is yet another area of pain disorder treatment in which a coordinated effort among the care team is important.While antidepressants have proven very helpful for countless people with conditions including pain disorder, they, like any medication, come with risks. Make sure you clearly understand how to take the medication as prescribed and how to identify possible side effects. Do not hesitate to consult your prescribing physician with questions or concerns.

, Medications and treatments given under the care of a mental health professional — such as CBT, visualization, and biofeedback — can do much to help people with pain disorder reduce the tension, stress, and anxiety common to the condition. There are also a range of other techniques you can try which are generally harmless and have varying degrees of evidence of effectiveness. Keep your medical team “in the loop” regarding all treatment methods you utilize, though.If you have pain disorder, you may find some degree of relief and relaxation via acupuncture, massage, meditation, yoga, music or art therapy, hobbies, or regular exercise, among many other options. The bottom line is that finding effective, safe ways to relax will make it easier for you to manage and overcome the other impacts of pain disorder.

Ask your insurance company if the procedure is covered.,
Locate a testing center.,
Give a blood or saliva sample.",How to Undergo Carrier Genetic Screenings2," Some American insurance companies consider genetic screening part of prenatal care, but others consider it optional. Call your health insurance company and find out whether or not they cover carrier genetic screening. If so, it may be free for you. If not, the out of pocket cost may be several hundred dollars.The cost and availability of screenings may vary by country. Ask your doctor or insurance company for details about cost and payment options.

, Most likely, your doctor or OB/GYN can perform the test in their office.If not, they will probably be familiar with local professionals who can perform the screening. Ask for suggestions; they may even provide a referral.

Medical Genetics programs also offer carrier screenings. Some companies offer mail-order services. Because of the risk of user error, it’s better to get the test done by a professional. The results should always be read by a trained medical professional.

, The test itself is relatively simple, easy, and painless. You will be asked to give a sample of blood or saliva. Your genes will be evaluated from this sample.You will get results in about 2 weeks.

Before making any major decisions about parenting, talk to a genetic counselor. They can help you understand the disease and your options for childbearing.For help choosing a genetic counselor in the United States, visit the website nsgc.org.They also offer an international contact list., Medical geneticists are doctors who are specially trained in genetics. They can be a valuable tool when considering your family planning, or coping with a potentially difficult pregnancy. Ask your OB/GYN or genetic counselor for a referral.You can find a medical geneticist in the U.S. through an online tool offered by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Other search engines may exist in your country, so try an online search.

, If you learn you’re a carrier before you get pregnant, you may want to consider getting pregnant by non-traditional means. Talk to your doctor about artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization. Sperm from a non-carrier donor will be used, eliminating the risk of passing on the disease you and your partner carry.If you choose IVF, be sure to have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis., Some couples decide not to have children if they carry the gene for a serious disease. Instead, consider adopting a child. Many children in this world need loving homes, and adoptive parents have more options than ever before., If you are pregnant and find out you’re a carrier, consider getting diagnostic testing done like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Tell the doctor what disease gene you’re looking for, and they can determine whether your child has those genes.Knowing early that your child has the disease can help you get them treatment as soon as possible.

Amniocentesis tests the amniotic fluid in your uterus, and is usually done between 16 and 20 weeks of your pregnancy.CVS tests cells from your placenta. It can be done earlier than amniocentesis, at around 10 to 13 weeks of your pregnancy."

Remove skin tags.,
Soothe burns and other wounds.,
Try it on corns.,
Treat dandruff.",How to Treat Skin Conditions with Tea Tree Oil2," The powerful anti-inflammatory properties of tea tree oil also work to get rid of skin tags. To do this, take a completely wet cotton ball (soaked in water) and drip 3 drops of tea tree oil onto it. Apply this cotton ball directly onto your skin tag by rubbing it in a circular motion for a minute or two, and repeating this process 2 times a day until the skin tag disappears.It can take up to 10 days to see results.

, The antibiotic properties of tea tree oil have been known to not only soothe burns, but to prevent skin wounds from getting infected. This includes a wide range of skin sores, from minor kitchen burns to puncture wounds to open sores to sunburns.Mix a few drops of tea tree oil with a carrier oil and alternate running the burn under cold water and rubbing in the tea tree oil mixture for ten minutes.

, Traditionally, tea tree oil has been effective in treating corns. Corns are bumps that usually occur on the feet. They are characterized by a thick layer of skin that is tender to the touch.Tea tree oil can be rubbed in with a wet cotton ball or in a carrier oil like olive or coconut oil to reduce the swelling and irritation. After letting the tea tree oil rest on the corn a few minutes, wash it away.

, Tea tree oil can be used for dandruff because dandruff can be caused by many things that are treated with tea tree oil—eczema, fungus, and dry skin, to name a few.The same principles that apply to these other skin conditions apply to tea tree oil and dandruff.


It is tea tree oil’s antibiotic, antifungal, and antiseptic nature that helps with dandruff caused by skin conditions.
You can add 10 drops of tea tree oil to an 8-ounce bottle of shampoo, making sure you scrub it into your roots.
You can also combine a few drops of tea tree with a carrier oil and rub it into your scalp, leaving it in 10 minutes or sleeping with it (wear a shower cap to bed to prevent oil transfer). Run a comb over your scalp to loosen flakes before washing it out with shampoo.

Reduce the inflammation of staph infections.,
Soothe infected wounds.,
Relieve ringworm.,
Rub tea tree oil on nail and foot fungus.",How to Treat Skin Conditions with Tea Tree Oil3," The antibacterial properties of tea tree oil, mainly due to a component called terpin-4-ol, have been known to heal boils caused by staph infections, including the problematic infection known as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).Applying tea tree oil several times a day until the infection is gone may help just as much as antibiotics.

, Any time that you get an infection in an opening of your skin, consider applying a diluted form of tea tree oil to help reduce the inflammation. Tea tree oil’s anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties help infections heal.

, Ringworm is a fungus that manifests in a red, raised, circular bump on the skin. Tea tree oil’s anti-fungal properties can take care of this unsightly ring through repeated application. Try soaking a cotton ball in water, adding 3 drops of oil to it, and rubbing it on the ring 1 or 2 times a day until it disappears.

, Other kinds of fungus can be eliminated through use of tea tree oil. Its antifungal properties have been shown to take care of dermatophytes, fungi that can infect hair, skin, and nails.


Tea tree oil can fight fungi that cause athlete’s foot and other nail and feet infections (called onychomycosis and interdigital tinea pedis).Soak a cotton ball in water, then add two or three drops of tea tree to it. Rub this cotton over each nail or on your foot, letting your nails dry or washing it off of your skin.

Gather supplies.,
Place carrier oil in a container.,
Drip a few drops of tea tree into the carrier oil.,
Use water.,
Rub into the affected area.",How to Treat Skin Conditions with Tea Tree Oil4," In order to apply tea tree oil (and any essential oil), you must first dilute it. This is especially important with tea tree oil because it is such a potent oil. It is suspected to be toxic, so it should never be even slightly ingested. To dilute it, you will either need a wet cotton ball, a container of water, or what is known as a “carrier oil.”The most effective way to dilute any essential oil is with a carrier oil.
A carrier oil is a pure oil that is not potent and can be safely rubbed onto the skin. Examples include olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, and other natural oils (including neem oil and castor oil).

, Before dripping out the tea tree oil, you need to set up a space for it to be mixed with a carrier oil, and the carrier oil should be poured out first. You can do this in a small dish or in the palm of your hand.


You only need one or two drops of carrier oil for a single treatment, but it can be useful to mix up an ounce of carrier oil with 15 drops of tea tree oil., Any time that you use tea tree oil to treat a skin condition, you should only use a few drops. If you are using a carrier oil, drop between 1 and 3 drops of tea tree into the oil and mix it together with your finger.

, If you are using water, use a lot, somewhere between half a cup and a whole cup, as water makes essential oils spread. If you are using a wet cotton ball, place about 3 drops onto the cotton.

, Once you have properly diluted the tea tree oil, you can rub it onto the skin condition you are treating. In most cases, you will need to repeat this treatment once or twice a day until the condition has gone away.

Stimulate the growth of white blood cells in your bone marrow.The first thing you will need to do in order to treat MS via chemotherapy is to stimulate the growth of white blood cells so that a large enough sample can be removed from your body and stored (frozen) for use later on.,
Receive chemotherapy for your MS.Chemotherapy is traditionally thought of as a treatment for cancer only; however, it is also effective in destroying white blood cells, and it is a certain lineage of white blood cells (called your T cells) that are responsible for the autoimmune damage in multiple sclerosis.,
Continue with regular monitoring following the chemotherapy.Your cell counts will typically return to normal 9-14 days following the treatment.,
Have the stem cell transplant.Once your white blood cells have been wiped out with chemotherapy, you are now ready to receive the autologous (meaning using your own cells) stem cell transplant.,
Determine whether you are a candidate for chemotherapy.In order to be a candidate to receive chemotherapy treatment for your MS, you need to have a form of MS with a poor prognosis (meaning a poor outlook moving forwards).,
Talk to your doctor about how to sign up for an MS clinical trial.,
Factor in the risks of MS chemotherapy treatment.Over 90% of people who have received this treatment to date have suffered no serious complications from it.,
Learn about the various MS treatment options that are available, apart from chemotherapy.While MS cannot be cured (and medical researchers are still actively looking into the question of how best to treat it), there are several options available to treat and improve symptoms and, in some cases, to actually slow the progression of MS as well.,
Consider steroid treatment.Regardless of which type of MS you have, and how early or late it is in the course of your disease, virtually all MS patients are offered steroids as a form of treatment.,
Opt for ""plasma exchange.,
Ask your doctor about treatments for symptom management.Common symptoms of MS include fatigue, trouble with bladder control, muscle stiffness and/or spasms, sensations of numbness and/or tingling, vision problems, trouble walking, problems with balance and/or coordination, and decreased cognitive function (problems with thinking, learning, and planning).,
Try specific ""disease-modifying"" therapies.As previously mentioned, the only way to actually alter (i.e.",How to Treat Multiple Sclerosis with Chemotherapy," The chemotherapy is the initial part of this treatment, and it must be followed up by a stem cell transplant, which is what these cells that are frozen will be used for down the road.


You will likely receive a medication such as G-CSF (Granulating Colony Stimulating Factor) which will promote the growth of white blood cells, that can subsequently be removed and frozen.
After this preparation stage is complete, you will be ready to move forward with chemotherapy.;
, Therefore, using chemotherapy to target and ""kill off"" your white blood cells, including your T cells, can be used as a method to get rid of the cells that are at the root of the problem in MS. It is this concept that has made the idea of chemotherapy for MS potentially so promising (although it is still in the early stages so doctors have yet to see ongoing proof of its effectiveness).


Chemotherapy agents that are typically used include a combination of Etoposide, Cytarabine, Carmustine, and Melphalan, as well as an immunosuppressive agent called Thymoglobulin. The chemotherapy regimen is called ""BEAM.""
Although chemotherapy does not technically cure MS, 18 out of 19 patients in the initial study showed either a stabilization or an improvement of their disease following treatment - so it is certainly a promising option for those who meet the eligibility requirements., However, you will be required to continue with ongoing monitoring for approximately 2 months following chemotherapy treatment for MS.


In the initial 2-month period following chemotherapy, doctors will check your cell counts and overall response to treatment to ensure that there are no complications.
You will also be asked to follow up with 8 study visits over the course of the following 5 years. At these visits, doctors will examine your blood and your urine, they may do an MRI, and they will perform a neurological exam to assess your MS symptoms (and to note the hopeful improvement of your symptoms since receiving treatment).
These follow up visits serve to inform you about your progress, as well as to provide the data needed for the study to determine the long-term efficacy of MS chemotherapy treatment.

, This is the final stage of treatment. The hope is that the chemotherapy will have eliminated all of the damaging T cells from your white blood cell line that were responsible for the autoimmune damage of multiple sclerosis. The goal now is to replace the cells that were destroyed with healthy new cells (the ones that were frozen and will now be transplanted).


When the cells were frozen, the doctors will have removed the T cells, and frozen only healthy cells to be transplanted back into you following chemotherapy. This is what makes the treatment so effective and so promising.
You will remain in hospital following the stem cell transplant until your ""peripheral cell counts"" (your white blood cell counts) have returned to the normal range., It is generally not used to treat mild cases of MS, due to the lack of evidence and the potential risks. If you have a severe progressive form of MS, or one with multiple relapses, this treatment may be for you.


If your form of MS qualifies for potential chemotherapy treatment, your doctor will also need to evaluate your overall health and fitness to receive the treatment.
If you have a number of other medical illnesses, you may not be eligible. However, if your body is strong and healthy, you may be eligible to participate in the clinical trial and to receive chemotherapy as a treatment for your MS.

, It is important to understand that chemotherapy as a treatment for MS is still in the clinical trial phase.What this means is that it is a new treatment that has only recently been tried by the medical community, and it lacks substantial long-term evidence of its effectiveness.


Normally, you would speak to your doctor to determine your eligibility to enter the clinical trial and, if you qualified, he or she would put you in contact with the physicians administering the trial.
Unfortunately, the clinical trial for MS chemotherapy is not currently accepting new patients.It may or may not open again down the road for new patients.
If chemotherapy treatment remains of interest to you, continue to follow up with your doctor about the status of the clinical trial to see if any new spots open down the road.

, However, there have been a few case reports of people who have died from the treatment. Also, there is no long-term evidence yet as to potential implications of the treatment on your health and wellbeing down the road. It is important to be aware of the risks prior to signing up for this novel treatment.


If your condition is severe enough (i.e. if you are suffering a lot from your symptoms of MS), the benefits of trying the treatment will likely outweigh the cons.
However, it is up to you to weigh the pros and cons and to determine which choice is right with you. Your doctor can provide guidance and assistance with this decision.

, Whether or not the progression is able to be slowed depends on two factors:


The stage at which ""disease-modifying treatment"" is initiated (the earlier, the better), and
The specific type of MS you have. The ""relapsing-remitting"" type tends to be the one which responds best to disease-modifying treatment, which in turn can slow the rate at which it progresses.

, Examples of steroid medications include Prednisone and IV (intravenous) Methylprednisolone. The purpose of steroid therapy is to reduce the inflammation around the nerves, as it is an autoimmune attack of the nerves that leads to the symptoms of MS to begin with.

,""Another option, if steroid therapy does not help you, is plasma exchange (called ""plasmapheresis""). This is when a portion of your blood (the plasma) is removed and exchanged with new plasma. The goal is that, in the exchange, the autoimmune antibodies (leading to the symptoms of MS) can be temporarily cleared from your body.

, Many of these symptoms can be improved with specific medical treatment.

, slow) the progression of the disease itself is to opt for disease-modifying therapies. These are most successful for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. They have unfortunately shown little utility in the other forms of MS.


Treatment options include Beta interferons, Dimethyl fumarate, Teriflunomide, Natalizumab, Glatiramer acetate, Fingolimod, Mitoxantrone, and Alemtuzumab.
These treatments may have significant side effects, so it is important to discuss the pros and cons with your physician prior to initiating treatment.

Children often experience vomiting and diarrhea as part of childhood illnesses.They may also not be able to understand or communicate when they need fluids.Older people may not experience thirst sensations as regularly, and their bodies do not conserve water as well. Some older people may also have conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, that make it difficult to communicate their needs to caregivers.People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart failure, or kidney disease, are more likely to become dehydrated. People may also take medications that contribute to dehydration (diuretic drugs).
Acute illnesses such as influenza can also increase your risk of dehydration. Fever and sore throat make you less likely to want to drink.Heavy exercisers, especially endurance athletes, are at a higher risk of dehydration because their bodies may lose more water than they are able to consume; however, dehydration is also cumulative, so you can become dehydrated over the course of a few days even with light exercise if you don’t consume enough water.
People in very hot climates or who are frequently exposed to prolonged heat are at higher risk. For example, construction workers and other people who work outside all day are at an elevated risk for dehydration. This is especially true if it is also humid in that climate. Sweat does not evaporate well in humid, hot environments, so your body has more trouble cooling itself.People who live at high altitudes (above 8,200 ft/2,500 m) are at an increased risk for dehydration. Your body may resort to increased urination and rapid breathing to keep your body oxygenated, both of which contribute to dehydration.;
, You can usually treat mild to moderate dehydration at home, with the remedies suggested in this article. Common signs of mild to moderate dehydration include:Dark yellow or amber urine
Infrequent urination
Increased thirst
Dry mouth, nose, and eyes
Overheating
Headache
Fatigue

, You should not treat severe dehydration at home with remedies. You will probably need IV hydration to recover from severe dehydration without quick and appropriate rehydration severe damage can be done to organs such as kidney and brain. Seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms include any of the following:Little or no urination
Reduced sweat
Very dark urine
Dizziness or light-headedness that significantly impairs your ability to stand or move
Weakness or shakiness
Low blood pressure
Fast heart rate
Fever
Lethargy or confusion
Seizure
Shock (e.g., pale/clammy skin, chest pain), Children may not be able to communicate all of their symptoms to you. There are several things you can look for to help determine whether your child is dehydrated.Reduced tears. If your child is crying but not producing tears (or not as many as usual), she is dehydrated.Capillary refill time. This is a simple test often used by pediatricians to test for dehydration. Press on the child’s fingernail until the nail bed turns white. Have your child hold her hand above the heart. Watch how quickly the nail bed turns pink. If takes more than two seconds, your child may be dehydrated.Rapid, shallow, or disturbed breathing. If your child is not breathing normally, it could be a sign that she is dehydrated., Severe dehydration in children should be treated immediately by a medical professional. Call your pediatrician or emergency medical services if your child has any of the following symptoms:Sunken eyes or fontanelle. The fontanelle is the “soft spot” on very young infants’ heads. If it looks sunken, the baby is likely dehydrated.Skin turgor. Skin turgor is essentially how your skin “snaps back” after being moved. For example, children who are dehydrated will have reduced skin turgor. If you pull up a small fold of skin on the back of your child's hand or on his stomach and it doesn’t return to its original state, the child is dehydrated.No urine output in eight hours or more
Extreme lethargy or loss of consciousness

, When you are adequately hydrated, your urine should be a pale, transparent yellow. Having too much or too little water in your system will change the color of your urine.If your urine is very clear or has almost no color, you may be over-hydrated. Overhydration can cause dangerously low levels of sodium, a natural electrolyte your body needs to function.If your urine is dark yellow or amber, you are probably a little dehydrated and should drink water.
If your urine is orange or brown, you are severely dehydrated and need medical attention immediately.

, This is the preferred treatment recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for mild to moderate dehydration. Plan to restore your child’s fluid levels over the course of three to four hours.Use a commercial electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte. These solutions have sugar and salt electrolytes to help prevent low blood sugar. It is possible to make your own rehydration solutions, but due to the possibility of error, it is generally safer to use commercial solutions.Give your child 1–2 teaspoons (5–10 ml) of the solution every few minutes. You can use a spoon or an oral syringe (does not contain a needle).Start off slow; too much fluid at once can cause nausea or vomiting. If your child vomits, wait 30 minutes before starting again., If your child is dehydrated, he will probably need to have the electrolyte balance in the bloodstream restored. Sodas and juices may cause hyponatremia, or low blood sodium, in children. Plain water also does not contain enough electrolytes to replenish your child’s body because children have a much faster electrolyte turnover than adults.Sodas may also contain caffeine, which is a diuretic and can further dehydrate the child.
Juices may have too much sugar and can make dehydration worse in young children. This is also true for sports drinks such as Gatorade. Sports drinks can be diluted with water — mix one part water with one part Gatorade.Other fluids to avoid include milk, clear broths, tea, ginger ale, and Jell-O., If your baby is still breastfeeding, try to persuade the infant to breastfeed. This will help restore the baby’s electrolyte and fluid levels and will also help further fluid loss through diarrhea.You can use oral rehydration solution in between breast feeding if your infant is very dehydrated; however, you should be taking your infant to the emergency room if she's severely dehydrated. Do not use formula during the rehydration period., Once your child has had the initial fluids restored, you need to make sure that the child continues to get enough fluid for the next 24 hours. The American Association of Family Physicians recommends the following formula:Infants should receive 1 ounce of oral rehydration solution per hour.
Toddlers (ages 1–3) should receive 2 ounces of oral rehydration solution per hour.
Older children (over 3) should receive 3 ounces of oral rehydration solution per hour.

, To make sure that rehydration is working, check the color of your child’s urine. As with adults’ urine, healthy children should have pale, clear yellow urine.Very clear or colorless urine could be a sign of overhydration. Ease up on the fluids for a bit to make sure that you don’t throw off your child’s sodium balance.
If the urine is amber or darker, continue with the rehydration treatment.

, Water is usually enough to rehydrate adults. Other options include clear broth, popsicles, Jell-O, and sports drinks that contain electrolytes. Go slow; drinking too much too fast may cause vomiting.Try ice chips. They dissolve slowly and the cooling effect can be helpful for overheated people.If the dehydration is the result of prolonged physical activity, consume a sports drink that contains electrolytes., When you’re dehydrated, avoid caffeine and alcohol. These have dehydrating effects on the body. Beverages such as coffee, caffeinated tea, and soda should not be taken while dehydrated. You should also avoid fruit juices, as the sugar can have a dehydrating effect by increasing urination., If you are not nauseated, try eating some fruits and vegetables with a high water content.Watermelon, cantaloupe, grapefruit, oranges, and strawberries are very high in water content.
Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, celery, cucumbers, eggplant, lettuce, sweet peppers, radishes, spinach, zucchini, and tomatoes have very high water content.
Avoid dairy if you have diarrhea or nausea along with dehydration. It can make these symptoms worse., Continue to rehydrate and rest over the next 24 hours. Drink plenty of fluids. Do not stop drinking simply because you don’t feel thirsty anymore. It can take several days to completely replace lost fluids., If you don’t feel better after rehydrating, or if you have a fever over 104°F (40°C), seek immediate medical help., If you are dehydrated, further exertion will only make your body weaker. Stop your activities., This will help promote heat loss from sweat and prevent heat exhaustion or heat stroke., This will prevent any more exertion and help prevent fainting.If you can, prop your feet up. This may help keep you from fainting.

, If dehydration is a side effect of heat exposure, remove excess clothing to cool off. You can also use damp towels and spray misters to help cool your body.Do not use ice water or ice packs. These can cause the blood vessels to constrict and can actually increase heat retention.
Use a spray bottle to mist lukewarm water onto the skin. The evaporation will help cool your body.Place damp cloths on areas of your body with thinner skin, such as the neck and face wrists, collarbone, upper arms and armpits, and inner thighs., If your child is mildly dehydrated due to overexertion, for example from playing vigorous sports, encourage the child to rest in a cool place out of the sun until she has replaced the lost fluids.Allow your child to drink as much water as she wants to during this period.
For older children, sports drinks containing sugar and salts (electrolytes) can be a good rehydration option.

, Use the steps in Method 3 to rehydrate your body. Drink at least 2 quarts (2 liters) of fluids over two to four hours.You should try to consume sports drinks that contain electrolytes or rehydration solutions to help restore your electrolyte balance. Mix 1 quart water with ½ teaspoon table salt and 6 teaspoons sugar for an inexpensive at-home rehydration solution.Avoid salt tablets. They can cause excess salt in the body and can cause severe complications., You should drink enough fluids even if you don't feel particularly thirsty. You may be dehydrated before you feel thirsty.The amount of water that adults need varies, but in general, men should drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids per day. Women should drink at least nine cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day.A good rule of thumb is to drink between .5–1 ounce of water for each pound you weigh. Thus, a 200-pound person should drink between 100–200 ounces of fluids per day, depending on exercise and activity level.If you exercise, drink an extra 1.5–2.5 cups of water for moderate exercise. If you will be exercising more than an hour, get additional rehydration using a sports drink containing electrolytes.Aim for .5–1 cup of fluid every 15–20 minutes during exercise.Avoid too much fruit juice. The sugar can cause trouble with your blood sugar levels and can increase urination, which can contribute to dehydration., Heavy exercise, such as that done by athletes, can cause salt loss. The average person can lose 500 mg of sodium through sweat over an hour-long workout; for athletes, that can be as much as 3000 mg.Try weighing yourself before and after a workout. Include the amount of water you drank during your workout. For example, if the scale shows you as one pound lighter but you also drank 16 ounces of water, you’re actually down two pounds. If you have lost more than 2 pounds, eat a handful of salty snacks such as pretzels or salted nuts to replace the lost sodium.

, If you will be outside, such as at a sporting event or activity, bring extra water with you. If you will be doing vigorous exercise, consider bringing sports drinks that contain electrolytes as well as a refillable water bottler..

, If you are regularly out in the heat or do vigorous exercise, wear breathable clothing. This can help your body regulate its heat. Bring along a personal mister or fan to help you keep cool. This will keep your body from losing fluid through perspiration.Don’t exercise during the hottest part of the day, if you can avoid it. High heat index, where the air temperature is hot with high humidity, can be particularly bad for your body., Fresh fruits and vegetables are often good sources of fluids. The average person gets about 19% of their daily water intake from food.Remember to drink extra water if you are eating dry or salty foods, as these can cause moisture loss.

Guard your kidneys from physical trauma.,
Stay hydrated all the time.,
Eat natural unsaturated fats, rather than saturated fats.,
Lower your phosphorus intake.,
Eat more whole grain products.,
Eat kidney “super foods”.,
Avoid smoking or drinking alcohol.,
Get exercise to stay in shape.,
Take epsom salt baths.",How to Treat Horseshoe Kidney1," Horseshoe kidneys are not protected by your ribcage and muscles because they do not ascend like normal kidneys. Because of this, it is really important to protect your kidneys as much as possible. It is best to avoid contact sports and occupations where your horseshoe kidney could be put at risk.


Go to the hospital if you sustain an injury to your kidneys. Your kidney is more in danger of injury that other people’s kidneys. If you get injured and think your kidney could have sustained some damage, go to the hospital right away. Damage to your kidney could lead to internal hemorrhage, intense pain, blood in the urine, and your kidney not being able to function properly.;
, Drinking lots of water every day will help to clean your kidneys out regularly. You should try to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water a day, but if you have the chance to drink more than that, more is even better! Carry a water bottle around with you so that you can stay hydrated even on the go.


You can drink other hydrating beverages like coconut water and electrolyte boosters like Gatorade on top of drinking water. If you get bored with plain water, squeeze some lemon in there to give it some flavor.

, Unsaturated fats lower the amount of bad cholesterol in your body and can help to cushion your kidneys. Saturated fats, on the hand, contain cholesterol and can harm your body if you eat them a lot. Stick to unsaturated fats for the most part.Examples of unsaturated fats: Vegetable oils like olive oil, raw nuts, fish, salmon, tuna, and flaxseeds.

Examples of saturated fats: Animal products like red meat, cheese, and lard. Coconut and palm oil are also forms of saturated fats, though they do not contain cholesterol like animal products do. Red meat also increases your chances of developing kidney stones.

, Phosphorus is an essential nutrient but when you consume too much of it, it can lead to your body sending calcium into your blood. When your kidney is weak, it can’t remove phosphorus from your body as well as it normally can. Excess amounts of phosphorus can gather in your body, causing bone and cardiac problems.Foods with very high amounts of phosphorus include:


Carbonated drinks and processed foods.
Pumpkin seeds, Romano cheese, scallops, pork chops, and beef.

, Whole grain products help your kidneys to lower cholesterol and have the added benefit of helping you sleep well at night.Try to replace less healthy carbs like white bread, rice, and pasta with products like:


Whole wheat bread and pasta, brown rice, barley and oats.

, Some foods are more kidney-friendly than others. In particular, there are three herbs—coriander, parsley, and turmeric—and two root vegetables—garlic and ginger—that are great for the health of your kidneys.


Coriander and parsley: Both of these herbs help to cleanse your kidneys. You can add them to your food, take extracts, or drink their juices.
Turmeric: Turmeric contains curcumin, antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. You can drink turmeric tea or take supplements.
Garlic: Garlic contains allicin, that has antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. You can add more garlic to your diet, eat the cloves, or take garlic supplements.
Ginger: Ginger contains gingerols, which work in a similar fashion to allicin and curcumin. You can eat raw ginger, add it to means, drink ginger tea, or take supplements.

, Both of these substances can do damage to your kidneys, and to the rest of your body. While an alcoholic drink every once in a while will not do too much damage, avoiding both alcohol and cigarettes is the healthiest route you can take, particularly if you are concerned about the health of your kidneys.

, Exercising helps your body in a variety of weights. By exercising, you can keep from gaining extra weight that can put more pressure on your kidneys. It can also keep your cholesterol, sugar, and blood levels at healthy amounts. Try to exercise for at least 30 minutes, five to seven days a week. You should perform a combination of aerobic and strength training exercises.Aerobic exercises include walking, biking, swimming, and running around while playing your favorite sport.
Try light strength training, but do not jump into heavy lifting, as you could injure yourself. Try lifting lighter weights and then work your way towards the heavier weights.

Give yoga a try. Yoga is also a great way to strengthen your body while also becoming more flexible.

, Epsom salt baths can reduce the stress you feel that can cause your kidneys some distress. Taking a bath with epsom salt also helps your body to expel toxins that get built up in your body. When your body has a little extra help expelling toxins, everything functions better—including your kidneys.

Acute bronchitis is usually due to a viral infection and symptoms should not last more than seven to 10 days. This is the type of bronchitis that can be treated naturally as it usually does not require prescription medication.Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing condition that occurs mostly in smokers. It's part of a variety of conditions that contribute to chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease (COPD). If you have chronic bronchitis, do not attempt natural treatment. Seek medical care.;
, Know the symptoms of bronchitis. People often misread bronchitis symptoms as that of another cold or a sinus infection. This leads to poor treatment options.


Acute bronchitis is much like the common cold. Symptoms include sore throat, sneezing, wheezing, fatigue, and fever; however, acute bronchitis is different from the common cold in that it's usually accompanied by a cough that produces green or yellow phlegm.Symptoms of acute bronchitis should only last seven to 10 days. If your symptoms last longer than this your bronchitis may be chronic.If you experience blue-tinged lips and swelling in the ankles, feet, and legs, call your emergency services immediately.
If you are not a smoker and have no symptoms specific to chronic bronchitis, you are likely experiencing acute bronchitis. This can be treated naturally and with over-the-counter medications. You may not need medical care if symptoms clear up within seven to 10 days., If you're still having trouble identifying your symptoms as bronchitis, you might be able to diagnose yourself based on your risk factors. There are a variety of factors that put you at increased risk for bronchitis.


A compromised immune system increases your risk for acute bronchitis, as it is caused by viral infections. If you've had a long-lasting cold or have a medical condition that weakens immunity, such as HIV/AIDS, you are at increased risk. You're also more susceptible if your immune system is lower due to age. Young children and the elderly are more vulnerable to viral infections that lead to bronchitis.If your job involves regular exposure to lung irritants, including ammonia, acids, chlorine, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, or bromine, you are at risk of developing bronchitis. These lung irritants easily make their way inside the lungs, which can cause inflammation and blocked air passages.Gastric reflux can irritate the throat and make you more susceptible to bronchitis.If you are a smoker, you are at increased risk for both chronic and acute bronchitis. You should forego natural treatment and seek medical care if you think your bronchitis was caused by smoking., Bed rest is generally recommended to treat bronchitis, as the body needs time to rest and heal after exposure to a virus; however, sleep can be difficult due to the cold symptoms associated with bronchitis.Engaging in behavior that could, even in good health, improve sleeping habits is worth a try. Keep your room quiet. Electronic gadgets and appliances should be turned off. Do not look at laptop or phone screens before attempting to sleep.
Natural, herbal cough syrups and cough suppressing teas can be found at many health food stores. If your cough is persistent to the point it's keeping you up at night, these might be a good option.Sleeping with your head tilted upward can help. Sinus pressure that has migrated to the ears moves downward and breathing becomes easier. Try sleeping with an extra pillow or on a recliner.Chamomile tea, or teas specifically designed to aid with sleep, help you relax before bed and provide you with needed fluids. A cup of tea shortly before you go to sleep or take a nap can help., Moist air can lessen symptoms by loosening mucus, resulting in less coughing and sneezing. Try to add humidity to the air in your home.


Invest in a humidifier. You can buy one online or at a department store. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly in regards to cleaning. You don't want to make symptoms worse by adding mold to the air.If you do not want a humidifier, you can add humidity in other ways. You can boil water in a bowl and inhale the steam. You can take a hot shower, with doors to the bathroom closed to maximize humidity. Houseplants are a good option as they add moisture and help purify the air., While at home, avoid exposing yourself to anything that can further irritate your lungs.


Do not smoke while symptoms last. If you live with smokers, ask them to smoke outside so you do not come into contact with secondhand smoke.Household cleaners and fresh paint can also irritate the lungs and should be avoided as symptoms persist.If you have any known allergies that result in sneezing and coughing, avoid them while your bronchitis lasts.

, Drinking liquids is helpful in treating bronchitis. The body loses fluids faster during fevers and heavy liquid intake helps thin mucus and reduce coughing, sneezing, and other symptoms.Plain water is great as it's the easiest route to hydration. Try to have a water bottle on hand at all times, and refill it as soon as it's empty.
You may find warm liquids more soothing. Soups and teas may soothe your throat after long bouts of coughing. Boiling water is also an option.
Avoid milk, as properties of cow's milk may thicken mucus. It is also not particularly hydrating in comparison to other options., There are a variety of foods that can help treat symptoms of bronchitis. Adding these to your diet during your recovery time can help.


Lemon and ginger help soothe the throat and can reduce coughing and mucus production. They can be added to teas and grated lemon rind can be added to water to provide flavor and help the throat.Almonds contain a variety of vitamins and nutrients that can encourage healing in respiratory infections.Spicy foods can lead to a runny nose, but the mucus produced is thinner and more easily expelled. Eating hot and spicy dishes can help clear the air passages and improve your breathing., Honey comes highly recommended for colds and flus for a reason. It's a powerful and natural cough suppressant.


In one study, a variety of treatments for coughing were used on patients experiencing cold-like symptoms. Honey, specifically buckwheat honey, was the best method for treating symptoms. Notably, honey improved symptoms far more than no treatment. This helps to debunk the notion that honey for colds is an old wive's tale and does not actually improves symptoms.Adding honey to your nighttime tea or taking a spoonful before bed is a good way to combat symptoms; however, not all coughing is bad. It's a necessary bodily process when it comes to clearing mucus from your airway, so you should not use honey all day to suppress a cough. Try to limit use of honey to times when the cough interferes with rest., Salt water can help soothe a sore throat temporarily. If your symptoms are particularly troublesome, you can try gargling with salt water and see if that provides some relief.


Generally, one fourth to one half a teaspoon of salt dissolved into an 8 ounce glass of water is ideal.Gargle for about 30 seconds, as you would with mouthwash, and then spit into the sink. Repeat as needed.
The water's temperature is a matter of personal preference, but many find lukewarm or hot water more soothing.

, Oil from the eucalyptus tree, sold at health stores and drug stores, is a powerful and natural treatment option. It relieves congestion and can soothe coughing and sore throat; however, there are some important precautions in regards to eucalyptus oil.


Do not take orally unless specifically instructed by a doctor. The oil is meant to be used and consumed indirectly and oral consumption can be dangerous.High doses or orally consumed eucalyptus can be toxic.
For bronchitis, add five to 10 drops of eucalyptus oil to 2 cups of boiling water. Placing a towel over your head, bend over the water and inhale the steam.You can also place eucalyptus oil on the skin, if diluted with another oil like olive oil or almond oil. This is generally used for skin rashes and inflammation, however, and may not be helpful when addressing bronchitis.Do not use eucalyptus oil on children unless you have asked your doctor. It can be toxic to children."

See your doctor.,
Seek treatment for a child or infant with jaundice.,
Receive a definitive diagnosis.,

Avoid hepatitis infections.,
Stay within recommended alcohol consumption limits.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,

Ensure your infant is getting adequate feedings.,
If you breastfeed, your baby should get 8-12 feedings per day in the first week of life.If you are feeding your infant formula, she should get 1-2 ounces (30 to 60 milliliters) of formula every two to three hours during her first week of life.",How to Treat Jaundice," If you or your child develop any signs or symptoms of jaundice, see you doctor as soon as possible. You may not need treatment for the jaundice, but if there is an underlying condition causing it, this will require medical attention.Some symptoms of short-term jaundice in adults are:


Fever
Chills
Abdominal pain
Other flu-like symptoms
A change in your skin color and whites of eyes to a more yellow pallor.;
, Children and infants can also develop jaundice. Jaundice is common in infants and it often goes away on its own within two weeks.However, severe jaundice can cause serious complications for some infants.To check for jaundice, look for a yellowish skin tone and a yellowish tone to the whites of your infant or child's eyes.
If your child or infant develops jaundice, then call your doctor right away.

, In adults, jaundice is often caused by underlying conditions that require treatment. Your doctor man run tests to confirm a diagnosis of these conditions causing your jaundice and then formulate a treatment plan from there. You may need to have have to have blood work, an ultrasound, CT scan, or a even a liver biopsy to find the cause of your jaundice. Common conditions that can cause jaundice include:


Hepatitis A
Chronic Hepatitis B and C
Epstein-Barr viral infection, or infectious mononucleosis
Excessive alcohol consumption
Autoimmune or genetic disorders
Gallstones
Gallbladder inflammation
Gallbladder cancer
Pancreatitis
Certain medications such as acetaminophen, penicillin, oral contraceptives and steroids may also cause jaundice.Your doctor can diagnose jaundice by looking for signs of liver disease including bruising, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, and urinalysis that indicates the presence of bilirubin. Your doctor may also use imaging or liver biopsy to confirm a diagnosis., If your doctor discovers an underlying condition that are causing your jaundice, she will likely treat that to see if it clears up other related health issues. Treating causes and complications of underlying conditions may help relieve your jaundice., In most cases, jaundice will go away without treatment. Speak with your doctor to make sure that foregoing treatment is the best option for you, especially if you have underlying conditions causing jaundice., Some people with jaundice experience itching. If the itching becomes bothersome or affects your daily life, take a medication such as cholestyramine to relieve your symptoms.Cholestyramine works by controlling cholesterol in the liver.Side effects of this medication include abdominal discomfort, indigestion, nausea, flatulence, and constipation., Infant jaundice is very common and, like adult jaundice, often doesn’t require any treatment.However, if your doctor diagnoses jaundice in your baby, she could call for one of the following treatments to help relieve the condition:


Phototherapy, which uses light to help your baby excrete excess bilirubin
Intravenous immunoglobulin, which can reduce antibodies in your baby that cause jaundice
Exchange transfusion, which is a type of blood transfusion that removes small amounts of blood and dilutes bilirubin. Exchange transfusions are used only in severe cases of infant jaundice., Contracting the hepatitis virus is one of the main causes of jaundice in adults. Avoiding contact with the virus as much as you possibly can may minimize your risk for contracting not only hepatitis, but also jaundice.You can prevent Hepatitis A with a vaccine. Anyone can get this vaccine.Hepatitis A is spread when a person eats tiny amounts of fecal matter, most often in tainted foods.Be careful when traveling for food that hasn’t been properly cooked or cleaned.You can also prevent Hepatitis B with a vaccine. Any person from newborns to adults can receive this vaccine.There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.Hepatitis B and C are spread through the blood and bodily fluid of an infected individual, but not through casual contact.Avoid reusing any type of needles—from tattoos to recreational drugs—to help prevent the spread of these viruses., Since your liver processes alcohol and is the source for jaundice, limit your alcohol consumption to daily recommended values. Not only can this help alleviate the symptoms of jaundice, but may also keep you from contracting alcohol-related liver diseases such as cirrhosis.The recommended daily limit for women is 2-3 units of alcohol. For men, the recommended daily limit is 3-4 units.As a reference point, one bottle of wine has 9-10 units of alcohol., Keeping your weight at a within a stable and healthy range can promote your overall healthy. But this can also keep your liver healthy, and in turn prevent jaundice.Maintaining your is easy if you eat healthy, balanced, and regular meals. Food choices that are nutrient rich and contain moderate fat and complex carbohydrates, are best to promote your general health.
Keep your daily calorie intake around 1,800-2,200, depending on how active you are. You should get your calories from nutrient-dense whole foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, and lean proteins.Exercise is important to maintaining your weight and promoting your overall health.
Participate in low-impact, moderate intensity cardiovascular activities every day.Aim to exercise for least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week., Keeping your cholesterol in check can not only help prevent jaundice, but also help maintain your overall health. You can manage your cholesterol through healthy diet and exercise or, in other cases, with prescription medication.Eating more soluble fiber, healthy fats, and foods high in omega-3 fatty acids can help manage your cholesterol. Foods such as lean cuts of meat, low-fat dairy, olive oil, salmon, almonds, oats, lentils, and vegetables contains these three nutrients.Reduce or eliminate trans fats from your diet. Trans fats increase your bad, or LDL, cholesterol. Limiting or stopping your intake of foods such as fried foods and commercial products including baked goods, cookies, and crackers may help control your cholesterol.Thirty minutes of exercise a day can help increase the levels of good, or HDL, cholesterol, in your body.There is some evidence that quitting smoking will increase your HDL cholesterol levels., Making sure that your baby is getting enough to eat throughout the day. This is the best prevention or jaundice in infants.,"

Drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day.,
Steam your face.,
Consider adding essential oils.,
Add cooking herbs.,
Take a bath.,
Try a humidifier or vaporizer.",How to Treat Chronic Sinusitis1," It's important to drink eight to 10 8-ounce glasses of water a day. This keeps the discharge thin and more fluid, making it easier to drain. Avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine, which could dehydrate you.Don't worry if discharge drains down the back of your throat. The acid in your stomach will kill off anything that may be causing the infection.;
, Fill a 1-quart pot with water and boil it for a couple of minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Steam should be coming off of the pot. Cover your head with a large, clean cotton towel, place your head over the steaming pot and close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for 5 counts and then in and out through your mouth for two counts. Repeat this for 10 minutes or as long as there's steam. Blow your nose after the treatment.


You can do this every two hours or as often as your schedule permits.
Keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water. You want the heat to enter your nose and throat, but don't burn yourself.

, Use one drop of essential oils or 1/2 teaspoon of dried herb for each quart of water (like you have in your facial steam pot, if using). To test any herb or essential oil for sensitivity, steam your face for one minute, then remove yourself and wait 10 minutes. If you don't notice a reaction, reheat the water and repeat the steaming. The following essential oils have either antibacterial, antifungal or antiseptic properties (meaning they can kill bacteria and other microorganisms that can infect the sinuses):


Spearmint or peppermint: Peppermint or spearmint may be irritating to some. Both peppermint and spearmint contain menthol which has antiseptic and immune-boosting properties.Thyme or oregano: These herbs boost the immune system and have antibacterial properties. Both increase circulation of the blood by opening up blood vessels.Lavender: This dried plant and oil is soothing and can help with anxiety and depression. It also has antibacterial properties.Black walnut oil, tea tree oil, oregano oil, and sage oil: These can treat a fungal sinus infection and they have antiseptic properties., If you don't want to use essential oils, you can use cooking herbs. Place 1 quart of water in a pot, bring it to a boil, turn off the heat and add 2 teaspoons of oregano and 2 teaspoons of basil. For added heat, you can add a pinch of cayenne pepper. Cover your head with a towel and breathe in the steam through your nose (and your mouth, especially if you have a sore throat or a throat infection). Do this as long as the steam is rising.


Like any of the steam treatments, the water can be reused. Simply reheat it till it begins to steam.

, Run a bath using water that's as hot as you can comfortably manage. Add 12 to 15 drops of one essential oil or a combination of oils. Soak for as long as you like and breathe in the steam.


You should get lots of rest if you experience chronic sinusitis. Soaking in a bath is a great way to relax.

, Another way to make sure your sinuses don't dry out is to invest in a humidifier or vaporizer. This can be especially useful if you live in a very dry environment, or during the winter when heating systems can cause your sinuses to dry out.Clean portable humidifier units daily, wiping all surfaces dry and filling the water tank with fresh water. If you do not keep your humidifier clean, mold and bacteria can begin to grow and they will be dispersed into the air and breathed in when the humidifier is running.Don't let the humidity in your house reach above 50%.Run the humidifier or vaporizer only when necessary.
To get the same effect you can also run a hot shower with the bathroom door closed and breathe in the steam.

Take antibiotics to treat kidney infections.,
Get plenty of rest while recovering from a kidney infection.,
Drink lots of fluids to help pass smaller kidney stones.,
Get a prescription for a medication that can help break down larger kidney stones.,
Visit your doctor often to get ultrasounds done for early detection of kidney tumors.,
Talk to your nephrologist about kidney cancer treatment if you have cancer or think you are likely to develop it.",How to Treat Horseshoe Kidney2," Horseshoe kidneys are prone to bacterial infection. You will have to have your urine examined to figure out what bacteria is in your kidney. You will then have to get a prescription for an antibiotic that will get rid of the infection. It is important that you finish your whole antibiotic treatment, even if you start feeling better within the first couple of days. If you stop too soon, the infection may come back.Some of the common antibiotics used for kidney infection include Ciprofloxacin and a combination of Amoxycillin and Clavulanic, which is called Augmentin.

, If you are taking antibiotics for a kidney infection, you should rest as much as possible. Take work or school off and rest so that your body can heal itself. Do not do any heavy lifting, and try to stay put in a bed or on the couch.Getting rest will speed up your recovery process and help the antibiotic medication to do its job.

, The more hydrated you are, the more urine your body will produce. If the kidney stone you are dealing with is small enough, filling your body with water and other fluids could flush the stone out with your urine. Drink upwards of 10 glasses of water a day to really hydrate yourself and see if you can flush the stone out.If you get bored drinking water, add some fruit juice, like lemon, to the water to give it some flavor. You could also drink hydration sports drinks like Gatorade or Powerade. Coconut water is also a good option for hydration.

, There are some medications that can enter your system and break down your kidney stone. One of these medications is Allopurinol, which can break down uric acid stones.


If your kidney stones are too large for medication to have much of an effect, your doctor may also suggest Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) to break up the kidneys. During this procedure, high-energy sound waves are sent through the spot where your kidney stone is. The kidney stone will get broken up but the rest of your body will remain unharmed., If you have a horseshoe kidney, it's a good idea to set up regular appointments with your doctor to make sure that you do not have any tumors developing. Doctors use ultrasounds to check out your kidney and make sure that it is tumor-free.


You may want to consider setting appointments up for every six months or so, just to be on the safe side. Talk to your doctor about the amount of visits he or she thinks is necessary based on your medical history.

, Your doctor will take your age, health, and medical history into consideration when determining the best way to fight the cancer.


The two most common forms of treatment are chemotherapy and radiation. Your doctor may also choose to do a combination of both therapies.

Consider surgery as your last option.,
Get kidney stones removed during the kidney separation procedure.,
Have kidney tumors removed surgically.,
Repair a bent ureter with surgery.",How to Treat Horseshoe Kidney3," Surgery should only be considered as a last resort if you are suffering from several conditions due to your horseshoe kidney. The risk of the surgery done to separate the two kidneys is actually very high, so it is only done in very severe cases. For the most part, surgery is done to fix conditions caused by horseshoe kidney, and is done less often to actually separate the kidneys.The surgery to separate a horseshoe kidney involves three separate surgeries in which a surgeon will work to separate, repair damage, and reconstruct your kidneys.

, If you suffer from frequent kidney stones and choose to have your kidneys surgically separated, the surgeon will remove your kidney stones at the same time.


Again, having surgery done to separate kidneys is risky, so you should consider getting the kidney stones removed via medication and safer surgical practices (see Method 2 for more information).

, If a kidney tumor, particularly a cancerous tumor, is found it will have to be removed surgically to make sure that it does not cause your kidney further complications. Talk to your doctor about the different procedures available and what would work best for you based on your medical history.During a kidney tumor removal, the tumor will be dissected and the surrounding tissue will be removed.

, Ureteropelvic Junction “UPJ” Obstruction can occur in people who have horseshoe kidney. Because your kidneys are joined, your ureter (the duct that carries urine from your kidney to your bladder) can be in a position where it becomes bent or kinked. Surgery will be done to correct this so that your urine can flow in a normal way through your body.


It is important to get surgery if you have UPJ obstruction because it can cause your kidney to dilate (open up) and can lead to cause abdominal pains, nausea, side back pain, weakness and severe colic. You may also see blood in your urine. It can also lead to a series of kidney infections.

Choose an essential oil.,
Prepare a Neti pot solution.,
Irrigate using a Neti pot.,
Use a nasal saline spray.,
Use a diffuser.",How to Treat Chronic Sinusitis2," Whether you use a diffuser or the Neti pot, you can use the distilled essences and fragrances (aromatherapy) of various plants to help treat your sinus infection. The essential oils used most commonly for sinus infections are:


Eucalyptus
Menthol
Lavender
Sweet basil
Oregano
Rosemary
Peppermint
Tea tree
Rose geranium
Pine
Clove
Lemon
Chamomile

, In a small bowl, add 1 and 1/2 cups of very warm (but not so hot that you scald your nasal tissues) distilled water, 6 tablespoons of finely ground unprocessed sea salt, and nine to 10 drops of essential oils, if you're using them. Stir the mixture well to dissolve the salt. Add the liquid to your Neti pot and let it cool before using.


If you'd like to use more than one kind of essential oil, just be sure to use an equal number of drops so that the total number of drops equals nine or 10.
Sea salt protects your nasal tissues.
Never use tap water or water that hasn't been filtered, distilled, or sterilized by boiling for at least one minute., Bend forward over a sink and tilt your head to one side. Breathe through your mouth to close your nose and throat off from the solution. Insert the neti pot spout into your upper nostril and slowly pour the solution so that it runs through and out of your lower nostril. Use half of the solution.Repeat this process with the other nostril and use the rest of the solution.
Blow your nose when you're finished to get the remaining fluid out of your nose.

, If you don't have a Neti pot or don't feel comfortable using one, try a simple nasal saline spray, available at any pharmacy. You can also make your own at home, though you must be careful to get the right proportions of salt to water, or you could end up drying out your skin (use about one teaspoon of salt per pint of water). Use the saline spray to keep your sinuses hydrated while you are on the go.


Irrigating your sinuses using a Neti pot is more effective in treating sinusitis than a nasal spray, but it can be intimidating at first.You may want to begin with a spray and gradually move to the Neti pot.
Nasal saline sprays have the benefit of being ultra portable. Throw one in your purse or bag or keep one at work.

, If more than one member of your family has a sinus infection, consider using a diffuser. This will dispense essential oils throughout a room. Anyone with a sinus infection should sit as close as possible to the diffuser. Choose an essential oil and follow the manufacturer's instructions on your machine.Most diffusers suggest using 1/2 cup of water with three to five drops of essential oils.

Massage your forehead.,
Massage near your nose.,
Massage your cheekbones to relieve congestion and pain.,
Do a nasal sinus massage.",How to Treat Chronic Sinusitis3," Rub a quarter-sized amount of castor, almond, or baby oil between your fingers to warm them. Place both of your index fingers in the center of your forehead, between the brows. Massage your forehead in a circular motion, moving from the center out towards the temples. Repeat this 10 times using constant and firm pressure.


The oil helps to lessen the friction caused by your fingertips rubbing against your face. Scented oils can be soothing and relaxing as well.
Massaging the sinuses and the tissues surrounding the sinuses can help relieve pressure and help drain mucus-filled sinuses., Place your thumbs on the bridge of your nose, just next to the inner corner of your eyes. Apply constant, firm pressure to the area for one minute, then move your fingers in a circular motion for an extra two minutes.Keep your eyes closed. If you are using an oil, make sure you don’t get oil into your eyes. Oil isn't harmful but it could make your vision temporarily blurry.


For some, using the index finger may be more comfortable. Using the thumbs is recommended because they tend to be somewhat stronger than other fingers.

, Rub about a quarter-sized amount of castor, almond, or baby oil between your fingers. Place your thumbs (or, if you prefer, the index and middle finger) on both sides of your cheeks, next to your nose.Apply constant, firm pressure on the area for one minute, then move your fingers in a circular motion for an additional two minutes. Keep your eyes closed.


You can also start by massaging the outer part of your cheekbone, near your ears. Massage in a circular motion and move your fingers along the cheekbone towards your nose. Repeat this 10 times.
If you are using an oil, make sure you don’t get oil into your eyes. Oil can temporarily blur your vision if it gets in your eyes.

, Rub a bit of oil between your fingers until they warm up. Use your index finger to stroke along the sides of your nose, moving them downward. Repeat this 10 times. Then, place your fingers on the bridge of your nose and apply constant and firm pressure. Massage in a circular motion, repeating this action 10 times.Massaging your nose in a downward motion can promote drainage.
You can add essential oils based on what you need. For example, antibacterial essential oils can be used if you have a bacterial sinus infection while essential oils that help loosen and break up the mucus in the sinuses can relieve the pressure by increasing drainage.

Determine the cause of your sinusitis.,
Consider your symptoms.,
Take decongestants.,
Try a nasal corticosteroid.,
Know when to see your doctor.,
Take antivirals, antifungals, or antibiotics.,
Consider surgery.",How to Treat Chronic Sinusitis4," Chronic sinusitis can be caused by infections (viral, bacterial or fungal), structural abnormalities (like polyps or a deviated septum), trauma, allergies, smoking or immune system dysfunction. To determine a cause for your sinusitis, look at the discharge. Viral infections and allergies usually create clear discharge. But, bacterial, fungal, or molds can cause a cloudy and yellowish-green discharge. Chronic sinusitis from other causes can be clear or yellowish-green.Your doctor may recommend a CT scan to evaluate the cause of chronic sinusitis.
Figuring the cause of your sinusitis can help you choose the correct treatments. For example, sinusitis caused by a bacterial infection may need prescription antibiotics.
If your doctor suspects your sinusitis is due to allergies, she may recommend you get tested so that you can better avoid the allergens which trigger your symptoms. In addition, you can then talk to your doctor about using prescription or over-the-counter allergy medications to control symptoms.

, Symptoms of chronic sinusitis vary from person to person. Pay attention to your symptoms, since you may be able to treat some of them with over-the-counter medications. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis include:Swollen sinuses (from inflammation or infection)
Pain
Pressure in the face
Headaches
Loss of smell
Cough
Congestion
Sore throat (if the mucus drains into the throat)
Fever
Bad breath
Dental pain
Fatigue

, Over-the-counter medications are available to treat sinusitis. You can take decongestants according to the manufacturer's instructions to reduce congestion. Some decongestants are available in nasal sprays. These may reduce swelling. Do not use nasal decongestants for more than three days or they can create rebound congestion, where the congestion returns worse than before. Side effects for decongestants include:Increased heart rate
Increased blood pressure
Insomnia
Anxiety
Nervousness and irritability
Dry mouth
Blurry vision
Difficulty urinating

, Nasal corticosteroids — such as fluticasone, budesonide, and mometasone — can help treat and prevent inflammation, making it easier for you to breathe.Many are available by prescription only, but Flonase and Nasacort can be purchased over-the-counter.This can be an especially helpful treatment if you suffer from allergies.


It can take a few days to a few weeks for nasal corticosteroids to work.
Side effects may include headache, sore throat, nosebleed, or cough., If you've tried several remedies at home and get no relief after four or five days, start running a fever, have facial puffiness, have increased pain, or have bad breath for no clear reason, you should make an appointment with your physician. You may be dealing with a more complicated health issue.Steam treatments, massage, Neti pots, and diffusers can all be used along with pain relievers, antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal treatments for infections of the sinuses.

, Your doctor may prescribe antivirals, antifungals, or antibiotics if your sinusitis is caused by a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. These medications should decrease the infection and inflammation and keep your sinuses draining.One problem with antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals is that they don’t get into the sinuses very well so they may not be very effective. A longer course of treatment may be helpful.

, Your doctor may recommend surgery if your sinusitis is caused by polyps, a deviated septum or an injury. The openings of your sinuses can be enlarged or nasal polyps and growths can be removed. These surgeries can improve sinus drainage.Surgery can correct any anatomic or structural problems inside your nose and sinuses.

Drink eight or more glasses of water a day.,
Eat a high fiber diet.,
Avoid straining yourself or picking up heavy objects.,

Stop smoking.,
Talk to your doctor about Colace, the most recommended stool softener.,
Ask your doctor about other brands of stool softener like Senna (Senokot, Ex-Lax) and Bisacodyl (Correctol, Doxidan, Dulcolax).The prescribed adult dose (19 and older) for Senna is two tablets (17.2 mg) orally at bedtime once a day, with or without food.,
Let your doctor know if you are taking other drugs or medications.,

Get your infant checked for an umbilical hernia.,
If you have recently had abdominal surgery, be wary of an incisional hernia.,
If possible, get a laparoscopic surgery.,
If you have intestinal movement, you will need open surgery.,
Remember that you will be under local or general anesthesia during the surgery.",How to Treat Constipation After Hernia Surgery," Constipation usually occurs because there is an insufficient amount of water in your stool, making it hard and difficult to pass. This happens when the peristalsis (muscle contractions)of the intestines stops due to the effect of the general anesthesia used during hernia surgery.


Increasing your fluid intake may help to soften the stool and prevent you from straining during a bowel movement.;
, Fiber-rich food prevents constipation by pulling water from the colon, which makes the stool softer and easier to pass.


Make sure you have a daily fiber intake of at least 21 gramsby eating foods like: raspberries, apples, pears, bananas, oranges, figs, strawberries, raisins, popcorn, brown rice, barley, oatmeal, bread, lentils, almonds, pistachios, green peas, broccoli, turnips, brussel sprouts, tomatoes, carrots and potatoes.
You can also take Metamucil, a fiber laxative and supplement. Metamucil can be taken after eating or on an empty stomach. Have a glass of water after you drink Metamucil for better absorption.
Men, 19 years and older can take 38 g/day. Women, 19 years and older can take 25 g/day. Pregnant and lactating women should consult with their doctor before taking Metamucil. Pregnant woman are usually prescribed 28 g/day and lactating women are usually prescribed 29 g/day.If approved by their doctor, children can also take Metamucil. Children 1-3 years old can take 19 g/day; children 4-8 years old can take 25 g/day. Boys 9-13 years old can take 31 g/day; girls 9-13 years old can take 26 g/day. Boys 14-18 years old can take 38 g/day and girls 14-18 years old can take 26 g/day., You do not want to strain yourself or lift heavy objects, especially the first few weeks after surgery, as this can cause the surgical incisions to tear.

, Light exercise like walking will help to reduce the time it takes for food to move into the large intestine. This will ensure the water absorbed from the stool is limited. Exercises also stimulate the natural contraction of the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract. If these muscles contract efficiently, the stools will move out much quicker.


Exercise an hour after a meal as this will force blood flow to increase towards the stomach and the intestines, which will then help your body to properly digest the food.Walk for at least 15-30 minutes a day at a slow pace so you do not disrupt the surgical site.Do not do any strenuous activities like running, jogging, or playing contact sports during the first four weeks after surgery, as these actions can possibly rupture the surgical incision.
Bedridden patients can dangle their feet on the bed and do arm and feet circling for at least 30 to 45 minutes daily to help promote the return of peristalsis (muscle contractions) in the gastrointestinal tract.The early return of peristalsis can help reduce constipation.

, Smoking cigarettes can further reduce the peristaltic movement of the intestines, which are already depressed due to the general anesthesia used during hernia surgery. The nicotine in cigarettes is a potent vasoconstrictor, which means it makes your blood vessels constrict or narrow, thus reducing blood flow to the intestines.


If blood flow is reduced, then digestion and peristalsis or the rhythmic movement of the intestines are also reduced. This causes the digested food to remain in the intestines for a longer period of time. During this time, the colon continues to absorb water from the digested food, which will lead to a firmer or hard stool and constipation.

, Do not self-medicate. Some stool softeners can cause intestinal bleeding, dependency and can alter the normal environment of the gastrointestinal tract if they are used for too long. Consulting with your doctor will help you find the right stool softener to treat your constipation.


Colace works by increasing the amount of water that the stool absorbs, making is softer and easier to pass.
The ideal dosage of Colace is 50 to 500 mg once a day., Do not exceed two tablets a day and do not take Senna for more than a week, unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor.


Patients 2-6 years old should take half a tablet (4.3 mg) of Senna orally at bedtime, and not exceed half a tablet a day. Patients 6-12 years old should take one tablet (8.6 mg) orally at bedtime and not exceed one tablet a day. Patients 13-18 years old should take two tablets (17.2 mg) orally at bedtime and should not exceed four tablets a day.
Senna should only used by pregnant and breastfeeding women if it is prescribed by their doctor.The prescribed adult dose (18 and older) for Bisacodyl is usually 5 to 15 mg (1 to 3 tablets) orally once a day, with or without food. Do not exceed more than 15 mg a day.
Children under 18 and pregnant and breastfeeding women are usually not prescribed with this medication unless otherwise prescribed by the doctor.

, Taking laxatives can affect your body’s ability to absorb other drugs such as antacids, mineral oils, castor oils, antibiotics, blood thinners, heart and bone medications, so always check with your doctor to find the right laxative prescription for you., The pressure of straining during a bowel movement can damage or reopen the wound in your hernia, resulting in blood in your stool.

, Prolonged straining may cause swelling in the veins of the anus. This can also tear the anal structure, especially if a large and hard stool is passed.

, These may all be signs of an infection., When stools are not passed, they stay in the intestines and can block the intestinal opening. This leads to an accumulation of more stools in the impacted part of the intestines and can restrict blood flow, thereby killing the tissues in it. If this occurs, the surrounding pain receptors will be activated and you will likely experience unbearable or excruciating pain.

, An inguinal hernia is common in men because the inguinal canal does not close properly, creating a weakened spot that is prone to hernias. Normally, a man’s testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly after birth and the canal closes almost completely behind them. An inguinal hernia develops when the intestines push through the inguinal canal.


In men and women, the inguinal canal is found in the groin area. In men, it is the area where the spermatic cord, which holds up the testicles, passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. In women, the inguinal canal contains a ligament that helps to hold the uterus in place.

, This type of hernia causes gastroesophageal reflux, a burning sensation that occurs due to the leakage of a person’s stomach contents back into their esophagus.


A hiatal hernia is most common in people over 50 years old.
Congenital birth defects may cause a child to develop a hiatal hernia.

, Babies under six months old develop an umbilical hernia if their intestines protrude through the abdominal wall near the belly button. If you notice a bulge or swelling near your child’s belly button when he cries, he may have an umbilical hernia.


Umbilical hernias usually go away on their own, once the child reaches one year old.
If the hernia is still present after the child turns one, surgery will be required to correct the hernia.

, An incisional hernia occurs when the intestines push through an incision scar or weakened tissue after abdominal surgery.

, This type of surgery causes less damage to the surrounding tissue and requires a shorter recovery period. However, there is a risk of hernia recurrence.


This procedure uses a tiny camera and miniaturized surgical equipment to repair the hernia using small incisions. The hernia is repaired by sewing the hole to close the abdominal wall. A surgical mesh is also used to patch the hole.

, This type of surgery is done for hernias where a portion of the intestines has moved down into the scrotum. A part of the scrotum or groin may be incised to retrieve and reposition the intestine. Then, it is closed using stitches.


Open surgery requires a longer recovery process. But, the patient can resume his normal daily activities six weeks after surgery.

, Hernia surgery is usually performed as an outpatient procedure. The surgeon repositions the herniated tissue and, if strangulation has occurred, removes the oxygen-starved part of the organ. The damaged muscle wall will frequently be repaired with synthetic mesh or tissue.

Being the most alarming symptom, reducing pain is the main goal of the therapy. However, keep in mind that all pain medications are gastric irritants and need to be taken with food.


Tylenol is a common, popular example of acetaminophen. This medication relieves pain perception but does not reduce the inflammation of the joints. Taking 2 gel caps of Tylenol every 8 hours orally may help reduce pain in your joints, but it's best to follow your doctor's opinion when it comes to appropriate dosage.;
, Degenerative arthritis causes pain following inflammation. Unlike acetaminophen, these drugs reduce both pain and inflammation in the joints and are usually used in place of steroids.


Examples of these are Naproxen and Ibuprofen, both taken orally on an as needed basis every 8 hours. Stronger NSAIDs require a doctor’s prescription since they can cause side effects that include stomach upset, cardiovascular problems, liver and kidney damage. Talk to your doctor for specific dosage information.

, Steroids reduce both pain and inflammation in arthritis; however, know that they may also predispose you to immunosuppression and edema (swelling). Because of these side effects, talk to your doctor beforehand to see if they're safe and appropriate for you.


Dexamethasone and hydrocortisone are common steroids available, also taken on an as needed basis. However, do not taken them for 3 consecutive days to avoid gastric irritation.

, These are intended for the relief of more severe pain and should be taken according to prescription due to the risk of drug dependence. Common side effects include sleepiness, nausea and constipation. Because of this, they are only available by prescription and treatment should be monitored carefully.


Narcotics such as Lortab have great pain relieving power but also have addictive consequences. Dosage depends on the physician's order, so consult your doctor before taking this drug.
Do not use narcotics when you have consumed alcohol or acetaminophen because of a high possibility of liver damage.

, This is an individualized exercise program aimed at strengthening the joints and muscles. It can also restore your ability to make normal movements by improving blood circulation to the area of the affected joint. These exercises, when done correctly, can even divert attention from pain. The common exercises done by a physical therapist include, but are not limited to, the following:


Fingers, hand and arm rotation
Feet, knee and leg rotation
Flexion and extension of the arms and legs

, Strategy training is an occupational therapy approach with the objective of identifying specific barriers that may be hindering you from participating in regular physical activity and exercise. A solution can be found by your occupational therapist once the specific barriers are identified.A common part of physical and occupational therapy is the use of immobilization devices. Your doctor may recommend the application of splints, braces or shoe inserts to help you in maintaining stability of your damaged joints. It can also provide extra support to avoid further injury.

, If the pain is unrelenting and medication doesn't seem to be helping, your doctor may be able to recommend a number of further, albeit more serious, procedures. Talk to him or her about these options:



Cortisone shots. This is a procedure performed by doctors to relieve pain in the joint. It begins by application of local anesthesia to numb the area. A needle is then inserted into the joint spaces and the drug is injected.

Lubrication injections. These are used to provide cushion around the knee that resembles the function of a regular joint fluid. Examples are Hyalgan and Synvisc.

Bone realignment. This is an invasive procedure technically called osteotomy. It is performed by cutting across the knee bone to reposition the leg. It lessens knee pain by keeping body weight away from the damaged joint.

Joint replacement. Arthroplasty is done by removing damaged joint surfaces and replacing it with plastic or metal prostheses.

, According to the Arthritis Organization, there is a strong link between fatty consumption and arthritis. Reducing your fat intake should help you reduce your weight – a necessary measure to reduce the stress in your joints. This reduction of stress leads to less pain and fewer symptoms of degenerative arthritis.


Examples of bad fats:

Fats from meat, like fried chicken, pork, and beef
French fries, potato chips
Cakes, candy, milk chocolate


Examples of good fats:

Avocado
Olive, sunflower, and flaxseed oil
Walnuts, almonds, and other unsalted nuts



, According to the Arthritis Research UK foundation, consumption of fish that is rich in omega-3s will help with the progression of inflammation in arthritis.In one study it also showed that consuming foods that are rich in omega-3 stimulates the regeneration of the cartilage of the bones.


Salmon, mackerel, herring, and tuna are good natural sources of omega-3s. However, you can also find them in supplement form. Talk to your doctor about what supplements (and how much) you should consider.

, Citrus, sweet peppers and other foods with rich Vitamin C content should be eaten to help your bones, tissues, and joints repair. Vitamin C is one of the components of collagen formation – it's a necessary nutrient in all types of tissue repair. In degenerative arthritis, connections from bone to bone have already deteriorated, making hastened repair all the more necessary.


A consumption of 1,500 mg-2,400 mg of worth of vitamin C every day helps with the tissue repair of the body.For the record, one small orange has just over 50 mg of vitamin C.

, Proper pacing of daily activities should be considered to balance adequate periods of rest and work. Try to rest damaged joints for 12 to 24 hours. In order to best pace yourself, the following guidelines can aid you:



Know your activity limits. This will serve as your baseline in knowing what activities can worsen your symptoms.

Have a record. This can help you know how many hours and what types of activities you can safely do.

Schedule your routine. Schedule your rest and activities at the same time in an organized manner.

Prioritize your work. Assess which things need to be done first and ranked them according to their importance in order to utilize your energy wisely.

, While you do have joint pain, that does not excuse you from doing exercises. In fact, exercises strengthen our bones. Just make sure you keep that at a low intensity and keep most of the stress off your affected joints.


Good exercises include swimming, walking and biking for 30 minutes at least three times a week. Jogging must be avoided because it causes a lot of stress on the leg joints., These exercises are focused on reinforcing strength, and improving general physical disability, depression and quality of life. However, they must be well planned to prevent future episodes of muscle rigidity and tenderness.


Examples of these exercises are lifting weights, strength training, and core workouts, like yoga. Studies show that engaging in these exercises can aid in restoring balance in the neurochemicals in the body by boosting the production of endorphins – also known as the happy hormone responsible for elevating your mood, reducing anxiety and depression and fighting pain.

, Heat and cold application can be used to alleviate pain. Heat targets stiffness and cold targets muscle spasm and pain.You can apply either as needed or when the pain occurs.


Ice packs need to be wrapped in a cloth or in a bag to keep from damaging your skin tissue. Place it on the affected area for 10-15 minutes every 2 to 3 hours. Any longer and you risk numbing your skin and creating skin damage.
Remember to measure the temperature of any hot or cold pack before using it, especially if you're elderly – the older you are, the more diminished your sense of touch, making you at risk for burns.

, Being overweight or obese puts a lot of stress and tension on your joints. Through a healthy diet and safe exercises, weight can and will come off. Just remember to do it gradually – sudden weight loss is neither healthy nor sustainable.


The ideal body weight for each person varies. Talk to your doctor about what your ideal weight is and what your diet and exercise routine should look like in order for you to meet your weight loss goals.

, Osteoarthritis may be diagnosed through several tools or procedures, including the following:



Clinical exam. A complete assessment of the affected joint and its surrounding parts is done. Presence of swelling, redness, tenderness and limited range of motion are evaluated.

Laboratory work. Examination of blood samples or joint fluid specimens is performed to rule out other possible conditions. This is generally done under a microscope.

X-rays or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This is performed to have a clearer view of the present condition of the involved joint or cartilage. Presence of unusual bone growths is also checked.

, Osteoarthritis can be related to two different types of osteoarthritis: primary and secondary. Here are the differences:



Primary Osteoarthritis. This is associated with the normal process of aging that may be due to certain things such as metabolic, chemical, mechanical and genetic factors. It is generally known as the “wear and tear disease” that is also affected by lifestyle factors.Secondary Osteoarthritis. This type usually follows a predisposing event like trauma, obesity and congenital deformity that leads to degenerative alteration.

, There are several things that can place an individual at greater possibility of acquiring the disease. They are as follows:



Age. As an individual ages, chances of developing the disease also increase. Incidence of disease usually begins at middle age and gradually progresses as you get older.

Sex. Women are more likely to develop the disease, usually after the age of 55.

Bone deformities. Some individuals have inborn malformations or defects that involve the joints and cartilage which places them at higher risk of acquiring the disease.

Joint injuries. Damages to the joint that happen after extreme contact from sports or any accidents may increase the probability of osteoarthritis.
Obesity. An excessive amount of body weight places greater pressure or stress to certain body parts like the knees, thus leading to osteoarthritis.

Certain occupations. Some jobs may place extreme stress on particular joints due to repetitive movements that may possibly result in the progression of the disease.

Underlying diseases. Individuals diagnosed with underactive thyroid, gout, diabetes or Paget’s disease of the bone are considered to be prone to the osteoarthritis.

, Signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis may vary depending upon the severity or site of involvement. It may include one or more of the following:



Joint pain. This usually comes after an activity such as exercise or weight bearing. The pain can be different in various persons, but it can be generally described as achy, sharp, stinging and like ""pins and needles.""Stiffness. A damaged joint may feel rigid particularly in the morning and after exercise. Joint stiffness is caused by inflammation in the synovium, the lining of the joint.Swelling. Cartilage acts as a cushion for the bones and prevents each bone from rubbing against each other. Once the cartilage loses its normal function, the bones will rub against each other causing irritation and leading to swelling.

Tenderness. The joint may feel tender, especially if gentle pressure is applied. The tenderness is caused by the swelling in the lining of the joints and surrounding tissues.

Grating sensation of the joint. Affected individuals may feel or hear the sound of friction between bones during motion. Damaged cartilage is unable to act as a cushion for the bones to prevent rubbing. What happens is that the bones rub against each other, resulting in a grating sound.

Limited movements. Activities may be impaired especially during attacks of pain. You may notice a slightly altered gait a well.

Growths or bumps. Presence of unusual lumps in the joint may indicate affliction of osteoarthritis. In more severe cases, progressive destruction and misalignment of the joint occurs. Bumps may develop at the base of the thumb as the metacarpal moves out of the saddle joint."

Check for skin discoloration.,
Check for bleeding or other fluids.,
Take stock of your condition.,
Visit your doctor.,
Determine the seriousness of the bedsores.",How to Treat Bedsores1," Take a close look all over your body, paying special attention to the places that rest against a bed or wheelchair. Use a mirror or ask someone to help you look at your backside, which may be hard to see yourself.Also check for skin that is tough to the touch.;
, If the bedsore is bleeding or seeping fluid from it, you may have fairly serious bedsores and need to consult a doctor immediately to prevent further damage and to manage pain.An offensive odor may indicate infection in the wound, in which case you should see a doctor immediately.

, Before visiting the doctor, you should be prepared with answers to a variety of questions you may be asked.Questions might include:


How long has the skin discoloration been present?
How painful is your skin in these areas?
Have you had a recurring fever?
Have you had bedsores before?
How frequently are you changing positions or moving around?
What is your diet like?
How much water do you drink every day?

, The doctor will ask you questions about your health, the nature of the sore areas, your diet and other topics. They will also conduct a physical examination, looking at your body and paying close attention to areas that are noticeably sore, discolored or tough to the touch. They may also take urine and blood samples to rule out particular conditions and to assess your overall health., There are 4 stages into which bedsores can be categorized. Stages I and II are less serious and can be treated and healed. Stages III and IV require medical intervention and possibly surgery to treat properly.Stage I: The skin has some level of discoloration but there is no open wound. For lighter complexions, the skin may look red; for darker complexions, the skin may look blue, purple or even white.

Stage II: There is an open wound that is still shallow. The edges of the wound are infected or have dead tissue.

Stage III: The wound is wide open and deep. It extends below the top layer of skin into the fat tissue layers. It may have fluid or pus in the wound.

Stage IV: The wound is large, affecting several layers of skin tissue. Muscle or bone may be exposed, and there may be eschar, which is a dark substance that indicates necrotic (dead) tissue.

Relieve pressure on existing sores.,
Reposition your body frequently.,
Keep as active as possible.,
Use support surfaces and protective padding.,
Maintain adequate blood circulation.,
Choose comfortable clothing.,
Change sheets often.,
Control pain with ibuprofen.",How to Treat Bedsores2," If you have a sore that has developed, reposition the body and make sure you stay off that sore spot for at least 2-3 days. If the redness does not go away, check with your doctor to consider additional treatment options.

, If you are confined to a bed or wheelchair, you need to reposition your body frequently throughout the day to relieve existing pressure on sores and to prevent bedsores from developing. Reposition the body every 2 hours in a bed or every hour in a wheelchair. This will relieve pressure that builds up on certain areas, which will help bedsores from getting worse.

, Even though someone who is bed bound or wheelchair-bound may not be very active, their body can still be moved around. This will prevent pressure from building up in certain areas and will increase blood flow through the body. Activity can also improve mental health, a crucial component in maintaining your overall health.

, The key to reducing risk of bedsores is to reduce pressure that builds up on particular parts of the body. Use special cushions that are made of foam or filled with air or water can be useful. Similarly, protective padding may help, especially between knees or under the head or elbows.Some support products such as doughnut-type products might actually increase the risk of developing bedsores. Check with your doctor to determine which products are best for you.

, Bedsores develop in part from inadequate blood flow to the skin areas. When pressure is applied to the skin, blood vessels are restricted from doing their job. Maintain good blood flow by drinking lots of water, not smoking, and repositioning your body.


If you have diabetes, this might contribute to lower blood circulation. Work with your doctor to strategize how to improve blood circulation.

, Wear clothing that is not too tight or too loose, both of which can cause rubbing and irritation. Change clothing every day to ensure that skin is kept clean too. Wear cotton-based materials that do not have heavy seams.

, For those who are bedbound, having clean sheets will ensure that bacteria will not aggravate bedsores. Bed linens may also get sweaty and irritate the skin. Changing the bedding on a frequent basis will help eliminate this risk.

, Take either over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to reduce pain. Choose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication, rather than aspirin, acetaminophen or opioids.


Take ibuprofen before or after you reposition your body, when you undergo a debridement procedure, or when your wounds are getting cleaned. These can help reduce pain that you might feel."
"
Inspect your skin every day.,
Keep the skin clean.,
Clean and dress wounds.,
Get a debridement procedure.,
Treat infections with antibiotics.,
Monitor how sores are healing.",How to Treat Bedsores3," Bedsores can emerge rapidly and need to be addressed as soon as they are identified. Pay special attention to the parts of your body that lay against the bed or wheelchair, or that rub against other parts of the body or clothing.


Pay special attention to the lower back, tailbone, foot heel, hips, buttocks, knees, back of the head, elbows and ankles., For early stage bedsores, wash the affected area gently with soap and water. Pat the area dry (do not rub) with a towel. Pay close attention to skin that may be prone to sweating or soiling. Moisturize with lotion to keep from getting dry skin.


Bedsores that develop on the buttocks or near the groin may be prone to getting feces or urine on them. Use protective and/or waterproof bandages over the bedsore area to eliminate this risk.

, A wound should be cleaned and wrapped with fresh dressing. A wound may be irrigated with saline (salt water solution) to clean it out before being redressed.Consult a healthcare professional before doing this; they may prefer to do this procedure themselves.


Do not use antiseptics like iodine or hydrogen peroxide on bedsores. These can actually hamper the healing process.There are different types of bandages or dressing materials that can be used. Clear film or hydrogel can help a Stage I bedsore heal quickly and should be changed every 3-7 days. Other bandages may allow for more air to circulate or to protect from other fluids such as feces, urine or blood., Debridement means the cutting away of dead flesh, which is performed by a doctor. This should be a relatively painless process, since the flesh does not have any live nerves, although there may be sensitivity since the dead flesh is next to flesh with nerves. Bedsores in later stages may require this procedure. Check with your doctor to determine the best approach to healing bedsores.

, A doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic that can be applied right onto the bedsore in order to stop the spread of infection and to help your body heal. The doctor may also give oral antibiotics, especially if the bedsore is at a later stage.If you have developed osteomyelitis, or a bone infection, you may need to take a long course of antibiotic medication. It may require more involved intervention from a doctor., Keep a close eye on how the sores are healing to make sure that they are clearing up and not getting worse. If the condition does not appear to be healing, consult your doctor.

Eat plenty of vitamin-rich foods.,
Keep your body hydrated.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Do not smoke.",How to Treat Bedsores4," Having good nutrition is vital to keeping your body healthy and keeping bedsores at bay. When you are healthy, your body can help heal bedsores more quickly and keep new ones from developing. If you are deficient in certain vitamins, especially iron, zinc, vitamin A and vitamin C, you may put yourself at higher risk for developing bedsores. Take vitamin supplements in addition to eating foods rich in vitamins.Eating lots of protein will also help keep your body healthy.

, Drink plenty of water every day. Men should aim to consume about 13 8-ounce cups of fluids and women should aim to consume about 9 8-ounce cups of fluids per day.This does not mean you need to drink only water. Many foods have high water content, and healthy foods can have up to 20% of your daily intake of fluids.Eat foods that also have high water content, such as watermelon, to increase your water intake.


You can also get added hydration by sucking on ice cubes throughout the day in addition to drinking water.
Do not drink alcohol, as this can contribute to dehydrating your body.

, If you are underweight, you have less padding to protect certain parts of your body that are prone to developing bedsores. Your skin can break down more easily. Being overweight can similarly cause problems, as it may be difficult for you to reposition your body to relieve pressure., Smoking contributes to drying out your skin and is generally considered an unhealthy habit. As well, it reduces blood circulation, a condition which can contribute to increased risk of bedsores."

Blow cool air in the cast with a hair dryer.,
Generate vibrations by knocking or tapping your cast.,
Massage the exposed skin near the cast.,
Cool down your cast quickly with an ice pack.,
Discuss medications with your doctor.,
Avoid using tools that may lead to infection, or get trapped in your cast.,
Limit your use of powder or lotions.,
Stop pulling at, or tearing, your cast's lining.,
Keep your cast away from water.,
Reduce sweating or excess perspiration.,
Restrict your cast from getting dirt, mud, or sand inside.,
Seek medical attention when there are bigger problems.",How to Scratch Under Your Cast," The hair dryer must be on a cool setting, as warm or hot air may worsen symptoms or burn skin. Blow the air from the dryer between the cast and your skin., Using a wooden spoon or your hand, vibrations to your cast may help relieve an itchy sensation. Vibrations through knocking are safer than sticking objects inside your cast for relief. , By massaging the skin nearby the itch, there may be some relief. Be careful when massaging exposed skin near your cast to avoid painful areas. The massage may generate sensations on the skin that redirect your focus away from the itch.


Massage also increases circulation in the area of the cast, which will speed up healing.

, By wrapping a water-tight ice pack around your cast, the cooling sensation may help to provide relief. Considering using an unopened bag of frozen vegetables as a substitute for an ice pack. Just make sure the condensation from the ice pack doesn’t leak., Consider using an over-the-counter antihistamine, or a prescription from your physician. Medications by mouth such as Benadryl can be used to reduce itchy feelings if the other options aren't working. This will help calm your body’s reaction to a skin irritant., Do not stick objects inside your cast as a way to calm your itch. Scratching your skin with these objects may break skin or lead to infection. You also may end up going to additional doctor's visits, or need to get a new cast put on, due to items that are now trapped inside the cast. These items include: Chopsticks
Pencils or other writing tools
Coat hanger wire

, Powders and lotions may reduce perspiration on the skin, but should only be used outside the cast so that the skin stays clean and soft. Powder inside a cast can cake and cause sores. If your cast has a perspiration odor, this is normal; however, if you notice an unusual or foul odor coming from the cast contact your doctor., Even though that itchy, scratchy feeling may feel miserable, damaging your cotton lining to your cast, or loosening your cast, may make matters worse. For some casts, the cotton lining is used to protect the skin from a saw blade when the cast is removed. Without that protective lining in its proper place, the skin may get scratched during removal., A cast needs to stay away from water or anything that will add moisture. Though at certain times, getting your skin wet will happen due to perspiration, there are ways limit your exposure to water or excess moisture: Bathe in a bathtub with your arm or leg out of the water. If you must use plastic to cover your cast while bathing, use duct tape and secure it with multiple layers of plastic.
Avoid walking or standing in water while wearing a cast.
Cover your cast shoe before walking in the rain or snow. Your cast shoe should only be removed when bathing or sleeping.

, Reduce your time in hot and sunny areas, since you'll sweat more. Strenuous exercise should be done in a climate controlled environment to reduce sweat and moisture that can create that itchy feeling.

, Any grainy materials that end up inside the cast may generate further irritation and make the itchy feeling worse. Keep your cast clean and dry is best. Use a damp cloth and scouring powder to clean soiled spots on the cast. Be sure to brush away plaster crumbs or other objects from the edges of the cast, but do not remove or rearrange any padding. Do not break off or trim cast edges.

, While an itchy cast may be frustrating, it’s common. Be on the look-out for these possible complications with your cast: Pressure sores due to a cast that is too tight, or not fitting properly
Unpleasant and strange odors from mold or mildew, after the cast and your skin have been wet for a prolonged time
Compartment syndrome, with symptoms like numbness in your affected limb, cold or pale skin with bluish color, increased pain or swelling, and burning or stinging sensations
You develop a fever or skin problems at the cast edges
Your cast breaks, cracks or develops soft spots
Your cast becomes badly soiled
You feel blister or sore developing inside the cast

Clear your mind before going to bed.,
Think about something or someone you like and focus on that as hard as you can.,
Avoid ""The Loop."",
Get out of the Loop if you're in it.,
Try masking the noise from your tinnitus.,
Keep thinking about something else until you fall asleep.",How to Sleep with Tinnitus," Since tinnitus may trouble your sleep, you certainly don't want to have more troubling things or thoughts on your mind.;
, This could be anything or anyone as long as you enjoy thinking about it or them. Create a story and consider visualizing it all, because that will definitely help you focus even more. See it or them as important as it is to breathe. And remember, it can be anything.

, Rule number one for those with tinnitus is to not start The Loop. The Loop is a vicious circle that works with the following two mechanisms:


1. The more attention you give to your tinnitus, the louder it gets. (What happens is, you are telling your brain “This sound is important/threatening, I need to hear it more clearly”.)
2. The louder your tinnitus is, the more it attracts your attention, which in turn makes it even louder, and so on.
If you start thinking about your tinnitus you should immediately focus on something else, or else you start the loop and make your tinnitus louder.

, At this point you must do whatever it takes to focus on something else. Read a book, watch a movie, do anything that keeps you from staying inside The Loop.


Keep telling yourself: ""If I let myself focus on my tinnitus, it will just get louder and even harder to ignore."" The Loop is something you should always keep in mind not to start.
The Loop will be significantly worse if you are in a silent room (like when you go to sleep) so it's even more important not to start the Loop then.

, Noise masking means having another noise like any type of white noise or something like a fan, a TV, or a white noise website to cover up your tinnitus.


Online, you can find a bunch of customizable noise generators for sounds such as wind, a waterfall, fire, rain, static, slow ocean waves, and a ton of other generators. These are made for noise masking, and the best part about them is all the customization you have available to create for each noise (and you can even save them!).

, Ignore any irrelevant images or thoughts that appear in your mind, as those will only make you lose your focus. Same thing goes for The Loop if you happen to start thinking about your tinnitus.

Sip water while traveling.,
Sit correctly when driving.,
Maintain good posture during air travel.,
Bring your own back support.",How to Travel with Back Pain1," Staying hydrated can help alleviate many aches and pains, including back pain. Dehydration tends to make joint stiffness work. Make sure to have a water bottle in the car or with you on an airplane.You should also make hydration a priority in the days leading up to your trip. If you go into the trip well hydrated, you're more likely to avoid back pain.;
, How you sit when you're driving makes a huge impact on your likelihood of experiencing back pain. Sit back in your seat with your shoulder blades pressed against the seat.Allow for your lower back to curve inward slightly as it naturally does.
Your knees should either be the same level as your hips or lower than them.
Keep your inner core contracted throughout the trip. This keeps your core from weakening, which can prevent back pain.

, Evenly distribute your body across your weight and spine. This can help prevent back pain when sitting for long periods on an airplane.Keep your spine straight, while maintaining the natural curve of your lower spine.Extend your mid back to lift your chest slightly.
Squeeze your shoulder blades together and lengthen the back of your neck by tucking in your chin.

, Your lower back and neck need extra support when sitting for long periods. Seats in cars, trains, and planes often don't provide adequate support. To prevent back pain, bring your own supplies.You can buy a lumbar pillow, which is a special pillow designed to support your neck and back, online or at a store.
If you don't have one, a rolled up blanket, sweater, or jacket can also work.
An inflatable pillow that fits around your neck can be a great way to eliminate back strain when sitting for long periods.

Protect the surgical site from water if waterproof dressings are not used.,
Use a wet cloth to remove any tape on your skin from the waterproof dressing.,
Move both crutches, followed by the unaffected leg and then the affected leg into the bathroom.,
Let someone assist you with taking off your clothes and preparing the shower chair.,
With help, sit down on the shower chair.,
Turn on the shower and begin to wash yourself.,
Once you are finished bathing, turn off the shower and slowly pull yourself up from the shower seat.,
Pat yourself dry with a clean towel.,
Get actively involved in the healing and recovery process.,
Do not cross your legs for eight weeks after surgery.,
Avoid bending your hips beyond 90 degrees or leaning forward when sitting.,
Get someone else to pick something off the floor for you while you are sitting.,
Understand how your hips work.,
Be aware of factors like age and disability that could lead to hip replacement surgery.,
Ask your doctor if you require partial or total hip replacement.,
Try non-invasive treatments before getting hip replacement surgery.",How to Shower After Hip Replacement Surgery," This will allow you to sit on a seat while bathing, making soaping and cleaning your body with a sponge a lot easier. A bath seat also ensures you are not bending your hips greater than 90 degrees when sitting, it ensures your bottom is supported, and it helps you stand up easily after bathing.Look for a metal, non-skid shower chair with a back to add more stability. Metal chairs are also more durable than plastics.
Use a chair that is 17-18 inches higher than the floor to avoid bending your hips more than 90 degrees.Try to get a shower chair with a footrest so if you are trying to shave your legs, you do not have to bend over.;
, A bidet allows you to clean up after you go to the bathroom by having warm water sprayed on your bottom to wash and clean it. It also lets out warm air to dry your bottom.It may be a good idea to also install a handheld showerhead. This will allow you to direct or control the flow of water on your body, especially if you are sitting down while showering.

, Horizontal bars will help you get in the bathtub and lower yourself down to a sitting position in the toilet, while vertical grab bars will help you get up from sitting on the shower seat or from the toilet.Remember not to grab towel racks for support because these are not strong enough to hold your weight; you might end up falling.

, This will prevent you from flexing your hip joint too much when sitting on the toilet after the operation.One of the precautions after hip replacement is avoiding hip flexion greater than 90 degrees so you want to avoid bringing your knee up higher than your hip when sitting.You can also purchase a detachable elevated seat cover or have a toilet safety frame installed. In your pre surgery consultation, ask your orthopedic surgeon where you can purchase a toilet safety frame.

, This will prevent any slips or falls when you are using the bathroom post surgery.


Make sure you also place a non slip or non skid bath mat outside the bathtub or shower door to help you get a firm footing after you bathe or shower.

, Position your shampoo, soap, and sponge within reaching distance from your shower seat so you don’t have to exhaust yourself trying to access them post surgery.


If possible, switch out bar soap for liquid soap. You can easily drop bar soap by accident, which will force you to reach or bend for it. Liquid soap will be easier to use.

, You can store them on a low shelf in the bathroom or in a spot that is a short distance away and easy to access so you can dry yourself off in the bathroom, rather than having to get up and look for one.

, This is to prevent your incision and bandages from getting wet. Your doctor will let you know when you can shower after your surgery.In the meantime, wash your upper body with the usual soap and water by using the sink or a small basin. You may ask the nurse at the hospital to help you wash or clean your private areas/genitals. They will know how to assist you.
Since you won’t be doing any other tasks other than to get well after your surgery, you won’t be perspiring much so just try to relax and focus on resting.

, If you aren’t sure what changes may be necessary or best for your bathroom set up, your orthopaedic or rehabilitation doctor can refer you to an occupational therapist who is qualified to look at your bathroom and make safety recommendations before surgery., Most surgical sites have waterproof dressings so your doctor may already permit you to take a shower provided you take some precautions. But if they are not used, your doctor will advise you not to get the dressing on the surgical site wet as a moist dressing is a breeding ground for harmful microorganisms that could lead to an infection.To protect a surgical site without waterproof dressings, get a plastic bag and cut it so it just covers the surgical dressing (should be at least a few inches larger than the dressing). Make two plastic bag covers. The second one is a backup in case the first bag has any holes.
Place the two cut plastic bags on the surgical site. Get tape and and secure it. Make sure that a part of the tape touches your skin to prevent water from entering. If you cannot do this on your own, ask someone for assistance.
You can also use medical or surgical tape, which can be purchased at your local drugstore.

, Almost all tape on the skin hurts when you remove them. Using a wet cloth on the tape will make it easier to remove the wet tape without hurting yourself.


Do not to reuse the plastic bag covers as it may rip off upon removal of the tape. Use a new one each time you take a shower.

, Usually, your doctor will provide you with crutches after surgery to avoid putting too much weight on the newly repaired hip.Make sure your crutches are placed within reach in the bathroom so you can grab them easily after you’re done showering.

, Having a family member, friend, spouse, or professional home care worker help you do this makes it easier for you to shower and prevents you from stumbling or falling.


Make sure there is a clean, dry towel within reaching distance, such as on the rubber mat on the floor, just outside your bathtub or close to the shower seat.

, If you feel comfortable bathing on your own, instruct your assistant to stay outside of the bathroom where they can hear you in case you need help.

, Use a shower sponge with a long handle to clean your legs, feet and toes. Then, use the sponge to clean the rest of your body.


You can stand up from the shower seat once or twice when bathing as long as you make sure that before you stand up, you dry your hands with a towel nearby and grab the vertical hand bars to support your weight.

, Make sure your hands are dry when grabbing the vertical bars or horizontal bars to avoid slipping. You can also have someone assist you as you get off the chair.

, When drying your body, do not attempt to bend down from your waist beyond 90 degrees and avoid excessive inward or outward turning of your feet when standing. Do not twist your body.


Hold onto the horizontal bars and make small stomping gestures with your feet to dry them out.

, This means using the help and guidance of a health care team, such as your orthopaedic surgeon, your rehabilitation doctor and her team and your loved ones to support your recovery.Returning to everyday activities will take time and you may need to make some modifications to your lifestyle as you recover. Performing basic activities like bathing, walking, running, toilet activities and sexual activities will need to be done in a modified way to account for your new hip.

, This could lead to the dislocation of your new hip joint., Do not bring your knees higher than your hip joint and always keep your back straight when sitting.

, This is especially important when bathing. If the soap falls out of your hand while bathing, your knee jerk response may be to bend down and pick it up.


Using liquid soap instead of bar soap will limit the chances of this happening.
Anything you have dropped on the floor while bathing must not be picked up. Instead, dry yourself and get out of the shower or bathroom to ask for assistance from a trusted family member or a caregiver, in picking up the soap or whatever has been dropped to the floor.

, Your hip joint is composed of a ball and a socket. The ball-like structure is attached to the long bone of the thigh called the femur, while the socket is located on the hip bone or pelvis. When you move your legs, this ball rotates into the socket (acetabulum).In a healthy hip, the ball-like structure is able to glide smoothly in any direction inside the socket. This is because the smooth cartilage, which is a flexible tissue covering the ends of the bones, serves as a cushion.
If the smooth cartilage gets worn out or damaged due to a fall or an accident, the movement of the ball and socket becomes rough and rubs against each other. This causes damage in your hip’s bone structure and reduces the mobility of your legs.

, While there is really no absolute weight or age criteria for total hip replacement, most people who need hip replacement surgery are within 50-80 years of age. Orthopaedic surgeons will evaluate hip issues on a case to case basis but will often recommend it if you demonstrate:Hip joint pain that severely limits your ability to do basic, daily activities.
Hip joint pain that is present both at rest and during movement, day and night.
Hip joint stiffness that limits your hip joint’s normal range of motion, especially when lifting your legs or while walking or running.
If you have a degenerative hip joint condition, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bone necrosis, fracture or in lesser cases, hip joint diseases found in children.
If you are not getting enough support or pain relief from medications, conservative treatment and orthopaedic assistive devices for walking such as a cane or walker.

, In partial hip replacement, only the head of the femur is replaced by a metal ball so that it will glide into the socket smoothly. In a total hip replacement, both the ball and socket are replaced.Total hip replacement surgery or hip arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure where the damaged bone and cartilage of the hip joint is removed and replaced with prosthetic parts.
A socket made of a durable plastic replaces the worn out socket. It is then stabilized using a cement-like material. Your doctor may also just leave it in the socket to allow new bones growing in the area to stabilize it.Total hip replacement surgery will eliminate debilitating pain in your hip joint and help you resume normal activities such as bathing, walking, running, driving, etc. which have become virtually impossible to do pre-operation due to your injured hip., Not everyone who experiences hip joint pain are good candidates for hip replacement surgery. Even if you are a good candidate for surgery, your doctor will almost always prescribe non-invasive procedures first to treat your hip joint painsuch as medications, exercise, and lifestyle modification such as losing weight and a physical therapy program.


Your doctor will only recommend hip replacement surgery when these non-invasive treatments have not adequately helped you recover and resume your daily activities.

Understand that the type of treatment will depend on the stage the thymoma is in.,
Take corticosteroids.,
Try hormone therapy.,
Consider the benefits of surgery.,
Talk to your doctor about sternotomy.,
Get a thymectomy done if you have a non-metastasizing thymoma.",How to Treat a Thymoma1," Thymomas are rated on a scale from stage I to stage IV, with stage I being a thymoma that is caught early on. The treatment your doctor will first recommend will be based on the stage of the thymoma.


Stage I is generally dealt with using corticosteroids and surgical intervention.
Stage II is generally dealt with through surgical resection and occasionally radiation therapy.
Stage III is generally dealt with through chemotherapy followed by surgical resection.
Stage IV is generally dealt with through chemotherapy or chemoradiation.;
, Corticosteroids like hydrocortisone and prednisone may be able to treat early stage thymoma. These drugs control inflammation and can be taken either orally or intravenously.Your doctor may prescribe between 20 to 800 milligrams (mg) taken every one or two days.
Intravenous corticosteroids are generally prescribed at 5 to 500 mg, depending on the severity of the thymoma.

, Hormone therapy is a treatment that involves the removal of hormones or blocks their involvement in the growth of the thymoma. This therapy may also be able to stop the growth of cancerous cells.


This therapy is generally used in conjunction with corticosteroid medications for thymomas that are caught early on.

, There are two reasons that surgery may be performed when you have a thymoma. The first is to test the thymoma and see what stage it is in, and whether it is malignant or benign. The other reason is that in some cases, the thymoma can be removed through surgical excision.

, One type of surgical resection that is used to combat thymoma is sternotomy. This procedure involves splitting the breastbone so that the surgeon can access the anterior chest cavity and remove the thymoma, as well as the entirety of the thymus if need be., A non-metastasizing thymoma means that the thymoma is not spreading to other parts of your body. This procedure involves removing the thymus glandso that the thymoma cannot do further damage to your body.


The thymus gland helps your immune system to form when you are born. When it is removed later on, the removal will have very little effect on your immune system."

Eat more magnesium.,
Get more potassium.,
Increase your intake of calcium.",How to Sleep Better Through Diet1," One of the best minerals for you if you are trying to get better sleep is magnesium. It is often a mineral that people are deficient in, so be sure that you try to get more of it every day.Magnesium deficiency can also cause calf cramps during the nighttime, which can disrupt sleep.Try to incorporate at least one food that is rich in magnesium every meal. These foods include:Fruits, such as berries, apples, melons, bananas, and avocado
Vegetables, such as Swiss chard, kale, spinach, collard greens, turnip greens, mustard greens, beet greens, broccoli, various lettuces, and field greens
Beans, such as soybeans and black beans
Tofu
Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, pumpkin seeds (pepitas), sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and cashews
Nut and seed butters, such as almond butter and sesame seed butter (tahini)
Whole grains, such as cereals, breads, wheat, millet, oats, and brown rice;
, Potassium levels are critical for you to achieve deep sleep. This means that you need enough potassium to get to sleep and stay in deep sleep, which will make you more rested.These foods include:Fruits, such as avocados and bananas
Vegetables, such as mushrooms, tomatoes, collard greens, field greens, kale, Swiss chard, broccoli, lettuces, mustard greens, spinach, turnip greens, beet greens, potatoes, cauliflower, and sweet potatoes
Beans, such as soybeans, lima beans, lentils, kidney beans, and pinto beans
Fish, such as flounder, cod, or salmon

, Calcium, which has long been known to help bone health, is also needed to help your body get to sleep. It plays a role in necessary bodily functions that are needed to help you sleep.A calcium deficiency can cause a disturbance in REM sleep.Foods rich in calcium include:Vegetables, such as collard greens, spinach, mustard greens, kale, Swiss chard, turnip greens, broccoli, beet greens, lettuces, and field greens
Dairy products, such as cheese, milk, and various yogurts
Fish, such as salmon and sardines
Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, Brazil nuts, and sesame seeds
Soy products, such as tofu, soymilk, soy beans, and soy yogurt

Wear slip on shoes.,
Make sure to move periodically.,
Lift luggage carefully.,
Request assistance when moving luggage if possible.,
Stretch.",How to Travel with Back Pain2," The shoes you wear for travel can help with your back, especially if you'll be moving around a lot during your trip. Slip on shoes are generally your best option, especially during air travel. They're easily to slip on and off, preventing pain from bending over and removing shoes, which you usually need to do at airport security.Make sure your slip on shoes also have adequate support. You need shoes with a slight arch that can slip on and off easily.

, For every hour, move around for five minutes. This will keep your muscles active, preventing pain. Set a timer to keep track of time.If you're driving, pull over every five minutes to walk around.
If you're, get up every five minutes, if possible. Sometimes, the seatbelt sign will be on, which means you'll have to stay in your seat.

, Lifting up heavy luggage can cause or aggravate back pain during a long trip. When lifting luggage, bend at your knees and not at your back. Pivot upward with your feet rather than twisting your lower back.With heavy items, carry them as close to the body as possible.
Keep your weight distributed evenly on both sides of your body.
If you're carrying a shoulder bag, periodically switch which shoulder you're carrying it on.

, If your back is already hurting, see if you can get assistance lifting luggage. Some airports and hotels may provide assistance lifting luggage. You can also try asking as fellow passenger if you're struggling to lift something into an overhead compartment., On an airplane, stand up and stretch every hour or so. When driving, pull over for a stretch now and again. If you're a passenger, stretch periodically in your seat.For a hamstring stretch, bend at the waist while keeping your legs straight. Try to touch your toes and hold the position for 30 to 45 seconds.
If sitting, move to the edge of your chair. Straighten your leg, keeping your heel on the floor. Sit up straight by pushing your navel towards your thigh and arching your back. Hold this for 30 seconds.

Stay on top of your regular workouts.,
Request an aisle seat on the plane.,
Pack your medication.,
Travel light.,
Opt for a backpack.",How to Travel with Back Pain3," Leading up to your travels, do not neglect your regular workout routine. Even if you're busy before at trip, strive to get your regular work out in. This will keep your body strong throughout the trip, lessening the likelihood of back pain., While many people love gazing out the window during a plane ride, it's better for your back to sit near the aisle. This way, it's easy to get up when necessary, allowing you to easily walk around and stretch., If you're on any medication for your back, always pack your medication prior to traveling. Make sure you keep your medication in your carry on bag on a plane in case your checked bag gets lost.It's a good idea to have some over-the-counter medications on hand as well in case your prescription medications aren't cutting it.

, The lighter you pack, the better. Carrying heavy items around the airport or from hotel room to hotel room can aggravate back pain. Pack only what you need and leave heavier items, like clunky shoes or thick books, behind., Backpacks are convenient and have the added benefit of putting less strain on your back. Keep a backpack across both your shoulders rather than slung over one shoulder or the other.Your backpack's weight should be no more than 10 to 20% of your total body weight.

Consider radiation therapy.,
Consider chemotherapy medications as an option.,
Talk to your doctor about Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan).,
Take Doxorubicin.,
Try Vincristine (Oncovin).,
Treat thymoma with Cisplatin (Platinol-AQ).",How to Treat a Thymoma2," Talk to your doctor about radiation therapy if you have stage III or IV thymoma. This treatment involves the use of high energy x-rays and other forms of radiation to eradicate cancer cells and stop new cells from forming.The type of radiation you receive may depend on the stage and type of thymoma you have.


External radiation utilizes a machine outside the body in order to send the radiation towards the cancer.
Internal radiation therapy, on the other hand, uses radioactive substances found in wires, catheters, needles, and seeds placed near or directly into the cancer.

, Chemotherapy can be used to reduce thymoma tumors. This treatment is generally used for people who have an invasive thymoma that has spread to other organs. The drugs that are used during chemotherapy include cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and cisplatin.These medications will be described in detail in the following steps.

, Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) is a drug that is used to treat various types of cancer. This drug is converted by the liver and made into acrolein and phosphoramide (active compounds that slow down the growth of cancer cells by disrupting the DNA of cancerous cells). This can help to shrink and treat the thymoma.Dosage is given initially at 30 to 50 mg/kg, administered intravenously during a period of 2 to 5 days. This dosage is then repeated in 2 to 4 weeks interval.
Orally, 1 to 5 mg/kg of this drug can be taken every day.

, Doxorubicin is another chemotherapeutic agent used with other drugs to treat various types of cancer, including thymoma. This drug works to slow down, and in some cases completely stop, the growth of cancer cells in your body.This drug is generally administered intravenously once every 21 to 28 days. The length of the treatment depends on the response of the tumor to the medication, as well as the response of your body to certain side effects.

, Vincristine (Oncovin) is a chemotherapeutic drug used with other drugs to stop or slow down the growth of cancer cells in the body. This drug is administered intravenously., Cisplatin (Platinol-AQ) is another chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers. This is used alone or in combination with other agents, such as the ones described in the previous steps. It works to slow down or completely stop the growth of cancer cells in your body.Doctors generally give this drug intravenously. They may prescribe 75 to 100 mg/m every four weeks, depending on what other chemotherapy drugs you are prescribed.

Increase melatonin production.,
Help with serotonin production.,
Eat foods high in B vitamins.",How to Sleep Better Through Diet2," Melatonin is one of the most important sleep hormones. It helps control your sleep cycle, which means the production of the hormone helps you get to sleep. Foods that help melatonin production include:Fruit and 100% fruit juices, such as cherries, raspberries, and goji berries
Vegetables, such as tomatoes and orange bell peppers
Seeds, such as mustard seeds and fenugreek
Nuts, such as almonds

, Serotonin is a chemical messenger found in your body that plays a crucial role in sleep.Serotonin levels are low when you are asleep and high when you are awake, but a deficiency in serotonin can disrupt sleep.There are some foods that can help with its production. These include:Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains and starchy vegetables
Lean protein, such as chicken, salmon, and cheese
Healthy fats, such as almond butters, various nuts, and seeds

, All different forms of the B vitamins can help you sleep better. Vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid are B vitamins that support serotonin production in your body. Many foods rich in B vitamin also have other sleep-inducing minerals in them, which makes them especially helpful.Foods rich in B vitamins include:


Vitamin-B6-rich foods, such as fortified cereals, poultry, beans, fish, dark leafy greens vegetables, oranges, papayas, and cantaloupe
Vitamin-B12-rich foods, such as fish, assorted red meats, pork, poultry, dairy, eggs, fortified breakfast cereals, and enriched soy or rice milk
Folate-rich foods, such as various fruits, many different vegetables, beans, whole and fortified grains, breakfast cereals, and grain products"

Identify the best nutrients for sleep.,
Get nutrients from food.,
Eat them across multiple meals.,
Choose foods that have multiple benefits.,
Try different things.",How to Sleep Better Through Diet3," There are a number of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that can help you sleep better. The best nutrients for better sleep include magnesium, potassium, calcium, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and vitamin D. These help various chemical messengers in your brain, which are starved for these nutrients, accomplish their functions related to sleep.These vitamins and minerals are also great for your overall health. This means that improving your sleep through food may also help improve your overall health.

, The best way to get these nutrients is by eating foods rich in each of these nutrients every day. This means you need to watch what you eat and try to incorporate as much of these minerals as possible.


You may also be able to increase these minerals with supplements, but your body will absorb the nutrients better if they come from food., When you are trying to get the right minerals and nutrients, you should spread them out. Eat healthy, nutrient-rich foods across multiple meals. This means you shouldn’t load all your nutritious food into one meal and then eat food devoid of nutrients at other times of the day.


Try to get at least eight to 10 servings of these foods throughout the day.
If you find this hard, start small. Add just one new type of food, such as a leafy green salad or a small cup of fruit, to each meal. This will help ease you into larger portions of these nutrient-rich foods throughout at day. As you get used to them, slowly replace other foods with these foods., When you are eating for sleep health, try picking foods that have more than one of the helpful nutrients in them. This will allow you to get the most benefit from these foods each time you eat them.


For example, avocados have magnesium and potassium in them, so eating them raw, in a sandwich, or on a salad may help you get better sleep by increasing two different sleep helping nutrients., If you are prone to getting bored with what you eat, try out different types of snacks rich in these vitamins and minerals. Don’t make it hard on yourself, either. If you know that you don’t like one thing rich in sleep-helping nutrients, change to another. It is better to find what you like than to keep yourself from any of the nutrients at all.


For example, if you really hate bananas, which are strong in magnesium, switch them with a handful of berries or a serving of cashews instead.
You can also incorporate them into recipes, such as making chicken stir-fry with cashews and broccoli or a large kale salad with almonds, salmon, and cherries."

Decide if you should treat the cut yourself.,
Wait for minor bleeding to stop.,
Apply pressure.,
Elevate the affected area.,
Wash your hands.,
Clean the wound.,
Apply an antibiotic.,
Confirm that your tetanus vaccines are current.,
Look for signs of infection.,
Make sure the bleeding has stopped before covering the cut.,
Choose the right bandage.,
Change the bandage regularly.,
Remove the bandage.",How to Treat a Minor Cut," Not all cuts should be treated at home. Seek medical attention right away if any of the following are true:The cut is spurting blood.
The edges of the wound are jagged or far apart from each other.
The wound keeps opening.
It is a deep cut or puncture wound, such as more than 1/4 inch deep.
The cut goes through muscles or tendons.
The wound was caused by an animal or human bite.
The cut is accompanied by severe pain.;
, If you have a minor cut, the bleeding will normally stop on its own. You can wait a minute to see if the bleeding will stop before you do anything about it., If the bleeding does not stop quickly on its own, you can help it stop faster by applying pressure directly to the wound. Use a sterile cloth or gauze to apply pressure and avoid introducing germs.Keep the pressure constant and avoid removing it every few seconds to see if the bleeding has stopped. This can slow down the formation of clots.
If the bleeding still hasn't stopped after ten minutes, you may need stitches, so see a doctor.

, Another way to help stop a cut from bleeding is to raise the affected area over your heart to inhibit blood flow. For example, if the cut is on your hand, hold it over your head. If the cut is on your foot, lie down on your back and raise your leg in the air.This method only works if the cut is on a limb. If it is on your torso, you will have to apply pressure to stop the bleeding.

, If you need to treat a cut, wash your hands thoroughly first. This will help remove germs from your hands that might otherwise infect your cut.If you have a cut somewhere on your body that is not on your hands, you may want to wear sterile gloves while treating it. This will prevent you from transferring germs that may be on your hands to your open wound. If you are treating someone else's cut, wearing gloves will also protect you against blood-borne pathogens the other person may have.

, Once your hands are clean, begin treating the cut by wiping away any dirt or debris off of the wound. Use a piece of sterile gauze to wipe the dirt or debris out from the wound in a starburst fashion. Then, begin flushing out the wound with cold water. The easiest way to do this is by holding the injured body part under running water. This will also help to remove debris and bacteria from the wound.Be sure to use cold water, not hot.
If you don't have access to a sink, you can pour bottled water or saline solution over the cut to clean it. You can also wipe it clean with a sterile cloth.
If there is still debris in the cut even after your flushed it, you will need to remove it. You can do this with sterile tweezers. (Sterilize them by rubbing them down with rubbing alcohol or boiling them in water.)
Many people use solutions like rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean wounds, but this is not necessary. They will not clean the wound any better than cold water, and they will cause pain.

, Once you've finished cleaning your cut, you may want to apply an antibiotic ointment. This will help keep the cut infection-free.Don't do this yet if your cut is still bleeding.
You can use antibiotic ointments with or without bandages.
Some people have allergic reactions to antibiotic ointments. If you develop a rash, discontinue use of the product.
Some experts recommend against using antibiotic ointments, as they may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.If you choose not to use antibiotic ointment, be sure to clean the area immediately around your cut every day until it is healed., If you have had a tetanus shot within the last five years, you will not need any further shots just because you got a cut. If you are not up-to-date on your tetanus shots, however, you should see your doctor right away to get vaccinated.Not all cuts require tetanus boosters, but it's generally advised for cuts that are deep or have had dirt or other contaminants in them. If you're not sure whether your cut necessitates a tetanus shot, call your doctor.If you're not sure when your last tetanus shot was, call your doctor to find out.

, As the cut heals, check it regularly and watch for signs of infection. If you notice any of the following symptoms, see your doctor:Redness
Pain
Swelling
Pus
Fever

, Before you attempt to dress your cut, it's important to make sure that the bleeding has stopped and the wound is clean. Once you confirm this, you may cover your cut to help protect it.If you haven't done so already, you can apply some antibiotic ointment to the cut right before covering it.
If the wound is in an area that won't get dirty or be irritated by clothing, you can leave it uncovered., The easiest way to cover a wound and protect it while it heals is to use an adhesive bandage. If you use an adhesive bandage, be sure to choose one that is large enough so that it won't stick to the wound at all.You can also use gauze and surgical tape to cover your wound.
If a regular bandage won't work for you, try applying a liquid bandage to your cut. This clear hardening liquid will protect the cut just as much as a traditional bandage, and it will stay in place even in awkward areas, like between your fingers., It's important to keep your wound clean and dry as it heals. In order to do this, you must change your bandage whenever it gets wet or dirty.It's a good idea to change the bandage daily, even if it appears clean and dry.
You can apply more antibiotic ointment when you put the new bandage on. You may also want to clean your cut with water or saline solution if it is still open., Once your cut has formed a scab, you can remove the bandage if you want. The scab will help protect it until it is fully healed.If you will be doing something that may cause the cut to get dirty or irritated, be sure to cover it.
If you are concerned about scarring, you may want to prevent the formation of a scab. You can do this by applying petroleum jelly to the cut regularly to keep it moist. Keeping a bandage over the cut will help keep the petroleum jelly in place."

Evaluate your level of risk for colon cancer.Everyone is eligible for colon cancer screening beginning at the age of 50; however, if you have a family history of colon cancer, or a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, both of which increase your risk of developing colon cancer) you may be eligible to begin screening earlier.,
Obtain the testing package.The first thing you will need to do in order to self-screen for colon cancer is to obtain the at-home stool testing package.,
Collect the required number of stool samples.,
Store the stool sample at room temperature.,
Send the stool sample back to the lab.After you have collected your sample and placed it in the appropriate areas of the packaging, you will need to return it to the lab for analysis.,
Book a follow-up appointment to review your results.After the lab has finished analyzing your stool, you will want to go in to see your family doctor again to review the results of your stool test.",How to Self Screen for Colon Cancer1," Don't wait to discuss this with your doctor — even if you are still young, it is important to notify your doctor if you have any risk factors.


See your doctor at age 50 to begin self-screening, and earlier if you believe you have additional risk factors (in which case your doctor will let you know at what age you are eligible to begin).;
, You will need to visit your family doctor to obtain this, and she will explain the procedure to you during this visit as well.


One stool test is called the Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). This looks for blood in your stool that is not visible to the naked eye. It is the most commonly used self-screening test for colon cancer.Another stool test option is called the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT). This is almost the same as FOBT, except instead of detecting blood via heme it detects it via antibodies directed at human hemoglobin.The final self-screening stool test option is called Cologuard. This evaluates both for the presence of blood in the stool, as well as for DNA that has been correlated to a higher risk for colon cancer.It is quite new and therefore not currently recommended as the standard of care; however, studies indicate that the new Cologuard test could potentially have a greater ability to detect colon cancer than either the FOBT or the FIT tests.

, Once you have the package at home with you, you are ready to begin testing at the time of your next bowel movement. Take note of how many stool samples you will need. Some self-screening packages request three samples, often each the size of a smear on a piece of toilet paper. Others ask for only one sample, but it may require the whole bowel movement to be packaged and sent into the lab.


One way to collect bowel samples more easily is to place a piece of plastic wrap over the toilet bowl, allowing it to hang just above the water level.After your bowel movement, you can then collect the stool sample (in the required amount) before flushing the rest down the toilet.
Ensure that no urine contaminates your stool sample.

, It is important to store your stool sample at room temperature until you have a chance to return it to the lab. This should be done within seven days following the collection of your stool sample.

, The address of the lab should be listed on the side of the package — normally, you can return it to any medical lab in your area, or to the hospital lab, whichever is most convenient for you to get to.

, Depending on whether the result is positive (suspicious for possible colon cancer) or negative (not worrisome), your doctor will help you to plan your next steps, if any further investigative steps need to be taken.

"
"
Take comfort if you receive a negative result.If the result of your stool test comes back as negative for blood (or DNA), you can take confidence in knowing that your risk of colon cancer at this time is very low.,
Proceed with a colonoscopy if you receive a positive result.If the result of your stool test comes back positive, you will need to proceed with further investigations at this time.,
Understand that a positive stool test (the self-screening test for colon cancer) does not necessarily mean you have cancer.It is important not to get overly worried about a screening test.",How to Self Screen for Colon Cancer2," Of course, no test is perfect, so there is always the slight possibility of a testing error, but more likely than not you are not at risk. Your doctor will advise you to proceed with your life as normal. No further testing will be indicated at this time.


The stool test is generally repeated every one to two years for people 50 and older, in order to ensure regular screening.Make a note to yourself to follow up with your family doctor again at this time for a repeat stool test.

, The next step is a colonoscopy, which is where a tube is inserted through the anus all the way up your colon so that your doctor can directly visualize the walls of the colon and look for any suspicious lesions or polyps. If there are any, these can be biopsied at the time of the test and evaluated under the microscope for the presence of cancer.If your colonoscopy shows nothing suspicious, you are in the clear and safe to go on with life as normal.
If your colonoscopy reveals colon cancer, you will need to consult a medical oncologist (a cancer specialist) about how best to treat you colon cancer.

, This is because the purpose of the screening test is not to diagnose cancer, but rather, to figure out who is at a higher risk and as such needs to have a colonoscopy (which is the official diagnostic test).


If you test positive for blood in your stool, there is a chance that you have colon cancer, but it is not diagnostic.
If possible, try not to worry too much until you have followed through with the actual colonoscopy.
Also, the good news is that, if you receive regular screening, colon cancer can be caught early in the stages where it can be treated and cured (90% of colon cancers caught early are able to be cured)."

Apply a dry dressing or bandage if needed.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Remove Surgical Staples," Depending on the condition of the healed incision, use saline, an antiseptic such as alcohol, or sterile swabs to remove any debris or dried fluids from the wound. , Begin at one end of the healed incision. This is a specialized tool doctors use to take out surgical staples.

, The upper part of the staple remover will push down the middle of the staple, causing the staple ends to pull out of the incision. , When the staples are removed, drop them into a disposable container or bag. Pull out the medical staple in the same direction it went in to avoid tearing your skin.
You might feel a slight pinch, sting or tugging sensation. This is normal. ,


When the end of the incision is reached, inspect the area again to check for any staples that may have been missed. This will help to prevent future skin irritation and infection. ,, The type of covering applied depends on how well the wound has healed.


Use a butterfly bandage if the there is still skin separation. This will provide support and help to prevent the formation of a larger scar. Use a light gauze dressing to prevent irritation. This will act as a buffer between the affected area and your clothing. Expose the healing incision to the air, if possible. Make sure to not to cover the affected area with clothing, to avoid irritation. , The redness around the closed incision should fade over a few weeks.Follow your doctor's advice on wound care, and be aware of the following signs of infection:


Redness and irritation around the affected area.
Affected area is hot to the touch.
Increased pain.

Be patient.,
Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAID) or acetaminophen.These medications should be used to treat acute pain sporadically or for no more than one to two weeks, unless recommended by a doctor.,
Try physical therapy.,
Sign up for acupuncture therapy.",How to Repair Nerve Damage1," If the nerve has been only partially compressed or severed, it can repair itself over time. This is because the nerve tissue beyond the damage point dies and the nerve must regenerate between healthy nerve endings.A pinched nerve can occur from a number of reasons including: bad posture, injury, arthritis, spinal stenosis, and/or obesity.;
,


NSAIDs treats swelling and inflamed nerves, acetaminophen only treats pain.Be sure that these medications will not interact with any other medication. For example, avoid taking aspirin when on blood thinners.
Long-term NSAID use can lead to gastritis and gastric ulcers. Be aware of your use of these medications.

, If a nerve was pinched, rather than severed, physical therapy (PT) is often used to repair the damage and increase strength and mobility. Check if your doctor will prescribe physical therapy.


Some insurance companies will not cover PT. Always check with your insurance company if you have a question about billing.
You may need to wait several weeks or months after acute injury to start this phase of repair. The nerve may need time to heal and regrow.
Try de-weighted training in the the pool for problems with movement on land. After you build up your stamina try some strength and resistance training.

, Some patients find that acupuncture calms the nerves and allows them to continue normal function while the nerves repair themselves.


Biofeedback can also be helpful. This is a technique you can use to control your body’s functions. You are connected to electronic sensors that provides information that will help you focus and relax.Unfortunately, neither acupuncture nor biofeedback are typically covered under American health insurance plans.

Undergo electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction tests.,
Consider an injection to numb nerves.If your doctor determines that your nerve damage is not causing long-term damage, you may be a candidate for a numbing or steroid injection called a ""nerve root block."",
Consider minor surgery.,
Engage in nerve “re-education” therapy.",How to Repair Nerve Damage2," These tests may find the location of the nerve damage and its severity. Your doctor may also prescribe a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) test.


Some of these tests, like an EMG can be done at your general practitioners. However, more invasive tests like an MRI may be conducted at a specialist or a hospital.

, Nerve root blocks are usually done by a trained anesthesiologist in pain therapy. Steroids can help your body heal more quickly from nerve damage., Some types of nerve damage occur from compression or pinching. Minor outpatient surgeries are often sufficient to repair this damage. Criteria for surgery include symptoms of radiculopathy, evidence of nerve root compression on an MRI, persistent nerve pain last longer than six weeks, and progressive motor weakness.


Minor surgery can be an arthroscopic surgery to unblock the pinched nerve or sew the damaged ends of the nerves together.Another minor surgery is a nerve release, which can help to fix nerve compression seen in nerve damage like carpal tunnel syndrome.These may create more room for the nerve by dividing tissue, or by moving the nerve to a new location., The nerves may need to be re-trained with this special type of physical therapy. This re-education therapy is generally completed in two stages: “early” and “late.” It is the process of “tuning” your nerves into feeling sensations normally.


The early stage of this therapy is making sure your nerves can feel a wide scope of sensations, while the late stage is fine tuning the sensations to manageable sensations.This type of therapy is generally done in outpatient physical therapy. The length of the sessions depends on the severity of the injury. Generally, this procedure does take some time, as it is essentially “retraining” the body to return to a normal range of function. "

Seek medical attention.,
Consider surgery to reconnect or graft nerves.,
Retrain your body.",How to Repair Nerve Damage3," Go to the emergency room immediately if you have had an acute injury and you are experiencing numbness or tingling in your extremities. If you have cut yourself on something sharp, try to staunch the bleeding as you go to the emergency room.


Nerve damage due to knives in the kitchen or broken glass is fairly common.
Visit the emergency room if you have had recent contact with lead, arsenic, mercury or other toxic substances. They need to be flushed from your body before repair can start.

, If the nerve has been completely severed, this may be necessary in order to start repair. If the surgery is successful, the nerve will grow and repair at a rate of approximately one inch per month.Nerve grafts often require the removal of nerve fiber from another part of the body. The area from which it was taken may remain numb after the surgery., Your body will typically go through four phases of repairing nerve damage.This repairing requires the cells to heal and “retune” themselves to properly send signals to the brain.


This may require physical therapy. A professional will help you train your body to heal properly by doing incremental range-of-motion exercises.
This may require time. Nerve repair may not happen overnight. It may take weeks, months, or years to heal. In severe cases, nerve function may not repair fully. Your doctor should be able to give you a prognosis about how long it will take to heal from a specific injury.

Recognize the symptoms and pain of nerve damage.,
Call your pharmacist if you began taking a new medication recently.,
See your doctor.,
Contact a specialist.,
Talk to your doctor about medication.",How to Repair Nerve Damage4," There are a few signs and symptoms of nerve damage. If you are experiencing any of these, please contact your doctor.


Pain or tingling in arms, legs, fingers, or toes
Loss of muscle control. This may cause weakness. If you find yourself having trouble with everyday tasks like buttoning a shirt, or twisting a doorknob, these may be signs of nerve damage.
Difficulty digesting food. This may be accompanied with bloating or fullness. You may vomit partially digested food, or have trouble using the bathroom.Peripheral neuropathy affects that brain’s ability to receive pain signals from your nerves . It is a common disorder and the symptoms include pain or numbness in the extremities. You may feel tingling or burning in your arms or legs, which may be an early sign of nerve damage.

, Some medications, especially those used to treat cancer and HIV, are known for creating nerve damage in some patients.

, Make an appointment with your doctor if you have a disease that can cause nerve damage.These diseases may include diabetes, cancer, alcoholism, or an autoimmune disease. Nerve damage should be included in the treatment plan for these conditions.

, Call your doctor to arrange for an emergency appointment if a back condition or disease has progressed to include numbness or tingling.These symptoms are indicative of a pinched or damaged nerve. In some situations emergency surgery is recommended.

, Talk to your doctor about using tricyclic antidepressants or anti-seizure drugs to control nerve pain. These medications are used for patients with chronic nerve pain in order to interrupt the pain signals in the brain. Make sure to discuss side effects of long-term usage.

Recognize the symptoms of an ulcer.,
Treat the stomach ulcer with a prescription.,
Use non-irritating pain medication.,
Take an antacid.,
Contact your doctor immediately if you experience “red flags.” You should always call your physician if your ulcer pain is associated with so-called “red flags.” These are signs or symptoms that don’t always mean there is a medical emergency, but should always prompt a call to your physician or, if they cannot be reached immediately, an ER visit.These may indicate a bleeding ulcer, an infection or a perforation in the wall of the ulcer.",How to Relieve Ulcer Pain1," Symptoms of stomach ulcers vary from person to person. If you believe you have an ulcer but haven’t had it diagnosed by a medical professional, see your doctor. The symptoms of a stomach ulcer include:Burning pain in the area just below the ribcage in the center of your chest. This pain may get worse with food or go away with some foods.
Nausea, vomiting, and bloating. Nausea and vomiting are rarer symptoms, but they indicate a serious problem. Seek medical attention if they develop.;
, When your doctor diagnoses the stomach ulcer, they will prescribe treatment to help treat it. There are a few different types of drugs that your doctor might prescribe.


Proton pump inhibitors are powerful acid blocking drugs that will reduce the amount of acid secreted into the stomach and can help reduce the pain of a stomach ulcer.
If the cause of the ulcer is an infection with H. pylori, this is generally treated with antibiotics.Histamine-2 (H-2) blockers may be used to reduce acid in your stomach., Over-the-counter medications referred to as NSAIDs damage the wall of the stomach and can cause ulcers to form. Acetaminophen, like Tylenol, is not associated with ulcers. If needed, use acetaminophen to treat your pain.NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), aspirin (Bayer), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), ketorolac (Toradol), and oxaprozin (Daypro). NSAIDs may also be included in combination medications including Alka-Seltzer and sleep aids.

, Over-the-counter antacids can help relieve ulcer pain. They neutralize acids in your stomach. Antacids come in liquid and tablet form.Common over-the-counter antacids include magnesium hydroxide (such as Phillips Milk of Magnesia), sodium bicarbonate (Alka-Seltzer), calcium carbonate (Rolaids, Tums), aluminum hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide (Maalox, Mylanta)., These “red flags” accompanied by stomach pain are:


Fever
Severe pain
Persistent nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea that lasts longer than two to three days
Persistent constipation, longer than two to three days
Blood in the stools, which may look like red blood, or the stools look black and tarry
Vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds
Severe tenderness of the belly
Jaundice — yellowish discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes
Swelling or visible bloating of the abdomen

Discard debris.,
Take care of collected yard waste.,
Have young people store their toys properly.,
Clean your gutters and drains.,
Drain your garden properly.,
Regrade your lawn if water pools in certain areas.,
Remove stumps.",How to Remove Sources of Standing Water1," The classic example is a old tire or empty gardening pot. Items such as these can easily collect and hold small amounts of standing water. Discard tires properly or drill holes in them to allow water to drain. Stack and cover containers such as pots whenever they’re not in use.Steps such as this are especially important to take late in the winter, preceding mosquito breeding season.;
, Piles of raked leaves, grass, or other brush can collect small pools of standing water that you may not be able to see. They can also serve as hangouts for adult mosquitoes during the day. Dispose of these piles before they are able to do so. If you compost, be sure to turn your pile weekly at the very least., Irregularly used kiddie pools are especially likely candidates for standing water. That said, many different toys can collect small amounts of standing water that may be less apparent. Encourage and help your children put away their toys inside or in a covered area.Make sure to get the little things too: that shovel in the sandbox or that frisbee in the corner of the yard are both ideal for small deposits of standing water.

, Gutters can fill and clog quite quickly, and can readily collect standing water. While a gutter cover can help, you’ll still need to check gutters regularly. Similarly, your downspouts and the drains or erosion-controlling troughs they pour into can get clogged as well.Check and clean your drains after any large leaf drops in the fall, and again at the end of winter.

, Standing water can collect in the areas of your yard that you keep watered, such as your garden. If ever you notice that a certain spot remains wet, it is likely collecting water above and below the surface.Add sand to the ground near the area to allow water to drain away from the spot.
Alternatively, dig a shallow drainage trough from a frequently wet area of the garden to another lower part of the garden that dries out more quickly.

, If water collects in shallow parts of your yard, work to raise that area of the yard. The easiest way to do so is adding soil to the area to bring it up to grade with the surrounding ground level. Alternatively, you can dig a shallow ditch from the shallow part of your yard to an area the water will be able to drain., Tree stumps that haven’t been fully removed can collect standing water that may not be readily apparent. Instead of allowing a stump to slowly decompose, continue chopping it until you can till it into the surrounding soil or remove it entirely."

Speak to a health professional before taking any medication.,
Be careful with over-the-counter remedies.,
Be careful when choosing nasal sprays.,
Have a hot soothing drink.,
Arrange your bedroom to help you sleep better.",How to Relax when You Are Sick1," Whether you’re taking prescription medication or wanting to combine over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, consult a pharmacist or health professional to avoid any negative reactions.For example, if you’re taking antidepressants, sleeping pills, or anti-anxiety drugs, avoid over-the-counter medications containing antihistamines that make you sleepy. The combination can have harmful side effects and can also be lethal in some cases.;
, Not all over-the-counter medications will help you sleep better. Also, many sleep medications and pain killers help you fall asleep but reduce the quality of your sleep. Avoid cold and flu medications that contain pseudoephedrine or ephedrine.If you have to take these medications, take them 2 or 3 hours before you plan on going to sleep.
Take these decongestants when you know you will be awake and medicines that have drowziness-causing painkillers or antihistamines when you want to sleep.

, While nasal sprays can decongest your nose for 8 hours or more, they may also contain stimulants that make it difficult for you to sleep.Look for nasal sprays with oxymetazoline or xylometazoline to best open the breathing passage in your nose. Oxymetazoline and xylometazoline are not stimulants so they won't keep you up at night.
Nose strips mechanically open up the nasal passages, so thus they have no stimulating effect as well.

, While your appetite may decrease, ensure you don’t get dehydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. High-calorie drinks, like hot chocolate or Ovaltine, can signal our bodies to go into sleep mode.Research has shown that a hot cordial can aid in many cold and flu symptoms like sneezing and coughing.

, Get rid of distractions like a tv, computer, or other electronic devices. Also, regulate a comfortable temperature as keeping your room cool will aid with sleeping.Dry-humidifiers and vaporizers may help with your breathing while keeping the atmosphere of your room conducive to sleeping.

Determine the triggers of your ulcer pain.,
Change your diet.,
Limit the amount of food you eat at one time.,
Refrain from eating before sleep.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Stop smoking.,
Visit your doctor if pain continues.",How to Relieve Ulcer Pain2," First, find out if you have any triggers that cause ulcer pain. Triggers are any foods and beverages that make your stomach pain worse. When you learn your triggers, and avoid them.


This may involve keeping track of foods and beverages that cause you any problems. Start with the common triggers, like spicy foods, foods with high acidity, alcohol, caffeine, or foods with high fat content.Add any foods or beverages that you are sensitive to. This is a simple process of writing down the foods you eat and seeing how you feel about one hour after eating. If the food you ate an hour ago is bothering you, you should eliminate that food from your diet.

, Eating a healthy diet full of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help reduce ulcer pain and stomach irritation. Most fruits and vegetables (with the exception of those in the citrus and tomato family), and whole grains won’t irritate your stomach. Plus, eating vitamin-rich foods will support your body’s healing so you can get rid of the ulcer.Avoid coffee and alcohol.
Getting more fiber from fruits and vegetables can help prevent new ulcers from developing and heal ulcers.Foods rich in probiotics might help your ulcer. These include yogurt, sauerkraut, dark chocolate, pickles, and soy milk.
Cutting milk from your diet may be able to provide some relief.Eventually, you will find the list of foods that cause your ulcer to hurt . Eliminating those foods will decrease your ulcer pain quickly.

, One way to help relieve ulcer pain is to decrease the amount of food you eat at any one time. This reduces the stress on your stomach, reduces the amount of acid in your stomach at any time, and can decrease your stomach pain., Don’t eat for two to three hours before bedtime. This helps reduce the risk of acid refluxing into the esophagus as you try to sleep., Another way to help your ulcer is to wear loose clothing. Wear clothing that doesn’t constrict your stomach or abdomen. This removes any extra added pressure that could irritate your ulcer., If you quit smoking, it can help with ulcer pain. Smoking has many negative effects, including increasing stomach acid and increasing stomach pain. By stopping smoking, you can eliminate unnecessary acid and pain in your stomach., If self-treatment, prescription medication, or lifestyle changes do not reduce your pain, you should visit your doctor again. Your doctor may be able to check if other underlying conditions or complications are causing your pain."

, Aloe juice decreases inflammation and acts to neutralize the stomach acid, reducing pain. You can drink ½ cup (100 ml) of organic aloe vera juice twice a day if you are experiencing pain.Aloe vera also comes in tablet or gel form. Use as directed on the package.
Since aloe vera can act as a laxative, limit it to a total of one to two cups a day. Do not use aloe vera if you have chronic intestinal problems, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or irritable bowel syndrome., This method uses your own body’s acid sensors to tell it to shut down acid production. To do this, add one tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar to six ounces of water. Drink the mixture once a day.You only need to do this once a day, but daily use may lead to more relief over time.
The vinegar doesn’t have to be organic, but it does have to be apple cider vinegar. Other vinegars just don’t work as well as ACV.

, Make you own lemonade, limeade, or lemon-limeade. Mix a few teaspoons of pure lemon and/or lime juice into as much water as you would like. If you want, you can add a bit of honey to the drink. Drink this before, during, and after meals.Citrus is acidic, and too much of it may make your ulcers worse. Small, doses diluted with water may help, however. For example, one tablespoon of lemon juice with eight ounces of water may prevent pain when drunk twenty minutes before a meal.The extra acid in the lemon and lime juice tells your body to shut down acid production by a process called “feedback inhibition.”

, When you are feeling ulcer pain, snack on an apple. The pectin in the apple skin acts as a natural antacid., Herbal teas can help soothe your stomach and reduce ulcer pain. Teas made from ginger, fennel, and chamomile are good choices.Ginger acts an an anti-inflammatory and soothing agent for the stomach. It can also help with nausea and vomiting. You can buy ginger tea bags or make your own from fresh ginger. To make fresh ginger tea, cut up about one teaspoon of fresh ginger. Add the ginger to boiling water. Steep for about five minutes. Pour into a mug and drink. Do this anytime during the day, but especially about 20 to 30 minutes before meals.
Fennel helps settle the stomach and decreases the acid levels. To make a fennel tea, crush about a teaspoon of fennel seeds. Add the seeds to a cup of boiled water. Add honey to taste. Drink two to three cups a day about 20 minutes before meals.
Chamomile tea can calm the stomach and reduce stomach pain by acting as an anti-inflammatory agent. You can buy bags of chamomile tea from any store that sells tea.
Ginger tea is considered safe for pregnant women.

, Cranberry may be able to prevent the growth of H. pylori in your stomach. To get the benefits of cranberries, you can eat cranberry foods, drink cranberry juice, or take extracts.


Cranberry contains Salicylic Acid. If you are allergic to aspirin, do not eat cranberry.
Cranberry may interfere with some medications, such as Coumadin (warfarin). Talk to your doctor before taking cranberry extracts., Deglycyrrhizinated licorice root (DGL) works very well to heal the stomach and control hyperacidity and ulcer pain. It is available as chewable tablets, and the taste might take some getting used to.Follow manufacturer’s instructions — this usually means two to three tablets every four to six hours.

, Slippery elm coats and soothes irritated tissues. Try it either as a three to four ounce drink or as a tablet. Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s directions for the tablets.Slippery elm can have serious side effects and should not be taken if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Facilitate movement in natural water features.,
Wall artificial ponds with concrete, stone or plastic.,
Care for you pool diligently.,
Clean bird baths once a week.",How to Remove Sources of Standing Water2," If you have a pond on your property, there are several things you can do to ensure it doesn’t turn into a giant deposit of murky standing water. Foremost, install an aerator or fountain in the pond to maintain a constant disruption to the water’s surface.Another option is removing trees and brush from the immediate vicinity of the pond. This will allow the wind to ripple the pond’s surface.

, This will reduce the amount of organic material available for mosquito larvae to feed on. If you do decide to go with soil, make the walls of the pond as steep as possible to prevent shallow areas., If you have a pool, it can quickly turn into an expensive reservoir of standing water if not cared for actively. Chlorine is the most common treatment, as it is a relatively simple and inexpensive process. Make sure your pool’s aerator is working as well, and cover the pool whenever it is not in use., To prevent bird baths from serving as mosquito breeding grounds, the water should be removed and changed weekly. Whenever you do so, wipe the bird feeder with a rag or spray it out with the hose.Do the same with small hanging birdfeeders.

"
"
Change indoor water vessels weekly.,
Replace or fix broken appliances.,
Address a humid basement or crawl space.",How to Remove Sources of Standing Water3," There may be various sources of standing water in your home that should be regularly changed. For instance, vases, water bowls for your pet, and other household decor that uses water need to be emptied, cleaned, and refilled once a week.If you keep lots of plants in your home, make a list of everything that holds standing water to be sure you don’t forget one or another of your flowerpots.

, Your household likely has appliances that can create puddles of standing water if they’re not working correctly. For instance, improperly working refrigerators, dishwashers, and washing machines can create puddles, potentially beneath the appliance itself. If you discover that an appliance is leaking, immediately get it repaired and replace it if necessary.

, While many buildings have basements or crawl spaces that are damp, this usually does not lead to standing water. However, if allowed to persist, the issues that lead to a humid basement can potentially lead to damage, health risks, or accumulated water in the future.Note that a dehumidifier or even an interior moisture coating only address the symptoms, not the cause of the problem. Consult a home drainage professional to help you identify the source of the moisture and consider their recommendations.

, Breathing slowly and from deep within your diaphragm will immediately relax you. This may be difficult when your nose is clogged so try breathing from your mouth.Place your hand on your stomach and feel it push out as you inhale deeply. As you breathe all the air out, bring your stomach back to its original position. This is not a forceful motion, but rather just to ensure that you're indeed taking a deep breath from your diaphragm.

, Whether you are looking at your pet or examining your hand, focus on the present to reduce stress. Breathe slowly and focus on the moment by describing it to yourself in detail., Relax by recalling a serene location or happy memory. Whether you transport yourself to a beach or time an old college road trip, focus on details to calm your mood., Music can greatly influence your mood so choose something with a soothing melody or a song that you associate with a happy memory.Be careful not to irritate an already sore throat by singing along too loudly.

Choose activities you enjoy.",How to Relax when You Are Sick4," One drink may be okay but several can block the breathing passages in your nose especially at night. Read the labels of any medication you are taking as it generally is not recommended to combine medications with alcohol., If you lay flat, the post nasal drip will be pulled by gravity down from your nose into your throat, making it difficult to breathe.For example, read a book, have a movie marathon, or play with your pet.

, Whether you take a hot bath, use a humidifier, or place your face over a bowl of hot water with a towel over your head, moisture in the air loosens congestion.Be careful not to burn yourself if placing your head over a bowl of hot water.

, Avoid dehydration by drinking a lot of water. You lose a lot of fluids when you’re sick and have a runny nose and are congested. Replenish yourself with fluids that naturally have a calming effect. Choose a tea like chamomile to help you relax.Adding some honey to your tea as it helps to soothe your throat.
Many types of herbal tea can help with congestion, for instance, licorice root tea is an expectorant.

, Make time for yourself and relax as only you know how. Don’t let others add to your stress by volunteering unwanted help. Take the time you need to heal on your own.Make sure that you check in with any clients, teachers, or anyone else that will be affected by your absence. You won’t be able to relax if you’re receiving concerned emails or angry phone calls. Understand that everyone gets sick and that you’re allowed to take some time to recover.

Look at a calendar if you are a woman who gets a monthly period.,
See your doctor if you notice signs of water retention that you know are not hormone related.,
See your doctor right away if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms along with your water retention: swelling in the feet, legs, or ankles, swelling in the abdomen, chronic coughing, or extreme fatigue.,
Keep a food diary.",How to Reduce Water Retention1," Water retention is a classic symptom of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Hormonal changes associated with your menstrual cycle may cause monthly water retention problems. For most women, period bloat occurs 1 or 2 weeks before their periods begin.Water retention is also a common problem during pregnancy and menopause for the same reason. Hormonal changes that occur during these longer transition periods in the body cause excess fluid retention that may be constant, cyclical or intermittent.;
,


Your doctor may run various types of tests, such as blood or urine tests, depending on your other symptoms. These will check the health of your heart, kidneys, liver, circulatory, lymphatic, and thyroid systems. He or she may also ask you about symptoms of arthritis or allergies, both of which can also cause water retention in some cases.,


Water retention that is heart related is a result of changes in your blood pressure. Typically, the legs, feet, and/or ankles will start to swell. Fluid will also build up in the lungs, giving the patient a chronic cough. A doctor may order blood tests, a chest X-ray, or an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine if your water retention is a symptom of a heart condition.
A urine test will determine if you are losing protein through the kidneys and your water retention is a sign of a more serious kidney problem.
A physical exam and/or blood tests can determine if there is a liver problem. Again, with a more serious liver condition you would likely have swelling in the feet, legs, ankles, and abdomen. This is actually one of the first signs of liver disease.
Finally, blood tests can determine if your water retention is a symptom of circulatory system problems (leaky capillaries), a congested lymphatic system, or a thyroid disease (hypothyroidism)., Notice what you ate for a few days leading up to the water retention. It may take a couple of days for your body to retain excess body fluid after you eat salty foods.


Food sensitivities and/or malnutrition can be causes of water retention. If you have food sensitivities and are still eating these foods, or you are not eating a healthy diet in general, this will show up in your food diary. You can then take steps to change what you are eating.
High salt intake and dehydration are leading causes of water retention. How to stay hydrated and eat a balanced healthy diet are discussed more in the next section, ""Reducing Water Retention With Diet."" "

Make a fruit puree.,
Chop the fruit into pieces.,
Stir in fruit juice.,
Add in fruit pulp or zest.,
Apply a fruit spread.,
Stir fruit into drinks.",How to Replace Sugar with Fruit1," Put a banana, figs, papayas, or another fruit into a food processor and pulse until you have a somewhat smooth consistency. You can bake the fruits for a bit beforehand, if you choose. Add this fruit puree into your recipes as a replacement for sugar. If a recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar, you can use ½ cup puree., Get an assortment of dried fruits and then use a sharp knife to dice them into tiny bits. Add these pieces into a baked recipe or sprinkle them on top of a non-sweet food, such as oatmeal, in place of a few tablespoons of sugar. They will provide a punch of sweetness with more nutrients., You can press your own juice or you can buy a 100% juice from a store. If you buy from a store, make sure that your product contains no added sweeteners. Be careful when adding juice to a recipe as it can impact the cooking time and consistency of the final product. A ratio of ¾ cup juice for every 1 cup of sugar is usually a good place to start.You can also use juice concentrate directly from a can. If you are looking for a more syrupy texture, try boiling the juice until it loses around 30% of its water content.If you like to drink fruit juice, limit intake to 4 ounces a day to moderate your sugar intake.

, If you squeeze your own fresh juice, then make sure to save the leftover pulp. Or, get a zester and run a few oranges or limes over it, creating some aromatic shavings. You can think sprinkle the pulp or shaving on top of bland foods, such as yogurts. Adding pulp or shavings into a baked good will also enhance the flavor without requiring any baking or liquid modifications., Purchase or make your own jam or jelly. Take a knife and spread it on top of foods that taste good with a bit of additional sugar, such as waffles or whole-grain toast. Make sure to use jelly sparingly, however, as it will still have a high sugar content. To avoid this, you can also simply mash a fruit, such as a ripe banana, until it becomes spreadable.To give your jam or jelly an extra kick, mix in a spice, such as vanilla or cinnamon.

, If you enjoy sweet drinks, but are avoiding them due to their sugar content, then you might use fruit as an alternative sweetener. Slice up watermelon or lemons and place them into your water glass. Mash up some berries and put them in a pitcher, letting this mixture sit overnight.Try sparkling water for a refreshing twist, too.

Stay hydrated.,
Cut back on the sodium in your diet.,
Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet that includes a lot of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and other high-fiber foods.,
Check the ingredients list in processed food and drink items before you buy them.,
Allow time for cooking.",How to Reduce Water Retention2," 8 glasses of fluids per day is a general guideline- this is about how much most people need to not feel thirsty and have clear or light yellow urine. More active people may need more. All fluids count, but keep in mind that some are not as healthy as water. If you are retaining water, consider whether you are staying hydrated; if your body is suffering from dehydration, it retains water as a survival mechanism.Drink plenty of water, fruit juices, herbal teas and other non-caffeinated beverages allows your kidneys to flush out excess fluids.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol, because they contribute to dehydration.
Avoid too many sugary drinks or drinks containing high fructose corn syrup (sodas, juice cocktail drinks) because these are simply unhealthy and cause people to gain unwanted weight. , High-sodium diets are the number one cause of excess water weight.


Avoid processed foods, deli meats, salty snacks and other foods that are high in sodium.
Don't add salt to cooked meals at the table. Avoid foods like potato chips and salted nuts.
Prepare meals using fresh (not canned) vegetables and fruits, grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Watch how much salt you use while cooking; don't add more salt than a recipe calls for. Or, use specifically low-sodium cookbooks and internet recipes.,


Six servings of grains (at least half of which are whole grains - check the labels) are recommended per day. One serving is one slice of bread, or 1/2 cup (about the size of a baseball) of cooked rice, pasta, or cereal.
Four servings of vegetables are recommended per day. Eat a variety of colors and types (if you find that you eat mostly potatoes and corn as your vegetables, you should change this). One serving is one cup of raw leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, lettuce - the size of a small fist), 1/2 cup of cut up raw or cooked vegetables, or 1/2 cup of vegetable juice. Be careful of added sodium in some vegetable juices.
Four servings of fruit are recommended per day. Again, eat a variety of colors and types. One serving is one medium sized fruit (about the size of a baseball), 1/4 dried fruit, or 1/2 cup frozen, canned, or fruit juice. Be careful of added sugars in canned fruit or fruit juices and try to avoid these., Avoid ingredients like MSG (monosodium glutamate), sodium nitrates and nitrites, butylated hydroxy-anisole (BTA), sodium and potassium benzoates, artificial sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin, sucralose), corn syrup, palm oil, and food colorings (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow). This can be a hard habit to stick with. But, there are countless hidden added ingredients that are unhealthy in:

Get 20 minutes of physical exercise daily.,
Elevate your feet and legs.,
Take extra care to heed the diet, hydration, and lifestyle recommendations if you are a woman who experiences PMS.",How to Reduce Water Retention3," Exercise is a necessary part of a healthy lifestyle and has shown to be helpful in controlling water retention.


Take a walk or go hiking with friends or family.
Ride a bike, go swimming, or go jogging.
Grab a basketball or baseball and glove and hit the courts or the field.
If you live close enough, ride your bike or walk instead of driving to work or to run errands. You would also be helping the environment by driving less. Just be sure to wear a helmet and abide traffic laws while biking.
If you have to clean the house, put on music and dance while you clean. You would be surprised all the ways there are to exercise!, Standing for too many hours or sitting all day with your feet on the floor may cause fluids to drain into your feet and legs, which causes swelling.


Lie down or sit with your feet elevated when resting and taking breaks.
While lying down, have your feet elevated at least 12 inches above your heart level. You can put them on top of a stack of pillows or blankets., Often women who experience PMS crave extra salt and sugar. Try not to give into these cravings especially if you are someone who experiences severe cramping and bloating during the 1-2 weeks before your period. Regular exercise is also known to help women experience less PMS symptoms.


If you are following all of the diet and lifestyle recommendations but still experience extreme monthly cramping and bloating, discuss this with your gynecologist. You may have another nutrient deficiency or gynecological problem that he or she can help you with. "

Follow your doctor's advice and all directions for prescriptions if you have been diagnosed with a health problem that can cause water retention.,
Consult with your doctor about taking nutritional supplements if your diet may be lacking in certain nutrients due to food sensitivities.,
Consult with your doctor about trying a natural diuretic.,
Consult with your doctor about taking a chemical diuretic sold over the counter, or one that can be prescribed for you.",How to Reduce Water Retention4," Be sure that you report any changes in your health or your symptoms right away if you have a more serious condition that requires frequent medical supervision.

, Deficiencies in protein, calcium, magnesium and vitamins B1, B5 and B6 may lead to problems with water retention.


Your doctor or another qualified nutrition specialist can help you determine what nutrients you may be lacking based on your food diary or a basic summary of what you eat.

, Some herbal remedies are known to increase the kidney's fluid output, which helps control water retention.


Dandelion has no harmful side effects and can be used indefinitely. Add 10 to 20 drops of dandelion tincture to salads or other foods daily.
Dong quai is best added to an herbal tea and taken at bedtime because it has a mild sedative effect. Some teas are sold with dong quai in them, or you can purchase it as oil and add a few drops to your favorite tea. In addition to being a diuretic, dong quai is known to inhibit the growth of bacteria.
Essential oils used in vaporizers, gargles, baths and massage may help combat water retention. Lavender, rosemary, geranium and cypress are known to have good results.,


""Loop diuretics"" such as Lasix are most common, and they inhibit sodium reabsorption into the bloodstream, causing more water to drain as urine. This type of diuretic is especially helpful for patients suffering from renal impairment, liver cirrhosis, or heart conditions. While they can drain the body's store of potassium and contribute to osteoporosis, there is a kind that includes an extra potassium supplement in it (Lasix K).
Other types of chemical diuretics include thiazide diuretics, which produce similar effects as loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, which only inhibit the absorption of sodium and not potassium.
Some prescription and over-the-counter medications interact with or counteract diuretics. Check with your doctor to make sure a diuretic will not negatively affect any medication you are taking.

Consider silica substitutes.,
Wear an approved respirator.,
Isolate and ventilate dust.,
Don’t take the dust with you.,
Take job-specific protective measures.,
Identify crystalline silica.,
Learn about silicosis and other health risks.,
Determine your likelihood of exposure.,
Know and follow exposure limits.,
Ask your doctor about Silica Exposure Monitoring.",How to Reduce Silica Exposure," Most harmful exposure to inhaled silica comes from chipping, grinding, cutting, cleaning, or otherwise disrupting materials like concrete or glass that contain silica. Abrasive blasting (“sandblasting”) to remove paint, rust, etc. is perhaps the most likely source, as the blasting material itself is often primarily silica.When possible, consider using materials that don’t contain silica for industrial applications. For instance, there are numerous sandblasting material options that don’t contain any sand (which is primarily silica).
Often, however, the very nature of a job or task requires the creation of silica dust, so be prepared to take other measures to reduce exposure.;
, Silica dust can only harm you if you breathe it in. The use of respirators intended to filter out silica dust will substantially reduce the risk of negative health consequences. The use of such respirators is usually required by law and safety codes as well, when engaged in an occupation in which silica dust exposure is likely.If you are going to be exposed to airborne silica at concentrations of 50 micrograms per cubic meter, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends a half-face particulate respirator with a filter rating of N95 or better (the 95 indicates that the filter was able remove at least 95% of the most-penetrating particles during testing).For higher concentrations of silica particles, you will need a powered or supplied air respirator.Make sure you choose a respirator that is intended to block out silica dust, and that you wear it regularly and properly. The mask needs to create a seal over your mouth and nose., The less silica dust you create or leave floating around in your vicinity, the less you are likely to inhale. Therefore, proper dust reduction and ventilation procedures are also straightforward ways of reducing silica exposure.If, for instance, your job involves cutting concrete blocks, the use of a wet saw (which dampens potential silica dust) and a vacuum dust collector (which sucks up and isolates dust before it becomes airborne) will significantly reduce the amount of silica available to be inhaled.In fact, studies indicate that the use of wet saws and exhaust ventilators reduce silica concentration in the surrounding air by 96%., When engaged in activities that produce silica dust, you should wear disposable work suits or gear that can be removed on site and washed. Likewise, washing and showering facilities should be available nearby so you can wash away silica particles on your body or in your hair.You also should not eat or expose food to the area in which the dust is present. Clean up thoroughly before eating off-site.

, The best health and safety practices in regards to silica exposure will vary by the nature of the work being done. Workers in the “fracking” industry will have different needs than glass engravers or tombstone etchers. Consult the recommendations and regulations of your workplace health and safety authority (on the federal level in the U.S., OSHA) for guidance.This construction industry website contains a number of useful videos regarding silica safety in a range of occupations and tasks.
Current proposed OSHA regulations (as of 2016) recommend limiting exposure to no more than 50 micrograms per cubic meter over the course of an eight hour shift., In basic terms, silica is the main component of sand, and sand is present in various man-made masonry and concrete products, as well as glass. Silica is also a building block for many types of stone (such as granite) and is abundant in a wide range of soils. Essentially, silica is everywhere around us.Crystalline silica can occur in three forms, with quartz as by far the most common of the three. The other two are cristobalite and tridymite. All three are equally prone to becoming respirable and are equally dangerous if inhaled in large or recurring quantities.

, As you might expect from inhaling bits of grit over long periods of time, silica deposits end up in the lungs and create scarring. Such scarring creates a condition known as silicosis, which can cause significant breathing difficulties and sometimes even death. There is no cure and limited treatment options for silicosis.Silica dust is also a known carcinogen, and smokers are even more likely to develop lung cancer if they also have silica deposits in their lungs. Kidney damage and other health problems can also sometimes occur due to prolonged silica inhalation.

, If you are regularly engaged in utilizing silica (sand) in abrasive blasting, whether to clean fine jewelry or remove peeling house paint, you are likely to be exposed to high concentrations of silica dust on a daily basis. Similarly, if your work involves cutting, grinding, breaking up, or etching materials rich in silica — such as concrete, granite, or glass — you are also at an elevated risk for exposure.Silica dust inhalation must usually occur consistently over a lengthy period of time to become a health hazard, however. Chronic silicosis, the most common form of the disease, occurs after 15-20 years of moderate exposure. Accelerated silicosis occurs after 5-10 years of high exposure. In rare cases, acute silicosis can occur after two years or less of extreme exposure to silica dust. All of these forms of silicosis are equally dangerous.

, The dangers of silica inhalation have been known for decades, and there have been efforts to reduce allowable exposure limits in the U.S. since the 1970s. In early 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor proposed reducing the limit of allowed exposure to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air for eight hours, for all types of work. The current limits vary by job type and range from 100 to 250 on the same scale.If you are in charge of your work conditions, be vigilant in making sure you remain within the current silica dust exposure limits and follow all safety protocols. Do so not only to prevent running afoul of OSHA inspectors, but more importantly to safeguard the health of your workers and yourself. If you are not in charge of your work conditions, do your part to make sure the limits and regulations are known and being followed. Report unsafe work conditions to government regulators if necessary.

, If you are regularly exposed to large quantities of silica, your doctor may recommend a series of tests, including chest x-rays and lung spirometry, to monitor your exposure levels. Give your doctor as much information as possible about the amount, duration, and nature of your exposure. This information will help your doctor decide if these tests are appropriate for you.Keep in mind that frequent exposure to x-rays may have harmful effects, so discuss the benefits and risks of exposure monitoring with your doctor.

Go with ripe fruits.,
Pick a fruit that complements the recipe.,
Use dates or figs.,
Use bananas.,
Go with a more unusual fruit.",How to Replace Sugar with Fruit2," Fruits that have fully ripened are at their maximum sweetness potential. Their natural sugar content has increased with the ripening process, making them great candidates for a refined sugar replacement. Unripe fruits may be too bitter in taste to provide a seamless substitute.To find out how to determine when a fruit is ripe, go online and do a bit of research regarding particular fruits of interest. A banana, for example, loses its green tinting while ripening.

, Not all fruits will work well when added to other foods. If you are baking, give the batter a quick taste. Follow this with a quick sampling of your fruit to determine if the flavors mesh together well. Keep experimenting until you find a combination that works.In carrot cake, for example, the sweetness of crushed pineapple can bring out the natural sweetness in the carrots even more.

, Dates and figs are great sugar substitutes, not only due to their naturally sweet flavor, but also because they are very good for you! Each one contains an array of useful minerals, such as iron and calcium.Make a puree by boiling down the figs or dates in a saucepan and then blending them in a food processor until smooth. You can then mix this puree directly into baked recipes or pour it as a sauce over non-sweet foods.


Figs can be rather dry, so make sure to either boil them or soak them in water prior to blending.
A date or fig puree can usually be used as a direct one-to-one substitute for sugar in a recipe. Use one cup of puree for every one cup of sugar, for example.You can even make a date vinaigrette dressing by pulsing dates, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, salt, and extra virgin olive oil with a food processor., This is probably one of the easiest substitute preparations. You can mash a ripe banana until it reaches the consistency that you need. Or, you can mix it in a food processor with a bit of cinnamon or other spices. Usually a banana puree can be used in a baked recipe with a one-to-one ratio.When you are making a banana puree, you may need to add a few teaspoons of water to the mixture for consistency.

, Don’t be afraid to expand your palette and try new fruit substitutes. Melons are often overlooked, but they can make some of the best additions. The monk fruit, in particular, has gained a great deal of attention lately due to its natural sugar content. Look for monk fruit granule sweeteners in your grocery."
"
Do a bit of trial and error.,
Lower the amount of liquid included.,
Monitor the baking time.,
Expect some veggies to add a bit of sweetness, too.,
Accentuate sweetness in other ways.",How to Replace Sugar with Fruit3," Cooking or baking with a fruit replacement is not an exact science. Be prepared to experiment a bit with new flavor and texture combinations. Give yourself extra preparation time to get the fruit ready to add in, too. You might also ask your friends if they have any tried and true recipes using fruit as a sweetener.

, In many cases, you will need to adjust the other liquid elements in a recipe to accommodate the addition of fruit. Fruit, even in a dry form, may release liquid into a recipe. The amount that you reduce depends on the final consistency that you desire.For example, in a dish using fruit concentrate you will likely need to reduce the addition of other liquids by at least 3 tablespoons.

, Similar to the liquid content, if you are baking, then your oven time and temp may need to be adjusted as well. Experiment with adding five minutes and five degrees to see if that changes the final product. Make sure to check any baked good regularly to determine doneness.

, It is possible to make a food too sweet. When you are deciding how much fruit to use, don’t forget to count in the natural sweetness of the vegetables in your recipe. Sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrots, beets, and other vegetables all carry an undertone of sweetness. Pair them with a fruit that will draw this out without becoming overwhelming.For example, sweet potato and apple often complement one another and go well together in various dishes.

, To elevate the sweetness of a dish, try adding spices into the mixture. Cinnamon and vanilla, in particular, will bring out the natural sweetness in almost any food. You can also try to place sweet elements in a place where they will be tasted immediately, such as on top of a muffin instead of baked inside of it."

Protect your knee from further damage.,
Immobilize your knee.,
Compress your knee.,
Elevate your knee.",How to Recover from an MCL Sprain1," Limit the amount of moving around you do right after the injury occurs. Injured ligaments should be well rested to promote faster healing and to avoid further injury. Make sure to avoid placing any excessive pressure on your MCL, as this could cause further complications.Another way to avoid damaging your knee further is to avoid exposing your knee to hot temperatures for at least 48 hours after the injury occurs. Hot temperatures could cause your knee to swell up and become even more tender.;
, Your doctor may recommend that you wear a knee brace for a period of time (the length of time depends on how badly the knee was injured). A brace can help to keep your knee stable, which in turn can keep further damage from occurring.

, Use an ice compress to do this. Cold temperatures can help to numb the area so you feel less pain, while also restricting the flow of blood to the area, which can help to bring the swelling down.


Do not place an ice pack or ice directly against your skin; make sure to wrap it in a hand towel first to avoid damaging your skin. Hold the ice pack against your knee for 15 to 20 minutes, then let your knee rest.You can repeat this process throughout the day.

, You should elevate your knee above the level of your heart; doing this can help to keep the amount of swelling that occurs to a minimum. Continue to elevate your knee as much as possible for at least 48 to 72 hours after the injury occurs.You can use a pillow to prop up your leg.

Take medications to control the pain caused by the sprain.,
Talk to your doctor about surgical management.,
Get a brace for your knee.",How to Recover from an MCL Sprain2," In addition to managing the pain, you should also try to combat any swelling that occurs by taking either painkillers or NSAIDs:


Painkillers: These medications limit the pain impulses that are transmitted to your brain, so you don’t feel the pain as acutely. You can purchase simple painkillers, like Paracetamol, over-the-counter. If they don’t work to eliminate your pain, you can also get a prescription for stronger painkillers like codeine and tramadol from your doctor.
Oral Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These medications limit both pain and inflammation by acting on certain chemicals in your body. Common NSAIDs include Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Aspirin.

, Some people do not respond well to taking medications; if you are one of these people, you may want to consider correcting the damage through surgery.


MCL sprains are commonly corrected with arthroscopic surgery; this surgery involves using a tiny camera to get a visual picture of the damaged area to help surgeons repair the sprain.

, A lightweight hinged knee brace can help to gradually increase your range of motion. The brace keeps your knee stabilized to prevent further injury.As you recover, you may be given a different knee brace that can help you to begin using your knee again without putting too much pressure on the knee.

Understand why exercising your knee is important.",How to Recover from an MCL Sprain3," There are certain exercises that are recommended for people who have suffered an MCL sprain. However, it is important to talk to a physical therapist before you try any of these exercises; if you begin these exercises too soon after your injury, you could cause further damage., Assume a lying position with the injured knee in a bent position. Keep your foot flat on the floor and slowly slide the heel in the direction of your buttocks as far as you possibly can without it hurting.


Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times.

, Grasp the right foot with the right hand and gradually pull the foot up then behind your back, towards the buttocks. Reach as far as possible until a stretch is felt.


Maintain this position for 10 seconds then return your leg to the starting position. Switch to your other leg and repeat the exercise.

, In a standing pose, position one leg in front of the other leg. Bend the back knee while keeping the front knee straight. Place the weight on the bent knee and then lean forward. Stop once a stretch is felt at the back of the thigh


. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds then return to the starting position. Switch legs and repeat the exercise.

, Exercises and muscle movements promote good blood circulation and oxygen distribution to the affected area, thus speeding up the repair of the damaged tissue."

Be aware that there are different kinds of sprains that can occur in the MCL.,
Recognize the causes and risk factors of an MCL sprain.,
Look for symptoms of an MCL sprain.",How to Recover from an MCL Sprain4," Sprain can be classified depending on the severity of damage to the ligament:


First Degree Sprain: Only a small number of ligament fibres are damaged.
Second Degree Sprain: Affects a greater portion of ligament fibres however the ligaments stay integral.
Third Degree Sprain: Causes total shatter of the ligament that can affect other structures in the knee like the meniscus (cartilage) and Anterior Cruciate Ligament.

, People who play contact sports where you collide with other players often suffer from this injury. However, this type of sprain can also be caused by any trauma that causes a disturbance to the ligaments.


Athletes who participate in contact sports, or sports where they must run and change direction quickly are at a greater risk of injuring their MCLs.

, The signs and symptoms of an MCL sprain may vary depending on the degree of injury:


First degree sprain: Localized sharp pain is felt on the site of injury due to the stress or irritation placed on the ligament. Sensation of pain may worsen upon movement of joints or after any contact made on the injured part.
Second degree sprain: You may feel pain if the injured area is touched, or any pressure is applied to it. Inflammation may be visible within 24 hours after injury. The pain is sharp and throbbing or pulsating.
Third degree sprain: Rupture of the ligament is present accompanied by unsteadiness of the knee joint. Any movement or activity involving the knee joint may be impaired as well. Swelling can be apparent due to the leakage of fluids from the damaged joint. The pain is sharp and excruciating.

Wear dark-colored pants.,
Consider higher-waisted pants.,
Tend towards longer skirts and dresses.,
Use vertical stripes to give the illusion of length.,
Wear heels to make your legs appear longer.,
If you're really worried, consider shapewear.,
Spend the time (and money) getting a perfect fit.",How to Reduce Heavy Thighs1," Most people have heard the age-old advice ""black is slimming"" so many times that it's become a cliché. In fact, there's plenty of truth to the old saying. In general, the eye tends to focus on bright colors and ignore neutral shades like black, so wearing black clothes on your lower body in conjunction with brighter colors on your best features can direct attention away from your thighs and towards more appealing areas.Note, however, that the effect is lessened if you wear only black, as the crucial contrast between your dark pants and the rest of your body disappears.;
, Another sure-fire way to make your thighs look thinner is to visually extend the bottom half of your body with pants that sit above your natural waist. Since the eye processes the entire pant length as a person's legs, high-waisted looks can give the impression that your legs are significantly longer (and thinner.)


While high-waisted jeans at one point were seen as a painful reminder of 80s fashion, they're now actually somewhat en vogue again: see American Apparel's catalog or the wardrobe of modern style icons like Kendall and Kylie Jenner for examples., Thigh-slimming fashion isn't just limited to pants — even flowing garments like skirts and dresses are perfectly doable. The trick here is to choose garments that are longer and flowier than what you'd normally wear. The extra length gives the impression of long, straight lines flowing towards the floor, which minimizes any extra bulk in your thighs.Stay away from short, narrow skirts (i.e., miniskirts, pencil skirts, etc.) These fashion choices tend to emphasize the thighs, rather than downplay them. Plus, they show more of the thighs.

, Vertical stripes are a good choice for women looking to reduce their bulky thighs for the same reason that pinstriped suits are often recommended for men who want to appear slimmer. Vertical lines tend to lead the eyes upward and create the impression of a longer, slimmer figure — research has even confirmed this effect.By contrast, horizontal lines tend to have the effect of making someone appear slightly shorter and wider, so you may want to avoid them.

, Even something as simple as your choice of footwear can affect how your legs look. For instance, a moderate-length pair of heels lifts you up by a couple inches, making your body (and especially your legs) look a little longer than they actually are. In general, taller shoes are a good choice for anyone aiming to make themselves look a little slimmer.


Another good idea is to pick a pair of heels that have a low-cut vamp. A ""vamp"" is the part at the front of the shoe that conceals your toes. The lower it is, the more your foot can be seen and the longer your leg will appear., Shapewear is type of garment designed to change your figure by lifting, pulling or pushing your body into shape. In ages past, this often meant tight, painful contraptions like corsets and girdles, but today, shapewear is usually much more gentle and is designed to give a more natural look. Shapewear should never be absolutely necessary, but if you're desperate to slim your thighs, it can definitely work.


Shapewear garments that have a slimming effect on the thighs include products with names like slip shapers, thigh slimmers, control briefs, and bodysuits.If you do decide to go the shapewear route, don't overdo it. While gently, subtle shapewear can give your figure a boost, garments that squeeze tightly can actually harm you by compressing your internal organs., No matter what you're wearing, clothing that fits properly almost always looks better than clothing that doesn't. If you're worried about the way your thighs look in a certain dress or pair of pants, the problem may not be be with you — it may be with your clothes! Clothes shouldn't ever look or feel tight and restrictive, so if they do, you may want to consider taking the time to get your fit right. Talk to an employee at a clothing store (or a trusted friend) about finding a new outfit that fits better.


For ""nice clothes"" like formal wear, you may even want to visit a tailor's shop to get your fit just right. Keep in mind, however, that this option can become somewhat expensive.

Don't believe the spot-reduction myth.,
Run, run, run.,
Cautiously consider thigh-centered resistance exercises.,
Don't forget to neglect your glutes, hamstrings, and core.,
Stick with your exercise routine.",How to Reduce Heavy Thighs2," Though celebrity doctors, fad workout coaches, and glamor magazines may tell you differently, there is no way to lose fat from just one part of your body. This fact has been definitively proven by science — for instance, one study found that tennis players (who typically use one arm more than the other) have the same amount of fat on both arms.This means that exercising your thighs won't cause you to lose weight only there — you lose weight from your entire body, not from one part at a time.


There are, however, things you can do to make your thighs more appealing: you can tone your thigh muscles with exercise or you can lose weight from your entire body (including your thighs). In this section, we'll explore ways to do each.

, If you've ever met long-distance runners, you may have noticed that they tend to have long, slim bodies and muscly (but thin) legs. In general, long, low-intensity cardio exercise (like running) is a great way to start slimming down all over and improve your leg muscle tone. While other leg exercises can actually add bulk, long running sessions generally reduce bulk by causing you to lose fat over time and build toned muscles.Running for about 45 minutes to an hour four or more times per week should begin to produce noticeable results within about a month or so. However, if you're not able to run for this long at first, just run for as long as you can in a single session and aim to increase the length of time you run for by one minute each time. Eventually, you'll reach an optimal level of cardio ability.
Try to avoid cardio exercises that involve shorter, higher-intensity workouts. For example, cycling (especially at a stationary machine with added resistance) will definitely burn calories, but it can also make your thigh muscles bigger, rather than more toned and compact., While it can be useful for some, as noted above, resistance exercises (like weightlifting) may not always be the best choice for people looking to slim their thighs. The problem with resistance training is that it can increase the size of your thigh muscles. If this isn't paired with a loss in fat (and it's worth mentioning that resistance training isn't as effective at burning fat as running is), your thighs are likely to get bigger. However, if you're willing to pair your resistance exercises with cardio or a weight-loss diet to lose fat, you can achieve great results. Below is a short list of thigh-targeting exercises you may want to consider:


Squats
Deadlifts
Lunges
Leg lifts

, If you're doing resistance exercises, it's not a wise idea just to focus on your thigh muscles. This can give you an ""unbalanced"" look — for instance, strong and toned on the fronts of your legs, flabby on the back. For all-around good-looking legs, you'll also want target, at the very least, your gluteals, hamstrings, and important core groups like your hips and abs. This will have the effect of building toned muscle mass all over your lower body, not just in your thighs.


You may also want to target your calves — building the muscles in your lower leg can make the muscles in your upper leg look smaller by comparison.

, No matter how hard you work for them, it's impossible to get toned thighs overnight. Any sort of cardio or muscle-building routine will take time to produce results. Don't give up! Stick to your workout plan, continually challenge yourself, push yourself to work a little harder each time, and you will see major improvement in the long-term.If you find it hard to motivate yourself to exercise, try making it part of your routine. Exercising at the same time every day should cause you to form a habit — eventually, it may feel odd not to exercise. Note, however, that it can longer than the typically-cited 21 days for a true habit to form."

Monitor your daily calorie intake.,
Shoot to consistently spend more calories each day than you take in.,
Ensure that the food you do eat is nutritious.,
Give yourself the occasional ""break."",
Don't have unhealthy weight-loss habits.",How to Reduce Heavy Thighs3," While you can't lose weight from one part of your body specifically, losing weight from your entire body will also lower the amount of fat in your thighs. If you have good underlying muscle tone, this should leave you with slimmer, firmer thighs. Your first step should be to start keeping track of how many calories you eat per day — you may be surprised how quickly they can pile up.


Calorie counters can be a huge help here. These handy online programs allow you to input the food you eat each day to get an accurate count for your calorie intake, then input your height, weight, sex, and exercise level to figure out how many calories you've burnt. Great calorie counters are available at Fatsecret.com, Myfitnesspal.com, and more.There are even calorie counter apps available for download to mobile devices.

, Once you know how many calories you're eating each day, losing weight is simple (though often not easy.) As long as you eat fewer calories than you burn during the day, you will lose weight — it's just a matter of time. The greater the gap between the calories you intake and the calories you expend, the quicker you'll lose weight. Note, however, that any diet that leaves you unbearably hungry or unable to function is not a healthy one.


In general, one pound of body mass is equal to about 3,500 calories.Losing this many calories is more or less equal to losing one pound. In other words, if you have a calorie deficit of 500 calories per day, you'll lose about a pound per week because 500 × 7 = 3,500.

, Going on a diet doesn't mean starving your body of the things it needs to function. In fact, since you're eating less than you normally would, it's extra important to eat healthy so that your body gets adequate nutrition. As you stick to your diet, remember that you're aiming to skimp on calories, not nutrients, and plan your meals accordingly.


This means that high-calorie, low-nutrient foods (like processed foods, sweets, greasy snack foods, and so on) should be the first things to go. In fact, if you tend to overindulge in these sorts of foods, you may notice that removing them from your diet is enough to make you lose weight without changing anything else.
On the other hand, high-nutrient, low-calorie foods are a must. For example, nutrition-dense vegetables like kale and spinach can give you loads of vitamins and minerals for very few calories, while whole wheat grains provide plenty of energy and filling fiber. Even lean meats like chicken breast can provide filling, satisfying protein (a must if you're trying to build muscle) without having a caloric load that's unmanageable.
For more information, see our article on so-called superfoods.

, Going on a diet shouldn't mean making yourself absolutely miserable. It's OK to enjoy life's culinary pleasures from time to time, especially at special occasions like holidays, birthday parties, and so on. As long as you return to your diet the next day, any sort minor indulgence is unlikely to hurt your progress in the long term.


In fact, the boost in morale from a single diet ""cheat"" day can be so rewarding that some dieticians actually recommend it.Think of it like the productivity boost you get at work or school after going on vacation — taking some time off makes it easier to stay focused in the long term.

, As noted above, there are wrong ways to lose weight. For instance, losing weight too quickly can be harmful — even a cause of numerous health problems if it's prolonged. In addition, any sort of diet that relies on starvation, purging, or other drastic solutions should be out of the question. These tactics constitute eating disorders — potentially serious conditions that require medical intervention."

Eat fresh foods.,
Consider taking vitamins and supplements.,
Avoid foods that do not boost your energy.",How to Recover from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome2," Maintain a diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins. Fresh, whole foods are packed with the nutrients your body needs to function properly. Eating a large amount of fresh vegetables and proteins will improve your immune system, help maintain your general health, and keep your energy levels afloat.


Fresh foods are not always readily available. Most supermarkets carry fruits, vegetables, and meats, but not all foods are necessarily fresh. Packaged and processed foods usually carry many preservatives that are not good for the body. Look for a farmer’s market or health food store in your area. These markets often sell local foods produced with minimal additives.

, Always talk to your doctor before adding supplements to your routine. Supplements can interact negatively with other medications that you may be taking. A few supplements that have been shown to be useful in reducing CFS symptoms include:


Magnesium supplement for bone and muscle health.
L-carnitine supplement may support energy production in cells.
Vitamin D is also helpful for overall healthy functioning and energy levels.
Melatonin has been shown to improve symptoms of CFS. It also helps to regulate sleep which is very helpful if you have hard time getting rest at night.
Vitamin B12 is known to boost energy levels and help with fatigue. Vitamin B12 can be taken orally or injected.Omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats that lower the risk of serious health conditions and improve improve brain function. They are good for your general health and are commonly taken by people with CFS.Omega-3s can be found in foods like fish oils, flax seeds, and walnuts. , Caffeine, sugar, alcohol and saturated fats may spike your energy levels briefly, giving you false sense of alertness.In reality, these foods deplete your body’s resources and ultimately do not help reduce fatigue.

Talk to a psychotherapist.,
Try Cognitive behavioral therapy.,
Go to physical therapy.,
Get massages.,
Get acupuncture treatments.",How to Recover from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome3," Talking to a psychologist can help you cope with the mental and emotional aspects of chronic fatigue syndrome. A psychologist can advise you on ways to structure your life around the symptoms that you face. This monitored guidance is meant to give you a sense of control over the disorder and leads to recovery., CBT helps you to identify and reverse beliefs and coping behaviors that perpetuate disability and hinder recovery. You will be exploring your beliefs about the illness and will be encouraged to gradually gain control and change behaviors from passivity and helplessness to active participation in recovery., Graded exercise therapy in combination with psychological behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective for patients who suffer from CFS.A physical therapist can give you different sets of exercises that will help you regain strength. Most sessions include light exercise like muscle movements or stretching. Sessions slowly increase in intensity as your body strengthens over time.Communicate with your therapist. Let them know how you feel after your sessions. If you feel extremely exhausted, you should reduce the rigor of your activities.

, Going for a massage may help ease any pains that you’ve developed as a result of CFS. It is unclear, however, if massage on its own can help you recover from CFS because the symptoms tend to vary from day to day., Acupuncture has been known to treat conditions and symptoms similar to those of CFS. People with CFS often have a compromised immune system and do not feel refreshed after a long night’s sleep. Acupuncture has been reported to improve sleep and has been shown to boost the immune system."

Take a painkiller.,
Consider anti-anxiety medication.,
Talk to your doctor about antidepressants.,
Talk to your doctor about sleeping pills.",How to Recover from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome4," Painkillers like acetaminophen or NSAIDs help relieve body aches and inflammation. These drugs can relieve headaches, muscle aches, or joint pain associated with chronic fatigue syndrome.Use painkillers as a sleep aid. Some companies make a night-time version of their pain-reliever that contains ingredients to induce sleep. These may be appropriate if you have both body aches and trouble falling asleep.

, Prescription anti-anxiety medicine eases anxiety and stress.Emotional unrest is something to reduce and avoid when attempting to recover from CFS. Consult a doctor if you have severe anxiety that may require prescription drugs treatment.

, Some people who suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome are also depressed. Depression can complicate CFS, making recovery more difficult.Antidepressants may ease some of the symptoms associated with CFS like exhaustion and sleeplessness. A psychiatrist can help determine if antidepressants are the right treatment for you.


A low-dose tricyclic antidepressant and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy may be beneficial.

, Prescription sleeping pills may be a last resort after making adjustments to your diet and sleep schedule.Tell your doctor about your progress and have a conversation to determine if sleeping pills are right for you.


Avoid developing a sleeping pill dependency. Long term use of sleeping pills can cause one to develop an emotional or physical dependency. This means that you will not be able to sleep without taking the pill. Additionally, some bodies build a tolerance to sleeping pills to the point where they may not work and may even interrupt sleep."

Check to see if you have a fever of 38.6°C (101.4°F) or higher.,
Monitor any headaches you experience.,
Keep track of any sore throat you develop.,
Watch out for stomach pain.",How to Recognize Signs and Symptoms of Ebola1," When you become exposed to a virus, your body reacts by increasing your internal body temperatures, thus creating a fever. Fevers are meant to burn out the infection, thereby protecting you from the virus.


The Ebola virus also stimulates the production of cytokine and histamine in your body. The increased production of these two chemicals can also lead to a fever.;
, Viral infections often cause headaches, which means headaches can also be a sign of other illnesses, not just Ebola. Headaches occur when blood vessels in your head become narrow due to fever or infection.

, This symptom may not be present in some Ebola patients. When the virus begins to spread through the body, it creates symptoms much like the flu, so there is the potential for a sore throat to develop.


Your throat may begin to feel scratchy or dry. This can lead to irritation of the throat lining which leads to a sore throat.

, This happens when virions (virus particles) start invading the gastrointestinal tract. The virions will attack the intestinal cells thus causing stomach pain by altering normal gastrointestinal activity."

Know the most common places where boils form.,
Examine the spot where you feel pain.,
Look for any signs of redness.,
Check to see if the spot feels hot.",How to Recognize Boils1," More often than not, a boil will for on your face, neck, shoulders, armpits, or buttocks. A boil forms around an ingrown hair where the bacteria will multiply and infect the area., A boil in the early stages of its formation will hurt only when touched. If you notice that a small spot on your body is particularly tender, you will want to examine that area. Does it hurt when you touch it? Does it feel hard to the touch?

, Boils that are beginning to form will take on a red color. This is because your body is sending blood to the area to fight the infection. When blood is pumped to an area, it brings oxygen and bacteria-fighting cells with it. The rush of blood to the area will give the forming boil a red color. The area will also be swollen because of the blood being pumped to that particular spot.

, An area where a boil is forming will feel hot to the touch. Heat is another way that your body fights off infection. Your body will send waves of heat to the infected area in an attempt to kill the bacteria located there. When you touch the spot, it will feel hot."
"
Look for internal and external bleeding.,
Monitor vomiting or nausea you experience.,
Take note if you experience diarrhea.,
Keep track of a loss of appetite.,
Look for skin rashes.,
Check for signs of impaired liver function.",How to Recognize Signs and Symptoms of Ebola2," This virus is also known as Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever. This is because the virus causes roughly half of Ebola patients to lose blood from puncture sites, or from mucosal membranes (such as the lips and gums). This bleeding occurs because the virus causes damage to the blood vessels.This bleeding can also occur around the ears, eyes, nose, and anus. It may also cause blood to appear in stool.

, If you have contracted Ebola, you will begin to vomit frequently. The virus creates chemical abnormalities that the body considers poison, which leads to vomiting.

, Since intestinal and gastric cells are being damaged by the virions of Ebola, you may begin to experience frequent diarrhea.


Diarrhea is defined as loose, watery stool that occurs at least three times a day.

, As the virus multiplies in the body, it can weaken systems, including the digestive system. The virus may begin attacking endothelial cells, which are located in the stomach; when this occurs, you may lose your appetite.

, This rash generally appears roughly five days after you have been infected with the virus. The rash is caused by increased levels of histamine in your body.This rash is often prominent on the chest, though it can also cover the rest of your body. The rash will look like numerous red dots, that may be raised, though sometimes they are not raised.

, Virus particles in the gastrointestinal tract will also damage and attack hepatocytes which are cells found in the liver. If this occurs, the liver will leak bilirubin (a yellowing substance produced in the liver) into the blood vessels. When excessive bilirubin is in the blood it may cause jaundice to occur.


Jaundice causes the skin and whites of the eyes to take on a yellowish color.

Take into consideration places where you have traveled recently.,
Contact your doctor.,
Get an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test done.,
Be prepared to get a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test done.",How to Recognize Signs and Symptoms of Ebola3," Even though Ebola has only manifested in Africa, this 2014 outbreak has cases of imported Ebola, which means that people who were infected with Ebola returned to their native country, and developed symptoms upon arrival.For this reason, anyone who traveled to parts of the world where Ebola is present, should immediately report to local healthcare centers, especially if symptoms like the ones mentioned above appear.

, An imported case of Ebola is the only way for you to get ill if you have never visited or lived in places where Ebola is known to be present. For this reason, it is impossible for people to contract Ebola anywhere else, even though individuals might experience the exact symptoms. It is most likely that in these cases, some other disease is affecting them.Nevertheless, it is best to report to your physician once these symptoms appear, to establish a diagnosis promptly.

, This test measures and detects antibodies in the blood. This is used to determine if you have certain antibodies that are related to certain infections. In performing this test, a blood sample is taken from your arm. The blood serum is sent to the lab for testing and analysis.


The result will indicate if you are positive of an Ebola antigen in the blood.

, This diagnostic test can diagnose Ebola virus faster than an ELISA test. PCR can also detect the viral load inside the body and is able to measure amplification of DNA. This procedure will test your blood, plasma, and whole blood.


If positive, the result will show that an Ebola antigen is present on the serum.You can generally get results within 48 hours."
"
Be aware that contact with an infected animal could lead to contracting the virus.,
Minimize any contact you have with other people’s bodily fluids, as this is how the virus is spread.,
Understand that Ebola cannot be transmitted through the air.",How to Recognize Signs and Symptoms of Ebola4," Ebola is normally found among bats and wild monkeys, making these animals a reservoir for the virus. Direct contact with these animals, or their secretions, can result in contracting the disease., Once a human gets infected with the disease, human-to-human transmission is possible through direct contact, including touching, sexual transmission, and by being exposed to infected bodily fluids. This means that in order for the virus to be transmitted from one human to another, physical contact must be made, whether it includes bodily fluids, or just skin contact.


The virus can stay alive in sperm tissue for roughly 60 days, making male individuals highly infectious for a prolonged period of time., Some other viruses, like influenza, can be transmitted through air, making them highly infectious, but Ebola is not transmitted this way.

Eat at least two fresh fruits (or vegetables) with each meal.,
Drink ""real"" beverages.,
Make sure your meat is locally grown.,
Stay away from fast food restaurants and also fried foods.,
Add a couple of whole foods to your diet, at least daily.,
Do not use food products that are lite, light, free, nonfat, etc.,
Be sure that your grains are 100%.,
Stop eating when you are full.,
Don't use refined sugars.Refined sugar goes by many names; to include sugar, brown sugar, table sugar, etc. ,
Do not use refined oils.,
Eat at least one locally grown product with each meal.,
Don't use any sweetener.,
Don't eat any products with over five ingredients.",How to Reduce Your Chemical Intake," If at all possible, have organic. Do this with every meal. Be sure to wash it thoroughly.;
, These are ones like coffee, tea, milk, and water. Only sweeten them with natural products, like 100% honey or 100% maple syrup. Be sure that they are 100%. Otherwise, it is very likely that there is high fructose corn syrup in them.

, Also, reduce your intake. Meat is, quite often, processed. Reduce your exposure to chemicals by reducing your intake of meat. Grass fed is better than grain fed.

, Frying foods does some rather unpleasant things to the makeup of the food., This means that you are eating foods at their most basic. Basically, you are eating it as it was created., What they do when they create those foods is alter them chemically. Aspertame is a particularly nasty character.

, Anything less has very little, if any, nutritional valueWheat is one of the food items that has been seriously altered by scientists.

, Don't put something in your mouth just because it looks good. Make sure you're hungry. This will slow your consumption of snack foods which are, usually, highly adulterated.

,, Refined oils are oils that have been heavily modified. Oils, like extra virgin olive oil are minimally processed, and are created by pressing versus chemical extraction, Your local Farmer's Market is a great place to find products like this.

, Even that seemingly harmless table sugar is most likely created from GMO altered sugar beets. It is also a good habit to cultivate in your life.

, Usually, any food that has a lot of ingredients, has been severely adulterated. If you can't pronounce it, you shouldn't eat it.

Know that the boil will become larger, softer, and more painful.,
Look out for any pus.,
Take note if you develop a fever.,
Check to see if your lymph nodes are swollen.",How to Recognize Boils2," When a boil continues to grow unchecked, its characteristics will change. The painful area will grow in size, but it will become softer to the touch. However, it will be painful even when you are not touching it. Some people describe the pain as a pulsing sensation.A boil in the late stages can range in size from that of a pea to the size of a golf ball.

, The boil may develop a white or yellow center directly in the middle of the infected area. This is actually pus that is collecting inside the boil. If the boil ruptures, the pus will leak out and it will be very painful.

, If the body finds that it cannot fight the boil because it has become to infected and large, the body may raise its overall temperature to fight the infection. When your body increases its temperature, you are at risk of running a fever.Fever can also cause fatigue.

, Your lymph nodes are part of your immune system. When an area of the body becomes infected, the lymph nodes will try to filter your blood of the bacteria and eliminate the detected pathogen. When the lymph nodes attempt this, they will become swollen.


There are lymph nodes located all over your body. The ones you will want to check are located in your neck.

"

Have good hygiene.,
Make sure your immune system is up and running.,
Avoid close contact with a person who already has boils.,
Know if a medication you are taking may predispose you to boils.",How to Recognize Boils3," People with poor hygiene are more likely to develop a boil. Make sure to take showers regularly and give your entire body a good scrub with a sponge and soap. Keep your hair grease-free. When you have dirty skin, bacteria can much more easily stick to it and create an infection., When your immune system is in poor shape, you are more likely to develop an infection. Some diseases like diabetes can weaken your defense system against outer infection sources. AIDS is another condition that will favor an infection by crippling your immunity. If you underwent chemotherapy, or recently suffered an organ transplant, you will also be prone to develop boils. To boost your immune system:


Eat a diet that focuses on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Try to avoid saturated fats as much as possible.
Exercise three to four times a week and maintain a healthy weight.
Get plenty of sleep. The amount of sleep you need depends on your age, but you will generally want to shoot for around eight hours each night.
Wash your hands regularly to avoid picking up any bacteria.

, Spending each day with a person infected with bacteria will increase your chances of developing boils, because you will constantly be exposed to the microbe. Working in a hospital and having contact with pathogens will also increase the chances of you getting infected.

, Medications can predispose a person to boils. If you take immunosuppressant drugs such as corticosteroids, your immune system can dramatically become ineffective.

Keep a look out for the secondary symptoms of Lyme disease.,
Discuss with your doctor whether you might have chronic Lyme disease if you experience the symptoms.,
Get diagnosed with Lyme disease.,
Get treated for Lyme disease.",How to Reduce Your Lyme Disease Risk," In the US it is mostly in the northeast and Midwest, though it appears to be spreading along the Pacific Northwest coast. Be sure to protect yourself from ticks if you are in an area that is known to have ticks.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a map showing where active Lyme disease cases have been reported. You can see it here: http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/maps.html

Be especially cautious of ticks in the summer. Ticks are most active in the warmer months (April to September).;
, Avoid areas that are wooded or brushy unless wearing protective clothing. If you are in wooded or brushy areas, walk in the center of the trail. Some ways to protect yourself with clothing include:


Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave so you can see ticks on them.
Wear shoes that cover your entire foot, long pants, and a shirt with long sleeves.
Tuck your pant legs into your shoes or boots.
Keep long hair tied back.

, Tick repellents should contain 20 – 30% DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) and should be used on all exposed skin and clothing. Always follow product instructions.


Make certain an adult applies the DEET on children, avoiding their hands, eyes, and mouth.
Treat all clothing, boots, backpacks, and tents with products containing 0.5% permethrin. Keep this gear separate from untreated clothing and gear. The permethrin stays on the clothing through several washings.

, After coming inside, remove and wash all clothing and washable gear. Dry clothing on high heat to kill ticks.


Bathe or shower as soon as possible. Use plenty of soap and water to wash off.

, It is important to check under the arms, between the legs, behind the knees, around the waist, your pubic area, on the scalp, inside your belly button and in and around the ears for ticks. Have someone look at the areas of your body that you can't see. Remember, ticks are very small, so you may want to use a lighted magnifying glass.


Check your children thoroughly. Children between the ages of five and 14 appear to be at highest risk of Lyme disease, followed by adults, aged 45 – 54 years.Also check any non-washable gear for ticks
These ticks can be very easy to miss. They can be roughly the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

, Ask your veterinarian about any tick-borne diseases that are common in your area. Both dogs and cats, as well as any other furry pets you have, should have regular treatment for ticks. These tick treatments may include:


Products which kill ticks: these can include dusts, collars, sprays or topical treatments to apply or use directly on the animal. These include Fipronil and Amitraz.
Tick repellents: these help prevent the ticks from landing but don’t actually kill the ticks. The most common type of tick repellents are Pyrethroids, including permethrin.
Most dogs and cats are recommend to be on monthly prophylactic medications for both heart worm and ticks.

, Check all your pets every day for ticks daily, especially if they spend a lot of time outdoors. Dogs particularly need to be checked for ticks. Dogs themselves can get tick-borne diseases and they can bring the ticks into contact with you., If you find a tick on your dog, remove it right away. If you are uncomfortable with this procedure, you can ask your vet to remove it.

, Keep grass mowed, leaves raked, and brush cleared.


If you use firewood, stack it neatly and in a dry area.

, Put in a three-foot-wide barrier between lawns and wooded areas. The barrier should be made of wood chips or gravel. Also make sure there is a nine-foot-wide barrier of lawn between the wood chip or gravel barrier and any area where people sit or play. This includes patios, gardens, and play areas.


Play areas should be in a sunny location. Ticks don’t like sunny areas.

, If you live in an area where Lyme disease is common, check with a professional pesticide company to see if your property can be effectively treated with tick pesticides. These pesticides are also known as acaricides.

, If you find a tick attached to your or anyone else’s skin, first of all, do not panic! Not all ticks are infected, and you can greatly reduce your risk of Lyme disease if you remove the tick within the first 24 – 36 hours.

, Grab the tick by the head using a pair of pointed tweezers. The head is the part attached to the skin. Pull firmly and steadily directly outward. Don’t jerk or twist the tick.


Do not grab the tick by the body. If you do you may just detach the body from the head, leaving the head attached. If you leave the head attached to your skin, you may still get infected.

, Place the tick in a small container of rubbing alcohol to kill it. Clean the bite wound with rubbing alcohol or with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Also clean the tweezers you used to remove the tick.

, You are watching to see if a “bull’s eye” rash develops. If you develop the rash, or flu-like symptoms, you should contact your doctor immediately.


If you live in an area where Lyme disease is common and you think that the tick may have been feeding off you for more than 24 hours, call your physician to tell them about the tick bite.
The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends preventative antibiotic treatment with doxycycline (one dose) for anyone who meets the following criteria:The attached tick is identified as an adult or nymphal I. scapularis tick (deer tick).
The tick is estimated to have been attached for over 36 hours (this can be determined the degree of engorgement or time of exposure).
The local rate of infection of ticks with B. burgdorferi (Lyme disease) is greater than 20 percent (these rates of infection have been shown to occur in parts of New England, parts of the mid-Atlantic States, and parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin).



, In general, Lyme disease occurs in three phases, with a possible fourth. If you have been bitten by a tick recently, or you just live in a tick-infested area, keep on a lookout for these symptoms.The first stage usually occurs within days or weeks of the tick bite. These symptoms can be very mild, so they can be easily missed. These include:


Fever
Aches
Headache
Fatigue
Muscle and joint aches
Swollen lymph nodes
Erythema migrans (EM): this is a rash that resembles a target or “bull’s eye.” This rash occurs in about 70 – 80% of infected people. The center of the target is the site of the tick bite and can appear anywhere on the body. The center may be red and surrounded by a clear area. The clear area is then surrounded by the circular, moving or migrating rash.

, These symptoms can show up weeks or months after the first, if the first stage has not been found and treated. The second stage involves nervous system and heart problems. Symptoms include:


Severe headaches
EM skin rashes
Arthritic joint pains
Muscle and tendon pains
Heart palpitations and irregular heart beats (Lyme carditis)
Problems with short-term memory
Facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy)

, There is a stage of Lyme disease that is estimated to occur in about 10% of all patients. It is often referred to as “post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome,"" PTLDS, or chronic Lyme disease. Symptoms include fatigue and joint and muscle pain. These symptoms can last for six or more months after treatment with antibiotics, which is the currently recommended treatment for Lyme disease.


There is some controversy about this stage. The controversy is not whether or not the stage exists, but what is the exact cause. It may not be from persistence of the Borrelia bug in the person despite treatment. It is thought to be from some other immunologic consequence, but it is not yet understood what the mechanism is exactly.

, If your symptoms indicate Lyme disease and you are in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent, your doctor should test you for the disease. The CDC suggests that labs use a two-step blood testing procedure for Lyme disease. Your doctor should send your blood to a lab to get this testing., If Lyme disease is diagnosed, a course of treatment with antibiotics is started. These antibiotics may be doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil. They are usually given orally, though intravenous treatment may be needed in some cases.

Eat iron-rich foods.,
Increase your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C can facilitate iron absorption in the body.,
Eat more folic acid-rich foods.,
Eat whole grains.,
Avoid foods that block iron.,
Try to eat less gluten.,
Use withania supplements to boost hemoglobin levels.,
Take nettle leaf to get a rich source of iron.,
Try dong quai supplements.,
Consider trying chitosan.,
Talk to your doctor about taking supplements to increase your hemoglobin count.,
Talk to your doctor about getting erythropoietin injections.,
Consider getting a blood transfusion if your hemoglobin levels are very low.",How to Raise Hemoglobin," Iron is an important element in hemoglobin production. If you’re suffering from low hemoglobin count, increase your consumption of iron-rich foods such as:Liver
Meat
Shrimp
Beef
Tofu
Spinach
Pineapple
Nuts like almonds. These should be eaten with precaution to avoid having an allergic reaction.;
, It can be acquired by consuming these fruits and vegetables:


Oranges
Mangoes
Tangerines
Strawberries
Cabbage
Broccoli
Peppers
Spinach.

, Folic acids are vital in red blood cell production. Foods that are rich in folic acids include:


Seeds
Peanuts
Wheat germ
Sprouts
Broccoli
Nuts

If your diet also includes lots of vitamin C, it is advised to eat a little more folic acid since Vitamin C makes the body excrete folic acid.



, Cereals, pastas and breads made from whole grains are enriched with iron. As we discussed, iron is a main component in the production of hemoglobin (the blood needs it to form the proteins). Eating these foods can up your iron levels, in turn upping your hemoglobin level.


Stay away from white breads, cereals, and pastas. These have had their nutrients processed out of them, also resulting in them losing their color. They offer little nutritional benefit and are often full of simple carbohydrates, or sugars.

, Avoid iron blockers – these are food items that can block the body’s ability to absorb iron. Examples of iron-blocking foods and substances are:


Parsley
Coffee
Milk
Tea
Colas
Over the counter antacids
Fiber and calcium-rich foods

, Gluten is a form of protein that can be obtained from grains. For some individuals with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, the intake of foods containing gluten can damage the lining of the small intestine, which in turn can cause impairment in nutrient absorption including calcium, fat, folate and iron.


Nowadays, having a gluten-free diet doesn't have to be inconvenient. Many restaurants easily accommodate those that need to eat gluten-free and gluten is also labeled on many products in grocery stores.

, Studies show that usage of this herb may cause a substantial increase in hemoglobin levels, especially in children. It is used in ayurvedic medicine to treat iron deficiency anemia.In the aforementioned study of those using withania, red blood cell counts improved and hemoglobin levels increased. Talk to your doctor about this supplement and how much is appropriate for you.

, Nettle leaf is an herb that can be a rich source of iron and is customarily used to treat arthritis. Iron plays an important role in producing and absorbing hemoglobin. The more iron you take, the more hemoglobin will be produced.


Nettle leaf is available in many vitamin and supplement stores and online. It is available as an oil, in capsule form, and even as a tea.

, Experimental studies reveal that the consumption of dong quai can restore hemoglobin levels to a nearly normal range.It is traditionally utilized to treat premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menstrual symptoms, menstrual cramps, constipation and anemia. The cobalt in dong quai is thought to increase the hemoglobin content of your blood.


Dong quai is mostly available in capsule form, though it can also be used as an oil you can mix into your drinks. It is available at supplement stores, some pharmacies, and online.

, Studies demonstrate that patients with kidney failure that were given 45 mg of chitosan showed relatively reduced cholesterol levels and increased hemoglobin levels.Talk to your doctor about this natural remedy and if it's right for you.


Chitosan is available online and in special vitamin supplement stores. For the record, it's pronounced KITE-uh-san.

, Some patients are advised to take prescribed or over the counter medications or supplements to augment their levels of hemoglobin. Supplements may include:20-25mg of iron per day. This stimulates the production of hematin.
400mcg of folic acid per day. This is taken to increase the production of red blood cells which transport hemoglobin.
50-100mcg per day of vitamin B6. This functions also to increase red blood cell production.
500-1000mg per day of vitamin B12. It is prescribed to enhance red blood cell count.
1000mg per day of vitamin C. It is administered for red blood cell production as well.

, Erythropoietin is a hormone manufactured by the kidneys to promote the development of red blood cells by the bone marrow. Once the kidney cells sense that the oxygen level in the blood is too low it produces and releases erythropoietin to stimulate the bone marrow to generate more red blood cells. The increase in red blood cell count can also enhance the capacity of blood to carry oxygen.


In general, erythropoietin functions mainly to encourage the production of red blood cells and instigate the synthesis of hemoglobin (a component of the red blood cells that are in charge in transporting oxygen) .
Erythropoietin is administered either through the veins or via subcutaneous (external, fatty portion of the legs and thighs) injection.

, Blood transfusions are sometimes recommended by health care providers to improve hemoglobin count.


Prior to transfusion, safety precautions are taken to ensure the quality and compatibility of blood. It is tested for signs of contamination which can cause adverse reactions to patients. Donated blood can contain infectious components for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis so proper screening is very important.
After a thorough examination, the blood transfusion is given. It is administered through a central venous catheter or intravenous line in the arm over several hours.
The patient is then watched carefully for any untoward signs of blood transfusion such as difficulty of breathing, itchiness or rashes and an increase in body temperature.

Massage the tops and bottoms of your feet.",How to Read a Foot Reflexology Chart," Starting out, learn about the basic areas on a foot reflexology chart. This outlines the major organs locations on the foot.The right foot is associated with the right part of the body and left foot is associated with the left side of the body. The stomach, for example, is primarily located on the left side of the body so massaging and applying pressure to the left foot can treat stomach ailments.
The toes and feet indicate your head and neck. Massaging your toes in foot reflexology means working your head and neck.
The insides of your feet correlate to your spine.
The area just underneath your toes corresponds to the chest.
The thinnest part of your foot, usually found towards its center, is known as the waistline. Parts of your foot correlated with the stomach are found above the waistline. Parts correlated with the intestines are found below.The bottom of your foot is connected with your pelvic area.;
, The sole chart is fairly easy to learn and deals only with the underside of the foot, not the tops or sides of the feet. If you're starting out with foot reflexology, keep your main focus on the sole chart. It provides slightly more details in regards to which parts of the foot are connected to which parts of the body.When it comes to toes, the second and third toe after your big toe are connected to the eyes. If you have eye strain, applying pressure in that area can help. Your remaining toes are connected to your teeth, your sinuses, and the top of your head.
Pressure points do differ on the left foot and right foot; however, there are some similarities.

Your ears are affected by the areas just below your toes on both feet.
On both feet, the lungs are found about an inch below all your toes except the big toe.
Your heels on both feet are connected to your legs.
The area just below the waistline is connected to your small intestine on both feet.


On the right foot, your liver is connected to the area just above the waistline and slightly to the left. If you move even further left, you'll hit your right kidney.
On your left foot, the area just above the waistline is your stomach. If you move down slightly, you'll hit your left kidney. Your spleen is found just to the right of the stomach area. Your heart is about two inches below the middle of your toes.

, If you want to get slightly more details in regards to a reflexology massage, you can use a toe chart. Toes contain what are referred to as meridian points, which are small pressure points correlated to certain body parts. There are five meridian points on each foot.There are two meridian points on either side of the big toe. The meridian point on the outer part of the big toe corresponds to the spleen. The one on the inner point corresponds to the liver.
On the toe next to the big toe, there is a meridian point on the left side. This corresponds to the middle of your stomach.
On the toe next to your pinky toe, there is a meridian point on the left side that connects to the gallbladder.
On your pinky toe, there is a meridian point on the left side. This corresponds to your bladder.

, An outside chart displays what areas of the body correspond to the side of your foot pointing away for the body. It also covers the top of your foot. For a more detailed reflexology massage, you can consult this chart.The very top of your foot corresponds to your lymphatic system.The lymphatic system is the part of your immune system that helps filter out toxins and other wastes.The area just above your toes is connected to the chest. The side of your foot above your heel is connected to the hips and knees.
The side of your foot just below your waistline connects to the elbow. If you move down slightly further, to the side of your foot just above your pinky toe, you'll hit your shoulder., An inside chart addresses addresses the side of the foot facing inward towards your other foot. It can also be helpful to know for more detailed foot reflexology massages.The bottom of your foot from the tip of your big toe to your heel represents your spine. The insides of your feet are the same basic shape as your spine, with the same curves and bends.
Just under the waistline there should be a puffy, oval-like mound on the side of your foot. This is connected to your bladder.

, Remember, the inner and outer charts are for people experienced with foot reflexology. Wait until you feel comfortable with the basics before trying to fully understand how to work the inner and outer charts. You may want to meet with a foot reflexology specialist or consider taking classes if you're interested in the inner and outer charts., To start a foot reflexology massage, begin with the toes. You should massage with the rotating thumb technique. Using your thumbs, press in, rotate, lift, and then move, focusing on covering only small areas of the body at a time.


Start by massaging the bottom of your big toe, Then, slowly move to the tip of your toe. Then, repeat the process with your remaining toes.Slide your index fingers and thumbs between the webbing of your toes, massaging this area first.

, After you finish massaging the toes on both feet, focus on your left foot. Cup your hand around the top of your foot. Using your thumbs, massage the foot from left to right on both sides. Then, massage from top to bottom on both sides., Once you've finished with your left foot, repeat the same process with your right foot. Remember to massage with your thumbs and massage from top to bottom and then left to right on both sides., Move on to the tops and sides of your feet. This is where your knowledge of foot reflexology is most useful.If you have abdominal problems, focus on the arch of your foot as well as the area above the waist line. Remember, the stomach is primarily located on the left foot.
If you have issues with your liver and gull bladder, focus mostly on the right foot.
If you're having issues with the kidney, focus on your ankles and heel.

Reduce physical stress.",How to Push a Hernia Back in," You can buy a hernia truss or belt at a medical supply store or pharmacy. Your doctor should recommend a specific type of support based on your hernia. In general, these supports are elastic bands or elastic underwear designed to keep the area around the hernia flat.


Your doctor should also teach you how to put on the truss, patch or belt.
A hernia belt will wrap around your waist, supporting the hernia. A hernia truss is an undergarment that helps keep the hernia in place.;
, Lay on your back so gravity helps push the hernia down. If you're using a belt, be sure to lay down on the belt so you can wrap it around your waist and the hernia. If you're putting on a tress, you can either pull it on while you lay down or stand up if it's easier for you.


Wash your hands before you put on the hernia support and make sure the support is clean and dry.

, Depending on your hernia, you should be able to use your hands and gently push the hernia into your stomach, groin, or belly button. This won't require much maneuvering and it shouldn't hurt.


If it hurts when you apply pressure to the hernia, stop and contact your doctor. You don't want to force the hernia into place which could cause more damage to your abdominal muscles.

, If you're using a band, carefully bring one side of the wrap over your abdomen. Remember, you should be laying on top of it. Bring the other side of the wrap across your abdomen so that it gives snug pressure. This keeps your hernia in place.


If you're using a hernia truss, simply pull the undergarment on to keep the hernia situated.

, Since you should only be using the support with your doctor's recommendation, wear the support for as long as advised. You should understand that pushing the hernia back in will cause temporary relief, but is not a permanent treatment.Your doctor may recommend using a hernia support until you're able to get corrective surgery.

, If you feel pain, tenderness, or discomfort when you push the hernia, stop pushing and call for medical help. Hernias can block blood flow within the abdomen which can cause a medical emergency. Pain can indicate:


A hernia that's become trapped in the abdominal wall.
A hernia that's become twisted and strangulated, which cuts off blood supply. If this happens, tissue dies and can cause gangrene.

, While you can push a hernia back in and use a support to relieve discomfort, surgery is the only permanent treatment for hernias.Discuss whether you'd like to consider this as an option. Keep in mind that most hernias are not medical emergencies, but they can become medical emergencies.


There are no medications to treat a hernia.

, Your doctor may recommend putting you under general anesthesia and performing open surgery. With this traditional approach, a surgeon opens the abdominal wall and repairs the hernia before closing the wall. Or, your doctor may recommend laparoscopic surgery in which small fiberoptic tools attached with a camera repair the abdominal wall.Laparoscopic surgery is less invasive although you'll also need to be under general anesthesia. Recovery time is much shorter than with open surgery.

, After surgery, take pain medication and gradually return to your normal activity level within 3 or 4 days. You might feel sore or have nausea (from the anesthesia) which will wear off after a day or two. You should avoid strenuous activity like lifting until your doctor approves.Ask your physician when you can resume activities like sex, driving and exercising.

, If your hernia is near the groin, determine whether it's located at the inner or outer part of your groin. If it looks like the hernia is at the inner groin (an inguinal hernia), part of the intestines or bladder is forcing through the abdominal wall (or inguinal canal). If it looks like the hernia is at the outer groin, part of the intestines is forcing out into the femoral canal (a femoral hernia).Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia and they usually occur in older men. Femoral hernias are more common in pregnant or obese women. If you have a femoral hernia, seek medical attention immediately as these are more commonly associated with femoral artery or femoral nerve injury since the canal is much smaller and tighter than other types of hernias.

, Umbilical hernias are a noticeable bulge at the belly button or navel. These happen when part of the small intestine pushes through the abdominal wall into the navel area. Umbilical hernias are more common in newborn babies which are usually surgically treated by pediatric surgeons.Umbilical hernias also happen in obese women or women who have had multiple pregnancies.

, Look for a bulge near your stomach and consider if you have acid reflux disease. These are signs of a hiatal hernia. The bulge is actually your stomach pushing through an opening in your diaphragm where your esophagus enters.Other signs of hiatal hernia: heart burn, feeling of food stuck in your throat, feeling full quickly, and, rarely, chest pain, which can be confused with heart attack.
Hiatal hernias are more common in women, overweight people, and people over 50 years of age., You might get a hernia following abdominal surgery, especially if you've been inactive. With an incisional hernia, the intestine emerges through a weakened part of the abdomen where you once had surgery.Incisional hernias are more common in the elderly or obese.

, You can reduce your risk for hernias by being a healthy weight and staying in shape. Work with a personal trainer or coach who can teach you how to properly exercise your abdominal muscles. You should try to strengthen these muscles to reduce your chances of getting a hernia. Studies have shown that stretching programs, like yoga may treat inguinal hernias.Learn how to lift heavy objects or do weight training before you lift heavy things. This can prevent damage to your abdominal muscles. If lifting, you may want to get help.

, Hernias can't be prevented, but you can reduce your risk of developing one. This mainly involves reducing pressure on weakened abdominal walls. Avoid straining or excessive pressure when you toilet. To do this, eat fiber and drink plenty of water. These can loosen your stools, preventing constipation or diarrhea, conditions that strain already weak abdominal muscles.


If you have a cold or allergies, don't be afraid to sneeze or cough. Suppressing these may actually lead to an inguinal hernia.Talk with your doctor if you're sneezing or coughing a lot.

Know that traumatic neuromata may be a result of surgery or other physical injury.",How to Recognize the Symptoms of Neuromata," The most common symptom of a patient with acoustic neuroma is progressive, one-sided hearing loss. Most of the time you will not be able to hear sharp sounds; however, dull sounds will remain intact. The actual cause of this ailment is unknown but three theories may likely explain how hearing loss in acoustic neuroma occurs:Compression on the vestibulocochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve is for maintenance of balance and is the one in which the acoustic neuroma develops whereas the cochlear or hearing nerve is for hearing. The compression of the acoustic neuroma onto the hearing nerve is theorized to cause slowly progressive hearing loss.Blockage of the internal auditory artery. Blockade of the internal auditory artery (which supplies the inner ear where the eighth cranial nerve is located), would cause damage to the inner ear structures including the eighth nerve and may cause hearing loss.

Biochemical changes in the fluids of the inner ear. This explanation remains a theory. Research has yet to show how biochemical changes in the inner ear fluids would lead to hearing loss.;
, Tinnitus, or a ringing in the affected ear, may accompany hearing loss. Tinnitus is usually high-pitched in character and is caused by the same mechanism that causes hearing loss in cases of acoustic neuroma.Whenever you sit in a peaceful place or while trying to sleep, it may appear as an irritating ringing or buzzing sound. Everyone experiences this, but most do not suffer tinnitus as consistently as those with acoustic neuroma.

, Due to acoustic neuroma, you may experience frequent headaches unrelated to any other ""normal"" cause, like dehydration or stress. This occurs as a consequence of compressing and irritating the neural, blood vessel, and dural components of the inner ear canal and/or the petrous bony dura.


Headaches may occur over the frontal area or the back of the head (the occipital lobe), and may occur long before hearing loss is present.
Headaches occur in 20% of those with 1 centimeter (0.4 in)-to-3 centimeter (1.2 in)-size tumors and in 43% of those with >3 centimeter (1.2 in)-size tumors., Vertigo is the feeling that the world is moving around you. You may often feel dizzy and may experience a fall occasionally because it seems as if the world is spinning. This is due to the acoustic neuroma interfering with the circulation of fluid in the internal ear canals and interruption of the transmission of balance impulses to the brain.


The internal ear has a system of canals and sacs with sensory cells in them. Circulation of fluid in this system helps the body to maintain balance.
Vertigo occurs in 27% of cases of acoustic neuroma. , Dizziness occurs in 48% of acoustic neuroma cases.This sometimes leads to a difficulty in maintaining balance, too. It is caused by compression or destruction of the vestibular nerve or compression on the lateral side of the cerebellum or cerebral peduncles (when the acoustic neuroma tumor is so big it compresses brain areas beyond the inner ear area).


The function of balance is a function of the cerebellum and the vestibular nerve. If the cerebellum is affected, an intentional tremor and gait ataxia can occur.An intentional tremor is a slow tremor of the hands and feet that occurs at the end of an intentional movement such as a tremor upon touching one’s nose.
Gait ataxia is an abnormal an uncoordinated movement of muscles on walking., This symptom occurs if the facial (or VII) cranial nerve is compressed by the enlarging acoustic neuroma tumor. This occurs where the facial nerve enters the internal ear canal. However, facial numbness only occurs in 10% of cases of acoustic neuroma.


Further compression of the trigeminal nerve would lead to the paralysis (partial or complete) of the muscle for chewing and eating (mastication). This symptom occurs in 33% to 71% of cases of acoustic neuroma that experience initial facial paralysis., This is a build up of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling. This is a late event that occurs when the enlarging acoustic neuroma has compressed and blocked the fourth ventricle of the brain.


Accompanying hydrocephalus are headaches, nausea and vomiting, and changes in the mental status of the patient. It is a very serious condition that requires immediate treatment.

, An acoustic neuroma (or vestibular Schwamoma or vestibular neuroma) is a noncancerous or benign tumor which originates from the vestibular (balance) nerves found in the internal auditory canal, behind the inner ear. Because of its location, it often leads to hearing and balance problems. Acoustic neuromata are rare affecting approximately between 1 in 75,000 and 1 in 100,000 individuals per year.This kind of tumor grows at approximately 1 mm to 3 mm per year till they fill up the whole internal auditory canal. These tumors can grow beyond 20 mm and may compress the brain stem if untreated, causing problems in the cerebellum, and blocking the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid through the spaces within the brain and spinal cord. Such tumor growth can span 20 years from the time the tumor begins to grow.

, 95% of cases occur sporadically, meaning there is no known cause. The last 5% are believed to be due in part to neurofibromatosis II disease.If you believe you are suffering from this type of neuroma, talk to your doctor for more information regarding possible causes and treatment.


That being said, one study found that mobile cellphone use “of at least 10 years’ duration” led to an increased risk of developing acoustic neuroma. This is believed to be due to increased radiofrequency exposure.

, One of the main symptoms of Morton’s neuroma are episodes of recurring pain occurring at two attacks per week and then none for quite a long time (about a year).These recurring pains in your toes are due to the stimulation of the affected nerve, usually upon weight-bearing.


Pain spreads from the ball to the digits or toes of the foot. Pain attacks can last from minutes to months, with long periods of time in between without symptoms. During these episodes, the area of the neuroma is painful to touch. The affected areas will likely be the web between the second and third toes, or between the third and fourth toes. Pain is recurrent and worsened by prolonged walking, running, squatting, standing fully on one’s toes, and wearing tight, high-heeled shoes. If the neuroma is of sufficient size, the pain will present during normal walking, too., With Morton's neuromata, there is often tingling, burning, or a sensation of numbness on the affected area, sometimes accompanied by an aching or shooting type of pain stemming from the area as well.


The shooting-type of pain, the tingling, burning, or numbness sensations are all symptoms of the affected nerve.
Tingling-and-burning sensations are akin to the “pins-and-needles” sensation at the origin of the neuroma.

, With this type of neuroma, there is often the sensation that there is something inside the ball of the foot. You'll find yourself removing your shoe and massing the affected foot, wondering how and why the pain started. This, too, is a sensation that can come and go, disappearing for long periods of time

, Morton’s neuroma, which occurs at the base of the third and fourth toes, is also called intermetatarsal or interdigital neuroma.This name describes its location at the ball of the foot between the metatarsal bones (the bones from the toes to the midfoot area).


Approximately five females to one male have Morton’s neuroma, and usually among patients of ages 15 years to 50 years old., Knowing the causes of Morton’s neuroma will help you know if you have it and if you should take further action. In short, Morton’s neuroma develops because of chronic nerve compression, trauma (accidental injury to the nerve), stress, and irritation, especially with excessive or too much toe dorsiflexion (raising the toes upwards), wearing tightly fitting, high-heeled shoes, and excessive or too much plantar flexion (putting the foot downwards.


The usual nerve affected is the interdigital nerve. In one study, Morton’s neuroma is due to the disruption or destruction of nerves and arteries that arise from the overgrowth of connective tissue (or scarring) over the area of injury.Another theory of causation of Morton’s neuroma is disruption of nerves due to a blockade or scarring of arteries supplying these nerves leading to ischemia or loss of oxygen to these nerves., This kind of tumor may result in the increased production of the sympathomimetic hormones. These hormones are responsible for an increase in blood pressure.However, because high blood pressure is so common, consult your doctor prior to forming any conclusions.


Ganglioneuroma may produce certain chemicals and hormones, causing a variety of different symptoms, especially compared to other types of neuromata.

, A ganglioneuroma may sometimes result in the increased production of male hormones. This will result in the unexplained increase of hair all over the body.


If you experience this symptom, contact your doctor immediately. Whether it's a ganglioneuroma or not, hirsutism and general increased hair growth are conditions that requires medical treatment.

, Sometime ganglioneuroma may result in hormones which increase the blood supply to the skin. This will in turn lead to the increased sweating in the body. Whether you are prone to excessive sweating or not, you may experience even more excessive sweating if you're suffering from a ganglioneuroma.

, This tumor may be present in the part of the chest which may put pressure on the windpipe. This may cause difficulty in breathing, making you feel like you're getting choked.

Chest pain. Sometime this tumor may press on the some other organ in the chest area like covering of the lungs. This will irritate the nerve passing through those parts. It will result in pain.

, This tumor may press an important organ in the abdomen. It may also irritate the sensory nerves in the area. This will result in a feeling of pain in the abdomen.

Bloating. Bloating is the feeling of fullness in the stomach or the feeling that your stomach is full of gas. This is due to the hyper-secretion of acid in the stomach, which may be due to it being stimulated by the neuroma.

, Take note of pain and feeling of loss of strength in your arms and legs. This is due to the compression of the spinal cord by the tumor, where the tumor may press on the spinal cord and damage a part of it.

Spine deformity. Sometime the spine damage due the pressure exerted by the tumor on the spine may be so great that it results in the deformation of the spine.

, This is the kind of tumor of the nerves present outside the brain and the spinal cord, affecting the peripheral nervous system. These are very rare hormone-releasing tumors which may occur in any part of the body.Symptoms of ganglioneuroma depend upon the part of body where these tumors are located and what hormones are released. Ganglioneuroma differ from tumor to tumor. They can arise in a variety of locations, affect a variety of hormones, or not affect your hormones at all.

, If you touch the area and apply pressure, you'll likely feel a very sharp pain springing from where the neuroma originates. Sometime due to hyperactivity of the nerve cells there may be pain even without any pressure.


After trauma to the nerve it grows to fill gap but sometime it will grow in disorderly way. It may create a growth of nerve which will fire in every direction resulting in intense pain.

, Sometimes you may experience pain so severe that that symptom itself has symptoms. It seems ceaseless and makes you physically and emotional exhausted. It's easy to get stressed out, which exacerbates the pain to boot.


Though the neuroma itself won't go away, in this case it is wise to take up a more stress-free routine. Consider implementing meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises into your daily routine. And, as always, consult your doctor. Chronic pain and fatigue deserves immediate treatment.

, With this type of neuroma, there is an area of raised sensitivity which may result in pain. It develops due to the physical injury to a nerve. The most common cause of this neuroma is surgery, but it may also be caused by cuts and damage done to the nerve by needles.

, By all means, allow them to help you where possible, but also avoid going too near to them to prevent spreading possible infections.

, There is no need to attend work or school; your state of health will make it hard to pay attention, and working with the ailment of a fever may only add stress to yourself and your body.

, Sleeping helps you and your immune system to recover faster from illness, as less energy is being spent on waking activities, meaning more energy may be contributed to fighting illness.

, Call a doctor or friend if the temperature keeps getting higher and inform them of any other difficulties you may have, e.g. headaches, body pains or loss of appetite.

, It is recommended you snack on saltines to help irritation go down.

, Use this often and dampening it with cold or cool water. Apply to the forehead and leave it until it starts to dry up. This helps alleviate any 'heaty' or uncomfortable warmth on the body by lessening blood flow (via vasoconstriction of blood vessels), and therefore aid in temperature maintenance.

, Sudden aches may occur in your body or head. Keep some medicine to help relive the pain. Panadol for example, is effective in lessening pain brought on by body aches.

, If you have or occur these other symptoms talk to your doctor and inform him/her of all the details: nausea, headaches, dizziness, vomiting, violent shaking of body or hands, slurred speech, blurry vision, unusual staggering while walking, and/or sudden sleep.Talk to your doctor if you have encountered these symptoms.

Find out if you have low testosterone levels.,
Speak to your doctor about hormone therapy.,
Lose weight.,
Perform high intensity exercise.,
Take zinc.,
Maintain adequate vitamin D levels.,
Reduce Stress.,
Make sure you get adequate sleep.,
Review your medications.",How to Raise Hormone Levels1," If you are experiencing decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, depression, or poor concentration/memory, talk to your doctor. These symptoms may be due to low testosterone levels. Your doctor can confirm low testosterone levels using a blood test.It is best to go for this test in the morning because this will provide the most accurate result.;
, The condition of having low testosterone levels is known as hypogonadism. If you are diagnosed with hypogonadism, your doctor may recommend replacement therapy. This involves taking a synthetic form of testosterone to meet your testosterone needs.Never try to take testosterone products yourself, as your hormone levels will need to be strictly monitored during treatment. Having too much testosterone can be just as harmful as having too little.
If hormone replacement therapy isn't for you, you can try some natural methods of boosting your testosterone levels.

, Testosterone is a steroid hormone, which means it is fat-soluble. If you are overweight, most of your testosterone will be stored in the fat. This portion will not participate in hormone activities. That means, although you have normal amount of total testosterone, you are not benefiting from all of it. You can boost your testosterone levels naturally, by losing a bit of weight.Processed sugar is primary culprits for obesity. Avoid soda, processed foods, and sweets.
Refined carbohydrates include bagels, waffles, crackers, pretzels, cookies, cakes, and muffins. Highly processed foods that are difficult for your body to digest and have little nutritional value include ketchup, chips, cereal, and ""easy"" to make foods. Limit your intake of these foods and switch to whole grains and other more natural options.
Eat plenty of vegetables. They slow down sugar absorption from the intestine and scavenge bad fats from the diet. Try to eat five servings of veggies per day.

, When it comes to boosting your testosterone levels, intense exercise for a short period is more beneficial than moderate exercise for prolonged periods. This high-intensity activity works to increase the function of testosterone receptors in the body. This helps to produce desired levels of testosterone in your body, without giving extra work to your testosterone producing cells.Warm up for about three minutes. Then exercise as intense and as fast as you can for 30 seconds. Swimming, cycling, sprinting or running on a treadmill are good examples. Then gradually slow down over 90 seconds.
Repeat the exercise and recovery cycle seven or eight times. The total duration of exercise should be 20 minutes.

, Zinc is a mineral that is essential for sperm production and testosterone synthesis. It increases libido and helps to maintain normal reproductive function. Meat, fish, raw milk, raw cheese, beans, and yogurt are good natural sources of zinc. You may also consider taking a zinc supplement., Vitamin D helps to maintain semen quality and sperm count. It also increases testosterone level, which may boost libido. Vitamin D is synthesized from cholesterol in the skin under the influence of UV light.


Sun exposure is the best way to increase vitamin D levels. Spend 20 to 30 minutes under the sun exposing some body parts like arms, legs, back etc.
Small fish and fish oil are also good sources of vitamin D.
Mushrooms are also an excellent source of vitamin D.

, When you are under a lot of stress, your body produces excess amounts of cortisol, a hormone to cope with that stress. Cortisol prepares your body for an emergency, triggering your survival instinct and essentially neutralizing the effects of testosterone. To allow testosterone to exert its effects, you need to keep stress-levels low.Get a massage.
Attend a yoga class.

Try meditation.

Perform a progressive muscle relaxation.

, Not getting enough sleep can reduce testosterone levels in men, so it is important to get plenty of sleep if you are trying to boost these levels.Aim for eight hours of sleep every night. To get this amount, you might need to go to bed a bit earlier than you have been, or sleep a little later if that is possible for you., Some medications counteract or compete with testosterone and reduce its activity. Speak to your doctor about trying different medications or dosages.Examples are opioid drugs (Fentanyl, MS Contin, and Oxycontin), corticosteroids (prednisolone), and anabolic steroids (nandrolone).
Always speak to you doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen. Do not experiment with dosages on your own.

Wear a hat.,
Use sunscreen.,
Avoid going out when the sun is most intense.,
Be careful around reflective surfaces.,
Wear a protective hairstyle.,
Look up UV predictions.",How to Protect Your Hair and Scalp from the Sun1," Even on cloudy days, ultraviolet (UV) light can still cause sunburns and damage skin. The easiest way to protect your head is to cover it with a cap of some sort. If possible, wear a wide-brimmed hat that protects your neck, as well.A hat is less effective than sunscreen (roughly equivalent to SPF 5), but it protects your scalp and other areas where sunscreen is difficult to apply.If you do not have hats available, walk in such a way that minimizes your exposure to the sun. For instance, walk on the shady side of the street instead of the sunny side, or choose a path that keeps you beneath the shade provided by trees.;
, If your hair is thinning, if you have your hair in braids, or if your hair is arranged in such a way that the scalp is exposed, apply sunscreen to your head. Take special care to apply it to areas where a large percentage of your scalp is exposed to the sun. Use a sunscreen that offers both UVA and UVB protection with at least SPF 30 if you’re spending an extended amount of time outdoors (at the beach or out on a bike ride, for instance) or at least SPF 15 if you’re just out on an average outing.Ensure your sunscreen is not oily. Your scalp can more easily absorb a lightweight, moisturizing formula than an oily one. Plus, an oily sunscreen will make your scalp feel greasy. Check for ingredients like zinc or titanium oxide that could make your sunscreen greasier.Apply the sunscreen in a thin, even layer across your scalp, just as you would when applying it to any other part of your body.
Reapply sun lotion every two hours.

, The midday (10 AM to 4 PM) sun is the worst for your skin. Try to avoid going out during these times. If you do, cover your hair and head with a hat, or seek shade beneath a stand of trees to maximize hair and scalp protection., Water, snow, and sand all reflect UV light back at you. If you visit a beach or snowscape during the late morning or afternoon, wearing a hat and high-SPF sunscreen is especially important., If you have long hair but no hat, consider wearing a ponytail, bun, or updo. Unlike hairstyles with a part, these will cover your scalp completely, preventing sunburn.


Since this leaves your hair unprotected, it's best to rely on a hat most of the. People with afro-textured hair, fine hair, or light-colored hair should be especially cautious, since their hair is more easily damaged by sun., Many weather reports tell you the day's UV index, at least during the summer. You can also find these predictions here for some countries, including the US, Australia, and Canada.Here's how to interpret the international WHO UV Index so you know how cautious you need to be:1 or 2: Low risk. No protection required.
3 to 5: Moderate risk. Wear a shirt, sunscreen, and hat. Seek shade around noon.
6 to 7: High risk. Wear a shirt, sunscreen, and hat. Reduce time in sun from 10am to 4pm.
8 to 10: Very high risk. Avoid sun from 10am to 4pm as much as possible.
11+: Extreme risk. Stay indoors between 10am and 4pm if possible.

Find out if you have low estrogen.,
Speak to your doctor about hormone therapy.,
Go easy with exercise.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Enjoy phytoestrogen-rich foods.,
Quit smoking.,
Drink coffee.",How to Raise Hormone Levels2," Low estrogen is commonly caused by the onset of menopause, however several other behavioral or physical problems can be the cause. These include: decreased function of the ovaries, eating disorders and/or excessive exercise that result in low body fat, childbirth and breastfeeding, and certain fertility drugs. Symptoms of estrogen deficiency include hot flashes (feelings of intense heat and sweating with rapid heartbeat), menstrual irregularity and amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), dry vagina, loss of sex drive, low mood, reduced bone density (which can cause fractures with only minor trauma). Visit your doctor if you are experiencing these symptoms.Normal estrogen levels in women prior to menopause range between 50 pg/mL to 400 pg/mL.
As estrogen levels fluctuate greatly in a normal person, several other tests are necessary to detect an actual problem. These include testing the levels of other hormones such as progesterone, FSH, LH etc.

, If you have been diagnosed with low estrogen (particularly if menopause is the cause), your doctor may recommend hormone therapy. There are two main types of estrogen hormone therapy: systemic hormone therapy and low-dose vaginal products. There are risks and benefits to each. Discuss these with your doctor and decide if hormone therapy is right for you., Low estrogen has been linked with excessive exercise. Working out 30 minutes per day can help prevent obesity, heart disease, and other problems, but more than 30 minutes per day is not necessary. Try modifying and/or limiting your exercise regime to help raise your estrogen levels.Intense exercise burns fat in the body. As a result, estrogen cannot find a place to be stored. This explains why athletes sometimes experience irregular menstruation.
You should perform mild-to-moderate exercise to maintain a satisfactory level of estrogen in the body. Avoid excessive strenuous exercise.

, Eating a healthy diet can help to balance the estrogen in your body. Specifically, avoid refined carbohydrates and sugars, such as cereals, bagels, waffles, pretzels, and most other processed foods. Instead eat foods high in protein and fiber.Simple carbohydrates rapidly break down into glucose and other readily absorbable sugars. They increase insulin resistance and impair the proper function of natural estrogen.
Foods low in fat and high in fiber can increase your estrogen levels. Keep a sufficient amount of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet, especially those that contain a lot of fiber.

, Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring substances that mimic the effects of estrogen. Phytoestrogens in food can act almost like estrogen-replacements.Most plant products contain phytoestrogens to some extent, and some foods contain particularly high levels of phytoestrogens, these include:


Soybeans, chickpeas, bran, peas, pinto beans, lima beans, flax seeds, vegetables, legumes, and fruits. Aim for two to four servings of these foods per day.
Don’t go overboard with these foods. In excess, phytoestrogens can actually suppress the natural estrogen produced by the body, as they compete with estrogen receptors.

, The contents of cigarette smoke significantly affect the production and metabolism of estrogen in the body. Increase your estrogen production, and glean numerous other health benefits, by giving up tobacco right away.


Decide why you want to quit.
Make a plan.
Execute your plan.
Consider seeking therapy for help.

, Caffeine is a natural stimulant for many hormones, including estrogen. Try drinking two to three cups of coffee per day to boost your estrogen levels. Try to drink your coffee black, or with some milk, and avoid sugars and sweeteners."

Determine whether you have low cortisol.,
Speak to your doctor about hormone therapy.,
Reduce Stress.,
Get enough sleep.,
Try licorice supplements.,
Keep thyroid hormones within normal range.,
Follow a healthy diet.",How to Raise Hormone Levels3," Cortisol is the hormone that helps us to manage stress. This hormone level should increase in situations where you are under physical or emotional stress, such as strenuous activity, infection, or injury. Have a doctor test the amount of the hormone in your blood to reveal your level.Cortisol can also be detected in your saliva, so your doctor might want to perform a series of saliva tests at different intervals.


Symptoms of low cortisol levels are chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure leading to dizziness and fainting, hypoglycemia, increase in anxiety, severe PMS, and inability to cope with stress.

, If you are diagnosed with low cortisol (in severe cases, called ""adrenal fatigue""), your doctor may recommend cortisol hormone therapy. This involved taking prescription ""bioidentical"" cortisol. This hormone can be very beneficial for individuals suffering from adrenal fatigue, however taking bioidentical cortisol may further interfere with your body's nature cortisol production. Discuss these details with your doctor, and decide if prescription hormone therapy is right for you., Cortisol production dramatically increases during stressful situations. Repeated bursts of cortisol may cause your adrenal glands to become fatigued. A stress-free body will allow cortisol to gradually increase in your system, instead of being produced all at once in high-pressure situations.Try things like blog writing, journal writing, yoga, or meditation to reduce your stress.
Spend more time with family and friends instead of being alone.
Whenever you feel your stress-level rising, stop and take a few deep breaths.

, Cortisol production is highest during deep sleep. As a result, you need to be getting between six to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep per night to naturally maintain adequate cortisol levels.Try to go to bed at the same time every night. If your sleep cycle is regular, your adrenal glands will adapt to secrete the hormone at a particular time. Irregular sleep will make it difficult for the adrenal glands to sense when to secrete the hormone.
A quiet and peaceful environment during sleep is necessary for the adrenal glands to work efficiently, so make sure to block out any noise or light.

, Licorice contains glycyrrhizic acid, which inhibits the breakdown of circulating cortisol in the liver. As a result, consume licorice supplements may help cortisol levels to gradually increase.Licorice supplements are available in tablet or capsule form.
Take one or two tablets in the mornings, as this is when cortisol levels tend to rise.
Use caution with licorice and avoid excessive use. If taken at too high of a dosage by people with high blood pressure, licorice can increase high blood pressure. It can also cause high blood pressure in people who do not have high blood pressure if you take too much of it.

, Thyroid hormones are necessary for cortisol to exert its effect within the body. These hormones act synergistically, which means that one hormone is necessary for the other to act.Low levels of thyroid hormones can produce symptoms of low cortisol, even if the actual level of cortisol remains normal.
Visit your doctor to have your thyroid levels tested if you experience any symptoms of low cortisol. Having your TSH levels tested will indicate whether you have any thyroid abnormalities.

, Foods high in trans fat and cholesterol will abruptly raise cortisol levels. Avoid trans fats (red meat, butter, shortening) to maintain a healthy level of cortisol. Instead, eat plenty of whole grains, fruits and vegetables. In particular, citrus fruits (such as grapefruit) break down enzymes that inhibit cortisol production, so you should add grapefruit to your diet to boost cortisol production."

Adjust your shampooing schedule.,
Avoid excessive heat.,
Wash out chlorine.,
Do not dye your hair.,
Do not use shampoo containing coal tar.,
Avoid tanning beds and sunlamps.",How to Protect Your Hair and Scalp from the Sun2," Clean hair is stronger, more resistant to sun-related damage, and less likely to leave your scalp exposed.However, washing your hair more often than necessary can dry out your hair, making it weak and brittle. Daily shampooing is only necessary if you have very fine or oily hair, or if sweat has a noticeable daily effect on your scalp. Thick, dry hair may only need washing once or twice a week.Wash with warm water instead of hot.
Use a mild, sulfate-free shampoo made with natural ingredients like shea butter, argan oil, tea tree oil, and aloe vera.
Once you’re done in the shower, avoid using lotions and styling gels. This will allow your hair to retain its natural oils, keeping it strong, healthy, and less likely to suffer sun-related damage.

, Curling irons, hot blow dryers, and other heat treatments will damage the keratin sheath around your hair. This leaves it open to sunlight, inviting sun damage that leaves it bleached and brittle.Set your blow dryer to cool and minimize high-heat treatments.

, Chlorine also makes your hair more vulnerable to sun damage. It's best not to swim in a chlorinated outdoor pool around midday, especially on days with a high UV index. When you do swim, shower right after leaving the pool to rinse out the chlorine., Dying your hair – bleaching it, especially – can open up the hair follicle, making it more vulnerable to UV damage., Check your shampoo bottle for a list of ingredients. If your shampoo contains coal tar, it could make your scalp more sensitive to sunlight. Many dandruff shampoos in particular contain coal tar, but there are alternative products for that condition., Tanning beds and sunlamps can expose your scalp and hair to unnecessarily high levels of UVA and UVB rays. Do not visit tanning salons or utilize sunlamps when visiting the spa."

Protect yourself at work.",How to Prevent Tendonitis," One way to prevent tendonitis is to warm up before you exercise. Try light exercises and massage your joints and muscles before you get to the main part of your workout. Slowly build up to a higher intensity. If you jump right into the hard part, you're more likely to get tendonitis.When you're warming up, the idea is to warm up the muscles you'll be using in the exercise. Often that can just mean doing the exercise at a slower pace for five or ten minutes. For example, you could walk at a slow pace before a faster walk, jog, or run. For swimming, you could swim at a slower pace before going faster.;
, If you're always doing the same type of exercise, you're more likely to develop tendonitis. That's why it's sometimes referred to as ""tennis elbow,"" ""swimmer's shoulder,"" ""pitcher's shoulder,"" and so on. It's doing the same repetitive movement that's the problem. If you're having problems with one exercise, do another for a little while instead.For instance, if you've been playing tennis and have developed tennis elbow, try running or jogging for a while instead.
If you've been running and have developed tendonitis in your feet or knees, try something with less impact, such as swimming.
You can also modify an exercise to put less stress on certain parts of your body. For instance, if your ankles hurt while doing pushups, try doing them on your knees instead.

, That is, find out the proper way to do each exercise and use each type of equipment when you're exercising. Use good form when you exercise. If you are exercising improperly, you're more likely to develop injuries like tendonitis.If you're at the gym and you're unsure how to use a piece of equipment, ask someone who works there.
If you're wanting to learn an exercise at home, use high quality training websites and videos to figure out how to do an exercise properly.

, Once you're done working out, don't just stop the exercise. It's time to cool down.Cooling down is basically the same as warming up. That is, you want to use the same muscles you've been using, just lowering the intensity of the exercise.If you've been running, walk for five to ten minutes. If you've been swimming at a high intensity, slow down for the last few laps.
Stretching all of your major muscles and taking all of your major joints through the full range of motion at the end of your workout will help to prevent tendonitis.

, If you develop a pain while exercising, you should stop that exercise for a while. It's particularly important to stop the exercise if the pain comes on suddenly, but you should also take a break from the exercise if the pain comes on gradually.If you do develop pain, see a doctor.

, After cooling down, take time to stretch out your muscles before finishing up your workout. Stretching increases your flexibility and range of motion, and you do it at the end because your muscles are warmed up enough that you aren't as likely to be injured in the process. You can also do stretching after the warm-up if you prefer., Lay on your back with your body flat. Pull one knee up towards you, wrapping your hands around the back of your leg as it comes up. Pull it straight up in the air so that it's perpendicular to your body. Return it to the floor. Do five reps, and then switch to the other side.You can also increase flexibility by adding reps at different angles. Try turning your thigh inward for five reps and then outward for five reps.

, Roll over on your stomach. With your toes pointed, lift your body off the ground by pushing your arms out until they are completely straight, which is how it differs from a pushup. Your thighs should be off the ground, too, and your back should be curved backwards. Tilt your chin up, and hold this position for five to ten seconds before releasing., Face a wall, starting a little less than a foot away. Put your hands on the wall. Move one leg backwards, and bend the knee of the other leg. The heel of the back leg should stay on the ground. Hold for a few seconds, and then change legs., Begin with your feet at shoulder-width. Step one foot forward about a foot. Interlock your fingers, and place your hands under your ribs. At the same time, try to pull your shoulders down. Lower your whole body by bending your knees. Go down as you count to three and lift back up as you count to three. Try five reps on each side., Lift one arm above your head with the elbow bent. Use the other arm to grab the elbow and gently pull it in that direction. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, and switch arms. Don't bend the arm too far., Yoga is a great way to increase your overall mobility, as it is basically just an intense form of stretching and moving.It will help increase your flexibility, too, decreasing your chances of injury, as tendonitis often results from having tight tissues.To prevent yoga injuries make sure you start your practice under the guidance of a qualified yoga instructor.
Consider joining a local yoga class. You can find them through your parks and recreation department or at local yoga studios.

, It's not good to jump into the highest level of a sport without building up your body first. Any time you want to start a new sport or intense exercise, it's best to start small and build up slowly over time.So you've decided you want to run a marathon. That's great. However, what you shouldn't do is try to run 10 miles tomorrow when you've been sitting on the couch for months. Start by working the muscles you need to run before you even starting running, then slowly increase how much you run day by day.
The same holds true for any sport. Work to build the muscles you need before you start the sport.

, Strength training should be an integral part of your week. Strengthening your muscles can help reduce the strain on your tendons. Work specifically on the muscles you use in your exercises and at your work.To build muscle, you can do things like use weights, use resistance machines, or do body weight exercises like lunges, squats, and push-ups.
When playing a particular sport, focus on exercises that will develop the muscles you need to use for that sport.

, You can develop tendonitis at work as easily as you can at the gym, particularly if you're doing the same thing over and over again. If you've been having pain, adjust your work space to better meet your needs. You may need to adjust the height of your chair or keyboard, for instance.A professional can help with this task. You can hire someone to do an ergonomic assessment of your work space to help you figure out what needs to be adjusted.

Enable the Mouse Keys feature.",How to Prevent Repetitive Motion Injury1," This is the easiest way to prevent repetitive motion injuries. Repetitive motion injuries (RMIs) occur when a muscle or connective tissue is used too frequently to repair itself. The more you take a break from the repetitive motion, the more time you give yourself to heal.


""Microbreaks"" should be taken for 30 to 60 seconds for every 10 minutes of computer use. Rest your eyes, neck, hands, and back.;
, Although we might see people typing in a variety of ways, a lot of ""natural"" positions can cause injury, because typing isn't a natural motion to begin with. A neutral position, also called touch typing, is the best typing method for preventing most office related RMIs.Keep your wrists elevated and off the surface of the desk or keyboard.
The keyboard should lay flat on the table. Don’t angle it up.The tips of your fingers should be the only part of your hand touching the keyboard.

, Sitting up straight makes it easier to maintain a neutral typing position. It also cuts down on problems with the neck, lower back, and shoulders.Roll your shoulders back.
Allow for a slight arch in your lower back.
Keep your elbows and knees bent at near-right angles to help maintain the position.

, If you are using a desktop, the proper placement of your monitor can help prevent eye strain and injuries to the neck and back. Your monitor should be between 20 and 40 inches (50 and 100 cm) from your eye to the screen and positioned directly in front of you.If your monitor is tilted back too far, it can distort objects on the screen and also cause glare from overhead lights, which can lead to eye strain. Do not tilt the screen more that 10 to 20 degrees.Your monitor should not be positioned to high up — the top of the monitor should be at or just below eye level., Your mouse or pointer should be next to the keyboard, not raised above it or placed so far back you have to reach to use it. This places stress on your arm and shoulder. Invest in a mouse wrist rest to support your wrist, and make sure your mouse is positioned so that you can maintain a straight, neutral wrist posture.Replace your mouse with a trackball. Use of a mouse can fatigue your wrist. Consider using a trackball device, which is better designed to fit the hand and doesn't require you to bend the wrist or grip., Though laptops are excellent for portability, they are not very ergonomically practical. Keyboards are more compact and screens are smaller and fixed, offering fewer options for placement (ideally, your monitor and keyboard should be on different levels) which can affect your posture.


To combat these shortcomings, consider a laptop docking station to use at your desk at home or at work, which allows you to plug your laptop into a station with a keyboard, monitor, and mouse. Or, you can purchase a separate full-sized keyboard and mouse and attach them to your laptop, using the laptop as a monitor. The keyboard should be at roughly the same height as your elbows., Sticky Keys are a Windows accessibility feature that allows a user to activate modifier keys instead of pressing multiple keys at once. This can help to ease the strain of repeated motions.For example, instead of pressing CTRL + C to copy text, the Sticky Key feature would allow the user to press CRTL, which would remain engaged, then press C.
The Sticky Keys feature can be turned on by pressing the SHIFT key five times in a row. This will bring up a dialog box that asks if the user wants to turn Sticky Keys on.

, One of the most common computer related RMI's occurs when the tendons on the index and middle fingers become strained due to over-clicking the mouse.


Setting the mouse speed to a slower speed means that not as much is demanded from the small muscles and tendons when clicking, reducing the strain.
Adjust the mouse speed in Windows by going to Control Panel-->Hardware and Sound-->Mouse-->Mouse Properties-->Pointer Options-->Mouse Speed. Then adjust the mouse speed to a slower setting.
Adjust the mouse speed on a Mac by going to System Preferences-->Mouse-->Point and Click. Then adjust the mouse speed to a slower setting.

, Certain keyboard shortcuts can help minimize computer related RMI, particularly if the RMI is related to using the mouse. There are dozens of different keyboard shortcuts. You can look at a list for Windows here, and one for Mac here., The Mouse Keys feature allows you to use the directional pad on your keyboard as you would a mouse. Since a lot of computer related RSIs come from the clicking of the mouse, using the Mouse Keys feature can help.Activate Mouse Keys in Windows by going to Control Panel-->Ease of Access Center-->Make the Mouse Easier to Use-->Enable Mouse Keys.Activate Mouse Keys in Mac by going to System Preferences-->Accessibility-->Mouse-->Enable Mouse Keys."

, If there is a chance that you may come into contact with someone who has SARS, or their body fluids or feces, wear disposable gloves. This can help ensure that you don’t accidentally infect yourself.You can use surgical-type gloves to prevent contamination.Make sure to check for any rips or punctures before you put on the gloves.Dispose of the gloves after each use in a lined wastebasket. Never wash or reuse gloves.You can get disposable gloves at many pharmacies and most medical supply stores.

, Typically, a person with SARS will be hospitalized and isolated, with no visitors allowed except for the few hospital staff caring for them. If you are in the same room as a person with SARS, wear a surgical mask. This can help minimize your risk of inhaling the virus.There is some evidence that in addition to wearing a surgical mask, wearing glasses may also a certain amount of protection against SARS.You may want to purchase an N95 particulate respirator as your surgical mask. Although there is varying information on the type of surgical mask with which you can protect yourself from respiratory viruses, the N95 is specifically designed to protect against large droplets and smaller respiratory particles.Put the mask in front of your mouth and nose. Secure the mask to your face with the pointer finger and thumb of your dominant hand. Push the mask on to your face until you are sure there is no space between your face and the mask.
Pull the garter than ensures your mask will stay on your face. This should be found on the top of the mask. Stretch the garter over your head and secure it on the back of your head.
You can purchase surgical masks at many pharmacies and most medical supply stores.

, It’s vital to wash any personal items shared with SARS patients. From utensils to bedding and clothing, making sure these items are properly washed can help minimize the risk of contracting the disease.You should not share clothing, towels, or bedding with a SARS patient. However, wash any laundry in a washing machine with warm or hot water and detergent. You can also consider adding some bleach to the load.Make sure to wear gloves when handling any soiled garments.You should not share eating utensils with an infected person, but you also don’t need to separate utensils for use by the patient. You can wash any dishes and eating utensils the infected person has used in a dishwasher or by hand with soap and hot water., It may help to separate infected waste into a separate bag or container from your wastebasket. You can then close the bag with the infected waste and place it in your regular wastebasket.This measure can help ensure that animals, small children, or other people don’t accidentally come in contact with infected waste., The SARS virus spreads easily in places such as bathrooms or on kitchen surfaces. Cleaning and disinfecting these spaces frequently may help prevent spreading the virus.Any surface touched by an infected person—such as the toilet or bathroom sink—should be cleaned and disinfected as often as possible, even after each use if possible.You can use anti-septic or anti-bacterial cleansers or a bleach mixture to disinfect surfaces.Make sure to wear gloves when you clean and throw them away after use., If a person in your home is infected with SARS, they will require isolation for at least 10 days. During this period, limit the number of people in your home as much as possible. This can minimize the risk of any family getting the virus or transmitting to the outside world.Patients should only leave the home for routine medical treatment.You may also want to separate the person from family members as much as possible.You can ask friends or family members to host for any person who has no symptoms of SARS if possible., One of most effective ways to help prevent SARS is to avoid travel to any locality, state, or country that has reported an outbreak. If you have travel plans to any of these areas, contact your respective travel company and ask them if they have contingency plans for travel to these areas or if they will let you rebook to someplace else.


The United States Department of State, the Centers for Disease Control, and the World Health Organization will alert the public about any outbreaks, where they are, and if you should avoid travel to these areas. If you are traveling, check any of these websites or contact your travel agent to inquire about travel restrictions.
If you are traveling to remote areas, you can take precautionary steps at home, such as buying a surgical mask or hand sanitizer, to help minimize your risk in areas where hygiene standards may not be high.

, SARS is highly contagious and spreads most easily in places where crowds congregate such as public transportation. Avoiding crowded spaces can help minimize your risk of contracting the virus.SARS is spread through close contact with an infected person. If someone with SARS sneezes or coughs, they could spread the disease through the transmission of their infected respiratory droplets.
Make sure to wash or sanitize your hands after touching anything in crowded spaces, such as handles in public transportation, doorknobs, telephones, or elevator buttons. You cannot sanitize yourself against everything, but it is also typically good to be exposed to germs in general.
You might want to consider wearing a surgical mask or N95 mask in crowded spaces or large urban areas.

, Just as you would in your home, make sure to practice good hygiene when you are out in public. Washing your hands and covering your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing can go far in minimize your risk of getting SARS or even infecting others., In some cases, it might be difficult to find a place to wash your hands after coming in contact with people who may have SARS or surfaces that many people have touched. Carrying hand sanitizer with you can help ensure that you reduce the risk of contaminating yourself after touching something.Make sure the hand sanitizer is at least 60% alcohol., If you have been exposed to SARS or were in area where there is a SARS outbreak and begin to experience symptoms of the virus, seek medical help immediately. You may require being isolated, but this can also help ensure your safety and health as well as that of others.


The symptoms of SARS are: systemic illness marked by the onset of fever higher than 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F); head and body aches; dry cough; and shortness of breath.Be aware that in spite of concerted international efforts, there is still no effective cure for SARS. Antibiotics won’t work against SARS because it is a virus, and scientists and doctors haven’t demonstrated any benefit, either.When someone is treated for SARS, doctors try to stop the virus from replicating in the body and administer medicine to help do this. They also focus a lot on caring for a person's symptoms.
Very young and very old people are more likely to die from SARS, because their immune systems are not as robust as others'.

Exercise can increase the uptake of lymphatic fluid,preventing buildups which can lead to painful swelling. Talk to your doctor - s/he will be able to inform you how quickly to proceed with new exercise after a mastectomy.


If you are considered ""at-risk"" for lymphedema, or are already showing signs of lymphedema, your doctor may recommend Lymphedema Remedial Exercise - repetitive motions in the affected arm (often performed while wearing special compression bandages) which can help ""pump"" lymphatic fluid away from the swollen area.;
, Avoid abrupt increase in physical work on the arm on the side where the surgery was done. If your previous exercise regimens included arm weights, don't immediately resume performing exercises with the arm on the same side as your mastectomy. Ask a doctor how long you should wait before resuming this activity. Though you should eventually rebuild strength in this arm, it is important, after a mastectomy, to approach strength exercise in the affected area gradually.

, Stretching exercises are useful after a mastectomy (as they are after many other surgeries) to prevent scarring and minimize joint contracture.More importantly, since good lymphatic function requires full range of motion in the affected area,stretching exercises are important for maintaining healthy lymph nodes and preventing fluid buildup. Talk to your doctor - generally, you can begin stretching about a week after the surgery or radiation therapy.


Stretching exercise should be part of a long-term effort to maintain overall fitness after your mastectomy. Be prepared to continue exercises for up to 18 months to maintain your body’s range of motion.

, As is the case with many, many other medical disorders, physically fit people recover more easily from lymphedema and are less likely to become afflicted with it in the first place. Scientists have shown a definite link between people who are obese and an increased likelihood of lymph node swelling. If you are overweight or obese, talk to your doctor about your options with regards to special diet programs designed to reduce your weight after you have a mastectomy.


In serious cases, you may want to talk to your doctor about surgical procedures such as liposuction or stomach stapling to reduce your weight. Besides simply increasing your chance of lymphedema, obesity can dramatically reduce the length and quality of your life.

, Unfortunately, there is no definitive ""cure"" for lymphedema.Treatment efforts are designed to reduce swelling and pain, not necessarily to fix the condition. As such, recovery from lymphedema following a mastectomy can be a long, arduous process. Be in frequent contact with your doctor as you fight with lymphedema - s/he will be your best resource for exercises and preventative measures you can perform to improve your condition.


If, at any time, your lymphedema appears to worsen or becomes irritated and/or inflamed, contact your doctor immediately - this can be a sign of a serious blockage or infection.

, Avoid wearing or carrying anything that compresses or squeezes your affected arm and/or hand. Tight sleeves or bracelets can constrict circulation in your arm, contributing to fluid build up which can lead to lymph node swelling.


Forcing the affected arm or shoulder to bear excessive weight can also contribute to lymphedema. Be sure to carry a light bag or purse and avoid handling heavy bags, (especially avoid carrying them on the shoulder or the crook of your arm) to minimize pressure and constriction on your arm.

, Blood pressure cuffs measure your blood pressure by constricting around your arm, temporarily stopping circulation. Since, to avoid lymphedema, you want to maintain healthy, free circulation in your arm, it's a bad idea to take blood pressure readings in the affected arm, which can contribute to further swelling and fluid buildup.

, Try to avoid exposing yourself to extreme temperatures, which can disrupt normal circulation to your arm. For instance, it's recommended that you avoid using hot tubs, saunas or steam baths.When you bathe, use warm or lukewarm (rather than hot or cold) water.


Also avoid burning or irritating the affected arm in any way by exposing it to extreme temperatures, which can increase fluid buildup .
Apply sunscreen at least SPF 15 during the day. This prevents sunburns, which can irritate the skin on the affected arm (and, in extreme cases of lymphedema, even cause the skin to break down).

, When sitting for a long period of time or sleeping, you may want to elevate the affected arm. Use a pillow, another similarly-sized object, or a medical arm support to prop your arm in a position that has it comfortably resting above your heart. This will naturally and safely decrease the the circulation to your arm, helping to minimize fluid buildup.


Be sure to avoid lying on the affected arm for an extended period of time. If needed, pack extra pillows behind your back or around your sides to prevent yourself from unconsciously turning over while you sleep.

Lift properly.",How to Prevent Repetitive Motion Injury2," Repetitive motion injuries (RMIs) occur because of overuse. Muscles and connective tissues don’t have enough time to repair themselves, which leads to strain and eventual injury. So avoid RMIs by allowing yourself ample recovery time.

, Even in the context of manual labor, it is important to stretch a variety of muscle groups to prevent injury. Pay special attention to the muscles that you habitually work., Work equipment that is too large, too small, or non-functional can force your body into unnatural and dangerous stress positions. Make sure that you use proper tools and safety equipment.If you have a job where you have to bend down a great deal, or a job that requires picking up heavy loads, consider a back support/lifting belt. They generally range from $25 – $100 new, and you can find them online, or at any sporting goods or orthopedic store.

, Akin to taking breaks, varying routines is an excellent way to prevent RMIs. Varying routines is difficult to do at work, but try.It’s usually cheaper to move workers around to different tasks than it is to pay for worker’s compensation.


Try to limit twisting motions, repeated wrist motions, long periods where heavy vibrating machinery is hand-held, repetitive motions with the back, and long periods of standing with little to no opportunity to sit, lean, or re-position.If you can't get rotated out of a particular assignment, see if you can get production lines to be slowed down, which helps minimize jerking motions.

, Use proper lifting techniques all the time, but particularly when you repeat the same motion numerous times a day.Basic lifting techniques include:


Keeping a straight back
Getting as far underneath a load as is possible
Keeping a wide stance
Lifting with your legs
Don’t twist, jerk, or use partial grips

"
"
Warm up and cool down.,
Stretch and massage.,
Allow adequate recovery time.",How to Prevent Repetitive Motion Injury3," Warming up and cooling down is one of the best ways to avoid injury, even more so than stretching. All athletes should practice warm-ups, especially athletes that have to make the same motions over and over again, like pitchers, sprinters, or shot-putters., If you are undergoing heavy athletic exertion, stretching after the workout might be more beneficial than stretching before a workout, although the evidence is not great either way.Make sure that you rub and massage sore muscles. Foam rollers are great tools for this.

, If you participate in athletics, practice different motions on different days. Separate high intensity cardio, calisthenics and/or lifts, and low intensity cardio into different days. Emphasize different muscle groups on consecutive days.As a part of recovery, make sure to eat a balanced diet high in protein and calcium, which aids in muscle and bone strengthening.

Cover most parts of your body.,
Apply cold cream or oil to your exposed body parts.,
Wear protective glasses.,
Apply nail polish.,
Avoid wearing white or light colored clothes.,
Never rub your face or your body forcibly to remove colors.,
Apply oil to the length of your hair thoroughly.",How to Protect Yourself from Holi Colors," Wear long sleeves and full length bottoms to protect your skin. Make sure what you wear during the festival covers the maximum of your body so that there will be less of skin exposed. Preferably, wear polo shirts or full-sleeved shirts and old trousers or denims.;
, Apply Vaseline, olive oil, coconut oil, mustard oil on your exposed body parts like your face and hands before and after playing with colors. The grease and slipperiness of the oil will not let the harsh colors settle deep into your skin.

, While playing Holi, protecting your eyes is very important so wearing even an old pair of sunglasses is a good idea as that even looks fashionable! Always, wash your eyes clean with cold water and if there is some kind of irritation after few hours of playing Holi, see an eye specialist.

, To keep your nails safe from the dangerous effects of colors, you should apply nail polish on them and also trim long nails.

, As these clothes absorb more amount of color and they might appear transparent when these clothes become wet so women especially should avoid wearing such clothes.

, Once you have enjoyed playing Holi comes the most difficult part of removing color from your skin, you should never try to vigorously remove color from your skin as It will not help you in removing colors but will only cause more damage to your skin. Don’t panic if the colors don't get off, it will come off eventually with each shower.

, Before playing Holi it's important that you thoroughly apply oil to your hair so that the colors don't stick to your hair and can be removed easily.

Wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).,
Use safe injection practices.,
Dispose of waste in the appropriate receptacles.,
Be sure the medication processing area is sanitized.,
Maintain a clean hospital environment.",How to Prevent Nosocomial Infections," PPE is specialized equipment used by staff to protect prevent the spread of infection to patients.


Hospital personnel should always clean their hands according to protocol before donning PPE.
Personnel should put on the hospital gown first, followed by a face mask, goggles, and lastly, gloves.;
, Health care professionals are commonly responsible for needle stick-related infections. The following ways will help to prevent such infections:


Never administer medications from the same syringe to multiple patients.
Do not administer medications from single-dose vials to more than one patient.
Clean the top most portion of medication vials with 70% alcohol before inserting a syringe in the vial.
Dispose of used syringes and needles in the proper container.

, Hospitals have designated receptacles for different types of waste. They are usually color coded as follows:


Black cans are for non-biodegradable waste.
Green cans are for biodegradable waste.
Yellow cans are for infectious waste.
Syringes and needles should be placed in designated puncture-proof containers.

, It is very important that the designated area for preparing medicine is clean, as contaminated medicine can be a source of infection.

, Hospital corridors, labs, and rooms should be kept as clean as possible, as these spaces are prone to harboring germs that can be easily transmitted to patients.


Make sure that areas that have been contaminated by body fluid spills are cleaned promptly.
Clean surfaces that are frequently touched, such as the work stations and medication tables, at least twice a day.

Take steps to prevent general staph infections.The best way to prevent a staph blood infection is to prevent a staph infection of any sort to begin with.,
Prevent a staph skin infection.There are a variety of ways that staph skin infections may present.,
Diminish your risk of ""toxic shock syndrome.,
See your doctor for a prompt diagnosis.If you suspect that you may have a staph infection — either by a wound or blister on your skin, a rash, a fever, or other symptoms — book an appointment with your doctor sooner rather than later.,
Take antibiotics.The mainstay of treatment for a staph infection is antibiotics.,
Complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed to you by your doctor.If your doctor has prescribed a course of oral antibiotics for you, make sure that you take all the pills as directed, until you have finished them all.,
Care for skin wounds properly while they heal.If your staph infection has led to skin lesions or a rash, it is important to cover the skin lesions while they heal with sanitary dressings, and to change the dressings regularly to maintain optimum hygiene.,
Be aware of the signs and symptoms of a potential blood infection.If you have been diagnosed with a staph infection and subsequently develop a fever and low blood pressure (or begin feeling much worse), proceed straight to the Emergency Room.,
Understand the severity of staph in your bloodstream.Once staph bacteria have gotten into your bloodstream, they may go on to infect your brain, your heart, your lungs, your bones, your muscles, and any surgically implanted devices such as pacemakers and artificial joints.,
Have any infected prosthetic devices removed immediately.If the staph infection has spread to your bloodstream and contaminated one or more prosthetic devices (such as a pacemaker, or an artificial joint, among other things), the infected prosthetic device will need to be removed.",How to Prevent Staph Blood Infections," Staph often begins on the skin, and it may infect skin wounds. If left untreated and it if continues to worsen, the infection may get deep enough to get into your bloodstream. This is why prompt recognition and treatment (as well as prevention) of staph infections is key.


Staph can also develop on tampons that are left in for too long. This can lead to what is commonly known as ""toxic shock syndrome.""
Staph may occur as food poisoning.
Staph may also infect tubing that goes from the outside environment into your body (such as catheters or other tubing). In serious cases, it may infect prosthetic devices that are inside your body.;
, They may appear as boil(s) on the skin, as an impetigo rash (a contagious rash with large blisters that may ooze and develop a crust), as a cellulitis infection (a red, hot, and swollen area of skin that is indicative of a deeper skin infection) or, in younger children, as ""staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome"" (which includes a fever, rash, and blisters that break open leaving a raw red area that resembles a burn). The best ways to prevent staph skin infections are:


Avoid sharing personal items such as razor, towels, or sheets with others. Staph can be spread from contaminated objects, as well as from person to person.
Regularly wash your clothing and bedding in hot water. This is because staph bacteria can be present if your clothing and bedding is not properly washed.
Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for 15–30 seconds to ensure that they are not contaminated with bacteria. If washing with soap and water is too much of a hassle, using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that you can carry with you throughout the day is another option.
Clean and care for any skin wounds carefully, and as directed by your doctor.
If you abuse injected drugs such as opioids, you are putting yourself at risk for a staph infection, especially if you are sharing needles. Common practices that go along with IV drug abuse — such as injecting in the same location, not cleaning the site properly, reusing needles, leakage of the drug into the skin — can all lead to infection.

,""Toxic shock syndrome is a staph infection that is generally associated with keeping a tampon in for too long. Recommendations to greatly reduce your risk of toxic shock syndrome include:


Use tampons for four to eight hours at a time, and then change them.
Alternate between tampons and sanitary napkins, if possible.
Use tampons with a lower absorbency (on days that you do not need the higher absorbency), as this creates less of a potential breeding ground for staph bacteria.

, She will be able to test for the presence of staph bacteria, and to offer you treatment as needed if the test comes back positive.

, Receiving antibiotics sooner rather than later can help your immune system to clear up the infection before it progresses to the point of developing complications, such as spreading to your bloodstream, which can be very dangerous and even fatal.


Antibiotics commonly used to treat staph infections include Cephalosporins, Nafcillin, Sulfa drugs, or Vancomycin.
Because more and more strains of staph bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment, Vancomycin is often used because it tends to be the most effective. The downside of Vancomycin, however, is that it has more side effects than other antibiotics and must be given by IV (rather than in pill form).

, It is important not to stop taking the medication once you feel better, or once symptoms subside, as there may be residual bacteria left in your system that could flare up later. It is essential that you finish all of the antibiotic pills prescribed, in exactly the way that your doctor has directed.

, Ask your doctor for advice on how to best care for your skin infection, depending upon its location and severity.


You may also need to have skin wounds drained by your doctor, in order to clear the infection out of them.
Ask your doctor if this is needed, and book an appointment to have your skin wounds drained of their pus if this is needed.

, The doctors will need to do a blood culture to determine whether the staph bacteria has spread to your blood. If it has, you will need intensive treatment in the hospital and heavy-duty antibiotics.

, Needless to say, an infection that has spread to your bloodstream can be very dangerous and requires immediate medical treatment.

, Otherwise, it will simply become a breeding ground for the staph bacteria.

Wash your hands!,
Take your medications and make sure your vaccines are up to date.,
Here's a bathroom tip.,
Breathe through your nose.,
Try to sit as far away as possible from someone who is sneezing, especially if the person is not covering their mouth.

,
Wash your clothes after being around sick people.",How to Prevent Illnesses," Wash your hands often. Try to always do it before you eat, before you cook, after using the restroom, after touching bins, after going on public transport. It is very important to wash your hands after touching things that you know others have touched. Here are some examples: Rides at amusement parks, handrails, a principle's hand at graduation maybe? A big one is the phone, and also the flusher on the toilet. And did you know that toilets spread germs up to 15 feet?;
, Ask your doctor about all precautions you can take.

, When you get toilet paper, tear one piece off and throw it away, then take however many sheets you need. If you don't understand, think about how you tear toilet paper. You hold the one just above the pieces right?

, Your nose has small hairs that filter out germs. If you breathe through your mouth, you are breathing in unfiltered air that has germs.

,, When people sneeze, their germs may be spread anywhere from 4 to 8 feet (1.2 to 2.4 m), and these germs can stay on your clothes. So wash your clothes after being around people who are sneezing.

Recognize the symptoms of heart failure.,
Link heart failure to other heart problems.,
Talk to your doctor if you are at risk of heart failure.,
Reduce your sodium intake.,
Maintain a healthy, balanced diet.,
Cook with salt-free seasonings and spices.,
Check the labels of packaged foods for the sodium content.,
Request food low in salt when eating out.,
Do cardio exercise and physical activity at least three to four days a week.,
Join an exercise group or a sports club.,
Quit smoking.,
Reduce your stress level.,
Get eight to nine hours of sleep every night.",How to Prevent Congestive Heart Failure," Heart failure does not actually mean your heart is failing or about to stop working. It means your heart muscle has weakened over time and cannot receive or pump blood as well as it used to. This can lead to congestion or a backup of blood in the heart. As a result, not enough oxygen-rich blood will be pumped to your body’s other organs.Heart failure can be acute, occurring suddenly, or it can be chronic and ongoing. The symptoms of heart failure can include:Shortness of breath when you do physical activity (dyspnea) or when you lie down (orthopnea)
Fatigue and weakness.
A rapid or irregular heartbeat.
Swelling (edema) in your legs, ankles, and feet. Your abdominal area may also swell due to fluid build-up (ascites).Reduced ability or inability to exercise.
Persistent coughing or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged phlegm.
Increased need to urinate at night.
Sudden weight gain due to fluid retention.
Lack of appetite and nausea.
Difficulty concentrating and decreased alertness.
Chest pain.;
, Heart failure is often the result of other heart problems or issues that become worse or that weaken your heart. You can experience heart failure on the left side or ventricle, on the right side or right ventricle, or both sides of your heart at once. In general, heart failure starts on the left side of your heart, which is your heart’s main pumping chamber. Heart conditions that can lead to heart failure include:Coronary artery disease: This is the most common form of heart disease and the most common cause of heart failure. If you have this disease, your arteries begin to narrow due to a buildup of fatty deposits, causing a reduction of blood flow to your heart. This disease can lead to a heart attack, as the buildup of fatty deposits can cause a blood clot to form and block blood flow to your heart.
High blood pressure or hypertension: Blood pressure is amount of force of blood that is pumped to your heart by your arteries. If you have high blood pressure, this means your heart has to work harder than normal to circulate blood throughout your body. Over time, your heart muscle may become thicker to make up for the extra work it needs to perform to get blood to all your organs. This could then cause your heart muscle to become too stiff or weak to pump blood effectively.
Faulty heart valves: You can develop faulty heart valves due to a heart defect, coronary artery disease or a heart infection and it can force your heart to work harder than normal to keep blood flowing in your body as it should. This extra work can weaken your heart and lead to heart failure. However, it is possible to fix faulty heart valves if they are treated in time.
Damage to your heart muscle, or cardiomyopathy: Damage to your heart muscle can be caused by diseases, infections, alcohol abuse and drug abuse. Some drugs used for chemotherapy can also lead to cardiomyopathy. As well, you may be genetically predisposed to developing cardiomyopathy.
Abnormal heart rhythms or heart arrhythmias: This condition can cause your heart to beat too fast, which forces your heart to work overtime to pump blood to your body. A slow heartbeat can also prevent your heart from getting enough blood to your body and could lead to heart failure.
The causes of acute heart failure can include viruses that attack your heart muscles, allergic reactions, severe infections, blood clots in your lungs, and the use of certain medications.

, If you have any heart conditions that could lead to heart failure, it’s important that you speak to your doctor about your condition. Most heart problems are chronic and require lifelong care, including maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle, as well as taking heart medications.The best way to prevent your heart condition from developing into heart failure is to allow your doctor to monitor your heart condition and follow a strict diet and lifestyle that does not aggravate your heart. Depending on your heart condition, your doctor may prescribe medication to support your heart muscle that you should take regularly, according to the dosage prescribed by your doctor.

, Sodium is like a sponge, it will hold extra water in your body and force your heart to work even harder than it already does. Reducing your sodium intake will reduce the amount of stress on your heart and prevent your heart condition from turning into congestive heart failure. Though it may be difficult to remove salt from your diet or reduce your intake drastically, you may notice deeper flavors in food when you do not use salt.Remove the salt shaker from the dinner table and avoid putting dashes of salt in your food before you eat. Instead, you can season your food with lemon or lime juice, as well as spices low in sodium.
You should also watch for foods that contain hidden salt, like olives, pickles, and packaged vegetables and soups, as well as sports or energy drinks. Cheese and cured meats are very high in sodium and should also be cut out of your diet.

, To prevent your heart from having to work overtime, keep your body healthy by eating a diet that includes a balance of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. Make sure your meals contain one protein source, one low fat source and one low carb vegetable source. Your carb intake should be in the recommended range of 20-50 grams per a day.Cut out carbs, sugars, and animal fats. Foods high in carbs and sugars cause your body to secrete insulin, which is a main fat storage hormone in your body. When your insulin levels go down, your body can start to burn fat. It also helps your kidneys shed excess sodium and water, which will help you reduce any water weight.Avoid foods high in starch and carbs like white breads and potatoes. Junk foods like potato chips and french fries are also chock full of salt. You should also avoid consuming foods high in sugar like soft drinks, candy, cakes, and other junk food.

, Replace salt when cooking with salt-free herb and spice combinations. You can make salt-free seasonings in advance by placing ½ cup of the seasoning blend in a glass jar and keeping it in a cool, dry place. You can then simply sprinkle it onto your food when cooking for added flavor without added salt.Use Chinese 5 Spice on chicken, fish or pork: Combine ¼ cup ground ginger, 2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon and ground cloves, and 1 tablespoon of ground allspice and anise seed.
Put a mixed herb blend on salads, pastas, steamed vegetables, and baked fish: Combine ¼ cup dried parsley flakes, 2 tablespoons dried tarragon, and 1 tablespoon of dried oregano, dill, and celery flakes.
Use an Italian blend on tomato based soups, pasta sauce, pizza, and bread: Combine 2 tablespoons of dried basil, dried marjoram, dried thyme, dried rosemary, and dried red pepper flakes. You can then add 1 tablespoon of garlic powder and dried oregano.
Make an easy dip blend to mix with cottage cheese, yogurt, or low-fat sour cream: Combine ½ cup dried dill with 1 tablespoon of dried chives, garlic powder, and lemon zest.
You should rub dried herbs between your fingers to release more flavor and aroma. You can also use fresh herbs in dishes by finely chopping them with a knife or cutting them up with kitchen shears.

, Many processed foods contain high levels of sodium, so before you buy any packaged or processed foods, check the label. Most processed foods that come in cans or boxes, like ramen noodles, canned vegetables, tomato juice, and instant potatoes, are too high in sodium.Look at the sodium content per serving and determine the number of servings in the package. You should buy packaged foods that have a sodium content of less than 350 milligrams per serving. If salt or sodium is listed in the first five ingredients in the packaged food, it is too high in sodium. Look for an alternative packaged food or skip the packaged food all together and go for fresh fruits and vegetables instead.

, Rather than avoid eating out, look for food options that have less sodium and let your server know you are on a low-sodium diet. You can then ask the server for suggestions on the menu that are low in sodium.When eating out, go for grilled, baked, or broiled proteins, like meat, chicken or fish, without sauce or gravy. Use lemon and pepper to add flavor, rather than salt. Try a side of steamed rice or baked potato, rather than mashed potatoes or fried rice.
You should also avoid using condiments like relish, pickles, and olives. Put only a small amount of ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise on your food.

, Doing even moderate exercise three to four times a week can help your body stay healthy and reduce the demands placed on your heart. Talk to your doctor about an exercise program that will work with your fitness level. If you are overweight or out of shape, your doctor may suggest a light walking program to start and working up to jogging or running.Regardless of the type of cardio exercise you do, it’s important that you try to maintain a consistent workout routine where you are physically active at least three to four times a week.

, It can be difficult to stay motivated when you are trying to get fit, so seek the support of others and join a workout group or a sports club. Having a social component to your workout routine may help you stay motivated and monitor your progress., If you do smoke and are diagnosed with heart problems or are overweight, you should try to quit smoking. If you don’t smoke, you should avoid secondhand smoke. Smoking damages your blood vessels and causes your blood pressure to spike, thereby reducing the amount of oxygen in your blood and making your heart work harder and beat faster.Your doctor may be able to recommend a program to help you quit smoking or another form of treatment.

, Stress can cause your heart to beat faster, your breathing to be more heavy, and your blood pressure to rise. Being anxious, upset, or stressed out will only make your existing heart conditions worse. Look for ways to reduce stress in your life. Focus on delegating tasks to others, if possible, and taking time out to take a 10 minute power nap or sit down and rest.You can also do relaxing activities, like a hobby or a passion. Spending time with friends and family can also be a good stress release.

, It is essential that your body is well rested so your body and your heart do not feel overworked. If you have difficulty sleeping at night due to shortness of breath, use a pillow to prop your head up. You can also discuss medical options if you snore at night, such as getting tested for sleep apnea or sleeping aids. Getting a good night’s rest will improve your body’s overall health, including your heart."

Remove the lead source.",How to Prevent Lead Poisoning," Extra precautions must be taken to avoid lead poisoning if your home was built before 1978. Risks of lead in older homes include paint and pipes.Find out when your home was built by looking at the ownership records. Your home’s title policy, title search, and purchase appraisal should all have the year the house was built on it.
If you do not have your home’s ownership documents, contact your county recorder’s office, which should have a deed and records for your property on file. Let the records clerk know, “I would like a copy of the deed to my house. Can you assist me?”;
, Lead paint that is not chipping or cracking is not an immediate health risk. Still, even small amounts of lead can cause health problems. An inspection is necessary to determine if there is any lead-based paint on any surfaces in your home.


Contact a local inspection, risk assessment, and abatement firm to schedule an inspection for your home. US residents can find one through the EPA’s locational tool.The inspector will come to your home and sample all interior and exterior painted surfaces. Samples may be tested on site or in a certified lab using an X-ray fluorescence machine to determine if lead is present.If lead paint is found in your home, you will need to contact an abatement team to safely strip the paint and clear the house. Cover all lead-painted areas with tarps or other coverings while you await abatement.

, Lead pipes may be found as the service line that brings water into your home from the public water main. To check to see if you have lead pipes, first locate your water meter, which may be inside or outside of your house.If your water meter is inside the house, it is likely in your basement, crawlspace, or garage. If it is outside of your house, it is probably on the sidewalk or in your yard with a cover that says “water meter.”
Walk the shortest path from your water meter to your house. This should show you where your pipe enters your home. Inside your home, the pipe should connect to a shut-off valve that may look like a lever, or a small wheel.
Check the pipe connected to the valve using a magnet. If a magnet will stick to it, then it is probably steel. If a magnet won’t stick to it, then it’s probably lead.
If you suspect you have lead pipes, contact an inspection and abatement team immediately to verify your findings and talk about replacement options., If you rent your home and you are concerned about lead where you live, contact your landlord and request a copy of a current lead risk reduction inspection. If your landlord does not have one, in many states you should be able to file a petition with your county to have the property inspected at cost to your landlord.In many states, landlords are required to perform risk reduction activities if lead hazards are found, which may include removing paint and updating pipes. These processes generally come at no cost to the renter, and are within your legal right to require from your landlord.

, Washing your hands regularly helps prevent hand-to-mouth transferring of soils or dust that may contain lead. Wash your hands with soap and water before putting them in or around your mouth.Encourage your children to wash their hands after playing outside, as well as before meals.
Do not allow children to play directly in or with ground soil. Direct them toward a sandbox filled with sand meant for play, or provide them with gloves for activities like gardening.

, Use cold tap water any time you go to the faucet to get water for consumption, especially if you have an older home. Use purified water or cold tap water when preparing infant formula and cooking.Older plumbing may contain lead, which is more likely to absorb into the water when it is warm.
If warm tap water must be used in a home with old plumbing, run cold water from the faucet for 2 minutes before switching to warm water.

, Keep trace amounts of lead from accumulating as dust by regularly cleaning surfaces that are prone to getting dusty. Use a wet mop to wipe down floors, and a damp cloth to get furniture, tables, TV stands, window sills, and anywhere else that may need dusting.If you know of a lead risk such as lead paint in your home, it may be advisable to wear a dust mask or surgical mask while dusting. These are available at most pharmacies and home improvement stores.

, Some items, such as toys, are required under US law to be lead-free. However, many items used in and around the home and office may have some lead in them. Whenever possible, opt to purchase lead-free products for yourself and your home.


Look for lead-free labels. Different certification groups, such as the CSA and UL, have different marks. Consult a guide to familiarize yourself with lead-free markings and text requirements.Check labels on cookware, utensils and food storage supplies very closely, as these could leach lead directly into your food. Avoid purchasing these items second-hand unless the lead-free label is still intact.
Regularly check toy recall lists and dispose of any toys that are shown to be contaminated with lead.

, The dirt that people track into your home on their shoes may have lead in it.To avoid having this brought into your home, ask everyone in your household and anyone who visits to leave their shoes by the door. You might even provide a mat for people to place their shoes on.

, Proper nutrition from regular meals may help reduce lead absorption. It is especially important to ensure that you and your family get the daily recommended amount of iron and calcium.


For children, the recommended amount of calcium is 200mg for the first six months, 260mg between six months and one year, 700mg between ages one and three, 1,000mg up to age eight, and 1,300mg up to age 18.For adults, the recommended amount of calcium is 1,000mg between ages 19 and 51, and 1,200mg from age 51 on.
For children, the recommended amount of iron is 0.27mg up to six months of age, 11mg for seven to twelve months, 7mg for children age one to three, 10mg for ages four to eight, 8mg for ages nine to thirteen, and 11 to 15mg for ages 14 to 18.For adults, the recommended amount of iron is 8mg for men and 18mg for women ages 19 to 50, and 8mg for all adults above age 50. Pregnant women require 27mg of iron daily.

, If you think you or someone you know may have been exposed to lead, look for symptoms of lead poisoning. In infants these may include learning difficulties and slowed growth. In children and adults, symptoms include:Memory loss.
Mood disorders.
Developmental delays or decline in mental function.
Constipation.
Vomiting.
High blood pressure.
Muscle pain.
Fatigue.
Headaches.
Loss of appetite or weight loss.

, If you think that you or a family member may have lead poisoning, request a blood test.A doctor will administer the test. The test uses a blood sample to check for levels of lead within the body.Young children are routinely tested at well-child physician visits, but children over the age of six years and adults are not typically given the test unless requested.
Blood tests are particularly important if you think you or others in your home have inhaled, ingested, or otherwise been exposed to lead.

, Your doctor will be able to recommend proper treatment for lead poisoning. For those showing low levels of lead in the blood, avoiding exposure may be enough to reduce levels. For those with higher levels of lead in the blood, chelation therapy or EDTA therapy may be prescribed.Chelation therapy involves repeatedly taking a medication prescribed by your doctor, often during a hospital stay. The medication binds with the lead in your body, forcing you to excrete it during urination.This therapy is appropriate for children and adults.
EDTA therapy is used to treat adults and some children with lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL of blood. It is a form of chelation therapy, wherein a chemical known as EDTA is injected by IV into the body to extract lead., If you or someone in your house is diagnosed with lead poisoning, immediately contact an abatement specialist about removing or mitigating the lead source. This is necessary to keep lead levels in the body low after lead poisoning treatment.A specialist may recommend removal or covering of the lead, depending upon the circumstances. For example, sometimes it is more practical to cover uncracked or undamaged lead paint with a thick coat of new paint, rather than peeling away everything.

Exercise on a regular basis.,
Perform a variety of strength training exercises.,
Add moderate aerobic exercise to your regimen, as well.,
Avoid excessive or improper exercise.,
Wear proper shoes for any activities you perform.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Stop smoking.",How to Prevent a Bulging Disc1," People who do not exercise face an elevated risk of back pain. A lack of exercise can make your back muscles weak and stiff, restricting movement, increasing stress on the back, and increasing the likelihood of a herniated disc.Exercising will strengthen the muscles that support your spine as well as the muscles in your back, stomach, and legs. It can also help to relieve back pain.Try to get 30 minutes of exercise at least five days per week. You can do anything you like, such as walking, biking, swimming, or dancing.;
, Perform strength training exercises at least twice per week. Choose exercises that target your back, stomach, and legs to increase the strength and flexibility of these muscles, and reduce the risk of a herniated disc. Try partial sit-ups or crunches, pelvic tilts, bridging exercises, and plank exercises.Crunch. To do a crunch, lay on your back. Keeping your knees bent, raise your shoulders about 3–6 inches (8–20 cm) off the floor, exhaling on the way up and inhaling on the way down. Do this slowly 8-10 times with your arms crossed over your chest.

Pelvic tilt. To do a pelvic tilt, lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Then, tighten the buttocks and pelvis so that they tip up slightly, pressing your lower back to the floor. Hold for one second and then relax.

Bridging exercise. A bridging exercise is an advanced progression of a pelvic tilt. To do a bridging exercise, lie on your back with your knees bent. Tighten the buttocks and raise your buttocks off the floor. Hold the position for 10 to 20 seconds and lower back to the initial pelvic tilt position. Repeat four more times

Plank exercise. A plank exercise is one of the best exercises to strengthen the core. To do a plank exercise, lie on a floor or bed. Lift your upper body over your elbows while getting on your toes. Hold your body in a straight line and tighten your stomach muscles. Hold the position for 10 to 20 seconds. Lower your body, rest, and repeat four more times.

, Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the back, providing nutrients that can support healing. It also increases balance, strength, and flexibility that will help to prevent injuries like a herniated disc. Low-impact exercises also help to relieve existing lower-back pain. These can include swimming, bicycling, elliptical training, water therapy, walking, lumbar extension strength training, and yoga.Aim for a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking or swimming. If you prefer vigorous aerobic activities such as running or dancing, perform at least 75 minutes of those exercises per week.

, Some research suggests that certain high-impact exercises eventually raise your risk for a bulging disc. Likewise, improper or overly intense exercise may lead to back troubles. A jerky golf swing or incorrect use of a rowing machine will put extra stress on your spine and, over time, may cause an injury.


Sometimes a small adjustment in form can help. For example, between 30% to 70% of cyclists experience lower back pain, which may be improved by adjusting the seat angle.You should also avoid exercises that are repetitive in nature and involve a rotation and twisting motion. Some sports such as football or golf can involve these type of movements.

, This practice will provide your back with additional support and may prevent other types of injuries from occurring. High-heels, for example, can throw off your alignment and increase the risk of a slipped disc, putting particular stress on the lower back.Consult with the salesperson in a specialized foot-wear or retail store to determine the best shoes for your lifestyle. Custom-made shoes will best address specific gait problems but can cost between $150 to $200.Running shoes are good for exercise as well as everyday use, as they give stability to your natural arch and provide cushioning -- essential for a healthy gait. New Balance brand is recommended by some doctors.Orthotic inserts and prescription orthotics are two other options. The latter, called ""functional orthotics,"" are usually made of plastic or graphite and target issues caused in your back or elsewhere through abnormal motion.Some runners promote so-called ""minimalist shoes,"" which are designed to maximize contact between the ball and center of your foot and the ground, rather than your heel, to mimic bare-footed running. Recent research suggests that such shoes might not be as good for your feet and back as is claimed, however., Excess body weight puts extra strain on your back and spine and can contribute to injuries. Do you have a healthy body mass index? Consult the British National Health at http://www.nhs.uk/tools/pages/healthyweightcalculator.aspx to find out. There are a number of ways to maintain a healthy body weight. Regular exercise is a must. Aim for a minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise like walking, running, or swimming on most days as well as 20 minutes of strength training (like lifting weights) twice a week.Exercise has to be supported by a healthy lifestyle, including diet. Don’t skip meals, particularly breakfast. Depriving yourself will simply tempt you to binge and slow your metabolism. To keep yourself satisfied, eat 4 to 5 small meals spread throughout the day.Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, healthy carbohydrates like beans, whole wheat, and brown rice; healthy fats such as nuts, olive oil, and fish; lean protein like chicken, turkey, or eggs; and foods that contain calcium to strengthen your bones. Limit high-calorie foods, sugars, and added fats from fried foods, butter or margarine, salad dressings, or rich sauces.Eat proper portion sizes. According to the Mayo Clinic, the typical meat portion size is about as big as a deck of playing cards. Fats should be about the size of two dice. For carbohydrates, aim for a portion the size of a hockey puck. Fruit and vegetable portions should be the size of tennis and baseballs, respectively., Smoking tobacco decreases the oxygen flow to your intervertebral discs and prevent them from absorbing the nutrients they need to function normally, causing the discs to degenerate more rapidly and become brittle.. Quitting will have an immediate remedial effect, and will also help your overall well-being. If you are having problems quitting smoking, speak to your health care provider for assistance or for information on joining a support group.

Be kind and responsive.",How to Prepare Yourself for Visiting Someone in Hospital," Before you visit the hospital, you should check to see when visiting hours are at that facility. Most hospitals have evening hours to accommodate working visitors, but some hospitals or even some specialized departments or floors, such as the intensive care unit, may have restrictive schedules.Call ahead with the name of the patient you wish to visit to confirm the location of the patient and the visiting hours for that ward.;
, In addition to checking on visiting hours, you should also check to see if there are any restrictions for that particular patient. Some individuals recovering from surgery or suffering from certain conditions need extra rest, while others at risk of infection may have limited or restricted visitations put in place.Some patients may not be physically or mentally capable of having visitors. This could be for a variety of reasons, and it's important to be respectful of those reasons.
The person may be on isolation precautions, meaning you will have to take special steps before entering the room. Speak to a nurse to find out if you need to wear a mask, protective gown, gloves, or other protective equipment. The nurse will be able to provide you with these items and instruct you on proper use. It's important you follow directions exactly, to protect bot the patient and yourself.Call the hospital and ask to speak with a nurse working on your patient's floor. Ask the nurse whether it would be okay to visit, and provide a rough time frame you'd like to visit.

, Even if there are no restrictions on visitation, some patients may not want to be seen while they recover in the hospital. Before you plan a visit, make sure that your presence would be well received.


Check in with the patient or her family to see if she wants visitors while staying in the hospital.
If the patient does not want visitors, be respectful of her wishes. You can always send a card or get-well package through the mail or ask the patient's family to deliver it for you.

, If you're ill and there's a risk you might spread an infection or disease to the patient, it is best to postpone your visit. Patients in the hospital often have compromised immune systems, and exposure to even minor germs could lead to infections, complications, and potentially a prolonged illness for someone with an already diminished condition.If you're ill, you are better off staying out of the hospital for both yourself and the patient. Consider a phone call or video chat instead.
Even if you're healthy, you should wash your hands before and after visiting the hospital, in particular when you enter and exit the patient’s room. You could accidentally introduce bacteria or viruses to patients inside the hospital, or you could inadvertently carry a serious pathogen home with you when you leave the hospital.
When you wash your hands, use soap and clean, running water for a total of 20 seconds.You may also wish to use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer instead of washing your hands.

, If the individual you're visiting suffers from a debilitating condition or life-threatening illness, you may find it comforting to learn as much as you can about that individual's condition. This may give you a sense of peace, relief from your anxiety, or at least some knowledge of what's to come.Start out by only reading credible medical articles. You can find a wealth of information on websites run by hospitals, medical schools, and medical care centers, such as the Mayo Clinic or Medline Plus.
You can also find endless information in print form. Check your local library for medical textbooks and journals, then research the condition or illness for which your friend or relative is being treated.
Once you've read some credible medical information, it may be comforting to read some personal accounts that talk about that condition/illness. Look for memoirs or even personal online blogs that discuss that condition or illness. Online forums specific to the illness often have good discussions and information.

, Even the most emotionally strong individual may feel grief, stress, or frustration at seeing a friend or relative in the hospital. Your mood may change before, during, or after your visit, and it's important to be aware of how you're feeling about the situation at any given time so you can better manage your emotions.Remember that everyone deals with crisis situations differently. You may be able to maintain your composure and handle the situation, or you may grow anxious, frightened, or even angry.
These feelings may change as the patient's health improves, declines, or alternates between improvement and decline.

, If you're feeling emotionally upset about a friend or loved one's hospitalization, talking with others can help. Some people you talk to may have input on how you can handle the situation better, while others may simply be there to lend an ear when you need to vent.You can speak with family and friends about any concerns you have, especially if those friends or relatives are also close with the patient you're going to visit.
If you have deeper-seated emotional concerns, you may want to consider speaking with a therapist or a clergy member (if you are religious).

, Journaling is an excellent way to process your emotions and navigate the way you think and feel. When someone you know is hospitalized, journaling can help you work through the confusion and make sense of your emotional response.You can write anything you want in your journal. You don't have to show it to anyone, and you can even destroy the page when you're finished.
Try to be consistent in your journaling. Since your feelings may change as the days or weeks go on, it can be helpful to make a daily habit of reflecting and writing.
You can buy any type of journal you want, from a simple spiral-bound notebook to an elegant leather-bound book of blank pages; however, you may want to consider portability and ease of access when you're deciding on a notebook.
It may be easier for you to journal on your phone or tablet. There are many apps that allow you to keep a journal on your devices.

, Visiting or taking care of someone in the hospital can be very stressful, and that stress can take a toll on your health if you're not careful. By taking good care of yourself, you can stay in a good physical and mental/emotional state while you process what's happened to your friend or loved one.


Exercise regularly. This can help you burn off some energy or stress and stay healthy. Even walking around the hospital can help.Make sure you're eating a healthy diet. While vending machines are convenient, they mostly contain junk food and you'll need proper nutrition, including a balanced diet with fresh fruits and vegetables.
Get adequate rest. Remember that most adults need at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night, while some adults may need even more sleep.Do things to help you relax and deal with your stress. Even if you can't leave the hospital, bring books, magazines, crafts, and other things to keep yourself busy and take your mind off of things.

, When you go to visit someone in the hospital, it's often customary to bring some type of gift. This can be a simple ""get well"" card, a stuffed animal, mylar balloons (latex balloons are often not allowed due to allergy concerns), or something else entirely.Some hospitals allow cut flowers but not potted plants, particularly in certain departments of the hospital. Contact the hospital first to ensure that your gift is acceptable in a patient's room.


Try to base your gift on the individual's tastes.
Choose a gift that will cheer up the individual. For example, if you know the person is an avid hiker and camper who is eager to get back on the trail, you may want to bring something that will make her think of hiking or camping.
Consider bringing something that will help the person pass the time, such as a book of crossword puzzles, magazines, a book, or some other activity.
If you know an image or object might upset the patient, you should avoid bringing anything that might be a reminder of that image or object. For example, if the individual will never be able to walk or ride a bike again, bringing reminders of these activities could be upsetting.

, Someone who is hospitalized may be dealing with a lot of physical discomfort and/or mental or emotional trauma. She may need someone to run errands or check on her home for her, but more than anything she'll probably need emotional support during this difficult time.Anticipate that the patient may be feeling a range of emotions. She may be feeling hopeful, fearful, angry, or she may even be in denial.
Never tell the individual how she should feel. Simply accept the way she's feeling without criticism or interrogation.
Ask the individual if she wants to talk about what she is going through. Don't unload your grief or fear on the patient, as she has enough to deal with on her own.
Let the patient know that you're available to talk anytime. Even if she doesn't want to discuss what she's going through now, that may change with time. Make sure she has your contact information so she can reach you in case she wants to talk later.
If the patient has a chronic illness/condition or will be going through a prolonged recovery period, be sure that you continue to offer support over the long-term. Many people will be there at first, but your friend or relative will need support down the line.

, If you are planning on staying with the patient and being his caregiver, you may find yourself physically and emotionally exhausted after a certain period of time. That's when it becomes helpful to have someone else to give you some time off.Talk to other friends or family members of the patient to coordinate schedules. Let each other know when you're available and what shifts would work best.
Once you've worked out a schedule, let the patient know who will be staying in the hospital and when. Having a schedule in mind may help give the patient some sense of normalcy.

, Even if you're staying at the hospital to be by your friend or loved one's side, you'll need to get away from time to time. Taking little breaks throughout the day to step outside the hospital can help you manage the way you're feeling and provide some relief from the stress and tedium of being in a hospital.Going for a walk, getting yourself some food or coffee, or simply stepping outside to talk on the phone can help give you a mental break from the stress of being in the hospital.
Let the individual know that you'll be back, and try to provide a rough time estimate. This can help put an anxious hospital patient a bit more at ease.

, When you visit someone who is ill or infirm, you may be at a loss for what to talk about. It can be difficult to tell whether you should be somber or upbeat, but the best approach is to see how the hospitalized individual is feeling and base your own responses on her outlook.Don't point out that the patient looks ill, injured, or otherwise unwell. Likewise, avoid talking about the procedure/surgery unless the patient wants to talk about it.
Focus on the patient's treatment and recovery. Try to remain positive so that the patient can keep a healthy, positive attitude.
If the patient is feeling sad or hopeless, try to lift her spirits. Talk about fun or humorous memories and try to get her to think about the fun times you'll have in the future once she is feeling better.

Use proper lifting techniques.,
Maintain good posture at all times.,
Use a bed that supports your lower back.,
Stretch your back regularly.,
Stretch your legs.",How to Prevent a Bulging Disc2," Lifting heavy objects improperly is the most common cause of back injuries, including bulging discs. Lift from your legs rather than your back. Stand as close as possible to the object that you wish to lift, with feet spread apart to give you a wide base. Then squat down and bend your knees, lifting up using the large muscles in your legs. As you lift, hold the object close to your body to reduce the strain on your back.Do not bend at the waist!
If an object is too heavy for you to lift on your own, seek help.
Also keep in mind that there is a greater risk of injury within one hour of waking up. This is because your spine has been in a horizontal position during sleep and has not fully rehydrated. Avoid lifting anything within one hour of waking up, especially if the movement involves twisting and bending.

, A correct posture will keep your head, shoulders, and hips aligned and your head up and reduce strain on your back. Incorrect posture, conversely, places extra stress on the spine. If you are standing or walking, stand up straight with your shoulders back and abdomen tucked in. If you must sit, use a pillow or other object to support your lower back if you do not have an adjustable, ergonomic chair to support your body. Your feet should either rest flat on the floor or be elevated.Try using a footstool to elevate your feet and legs when you are seated.
Riding in a vehicle for long periods can be quite stressful on the spine. Consider moving the car seat forward as much as possible to avoid leaning forward. Try to stop and walk about for a few minutes every hour, if possible.

, Extend good posture to your sleep. Sleep on a firm mattress. To keep your mattress firm, replace it every 8 to 10 years and flip it every 3 months. While using the bed, sleep on your back or on your side instead of on your stomach or in the fetal position. Sleeping on your back and on your side will reduce your risk for a bulging disc., Stretch your back whenever you have to endure long periods sitting down. This will prevent you from becoming stiff while at work or on a long car trip. Try the following quick exercise as a way to keep limber.


First, stand up straight and spread your legs hip-width apart. Bend your knees slightly and place both of your arms straight out in front of you at the height of your shoulders, keeping your shoulders down and relaxed.
Clasp one hand with the other hand, then drop your head toward your chest. Pull your abdominal muscles inward to protect the lower section of your back and slightly round your lower back.
Then, create the letter ""C"" shape with your torso by tucking your hips slightly forward, stretching your arms in front of you until you feel your shoulder blades moving apart. You will then begin to feel the stretching of your upper and lower back and your shoulders.

, Make sure that you take time every day to stretch your leg muscles, such as your hamstrings, calves, and thighs. It’s important to stretch all of your lower body muscles to avoid any tightness that might affect your back.

Try doing a forward bend, hamstring stretches, or a butterfly stretch.

Start pre-op education months before the surgery.,
Undergo psychological evaluation.,
Follow all your doctor’s instructions.,
Get pre-op tests.,
Discuss your medication with your doctor.,
Determine how your insurance will help with the surgery.",How to Prepare for Bariatric Surgery1," Bariatric surgery is a major and life-changing surgery. It takes months to prepare. Approximately six months before the surgery, you should begin your pre-op education.This pre-op education should help you decide if bariatric surgery is right for you.
Join a bariatric information or support group to learn about the surgery and receive support through the process.Learn as much about the surgery as possible. Read books and websites to find out more information about the procedure. Read stories from people who have undergone the surgery. Research the risks and complications associated with it.Learn about the lifestyle changes you will have to undergo before and after the surgery, including the dietary restrictions, smoking cessation and an exercise regimen.;
, In addition to seeing your bariatric physician and surgeon, you will need to be evaluated by a psychologist.This is an important part of the pre- and post-op process since obesity may have had an impact on your mental health. Bariatric surgery has a large impact on your physical and emotional life, so your psychological care aims to help you make an easier transition into your new lifestyle.The evaluation before surgery helps determine if bariatric surgery is right for you.
Psychological counseling also helps you address your relationship with food. You may be asked to discover factors that led to your weight or held you back from making lifestyle changes in the past.You may be asked to think or talk about why you want this change at this moment.
If you are an emotional eater, you may be able to find help to work through the issues surrounding that.

, Your doctor will give you a pre-op plan as you prepare for your bariatric surgery. Sometimes, doctors may tailor the surgery for your specific case, so make sure you know what exactly the surgery will entail. Other doctors or hospitals may follow very specific pre-op plans. Make sure to follow all instructions given to you by your doctor.Your doctor will give you information on how to prepare for the surgery and information regarding the surgery.
Your doctor will probably also give you a nutritional and exercise plan for pre- and post-op.
Ask your doctor any questions you have about the surgery, the risks, the pre-op plan, the nutritional plan, or the exercise routine. Discuss concerns you have with your doctor so they can be addressed early or as they arise.

, Before you get the surgery, you will have to undergo an array of tests. These tests ensure you are physically prepared for the surgery so you can be successful. These tests include:Complete blood count (CBC)
Urinalysis
Glucose tolerance
Chest x-ray
EKG
Chemistry panel
Gallbladder ultrasound
Upper endoscopy
Sleep apnea test
Cardiology workup
Other tests to check the lungs, heart, or gastrointestinal tract

, Prior to having surgery, you should discuss any medications that you take. Talk to your doctor about which medications are safe to take and which shouldn’t be taken before the surgery.You will not be able to take aspirin prior to the surgery. Don't forget to include any vitamins or supplements you may be taking.

, Before the surgery, talk to your insurance company to discuss whether or not they will pay for the surgery. If they don’t pay for all of the surgery, you should determine how much they will pay for.Find out if your insurance company has any requirements for bariatric surgery, such as a BMI requirement, or diet-related conditions.
Some insurance plans require pre-op education programs. Determine if your insurance provider requires this, and if they do, find out how long you have to be in the education program before your surgery.Schedule a financial planning meeting with the hospital to discuss any payment plan options available to you if you have to pay for anything out of pocket.Be aware that even if your insurance covers the surgery, it may take a long time to be approved. Contact your insurance company months in advance so you don’t have to reschedule or postpone your surgery."

Prepare yourself for the equipment that will be attached to you.,
Be aware of how it will feel.,
Remove your jewelry and any other accessories.Prior to undergoing the ECG, the technician performing the test will ask you to remove any jewelry or other accessories that could possibly interfere with the electrical readings.,
Lie still for the duration of the test.The ECG will only take a few minutes in total once the procedure is underway (not counting equipment set-up time).,
Follow-up with your doctor.,
Understand what an ECG is measuring.,
Be aware of possible reasons why your doctor may have ordered an ECG.An ECG is an invaluable diagnostic tool in differentiating causes of chest pain, respiratory problems, or other suspicious symptoms that may be related to the heart and/or lungs.,
Obtain follow-up tests as needed.An ECG alone may not be sufficient to gather all of the information that your doctor desires.",How to Prepare for an ECG," In order to obtain an ECG, the technician will place a variety of small patches called ""electrodes"" over areas of your chest, your arms, and your legs. There will be about 10–15 electrodes in total, depending upon the complexity of information desired by your physician. The placement of these patches (electrodes) may seem random, but they are in fact carefully calculated as the best possible positions, or ""vantage points,"" from which to record the electrical activity of the heart.


The electrodes themselves are harmless. They do not emit electricity; they merely record and measure the natural electrical impulses that are emitted from the heart cells themselves.
The only problems one could have from the electrodes are either itchiness or, for men with hairy chests, the technician may require the chest hair in those areas to be shaved in order to optimize the adhesion of the electrodes to the skin (they do not stick properly when too much hair is present).
The electrodes will then be attached via lead wires to the ECG machine, which records the information for the doctor as the procedure takes place.;
, The great thing about an ECG is that you do not feel anything as the procedure is underway.Other than some possible mild irritation from the electrodes placed upon your skin, there is otherwise no sensation associated with the test itself., You will also be asked to remove clothing on the upper half of your body, so that your chest and arms are exposed, and you may be asked to wear shorts to better expose your legs. For your modesty, the technician will provide you with a gown to cover yourself.

, For the duration of the test, it is important that you do not talk, move, or engage in any activity that could disrupt the test readings. Lie as still as possible in order to ensure the greatest accuracy of the results. Breathe normally (as you would at rest) as abnormal respiration could also interfere with test results.

, There are no specific post-test instructions after an ECG; you should be able to just get up and leave after the test is over.However, within the next few days you will want to check in with your doctor about your test results, and to receive any additional diagnostic tests or medications as needed. Be sure you know when and how to follow-up with your physician prior to leaving the test.

, An ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart. As previously mentioned, the test itself does not send out any electricity; it merely records the natural electrical impulses of the heart cells. This, in turn, provides valuable information to your doctor about your heart rate, your heart rhythm (and whether it is regular or irregular), and the strength and coordination of each heartbeat as the impulses travel through the various aspects of the heart muscle., An ECG can also be used for other health-related purposes, such as clearing a patient before surgery, checking on the status of a pacemaker or other implanted cardiac device, or to evaluate the effectiveness of certain heart-related medications on one's overall heart function.


The diagnostic pros of the procedure tend to outweigh the cons, as there are no side effects or negative ramifications of undergoing the procedure itself. The only possible ""con"" is the cost of the procedure, which depends upon whether or not it is covered under your healthcare plan.
There are virtually no risks associated with an ECG. However, if you have concerns of any sort, feel free to discuss these with your doctor prior to undergoing the procedure., Further diagnostic tests that are often performed for additional information following an ECG include:


A ""Holter monitor"" test. This test is basically a 24-hour ECG. It obtains the same information about the electrical activity of your heart that a standard ECG does, but it does so over a much longer period of time, therefore capturing unusual beats or episodes that may not have shown up during a short ECG test.
An ""event recorder."" This is similar to a Holter monitor and to an ECG. However, it is something you use only when you are experiencing cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath, unusual heartbeats (called palpitations), or light-headedness or dizziness, among other things.
A ""stress test."" If your symptoms arise primarily during exertion, your doctor may recommend a stress test to provoke your symptoms. This test also records the electrical activity of your heart, and it hopes to capture abnormalities provoked by exertion.

Inform your doctor if you have any bleeding problems.,
Tell your doctor about all medications and herbal supplements that you are taking.,
Inform your doctor if you are pregnant.,
Prepare information to give to your anesthesiologist.,
Ask your doctor about what to expect during and after the procedure.",How to Prepare for a Kidney Biopsy1," For example, do you bleed profusely from a small cut? You may need to confirm that you do not have a bleeding disorder by having some laboratory tests (PT, PTT, INR) done to determine your bleeding time and clotting time. This will ensure that your kidney does not bleed unusually during the procedure. The kidney is a highly vascular organ and is at risk of bleeding from minor injury.Bleeding disorders can increase the risks associated with the biopsy.
Common bleeding disorders include hemophilia A and B, which are disorders in factor VIII and IX, respectively.;
, Some drugs increase the risk of bleeding so you must stop taking them before the procedure. By informing your doctor of all the drugs and supplements you are taking they can instruct you on which ones to stop taking prior to the biopsy. As a general rule you should avoid:Blood thinning drugs such as warfarin which you should stop taking 7 to 10 days before the biopsy.
Drugs that prevent blood clot formation, such as aspirin and other over the counter pain medications (ex. Ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin).Herbal supplements like ginkgo, garlic and fish oil because they can cause blood thinning., Pregnant women have high blood pressure that increases the risk of bleeding after the procedure. Additionally, pregnancy itself alters kidney structures and makes it difficult to properly diagnose diseases through a biopsy.


Before the biopsy your doctor may ask you to arrange one or two units of cross matched blood as a precautionary measure.
Your doctor may also ask you to defer the procedure until after delivery. After delivery the effect of pregnancy on your kidney structure will wane and the actual problem will be revealed.

, The anesthesiologist is the doctor who administers medication to keep you comfortable during the kidney biopsy. You will need to provide information regarding:Family history: The anesthesiologist will need to know if you, or anyone in your immediate family, has had any problems with anesthesia in the past. This helps the anesthesiologist order the correct medicine to use during the procedure.
Allergies and reactions to medications: Tell the anesthesiologist about any allergies you have or reactions to medications you’ve had in the past.
Medical history: Make sure to tell the anesthesiologist if you have a history of bleeding or if you are on blood thinners, known as anticoagulants such as Coumadin or Aspirin. Other medications that cause bleeding are Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Advil, Ibuprofen, Motrin and others. You’ll be asked to stop these medications a few days before surgery.

, In order to make sure that you are fully prepared for the procedure it is best to have a clear understanding of what a kidney biopsy entails, any risks associated with the biopsy, what the potential results could mean, and how long the recovery will take."

Meet with a nutritionist.,
Learn to eat for health.,
Change your daily eating habits.,
Eat protein.,
Track your food.,
Eat mindfully.",How to Prepare for Bariatric Surgery2," Before your surgery, you will probably be required to meet with a nutritionist. This nutritionist will help you with a few important things. The nutritionist will teach you how to modify your diet so your surgery can be successful due to your lifestyle changes.Your nutritionist will also help you make diet changes before the surgery that leads to pre-op weight loss.
Your nutritionist will let you know any restrictions or instructions you should follow just before the surgery.

, In the months leading to your surgery, you will work with a nutritionist to change the way you eat and the way you view food. One main concern is the size of your stomach post-op. Your stomach will be much smaller, so you will be unable to eat as much food as before.Since your stomach is smaller after the surgery, you will eat less. This means you will have to fill your stomach with nutritious food instead of junk food.
Only eating junk food after your surgery can lead to malnutrition, prevent weight loss, and other uncomfortable side effects or conditions.
Before your surgery, retrain your palate to eat healthy, nutritious foods that will nourish your body, keep you full, and keep you healthy.

, Pre-op diet plans help you begin developing eating habits you will continue after the surgery. One important thing to start doing is to eat three portion-controlled meals each day, including breakfast.You can have one to two small snacks each day.
Try to eliminate any eating four hours before bedtime.

, Patients who prepare for bariatric surgery are encouraged to eat more protein. A diet high in protein helps aid and boost weight loss.Your doctor or nutritionist will advise you on how many calories you should eat a day, along with the proper amount of protein to include each day.


Make sure you are choosing healthy sources of protein. A diet full of fatty meats, bacon, and steak is not going to help you.
Eat lean red meat, such as 85/15 or 93/7 ground beef. Choose skinless chicken breast and fish. Eggs contain a lot of protein.
Nuts are a great source of protein, as are beans.
Low-fat dairy contains protein. Try Greek yogurt and low-fat cheese.
In conjunction with this high protein diet, you should eat significantly less carbs, saturated fat, and refined sugars.Most pre-op diets suggest 800 to 1200 calories per day with 70 to 120 grams of protein each day., Your psychologist, nutritionist, or dietician may require you to track your daily eating habits. Doing this can help in multiple ways. Tracking your food may help you discover problem foods or problems times of the day.Tracking your food also helps you learn how to eat with your new lifestyle changes. If you are on a calorie-controlled diet, you can keep count of the calories you eat a day. If you need a certain amount of protein, you can also tally your daily grams.
Also track your water. You will be encouraged to drink more water and limit other beverages, especially sugary beverages.

, Part of the process that goes along with bariatric surgery is learning how to eat. This includes eating with purpose. Start eating slowly, making sure to chew each bite and taste the food.You can start paying attention to the way your body feels when you eat. This includes learning to know when you are full, or being able to recognize foods that do not agree with you.
You will start learning how to stop mindlessly eating or emotional eating. For example, you should stop eating in front of the TV or while working. You should also not turn to food when you are tired or stressed.

Lose weight.,
Quit smoking.,
Start an exercise program.,
Understand the importance of changing your habits pre-op.,
Find a support network.",How to Prepare for Bariatric Surgery3," Often, doctors will ask you to lose weight prior to your surgery. Even losing 1% of your body weight can help you lose more weight in the year following your surgery.Your doctor may suggest that you lose 15 to 30 pounds prior to the surgery.Losing weight before the surgery helps you demonstrate that you are committed this lifestyle change to both your doctor and yourself.
Losing weight also helps reduce the risk of health problems and complications during the surgery. Studies have shown that losing weight pre-op and being at a lower weight at the time of the surgery reduces the amount of time a doctor has to operate. Lower operating time leads to a lower risk of complications.
Losing weight helps reduce the size of the liver. If your liver is too large, it can interfere with the surgery or even cause the surgery to be postponed until it has reduced in size., If you smoke, you should quit smoking before the surgery. Tobacco products have been shown to increase the risk of complications associated with bariatric surgery.Smoking can lead to post-surgery illnesses, such as pneumonia, and poor wound healing with a higher risk of operative complications.


Some programs require you to quit smoking a few months before beginning pre-surgery steps. If you smoke, discuss quitting and the timeline for your surgery based on your smoking with your doctor.

, Exercise will be an important lifestyle change before and after your bariatric surgery. Approximately six months before your surgery, you should start exercising consistently. Consider starting with a daily walk of 30 minutes.Start exercising at your own level. Figure out ways to get moving. This may include short walks with friends or your dog, doing chair exercises, dancing around your house, or joining a gym. If you can’t walk 30 minutes at one time, walk for 10 minutes three times a day until you can do it at once. Add daily physical activity into your life.Your major aim is to exercise frequently and consistently. Start by trying to get 20 to 30 minutes at least three times a week, more if you can. At the beginning, the important thing is to make exercise a habit.
Gradually increase the intensity of your exercise as your fitness level improves. You want get your heart rate up. Try calculating your target heart rate for maximum benefits.

, When you decide to have bariatric surgery, you should start making lifestyle changes. These changes help condition your body for your post-op lifestyle so it’s not a shock or too difficult after the surgery. You will not be able to go back to your old lifestyle after your surgery, so you should start working on your lifestyle changes before the surgery.If you go back to old habits after your surgery, you will regain the weight, which brings back the health problems connected to your obesity.

, Since bariatric surgery is a life-changing surgery with physical and emotional implications, surround yourself with supportive people. Find family and friends who will be there for you. Talk to them about your choice for bariatric surgery and make sure they understand your reasons.Educate your friends and family on the surgery and the process you will go through.
If people around you discourage your weight loss or are not supportive, don’t let that stop you. Distance yourself from those people and surround yourself with encouraging, supportive, and understanding people. Reach out to support groups if you have to.

Wait and see.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Consider using tea tree oil.,
Promote boil drainage.,
Know when to call your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about lancing.,
Take antibiotics only if strongly recommended.",How to Pop a Boil," Most people's natural immune systems are strong enough to effectively deal with minor skin infections such as boils. Thus, boils often heal on their own after a period of a few weeks, although you'll likely experience some itching and mild throbbing pain in the early stages.Boils can become more painful with time as the pressure builds up from pus accumulation, although they can spontaneously burst after a few weeks and then clear up quickly.


If you are anticipating a boil bursting on its own after a few weeks, be prepared by carrying some antibiotic wipes and clean tissues with you or in your car.
If you have a boil on your face, keep it clean and refrain from covering it up with a thick layer of make-up or cover-up. Facial boils can be embarrassing, but its best to expose them to the air and let your immune system deal with them.;
, Applying a warm washcloth or flannel compress to your boil helps to rupture and drain it because the heat expands the blood vessels underneath the skin and increases blood and lymph flow.The warmth may also help sooth the pain, even though its promoting local inflammation. Soak a clean washcloth in water and put it in the microwave for between 30-45 seconds. Apply the warm compresses to the affected area several times daily (for about 20 minutes at a time) until the boil starts to naturally drain and shrink.


Be sure to wash and rinse the towel once you are done to avoid spreading the infection, although microwaving it will likely kill any bacteria anyway.
Make sure the cloth from the microwave doesn't scald your skin and make the problem worse.

, Tea tree oil is a natural antibiotic/antiseptic commonly used to treat skin infections — it's extracted from the leaves of the Australian tea tree.Tea tree oil may help get rid of boils because it has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, although the degree to which it can absorb deep into the skin is not well understood.It's also useful for preventing the spread of the bacteria once the boil has burst. Use a clean swab, dip it into the tea tree oil and then lightly dab your boil three to five times daily. Keep it away from your eyes as it might sting.


Tea tree oil can trigger allergic reactions in some people (it's rare), so stop applying it if you notice the skin around the boil is getting irritated and puffy.
Other natural antibiotics that have similar effects to tea tree oil include: olive leaf extract, oregano oil, lavender, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar, and iodine solution.

, Once the boil bursts on its own, promote drainage by lightly putting some pressure on the edges with clean absorbent tissues. Don't be surprised if you see quite a bit of pus and blood come out of a boil — it's typically much more compared to a large pimple.Soak as much of the blood and pus up as possible, dispose of the tissue, then thoroughly clean the area with antibiotic wipes. Boils aren't contagious, but the bacteria within them can be.


The boil may continue to ""weep"" (slowly drain) for a few hours, so consider dabbing it with some antibiotic cream or lotion and then covering it with a small bandage overnight.
Exposing the draining boil to some fresh air and sunlight will promote healing, but too much sun can burn the damaged tissue and leave a discolored spot for many weeks or months.
Keep applying warm compresses for a few days after the boil has opened to help drain it as much as possible. Remember to always use clean compresses.

, Most boils are caused by ingrown hairs or by splinters or debris getting lodged in the skin.In otherwise healthy people with strong immune systems, the boils get resolved and fade away within a few weeks. However, if your boil persists for more than a few weeks (or is chronically occurring) and involves severe pain, swollen lymph nodes, fevers / chills and/or loss of appetite, then call your family doctor and have it examined. Large boils (greater than 2 inches in diameter) should also be looked at by your doctor.Boils are not considered very serious, but other more serious conditions that can look similar include skin cancer, allergic reactions, wasp or bee stings, diabetic abscess, MRSA, herpes outbreak, and chicken pox.
Applying antibiotic cream (Neosporin, Bacitracin, Polysporin) on boils often is ineffective because it doesn't penetrate deep enough into the skin to reach the bacteria., If your doctor confirms the skin lesion is a boil and not something more serious, then he/she might recommending lancing it if you've been dealing with it for more than a few weeks, or if it's particularly large or painful. Lancing is a minor in-office procedure in which the doctor applies a local anesthetic and then makes a small incision into the tip of the boil to release the pus and promote drainage.The doctor will then bandage it up and send you home with basic cleaning instructions. Lancing by your doctor is always a much safer alternative to popping the boil at home yourself.


In some cases, large, deep skin infections that can't be completely drained by lancing may be packed with sterile gauze to help soak up additional pus.
Depending on the size of the boil, lancing it may leave a small scar on your skin. This may be a concern if the boil is on your face, so weigh your options with your doctor carefully.

, Antibiotic medications are seldom needed to deal with boils, although your doctor may prescribe them if the infection is severe enough or reoccurring.For people with multiple or recurrent boils, antibiotics are usually prescribed by mouth for 10 or 14 days.In particularly severe cases, two different antibiotics may be prescribed, plus the use of strong antibiotic ointments to be applied to the skin throughout the day.


Overuse of antibiotics during the last few decades has created many resistant bacterial strains that can be life-threatening. If you develop a boil or other type of infection while in the hospital for a different ailment, then tell your care givers immediately.
Side effect of antibiotics include destruction of ""friendly"" bacteria in your intestines, which can lead to poor digestion, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and nausea.Allergic reactions, rashes and breathing difficulty are also relatively common with antibiotic use.

Make sure you don’t have an infection.,
Sign the consent form.,
Clean and shave the operative area.,
Take an anxiolytic drug as prescribed by the doctor.,
Do not eat anything after midnight the night before your procedure.",How to Prepare for a Kidney Biopsy2," Examine the skin of your abdomen and back-- they should be free from infection. If you do have a skin infection, the needle used for the procedure may carry microorganisms inside the body and your kidney may get infected this way.Common signs of skin infection are redness, itching, pain, and discharge of pus. An open wound is likely to get infected.
You may also need to provide a blood or urine sample to detect if you have an infection., Your doctor will inform you about the whole procedure, along with the risks and benefits of the biopsy. Then you will need to sign the consent form just like with any surgery.Consent is usually required due to the risk of bleeding and infection, or due to the risk for disability or death.


Make sure that you understand all risks associated with the procedure before signing the consent form.

, You need to shave any hair on your back and abdomen. Doing this will make the procedure easier for the surgeon. A clean surface will provide a good view of the target area and will reduce the risk of infection.


Take a shower and wash the area thoroughly with soap after you shave. You will want to be as germ free as possible.

, Most people get anxious before getting a simple injection, let alone having surgery. Anxiolytic drugs such as bromazepam or lorazepam will greatly reduce this fear or anxiety. Take it as prescribed by your doctor. If you do not want to take medication for your anxiety try these other relaxation techniques:Cleansing, deep breaths may help you to relax if you’re feeling anxious. Slowly breathe in through your nose and hold for two seconds, then release your breath slowly out of your mouth. Repeat five times. Perform this breathing technique before you go to bed and on the morning of the procedure. Doing some deep breathing will stimulate your parasympathetic nervous system and help you to relax.
Meditation is also a way to relieve anxiety. Close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful place. Focus for a few minutes and concentrate on slowing your breathing down. This can be done the night before and in the morning before you leave your home.

, You’ll most likely be put on NPO status, which is the medical term for “nothing by mouth” the night before the procedure. It’s important for your stomach to be empty to prevent aspiration during the procedure. Aspiration happens when stomach content enters the respiratory tract causing problems such as pneumonia."
"
Take any medication if needed.,
Do not take insulin in the morning if you are an insulin user.,
Arrange for someone to drive you home.",How to Prepare for a Kidney Biopsy3," Because you are not allowed to eat anything the morning before the procedure, take sips of water with your medication. This will help make the pills go down easier. Do not eat food of any kind the morning before your procedure.

, Taking insulin may reduce your blood sugar level too much, making the biopsy difficult. Instead, you will be given short acting insulin with a saline infusion to keep your sugar level optimum., After your kidney biopsy, you will be able to return home that day. However, you may remain drowsy throughout the day because of the anesthetic and any sedative drug you may have received. Because of this, you will need to arrange for someone to drive you home, as driving yourself could be dangerous."

Eat few to no carbs for the next month or two.,
Adjust your life accordingly.",How to Overcome Carbohydrate Addiction with a Detox," Setup for this detox is somewhat costly, but is a fraction of what you would pay for a commercial detox kit. This total setup will cost you anywhere between $100 and $200 in most cases. It might seem expensive, but compare it to detox kits that take up to three times as long and cost over $500 (refer to the list below).;
, This detox is an intensive three to five day cleanse. Most people will only need 3 days (i.e. the “3-day hump”) to be ready to take on a low-carb diet. Depending on your weight, your usual carb intake, and your activity level, the detox will take up to 5 days.


It is recommended to start this detox over the weekend, and take off from work on Monday. Starting with Saturday, you should be okay by Monday night. If you can’t afford to miss a lot of work, or your school schedule gets in the way, you could be a warrior and tough it out (not recommended, but do as you wish), or wait until you have a three-day block of time.

, It is an abominable process. It’s three straight days of raw vegetables, green tea, and going to the bathroom. It’s not going to be fun, which is why it is advisable not to go to school or work while it is happening, due to its side effects.


Don’t be scared by the side effects! That’s just your body adjusting to the changes. You’ll be fine!
The side effects you are likely (but not guaranteed) to experience include, nausea, some vomiting (not much), diarrhea, drowsiness, dizziness, and fatigue. Sounds pretty gruesome, right? Everything has side effects, and detoxes are no exception, but the health benefits of this one are worth the three days of being sick.

, It’s important to know how to take your detox and vitamin supplements. The detox is to help speed up the process of going to the bathroom, and the vitamin is to make sure your body’s vitamin levels don’t drop too significantly, due to the lack of certain foods. Make sure you take your detox as instructed, to assure its effectiveness.

, You’re going to want to go a little crazy on carbs two or three days before you start the detox regimen. Don’t go too crazy, but keep the simple sugars high. Eat a chocolate bar, or a few cookies, or something similar. Your detox will be very difficult if you’ve gone a week without simple sugars, and this detox doesn’t need to be any harder than it already is.

, If you are using a protein supplement, drink only one serving in the morning, mixed with water.

, Drink one cup of your green tea with your first meal, one with lunch, and one in the evening, at least three or four hours before bed.

,, The point is to get off of carbs. While healthy, fruits contain lots of natural sugars, and those are bad for a detox. To put it simply, if it’s not green, don’t eat it. Eat about four or five times a day, and eat enough to be full sufficiently.

, Drinking too much water will lead to too much urination, which will lead to excessive vitamin expulsion. Don’t drink copious amounts of water, though.

, Get a solid seven to eight hour sleep per night of the detox, as well as the night before you start the detox. Granted, you should be getting eight hours anyway, but doing this will greatly dampen the severity of the side effects.

, Some people experience every side effects; some experience none – it’s based on you and your body. Here are a few tips to make it a little easier on you:


Turn down the brightness on your computer/phone/TV, as not to make your headaches worse. The withdrawal headaches are migraine-like, so you’ll probably be sensitive to bright lights and loud noises.
Stay away from painkillers. While using painkillers might help a bit, they only treat pain; they’re not withdrawal medications. They probably won’t help you too much, so there’s no point in wasting them. If the pain is extremely severe, then you can try them to see if it works.
Don’t exercise. This detox is nauseating and dizzying, and the last thing you need is to pass out or vomit in the gym. It can wait until the detox is over.
Sleep a lot. If the pain gets too unbearable, or you’re too dizzy or drowsy to do anything, just sleep it off for an hour or two. Just be sure to be up in time for your next meal.

, Congratulations, you did it! Now, continue with your detox pills’ instructed usage. They’re usually for anywhere between a week and two weeks in total. It is advisable to stick to the shorter option, but that’s completely up to you. It’s also beneficial to continue your multivitamin because hey, it’s good for you.

, The only carbs you should be eating for the next month or two should come from a serving or two of fruit/berries during the day. Your diet should consist of mostly lean meats and fish, and green vegetables.


A small serving red meat is okay, but stick to your white meats and fish. Red meat isn't significantly unhealthy contrary to popular belief, but it isn’t easy to pass when going to the bathroom, which is something you’re going to be doing a lot of for the next bit of time. Make sure to eat four or five times a day, as well.
Your protein intake needs to be very high, because your body will be using that and healthy fats for energy. Carb-free protein powders are ideal for this (assuming they’re mixed in water), as well egg whites, and a serving of almonds everyday will help give you the fats you need.
As far as preparing your food goes, stay away from frying anything in oils, stay away from butter, and stay away from egg yolks. Cholesterol levels are sensitive during low-carb diets, so getting too much of them isn't good.

, A common question is about cheating on this diet. How often can you cheat? In the beginning, the answer is never. For at least one solid month, you cannot cheat at all.


After losing some weight via diet and exercise, cheating once every week or two is alright, but only then. You will also need to come to grits with the fact that, from now on, you may not be able to exceed 100 carbohydrates a day, complex or otherwise.
Understand that carb addiction is scarily similar to opiate addiction, and going overboard could quite actually lead to a relapse.
Once you’ve lost a significant amount of weight, and you’re ready to put on muscle, or start a more balanced diet, you can allow yourself 100 to 150 complex carbs a day, and see how it goes. If you notice yourself getting more and more carb-craving, slow it back down.
Despite these new challenges, you are now a healthier (and most likely lighter) person than you have ever been! Good for you!

Learn about the procedure.,
Know what to expect.,
Understand different procedures.,
Ask questions.",How to Prepare for an Endoscopy1," An endoscopy can serve several purposes. Your doctor might advise an endoscopy to investigate symptoms such as nausea or vomiting. If your doctor recommends an endoscopy, take time to learn why.In addition to investigating digestive symptoms, your doctor might use the endoscopy to collect tissue samples. This is also known as a biopsy.
Tissue samples can help your doctor to diagnose your condition. The tissue samples can be tested for diseases such as anemia and certain cancers.
If your doctor suggests this procedure, you do not need to immediately be alarmed. It is a common procedure and used to diagnose many conditions.;
, Talk to your doctor about what the procedure entails. You can also ask him to provide additional resources, such as pamphlets or useful web sites. If you know what to expect, you will feel more comfortable about having the procedure.You will be awake during an endoscopy, however you will also be slightly sedated with a rapid onset and short duration medication. It is a same day procedure that takes place in a doctor's office or exam room.
During the procedure, you will lie down either on your back or side. Your doctor may give you a sedative to help you relax.
The endoscope, which includes a small camera, will be inserted into your mouth. Your doctor will extend the scope down into your esophagus so that the camera can capture images.
Your doctor might use other small tools to gather the tissue samples. You will not be able to talk during the procedure, but you will be able to breathe and make sounds.

, It is important to understand that there are actually two common types of endoscopy. One is the upper endoscopy and the other is a colonoscopy. Make sure to clarify with your doctor which type of procedure you need.Your doctor will use an endoscopy to view the upper digestive tract, or a colonoscopy to view the lower digestive tract.
The upper endoscopy is the procedure where the scope is inserted through the mouth. It will allow your doctor to look at the small intestines and stomach in addition to the esophagus.
During a colonoscopy, the camera is attached to a flexible tube inserted through the rectum. This procedure allows your doctor to examine the large intestine, colon, and rectum.
Both procedures are used to diagnose disease and investigate symptoms. Both are common, same day procedures.

, You may be disconcerted if your doctor recommends an endoscopy. It is normal to be nervous about undergoing a new procedure. Take time to ask your doctor several questions about his recommendation.Gain an understanding of why you need the procedure. Try saying, ""What, specifically, makes you think this procedure is necessary for me?""
You can also ask about the procedure itself. You might say, ""Can you tell me if it will hurt?""
Ask your doctor about possible side effects. You can also ask how regularly he performs the procedure.
Feel free to take notes. You might hear some unfamiliar medical terms and want to write down what they mean.

Stop taking certain medications.,
Fast before the procedure.,
Be mindful of your needs.,
Follow your doctor's orders.",How to Prepare for an Endoscopy2," There are several things you will need to do to physically prepare for your endoscopy. Some medications might interfere with the procedure or the results. Make sure your doctor is aware of all medications that you are taking.If you are on blood thinners, you will need to stop taking them several days prior to the procedure. These medications could increase your risk of bleeding during the endoscopy.
You may need to stop taking your blood pressure medication for a few days. Ask your doctor about the specific dosage you are taking.
Discuss supplements with your doctor. If you take vitamins or natural medications, make sure that your doctor has that information.
Always make sure that you get specific instructions from your doctor before you stop taking any medications that you are currently on.

, The point of an upper endoscopy is to allow your doctor to examine your upper GI tract. To get a clear picture, your system needs to be free of food and drink. It is necessary to fast before the procedure.Do not eat any solid food for 8 hours before your endoscopy. You should also avoid chewing gum during this period.
Do not drink any liquids for 8 hours before the endoscopy. Ask your doctor if you may have a small amount of water.
If you smoke, avoid doing so for at least 6 hours prior to the procedure. It can interfere with the results.

, Take your medical history into consideration as you prepare for your endoscopy. For example, if you have asthma, take your inhaler with you. You won't be able to use it during the procedure, but you might want it before or after the endoscopy.Make sure to empty your bladder. Going to the bathroom before the procedure will help you feel more comfortable.
Know that the procedure will take about 30-45 minutes. If you wear corrective lenses, think about whether you would be more comfortable in your contacts or glasses.
Remove any uncomfortable jewelry. You will wear a gown for the procedure, but bring comfortable clothes to wear home.
Make sure that you arrange for someone to take you home after the procedure. You will have some lingering effects from the sedation and you may not feel well.

, Make sure that you follow your doctor's instructions very carefully. It is important that you are mindful of the policies regarding fasting and stopping medications. Ask your doctor to write down all of the instructions so that you don't forget anything.Take some time to go over your medical history with your doctor. Make sure that he is aware of any pre-existing conditions.
For example, maybe you are diabetic or have heart disease. Make sure your doctor takes that into account when giving you instructions.
Enlist a family member or friend. They can help make sure you obey the rules before your procedure.

Plan your recovery.,
Find someone to help you.,
Anticipate side effects.,
Be prepared to get your results.",How to Prepare for an Endoscopy3," For most people, you will not feel any significant physical discomfort after your endoscopy. However, it is important to remember that you will be taking a sedative for the procedure. It might take a while for that medication to wear off.You might feel perfectly fine after the procedure. But you might be less alert than you realize.
For many people, a sedative can impair judgement and delay reaction time. Avoid making any major decisions for 24 hours after your procedure.
Plan to take the day off work. You will likely be physically capable of working, but your mind not be working as fast as usual. Take a break.

, Because of the sedative, you should not drive after your endoscopy. Ask a friend or family member to drive you home. You can also ask them to be there for you during the procedure.Be honest about your needs. Try saying, ""I'm having a minor procedure, but I'm a bit nervous. Would you mind being on site for moral support?""
Choose someone responsible. You want to know that the person you ask to give you a ride home will show up on time.

, Most people do not suffer from any complications during or after an endoscopy. However, as with any procedure, there are risks.Talk to your doctor about possible side effects. Ask him to tell you symptoms to look for.
There are several indicators to look for. If you have a temperature or stomach ache in the 48 hours following your procedure, make sure to contact your doctor.
Difficulty breathing and vomiting are also signs of distress. Call your doctor if you experience these symptoms.

, Your doctor may be able to give you some initial results immediately. For example, he can tell you if there are any obvious signs of damage. Your doctor might discuss these findings with you after the procedure.Remember that the sedative might impair your concentration. Depending on how you feel, your doctor might wait to discuss his findings.
Some tests will take longer to complete. If your doctor collected tissue, these samples will likely need to be sent to a lab.
It may take several days to get some of your results. Ask your doctor for a clear timeline about when you can expect some answers.

For example, a diaper bag offers a good amount of storage space.
You can also choose from school backpacks, “over the shoulder” messenger bags, or a variety of other items.;
, Focus on lightweight clothing; hospitals maintain a controlled temperature, so it’s unlikely that you’ll need heavy jackets or gloves.Bring comfortable pajamas or lounging clothes.
If you’re concerned about getting cold, bring a variety of layers. For example, a t-shirt, flannel shirt, and a cardigan or light sweater should keep you warm during the evening.

A list of all current medications, including dosage and frequency
Birth certificate
Medical insurance card
Hospital forms — check with the office staff to see if you can fill them out ahead of time
Eyeglasses, writing pen and paper in case you would like to jot something down

, Although the doctors and staff at the hospital will be able to give you medications as needed, you should also pack any medications that you regularly take. This should include any prescription medication you currently take.


Plan to pack any over-the-counter medications that you have been taking (with approval by your doctor). You may not be allowed to take them, but it is still important to bring them just in case.
For example, pack Pepto Bismol if you have stomach virus, and an inhaler if you have asthma.

, If you’re going to be leaving the hospital with a baby, bring a few newborn-size outfits.The hospital will have an undershirt for your baby, but you may want to bring the baby home in more substantial—and personal—clothing.


Bring two or three different sizes of newborn clothing, since you won’t know ahead of time the exact size of your infant
Also bring scratch mittens, socks or booties, a hat, and a baby blanket
Don't forget the car seat — make sure you make all of the adjustments before you get your infant into the car
Also consider bringing a pacifier for your infant

, Both of these are necessary, even for the (potentially) short time you and your infant will be at the hospital post-birth. Pack several infant-sized diapers for your baby’s bathroom needs, and breastfeeding-specific bras and pads for yourself (or your the mother, if you are just helping out).When packing, make sure to include:


Three comfortable nursing bras
A packet of breast pads (to contain minor leaking)
Spare underwear (consider bringing pairs that you consider disposable)

, This is a typically brief document which describes — in detail — the specifics of how you would like to give birth. Give the birth plan to the attending caregivers or nurses.This way, if you are asleep or on pain medication, the nurses will still follow your plan for giving birth. Your birth plan should include specifics detailing:


Do you want to be offered pain relief? If so, what type?
Whom do you want present in the room during labor?
If you have a boy, would you like him circumcised?

, The majority of your time in the hospital will be spent killing time and waiting for doctors or test results. Plan accordingly to keep yourself from getting too bored while you wait.Pack a book or eReader if you plan to spend time reading.


Pack something like a notepad and pencil if you’d like to keep a journal or list of your thoughts.
Bring magazines, a deck of cards, or a book of puzzles, like Sudoku or crosswords.
Focus on packing as few objects or devices as possible. Bringing a Kindle would be more efficient than packing a dozen books.

, These tend to get overlooked in the rush of packing — while the hospital should have a shower or sponge-bath available for you, you should also bring your own personal products. Hospital will have basic hygiene items if you forget them, but they will add a charge to your bill for these.These can include:


Deodorant
Dental care products (toothbrush, paste, and floss)
Feminine care products (pads or tampons)
Hair care products (shampoo, conditioner, headband, comb or brush, etc.)
Chapstick or lip balm
Makeup

, Especially if you’re going to spend more than a week in the hospital, you can avoid homesickness and bolster yourself emotionally if you bring mementos of home.Pack some photos of you and your family at home. A group shot that includes every family member may be especially emotionally comforting. (Make sure this photo has some type of backup copy where you can make a duplicate of it, should it get lost.)

, Although the hospital will have pillows available for your use, you may find your own pillow to be more comfortable and comforting.A small stuffed animal or personal blanket can have the same comforting effect.

, Although the hospital will bill your for large, medical expenses, you’ll need cash for minor day-to-day expenses. Plan to bring $20 – 40 cash.This will be useful for buying coffee, newspapers, and items from vending machines.
Avoid bringing credit cards — or any type of valuables — as these items can be easily stolen., Although hospitals have kitchens and vending machines, you may want to avoid eating the sometimes notorious hospital food by eating out of your own bag.In these cases, it’s best to bring nonperishable foods that that provide nutrition, without much sugar.


If you want to bring any fruit or cheese, make sure to have a cooler and ice.

, If you need to work through your hospital stay, it’s OK to bring your computer or a folder of papers to the hospital with you.Working at the hospital may also take your mind off of any health concerns you’re experiencing.


Likewise, if you are a student and have work due soon, bring a textbook or two with you, so you can stay on top of your homework deadlines.
If you bring a charger for your computer, make sure to call ahead and ask the hospital if you’ll need a special adapter for the hospital’s power outlets.

Choose your friends wisely.,
Help your friends avoid drugs and bad decisions.,
Ask questions and learn the answers.,
Remember that so-called ""soft drugs"" are drugs, too.",How to Not Do Drugs1," True friends would not endanger another friend's life by pressuring them to use drugs. You might ask: How can I choose a good friend? Simple. Observe people and their habits before stepping up to be their friend. Make sure that they have morals and seem to be honest and have a good personality. That way before you become their friend you can already have an idea of what they are like.


True friends won't make you feel bad for staying away from drugs. True friends will respect you. They want to see you happy and successful. If one of your ""friends"" doesn't understand that drugs aren't right for you, you should probably reconsider whether they're actually one of your friends.;
, Tell them the simple steps they can take to avoid them, and tell them that you truly care about them. Also be open to your parents about drugs. If you cannot help yourself, they will surely help you.

, The more you ask questions about drugs, the harder it becomes to rationally use them. So be informed about drugs, what they do to people's bodies, and how they work. Knowledge is power.


Did you know that methamphetamine causes sores over the body, serious hallucinations, and a rotting of the teeth known as ""meth mouth""?Did you know that in America, 27% of HIV/AIDS carriers are heroin addicts?People who shoot heroin with a needle are at a significantly higher risk to develop a host of diseases, such as AIDS.
Did you know that after snorting or smoking cocaine, the user's heart attack risk grows to almost 24 times the normal amount?, Drugs like alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco, though they may be more socially accepted, can still be powerful drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 2.5 million people die because of alcohol each year.That's a lot of people, even though alcohol is legal in many places for adults. The point here is to remember that even soft drugs, or socially-accepted drugs, can be harmful.


Soft drugs are often talked about as ""gateway drugs."" Gateway drugs are drugs that, when tried, cause users to experiment with and abuse other drugs as a result.
What is clear is that alcohol, marijuana and tobacco can lead to abuse of other drugs. Although alcohol and tobacco may be legal and marijuana may not, be careful about using them so much that you start abusing other drugs.

"
Learn how to say ""no"" to drugs the right way.,
Learn to say ""no"" without feeling guilty.,
Think again about the possible long-term effects of drugs and alcohol.,
Respect yourself.",How to Not Do Drugs2," Telling people you don't want to do drugs can be a really hard thing to do. You want to be clear and not offend anyone. Take a little time to think about how you might say ""no"" to someone who tries to pressure you into trying drugs. Here are some examples to start you off:



""No, thanks. The way I'm going, I need all the brain cells I can get.""""Actually, I was just heading home. My parents asked me to look after my little sister. I'll see you guys tomorrow?""
""I'm starving. Let's go grab a bite to eat at my house instead.""

, Remember your reasons for saying ""no"" in the first place: You care about your health; you want to give yourself the best chance to succeed; your sights are set higher than petty distractions. If you remember all the reasons why drugs aren't right for you, you're less likely to feel guilty for saying ""no."" When you don't feel guilty, you're less likely to cave in to peer pressure.

, Like it or not, your whole entire life could be changed with one decision. Often, all it takes is one time before things go horribly wrong. Are you willing to bet your life that this time is going to be different?

, People who take drugs often don't respect themselves. They understand that they're hurting their body and hurting their family, but they're powerless to stop, and sometimes wouldn't want to because, deep down inside, they think they deserve it. (This is why many addicts need to go to therapy in order to help kick their addiction.) Once addicts begin to have more self-respect, they often clean up their habit.


In order to have self-respect, you need to know who you are. This is an incredibly liberating journey if you haven't taken it before. It's about loving yourself from the inside out. If you can achieve that, the most powerful drug in the world won't compare to the love you have for yourself.

Stay active with sports.,
Get outdoors and enjoy nature.,
Practice meditation, yoga, or Pilates.,
Eat the right kinds of food.",How to Not Do Drugs3," It's really hard to use drugs and be serious about sports at the same time. All that running and coordination and teamwork gets pretty hard when your body is sluggish and your mind is cloudy. Staying active with sports is therefore a great way to avoid the world of drugs in the first place. Not only this, but being active causes your body to release so-called endorphins, which make you feel better and relieve certain kinds of stress.Participate in team sports. These sports include soccer, American football, rugby, lacrosse, baseball, basketball, hockey, field hockey, badminton, cricket, volleyball, water polo, and more. Team sports teach participants about mutual respect, the value of working together, and self-sacrifice.
Participate in individual sports. These sports include: skiing, wrestling, skateboarding, bowling, golf, darts, chess, fencing, track and field, tennis, surfing, swimming, and more. Individual sports teach participants the value of grit, determination, and hard work.

, Perhaps the reason why many people turn to drugs is boredom. There's nothing much to do, so why not have some fun and experience excitement? While there are other cures for boredom, you can avoid becoming bored in the first place by going outside and enjoying nature, even if you don't play sports.


Find time to take a hike. Many urban or suburban neighborhoods are close to parks or nature reserves where you can go to experience a bit of the great outdoors. If you can't make it out of your urban area, go exploring in a safe place inside your city.

, So you may think that these three activities are for your parents, or washed-up hippies, but there's some value in connecting your brain and your body in a single exercise. All three of these activities strive to do this. The person who is more in touch with his or her body is less likely to abuse it by taking drugs.


There are several different kinds of meditation. Maybe the simplest meditation exercise is closing your eyes, breathing in and out deeply, and trying to gain awareness of each part of your body — all at once. This is sometimes called awareness mediation.
There are dozens upon dozens of kinds of yoga. There's Hatha yoga, Bikram yoga, Ashtanga yoga, Vinyasa yoga, not to mention many more. Explore different practices with different teachers. Each has its unique set of poses and breathing practices.
Pilates was developed by a German physical-culturist in the first half of the 20th century. It is a body condition routine that emphasizes core strength as well as spinal and pelvic alignment. Many Pilates enthusiasts report feeling much better after their workouts. When you feel good already, what's the use in taking drugs?

, What does food have to do with drugs? What you eat has an effect on how your body functions, and how well you feel. If you make a habit of eating junk food and treating your body like you don't care for it, it's not going to feel its best. If your body doesn't feel it's best, you'll be more motivated to lean on drugs as a crutch.


Doctors recommend filling your diet with fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and plenty of fiber. A diet rich in these foods will give your body the energy and nutrition it needs to keep you happy and drug-free.
Eat healthy fats instead of unhealthy ones. Healthy fats include omega-3 fatty acids (flax seed, salmon), as well as monounsaturated fats (avocados, pumpkin seeds).Unhealthy fats include trans fats (partially-hydrogenated oils) and saturated fats (animal fat, such as lard).
Drink water and unsweetened teas instead of colas and alcohol. There's nothing wrong with a Diet Coke or a glass of red wine every now and then. In fact, researchers believe that red wine, in moderation, may actually be good for you.But the majority of what you drink should be coming from water. Water will help you stay healthy and hydrated throughout the day.

Reduce the amount of sodium you eat.,
Run, bike, swim, or exercise for one hour a day, 3-5 times a week.,
Find times to relax each day.,
Eat healthy, smaller portions for each meal.",How to Naturally Reduce Blood Pressure1," You want to aim for less than 2300mg a day, preferably staying below 1500mg.There are some easy steps you can take to reduce your sodium intake right now:


Don't add salt to your meals. When possible, season your food yourself.
Stay away from processed and packaged foods. Fast-food is also notoriously high in sodium.
Purchase items with ""No-Added Sodium."" Many canned goods and vegetables have sodium added to help them stay fresh longer.;
, Regular exercise is essential to help control your blood pressure. Your goal is to raise your heart-rate for the entire time, so look for an activity that makes you sweat and breathe a little heavier. Even a long walk once a day is a great way to fight high blood pressure.


Find an exercise partner. You're both more likely to keep exercising regularly if you motivate each other.
When possible, take the stairs. Use the push-mower on the lawn, try a standing or treadmill desk, and find ways to incorporate movement into your everyday routine.

, High anxiety leads to higher blood pressure. Stress has a profound effect on your physical health, so you need to find ways to ""flick off the switch"" when you're home from work and ready to relax.


Make 15-30 minutes of ""me time"" each and every day. Close the door, turn off your phone, and sink into an activity all by yourself.
Pick up a good book or listen to music before bed. Take the time to shut out distractions and stress before sleeping.
Learn to say no to new responsibilities.
Use your vacation days. You'll be happier and more productive in the long term., A good diet will have lots of lean meats, like chicken, turkey, and fish, a variety of complex carbs like oats, quinoa, and whole wheat, and large servings of fruits and vegetables. You can eliminate sodium with ease, bringing your body to a happier, healthier blood pressure.


Wait 10-15 minutes before getting more food. Your body takes time to process the feeling of fullness, meaning you may keep eating even though you aren't really hungry.
Aim for at least one fruit and or vegetable at each meal. Potassium and Magnesium, found in natural foods, may help combat high blood pressure.Focus on healthy snacks, like hummus, fruit, carrots, low-sodium crackers, and yogurt. Snacking is when most people break from their healthy diets."

Look up a Needle Exchange Program (NEP) in your area.,
Find a fixed site.,
Locate a mobile unit.,
Check for needle vending machines.,
Find a pharmacy based NEP.,
Consider if you need the program.,
Get sterile needles.,
Return used needles.,
Take part in the testing programs.,
Consider the counseling programs.,
Look into the drug rehabilitation services.,
Make return visits.",How to Participate in Needle Exchange Programs," To look for an NEP in your area, do some research online. There are online databases that list NEPs in certain areas, and most organizations have their own websites to help with outreach. There are NEPs in 90 countries worldwide, so there may be one nearby.


You may also be able to ask your local doctor if he knows of a NEP in your area.
This will ensure that you find a legitimate program with proper equipment, facilities, and workers.;
, Many of the NEPs are run out of fixed sites, which are typically in areas known to have an active injected drug scene. The fixed sites are established locations for NEPs, with a staff that helps offer additional services to benefit IDUs.


These locations make it easier to provide healthcare, counseling, testing, education, and additional services to help prevent the spread of blood-borne diseases and take care of IDUs., If your area does not have a fixed site, look for a mobile unit. These mobile units operate from a bus or van, where the sterile needles are distributed through a window or door.


These units travel to areas where fixed sites cannot reach, such as rural areas or smaller cities. They also reach areas where the population of IDUs are not as large as the places for fixed sites.
Mobile units may also be affiliated with fixed site, so they act as an extension of these larger establishments.
There are some large scale mobile units, which offer a few additional services, such as disease testing., If you are not near a fixed site or have access to a mobile unit, check to see if there is a needle vending machine in your area. These are machines mounted on walls outside places where the other distribution services cannot reach and operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.


These machines work by giving out sterile needles after coins or tokens, which are typically given by outreach workers, are inserted into the machines.
These needles are sometimes accompanied by educational materials or other injected drug supplies., There are some countries that have NEPs that run out of pharmacies. These generally work in two ways, where they either sell needles to IDUs or exchange them for vouchers given out by outreach workers. An added benefit of pharmacy NEPs is that they are often located in areas with IDUs, meaning there is more access to them.


Pharmacy NEPs work similar to fixed sites, but often have better hours.
One major problem with them is that they are not common in low income countries. They also rarely offer education or healthcare services., NEPs are important for the prevention of blood-borne diseases among IDUs. NEPs have helped lower the transmission of HIV/AIDS by a large degree. These programs have also helped cut down considerably on the number of used needles freely available to other IDUs.


People who utilize NEPs are also five times more likely to enter drug prevention programs., Once you find the NEP accessible in your area, you can start receiving your sterile needles. The site where you visit may also be able to give you access to other supplies that you need to safely inject the drugs.


The World Health Organization suggests that each IDU gets 200 sterile needles per year., When you visit the site to get sterile needles, turn in your used needles. This will help prevent others from using your needles and get contaminated needles off the street., If you are a frequent injected drug user, you should get tested. If you have ever shared a needle with another IDU, you are at risk for blood-borne illnesses. Most fixed sites and many mobile units offer testing for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, and other blood-borne diseases.


If you aren't tested, you are also at risk of spreading diseases you don't know you have to sexual partners or loved ones.Common symptoms of HIV include a flu-like illness 2-4 weeks after infection. These flu-like symptoms can include fever, chills, night sweats, rash, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and mouth ulcers.Common symptoms of HIV/AIDS include rapid weight loss; recurring fever; profuse night sweats; intense fatigue; swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, neck, or neck; diarrhea that lasts longer than a week; sores on the mouth, anus, or genitals; pneumonia; blotches underneath the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids; and memory loss, depression, or other neurological disorders.Common symptoms of hepatitis C include dark urine, jaundice, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and stomach pain.Common symptoms of hepatitis B include abdominal pain, dark urine, fever, joint pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, weakness and fatigue, and jaundice.If you have any of these symptoms of think you might have been exposed to one of these illnesses, get tested immediately.

, Many fixed sites and some mobile units offer counseling to IDUs. The workers in these places can offer you advice about how to avoid overdoses, minimize the damage done by injected drugs, and practice safe injection habits.


If you already have a blood-borne disease, NEPs often have counseling services that can help you deal with your particular situation., Many IDUs are not at a place where they want help, or they may not have an avenue for help. If you are trying to stop using injected drugs, NEPs can offer help.


They can help you get in touch with rehabilitation facilities or drug treatment programs, such as opioid substitution therapy (OST)., You should go back to your NEP often in order to keep yourself healthy. If you continue to use injected drugs, you will need access to sterile needles so you are not infected with a blood-borne disease.


You can also keep up with testing and access other healthcare offered by the NEP."

Aim to eat less than 1500mg of sodium per day.,
Use spices to season food instead.,
Choose foods with ""low sodium"" labels.,
Substitute high sodium foods with lower-sodium options.,
Find alternative snack options.,
Cut back on sodium gradually.",How to Naturally Reduce Blood Pressure2," Some days, it may not be possible but you should definitely not have more than 2300 mg a day.Table salt is 40% sodium, so this equates to about ½ tsp of salt.
Try to avoid foods with more than 200mg of sodium per serving
Generally, processed foods with long shelf lives have higher sodium contents than fresh or plant-based foods.

, If you get creative with the spices and flavourings you add into a dish, you can decrease your intake of condiments and salt that have high concentrations of sodium.Some examples of low sodium alternatives include:



Herbs: basil, bay leaf, cilantro, dill weed, parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, tarragon, and marjoram.

Spices: cinnamon, cloves, curry powder, ginger, mace, and nutmeg.

Seasonings: chives, garlic, lemon, dried or chopped onions, and vinegar.

, However, not all ""low sodium"" labels mean there is no sodium or low levels of it. For example, a food labeled as “reduced sodium” is not necessarily low in sodium but just has less sodium than it used to have. Here is a list of common sodium claims and their meanings:Sodium-free or salt-free: each serving contains 5 mg of sodium at most.

Very-low sodium: each serving contains 6 to 35 mg sodium.

Low sodium: each serving contains 36 to 140 mg sodium.

Light or lite in sodium: each serving contains 50% of the regular version’s sodium quantity. Some of these products might still be high in sodium.

Reduced or less sodium: each serving contains 75% of the regular version’s sodium quantity. Some of these products might still be high in sodium.

Unsalted or no salt added: no salt has been added during the processing of a food that normally contains salt. Some of these products might still be high in sodium.

, You can often find lower-sodium options for certain foods that don't change the taste, texture, or the shelf life of a food. For example, canned and frozen peas can be used interchangeably in most recipes. Yet, canned peas have 3 times more sodium than frozen peas.


Generally, processed foods have more sodium than their fresh version.
Generally, foods with long shelf lives have more sodium than their shorter lived counterparts.
Restaurants rarely know exactly how much sodium or salt is in a dish. Research how to make the dish yourself, or look up the sodium content of the ingredients.

, Snacks are the enemies of most low-sodium diets, especially salty snacks. If you like snacking, try eating different flavours with less sodium or make your own, healthier versions of your favourite snack.


Incorporate fruits and vegetables as snacks. If you like to munch on crunchy snacks, try eating carrots. If you like sweet snacks, try apples or plums.
Try healthy snacks that are bursting with flavour. For example, frozen berries are great in the summer, especially in yogurt.
Try the non-salty version of a snack, or make it at home. For example, nuts are often available unsalted. While popcorn made from scratch without salt has a much lower sodium count than popcorn bought from a store.

, Change is slow to happen, slower to notice, and even slower to become your default lifestyle. The key is to create achievable, realistic expectations for yourself. Go at a pace that you are confident in.


Cut out foods one at a time. If your diet is high in salt and sodium, it might take a couple of weeks to transition into a diet lower in salt and sodium, and maybe months before you are happy and used to these changes.
Manage cravings. If you cut out too many foods too fast, or stop consuming a food your body is accustomed to, you will probably experience a craving for that food. Try to eat a healthier version of the food, but if needed, decide to eat a reasonably sized portion to satisfy your craving.

Eat 4,700 mg of potassium each day.,
Include more vitamin D in your diet.,
Drink less caffeine.,
Drink less alcohol.,
Avoid cigarette smoking.,
Keep a food diary.",How to Naturally Reduce Blood Pressure3," Potassium counters the effects of sodium. Eat foods that contains high levels of potassium, like fruits and vegetables, or use vitamin and mineral supplements. Some examples of potassium-rich foods are:


Bananas: 422mg
Baked potato with skin: 738mg
Orange juice: 496mg
Low-fat yogurt: 540mg

, Research shows that people with higher levels of vitamin D have lower blood tension.Include vitamin D by:


Getting some sun. Sunlight is loaded with vitamin D and about 20 to 25 minutes of sunlight a day can become highly beneficial.
Eating fish like salmon, trout, mackerel, tuna, or eel. Fish is also a great source of omega-3 fatty acids which is beneficial for your heart health.
Eating dairy products like low-fat yogurt and milk. However, avoid cheese which is higher in fat and sodium.

, Caffeine can increase blood pressure in people who rarely consume caffeine and especially in people who are already diagnosed with hypertension. Caffeine creates a big jump in the stiffness of arteries, causing the heart to pump harder which increases blood pressure.To see if caffeine affects your blood pressure, drink a caffeinated beverage and check your blood pressure within 30 minutes. If your blood pressure has increased 5 to 10 mmHg, then caffeine likely causes an increase in your blood pressure. Confirm with your doctor.
Although most researchers believe coffee increases blood pressure, there is also research that says if you consume caffeine regularly, lowering your caffeine intake does not seem to lower your blood pressure.

, In very small quantities, alcohol can lower your blood pressure. However, drinking more than moderate amounts can raise your blood pressure and reduce the effectiveness of many blood pressure medications.


Different people have different alcohol limits. Ask your doctor how much you should drink.
Drink alcoholic drinks that are lower in sodium and salt than others.

, Smoking a cigarette will increase your blood pressure for a few minutes, and smoking is also very bad for your health overall. If you smoke cigarettes, your body will be less equipped in general to maintain health, as well as experiencing spikes in your blood pressure. Many people smoke cigarettes to handle stress, so it is important to find an alternative stress reliever.


Cigarette smoking can lead to health complications that will also cause you stress and limit your lifestyle.
Cigarettes are expensive, and heavily taxed in some areas. They can cause financial stress to some people with tight budgets.
In some cultures and cities, there is a social stigma against cigarette smoking. Experiencing pushback for smoking from your friends or coworkers can cause you stress.

, This will make you more aware of the food you are consuming. Record quantities as well as what kind of foods you eat. You might be surprised by how much, or little, of one food you eat.


Write down everything you eat, how much, and when you eat.
After you have this food diary for a week or so, reread your entries and see if you are happy with what food you are eating.
If there are any meals, snacks, or food items that you think you should cut out, do so.
Keep up the food diary and use it as a source of information about your diet.

Create an exercise routine with the help of your doctor.,
Do your everyday chores.,
Do fun activities with others.,
Use your feet to go from place to place.,
Get creative.",How to Naturally Reduce Blood Pressure4," Devise an exercise regimen that fits into your lifestyle, schedule, and blood pressure concerns. It is important that you create a realistic exercise plan, because your blood pressure will rise again if you stop exercising.


Your doctor will be able to tell you your target weight and size for your body which can become a goal to work towards. A body carrying extra weight puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels, so losing weight can help you maintain and control your blood pressure.Don’t quit. If it helps, think of your exercise like a prescription: the doctor ordered that you walk for X minutes, just like the doctor might order you to take a pill.
Be honest about your schedule, lifestyle, and motivations. Do you really have time to walk 40 minutes? Can you afford to subscribe to a gym membership? If not, there are still many alternative ways to get active for free, with little time and space. Ask if your doctor knows what other patients have found successful.

, You might not realize it, but doing your daily activities and moving around the house are significant ways to stay active. Most household chores are can be physically vigorous like:



Doing the laundry. Carrying weighty baskets of clothes and walking around and standing up lightly exercises your body.

Sweeping and mopping. You walk around while pushing a weight with your arms.

Doing garden or yard work. Depending on the activity, you might be planting, raking the leaves, collecting branches, or pulling out stubborn weeds.

Washing the car. Washing your car takes arm strength and endurance.

Moving furniture. A room in your home might need a mini-makeover or you might need to clean the floor underneath the couch. However, be careful moving heavy objects and avoid harming your body.

Doing the dishes by hand. Washing dishes while standing up doesn’t burn a lot of calories, but it can keep the extra weight off. Even loading and unloading the dish washer counts as exercise.

, Exercise can be fun and rewarding if you incorporate it with fun activities that you can do with your friends, family, or in groups.


Look into joining an exercise, fitness, or sports groups. For example, you can often find boot camps, yoga classes, or walkers and joggers who routinely meet at parks. There, you can meet new people with similar goals to motivate you to be active.
Find a fitness buddy. Most people find they stick to their exercise schedule more closely when they have a partner or buddy who is also trying to exercise. You can try to find someone who wants to run at around the same time and pace.

, When possible, try to walk, run, or bike to certain places instead of driving, taking the escalator or riding an elevator. One simple difference like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every day at work can help keep you from gaining weight.

, There are infinite ways to exercise beyond walking and running. Take a dance or aerobics class, join a local or company team for a sport, or start doing yoga and pilates at home. If you haven’t found the right regimen and schedule yet, look around online or at your local community for activities to do and ask your friends and family for suggestions. You will eventually find the right kind of exercise, but it might take some time to decide what you like most.


For example, you can use the playground as a gym instead of going to a fitness gym. You can exercise by walking up slides, hanging onto monkey bars, or climbing onto platforms. However, make sure you aren't disrupting children from playing on the playground. Use the park in the early mornings, during the school day, or late at night when children are least likely to be at the park.

Ask for a thyroid check.,
Ask for a urine test.",How to Obtain Iodine1," If you are concerned about your iodine levels and needs, ask for a check of your thyroid function. Iodine deficiencies can cause enlarged thyroid glands (goiter) and can often be corrected through dietary changes, medication, or iodine supplementation.;
, Excess dietary iodine is secreted in the urine, so iodine levels can be easily assessed through urine checks; some health professionals may request a series of checks to get a more accurate representation of your average iodine levels.


If you are deficient in urinary iodine, your health professional can recommend the best way to address the deficiency.

Get support.,
Practice gratitude.,
Know what triggers your stress.,
Make time to relax.,
Be with people you like.",How to Naturally Reduce Blood Pressure5," Changing your lifestyle is difficult and takes a long time, so trying to lower your blood pressure can cause stress. However, stress also raises blood pressure, so it is important to reach out for support and help when needed. Having support from your family, friends, workplace, and living space can help you manage stress and your blood pressure.


Ask your friends and family for support. You need the help of others around you to succeed. Eating healthy and working out can become fun social activities and having someone supportive encourage you or do it with you can help reduce stress. It can also help strengthen your relationship with whoever you choose to share this lifestyle change with.
Join a support group. Many support groups put fellow blood pressure patients in contact with one another. Ask your doctor or nurse if there is a group around you.
Get professional help. Health, social, and lifestyle changes can be very difficult at times. Contact a psychologist or therapist near you if applicable.

, Expressions of gratitude can help lower levels of stress. Many believe that there is a relationship between focusing on what you are thankful for, and having less stress in life.


Think of 3 things you are grateful for every day. You can do this before going to sleep, at dinner, or halfway through the day. You can do this out loud and with others, or only in your head to yourself.
Say thank you to people. After someone has done something nice for you, telling them that you appreciated them can not only make others feel good but can make you feel good as well.
Tell your loved ones why you love them. Showing people that you care and are grateful for them can make you less stressed. In addition, your loved ones are more likely to respond positively, and your relationship will be less stressful.

, For many people, there are certain things that happen that cause stress. Some people find it helpful to recognize in advance what events, things, or people cause them stress (called a “stress trigger”) and remove themselves from the situation.


Create a list of times when you get stressed, or what stresses you out.
Identify repeating or important factors: “my mother-in-law” or “when it’s 10pm and I still have the dishes to do.”
Decide how you want to handle these situations to avoid getting stressed. Often, people find it helpful to think of a reason or way to excuse themselves or ways to communicate with others about their stress in a situation.
Try to recognize when stressful events will happen such as looking for warning signs. You want to get good enough that you can anticipate your stress, and take action to avoid getting stressed. For example, if you become stressed when you still have dishes to do late at night, you can avoid your stress trigger by choosing to do the dishes right when you get home. Alternatively, you can ask someone else living with you to do the dishes earlier.

, It is easy to try to do too many things and overwork yourself. If you do not take time explicitly just to relax, you might increase your stress level. Make sure you unwind during the day to handle your stress and blood pressure.


Do something calming that you enjoy. This might include reading, watching TV, yoga, window-shopping, walking, or doing a crossword.
Do nothing. Some people consider meditation and focused breathing to be incredibly relaxing. Some also say meditation helps with control over their emotions and thoughts.

, Your social life is incredibly important to your happiness and health. Spend time around people you enjoy to have a good time and destress. Regardless of the activity, spending time with friends can help you relax.


Being alone or stuck in one environment can close your perspective about many things. Opening yourself up to new activities and spending time outside of where you are normally can give you a new outlook on life and lower you stress.

Make achievable goals.,
Find someone who will make changes alongside with you.,
Make a contingency plan.,
Have faith in your hard work.",How to Naturally Reduce Blood Pressure6," Creating difficult goals and failing to reach them can make you feel discouraged. By speaking to your doctor or health care professional, you can come up with a doable plan and stick to it. If your needs change over time, adjust your plan accordingly.


A common mistake of people who embark on changing their lifestyle or habits is expecting too much, too fast, and then becoming discouraged when their expectations are not met. Think realistically about what changes you can make, and in what time frame. Use numbers to calculate calories, sodium intake, hours of exercise or rest, and so on when possible.

, Eating is an inherently social thing, and light exercise can be a great socializing activity. Ask your family and friends to make some lifestyle changes with you to make your transition seem more feasible.


Even if family and friends do not want to eat the same food or exercise the same amount as you, they can still support your decisions and help encourage you to go to the gym, or to eat certain meals.
Start first with the changes that are easiest for everyone. For example, adding fresh fruits to everyone's diet is easier than eliminating a certain food all together. Or start with light walks around the neighbourhood before asking friends or family to go on marathons or to the gym.
Ask people you trust and are comfortable with for support. It can make changing your lifestyle less stressful if the people who support you are positive, encouraging, and non-judgemental.

, Some people try to motivate behaviour change by making a contract with themselves in case they fail. These contracts might promise something bad will happen if the person fails to uphold their end of the contract and encourage them to avoid the negative result. Some ways to incorporate contingency plans are:


Tell a friend what goals you will be working towards and ask them to make sure you complete them. For some, just telling someone you're planning to achieve something is a good enough contingency plan. By telling someone what your goals are, you are making yourself accountable to that person. You don't want to disappoint them by not completing your goals and you want to make them proud by working hard to achieve them.
Give yourself negative consequences for not completing your goals. For example, if you smoke regularly, you can tell yourself that for every cigarette you smoke, you have to put a money in a jar and donate that money to a charity or an organization that helps smokes quit. Or you could say to yourself, ""I’m working on having a healthier diet. If I cheat and have unhealthy snacks after dinner, I have to clean all the bathrooms in the house.”

, Permanent behavioural change is difficult to implement, and will not happen in a day, week, or even for months. There will be days when you don’t want to eat healthily, or when you don't exercised. The important thing is to remember that every little bit counts. Hard work and an honest relationship with your body will pay off in the future, even if it doesn’t seem like it at the moment.


Remind yourself of your goals and motivations.
Ask friends and family to help you reinforce your rules and goals even when you are unmotivated.
At the beginning, write a list of the reasons why you are doing this, or goals you hope to achieve. Reread this list when you start to feel unmotivated.

Eat table salt.,
Eat plenty of seafood.,
Buy enriched grain products.,
Get iodine through dairy and eggs.",How to Obtain Iodine2," Just over 1/2 teaspoon of iodized table salt throughout the day will provide adults with 100% of the recommended daily amount of iodine.

, If you dislike adding salt to your food, a single sheet of seaweed (for sushi or soup) or 3 ounces of cod, fish sticks, tuna, or shrimp can provide between 10% and 66% of your daily necessary intake of iodine. In some cases, seaweed can even contain incredibly large doses of iodine (up to 2000% or your daily need).

, Many cereals, breads, and other grains are enriched with iodine. A cup of enriched pasta and 2 slices of bread can together provide up to 50% of your daily iodine needs.

, Milk, eggs, cheese, ice cream, and yogurt can all be significant sources for dietary iodine.

Consult a health professional before beginning iodine supplements.,
Consider your supplement options.,
Take iodine supplements as directed.",How to Obtain Iodine3," Most people in developed nations do not need iodine supplements, even to treat iodine deficiency.


Your doctor or nurse may recommend that you attempt to reach sufficient iodine levels naturally through diet instead of through supplements. Health professionals can also examine your medication and supplement list to look for potential negative interactions that could occur if you begin iodine supplementation.

, Iodine supplements can come in the form of potassium iodide, sodium iodide, and kelp-based supplements. Discuss the optimal choice of a supplement form with a health professional.

, Most adults need about 150mcg of iodine daily. Pregnant women need up to 220mcg and breastfeeding women need up to 290mcg each day.


If you cannot achieve these levels through your daily diet due to allergies or dietary restrictions, consider an iodine supplement in consultation with your doctor or health adviser.

See a medical professional.,
Learn the symptoms of schizophrenia.,
Recognize that you might not be the best judge of your symptoms.",How to Minimize Symptoms of Schizophrenia1," Proper diagnosis of schizophrenia is essential to treating its symptoms. Schizophrenia is difficult to properly diagnose, because it shares qualities with a number of other mental health conditions. Ask your primary care physician for a referral to a psychiatrist, psychologist or other specialist who may be able to provide proper diagnosis.Average age of onset for schizophrenia is late teens to the early 20s for men, and late 20s to early 30s for women. Schizophrenia is rarely diagnosed in children younger than 12, or in adults over the age of 40.
It's difficult to diagnosis schizophrenia in teenagers. This is because the first signs of the illness include behaviors common among teens – avoiding friends, showing less interest in schoolwork, sleep problems and irritability.
Schizophrenia is a highly genetic condition. If you have a relative with schizophrenia, your chances of being diagnosed with the disorder are higher than for the typical population.African-Americans and Hispanic people may be more likely to be misdiagnosed. Try to find a health care provider who understands the way schizophrenia affects minority communities to ensure best treatment options.;
, To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a person doesn't need to have all of its symptoms. He must demonstrate at least two of these symptoms over a period of time. The symptoms must have a noticeable impact on the person's ability to function, and not be better explained by another cause, such as drug use.Delusions or hallucinations are the symptom most commonly associated with schizophrenia. Hallucinations can be either auditory or visual. These symptoms are often associated with psychotic episodes.
Disorganized speech is a function of a person's cognitive disorganization. The person may be difficult to understand, not be able to stay on a topic, or respond in ways that are confusing and irrational. He may use imaginary words, or speak in an entirely made-up language.
Disorganized behavior reflects the person's temporary loss of cognitive functioning due to schizophrenia. He may have difficulty completing a task, or persevere on a task beyond ordinary expectations.
Catatonic behavior can also be a symptom of schizophrenia. The person may sit for hours without speaking. He may appear unaware of his surroundings.
Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are often mistaken for depression. They include a lack of emotional expression, lack of pleasure in everyday activities, and/or talking less.
Many times, the person with schizophrenia is not troubled by these symptoms, resulting in resistance to treatment.

, One of the most challenging characteristics of schizophrenia is the difficulty in recognizing delusional thinking. Your thoughts, ideas, and perceptions may seem perfectly normal to you, while appearing delusional to others. This is often the source of a great deal of tension between the person with schizophrenia and his family and community.Almost half of all people diagnosed with schizophrenia have difficulty recognizing their delusional thinking. Therapy should address this lack of insight.
Learning to ask for help handling troubling or worrisome perceptions and other symptoms is central to living well with schizophrenia.

Get some answers.,
Make sure that your physical needs are going to be met.,
Pack for the visit.,
Plan ahead.,
Continue to communicate your concerns.,
Have faith.,
Keep as fit as you can.",How to Mentally Prepare for Surgery," You may feel more confident about the surgery if you understand what is being done and why it is needed. Once you understand this better, try to explain the procedure to friends and family; talking about it and explaining what is going to happen to others can be a valuable way of boosting your confidence and helping you to feel more assured about what is going to be happening.;
, Once you understand what the surgery entails and you are sure you’re getting the surgery, you can start to prepare for the effects.


How will the surgery effect your life afterwards?
How long will it take you to recover from the surgery?
What can you and can’t you do before and after your surgery? For how long?


These are the sorts of questions you should be sure that you have the answers to before you start anything else, as these will help you to properly prepare, and being prepared will make you feel more confident and comfortable with the surgery in general.







, Once you have the answers to your questions you can pack – think about how long you’re going to be in the hospital and what sorts of things you’re going to want. You may want clean clothes, books, spectacles (if you require them) and so on. Take anything you think you might miss or want to use during your stay, but try to limit it to just one bag. If you need something else, your family and friends are often more than happy to take your dirty clothing and bring you clean, or exchange your books and games when you’re finished with one.


If you’re religious, you may choose to take an item that is significant to your religion; if not, many people choose to take a family photo or album to encourage themselves.

, If you‘re going to be out of work for a period of time post-surgery, take the appropriate steps to ensure that you and your family are provided for financially during this time. This may be something you have to discuss with your health insurance or national health service (it will vary depending on where you live). Regardless of what you need to do in order to manage it, be sure that you’re not going to end up in a tight spot financially as a result of your surgery. Sorting this out in advance will prevent you from stressing about financial matters during your recovery.

, Regardless of whether it’s asking your doctor questions or talking about your fears with your partner, be open about your feelings during this time, as keeping them to yourself could increase your stress. The more relaxed you are, the better – some studies have shown that there are fewer complications in procedures where the patient feels confident and relaxed, particularly in women.Thus, it is certainly worth trying to relax yourself and have confidence in your surgeon and the procedure as much as possible.


You might feel like keeping it to yourself when you’re expecting surgery, but it can be much more beneficial to share the information with the people you care about and who care about you. You may also find that there are people willing to help out with your household maintenance, meals, etc., during your recovery but if they don't know, they can't offer such help.

, It doesn’t have to be a deity or spirit that you choose to have faith in. Have faith that your doctor will do everything that is needed to let you continue living a happy and healthy life, have faith that your body will heal. Have faith that your family are waiting for you, encouraging you. Have faith in yourself and everyone that loves you; faith is a simple concept that gives you purpose during a time when you desperately need it, which can help to reduce your stress levels and thus make you more relaxed and confident.

, In the run up to your surgery, try to exercise as much as your condition safely allows, eat healthy, stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. Being in tip-top condition during the surgery can improve your mood, which helps you to stay in a more positive frame of mind, as well as helping to reduce the risk of complications, so that you can be even more confident when going into the surgery."

Eat fatty fish at least twice a week.,
Choose fresh, small fish.,
Use supplements as a secondary option.,
Snack on nuts.,
Work nuts into your meals.,
Stir in some seeds.,
Don't rely only on dietary changes alone.",How to Minimize Arthritis Symptoms with Diet1," Fish are one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Certain fish in particular make up one of the most powerful anti-inflammatory food groups. These include mackerel, trout, and herring. Eat a 3 – 4-ounce serving of one of these fish two to four times a week.Sardines and anchovies also contain good fatty acids, and have even less mercury, which can be dangerous when consumed in high quantities.
Tuna and sablefish have good fatty acids, but contain more mercury than the other fatty fish.;
, Even within species, nutrient levels will vary according to individual fish. As a rule of thumb, the best sources of anti-inflammatory fatty acids are wild-caught, cold water fish. Meanwhile, larger fish accumulate more mercury in their flesh, which you should try to avoid.When choosing a cut of salmon, lean towards pieces from smaller fish that were wild caught in the Atlantic. Similarly, choose pieces of trout from smaller fish raised in cold water sources.
If farm-raised fish are your personal preference, these are still good sources of anti-inflammatory fatty acids. Similarly, canned tuna is also a great way to get healthy fish at a low cost.

, Fish oil supplements can provide you with plenty of omega-3 fatty acids; however, your body will not process these supplements as well as it will process fish. Further, eating fish provides additional health benefits as well. Even if you’re not accustomed to eating fish, try a few different types and find one you enjoy., Nuts are another great source of healthy, inflammation-fighting fatty acids. Several nuts also provide magnesium, l-arginine and vitamin E, which may also help your body fight the inflammation that can worsen your arthritis symptoms. Default to walnuts, peanuts, almonds, and pistachios.Just one 1-ounce serving of walnuts per day (about one handful) can help reduce symptoms!
Peanuts are a great high-protein, low cost snack option that can help you lose weight. Similarly, snack on peanut butter that contains only peanuts or peanuts and salt.
Opt for raw, unsalted nuts. Go for lightly salted or otherwise seasoned nuts if it means you’ll be eating more of them and less of other, relatively unhealthy snacks like chips.

, Nuts can provide texture, flavor, and protein to dishes. They can even be used as a healthier alternative to meat. For instance, make a veggie stir fry with walnuts, garlic, and lemon juice. Or, make a creamy, nutty sauce for your favorite steamed veggies with peanut butter, water, lime juice, soy sauce, and cayenne.Finally, crush up almonds or pistachios to season a slab of fish.

, Flaxseed contains very high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids too. Get crushed or milled flaxseed, as this will be easier for your body to digest. Chia seeds are good sources too, and provide plenty of filling fiber as well.Try to eat 1 – 2 tablespoons of one of these types of seeds every day.
Flaxseed can be sprinkled on or added to just about anything. Try some with Greek yogurt for an especially healthy breakfast.
Chia seeds are often added to beverages, as they absorb liquid well. Try them in almond milk!

, Eating healthy will have many positive effects beyond a likely reduction in your arthritis symptoms. You have the best chance of minimizing the symptoms of arthritis, however, by working with your doctor. They will be able to advise you about things like diet, as well as physical therapy and medical treatment."

Ask your doctor about antipsychotic medication.,
Watch for undesirable side effects.,
Remember that medication is only one treatment for your symptoms.,
Be patient.",How to Minimize Symptoms of Schizophrenia2," Antipsychotic medication has been used in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia since the mid-1950s. Older antipsychotics, sometimes called typical antipsychotics or 1st generation antipsychotics, work by blocking a specific subtype of dopamine receptor in the brain. Newer antipsychotics, also called atypical antipsychotics, block the receptor as well as a specific serotonin receptor.1st generation antipsychotics include such medication as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, trifluoperazine, perphenazine and fluphenazine.
2nd generation antipsychotics include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone and ziprasidone.

, Antipsychotic medications often have significant side effects. Many side effects will go away after a few days. Side effects include blurred vision, drowsiness, sensitivity to the sun, skin rashes, and weight gain. Women may experience menstrual problems.It may take a while to find the medication that works best for you. Your doctor may want to try different doses, and combinations, of medication. No two people respond in exactly the same way to medication.
Clozapine (Clozaril) can result in a condition called agranulocytosis, which is a loss of the white blood cells. If your doctor prescribes clozapine, you will need to get your blood checked every week or two.
Weight gain from antipsychotic medication may result in diabetes and/or high cholesterol.
Long-term use of 1st generation antipsychotics may result in a condition known as tardive dyskinesia (TD). TD causes involuntary muscle spasms, usually around the mouth.
Other side effects from antipsychotic medication include rigidity, tremors, muscle spasms and restlessness. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing these side effects.

, Despite the importance of taking medication to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia, medication by itself does not cure schizophrenia. It is only one tool used to help minimize the symptoms.Psychosocial interventions such as individual therapy, social skills training, vocational rehabilitation, supported employment, and therapy for your family can also help to manage your condition.Be proactive in seeking additional information about treatment options that may work together with medication to minimize your symptoms.

, Medications may take days, weeks, or even longer to become truly effective. While most people may see good results after taking medication for six weeks, others may not see good results for several months.If you don't start seeing improvement after six weeks, check with your doctor. You may benefit from a higher or lower dosage, or a different medication.
Never stop taking antipsychotic medication abruptly. If you choose to discontinue taking medication, do so under a doctor's guidance.

"
"
Talk to your doctor honestly.,
Communicate with your doctor or treatment provider.,
Attend a support group.",How to Minimize Symptoms of Schizophrenia3," Having a strong support system is one of the primary factors for successful treatment of schizophrenia. A good support team may consist of mental health professionals, family members, and personal friends and peers who share the diagnosis.Talk to trusted friends and family members about your symptoms. They may help you navigate mental health care systems to get the treatment you need.
Many times, maintaining stable, consistent housing is difficult for people with schizophrenia. If staying with your family is an option during stressful times, consider allowing your family to care for you until your symptoms improve.
Housing options, such as group homes or supported living apartments, support people with schizophrenia. The availability of such homes varies widely from state to state. Check with your local National Alliance for Mental Health (NAMI) chapter or other mental health professionals to learn more about these services.

, Having good, honest communication with a mental health professional will allow you to receive the best level of treatment they can provide. Being honest with your doctor about your symptoms will ensure that you're getting the right dosage of medication, neither too much nor too little.You can always seek out a second opinion, if you feel that your doctor isn't responsive to your needs. Never discontinue medical treatment without having a back-up plan.
Check in with your doctor regarding any questions you may have regarding treatment issues, medication side-effects, persistent symptoms, or other concerns.
Your participation is essential towards most effective treatment of your symptoms. Treatment works best when you're working together with your treatment team.

, The stigma from schizophrenia can be more uncomfortable than the symptoms. In a peer support group, your experience is shared by other members. Attending a group for support has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to minimize the difficulties of living with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.Peer support groups are offered through local mental health organizations, Schizophrenics Anonymous (SA) and NAMI throughout the United States. For more information, do an online search for groups in your area.
Peer support groups are also offered online. SA offers conference call support groups as well. Find a support group option that works for you.

Consume lots of colorful veggies.,
Favor dark, leafy greens.,
Don’t forget red and orange veggies.,
Steam your veggies.,
Carry tart cherries with you.",How to Minimize Arthritis Symptoms with Diet2," As a general rule, the more colorful your vegetables, the better. The important part is not which colors — but the variety of multiple vegetables with every meal. Aside from nutritional benefits, a diet that prominently features veggies can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which is an important component of reducing painful arthritis symptoms.


Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage include compounds that may be especially helpful in reducing pain in your joints.

, Spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and bok choy can also help protect your cells from damage that is otherwise accelerated by arthritis. They also contain nutrients like calcium, and also help reduce inflammation.


Onions, garlic, leeks, and shallots can also provide healthy antioxidants and potentially relieve inflammation.

, These hues actually indicate the presence of natural chemical components that can help your body fight the symptoms of arthritis. Sweet potatoes, carrots, and squash are all great. Peppers (of any color) are especially helpful in protecting your bone and cartilage health.


Work at least a ½ cup of red peppers into your diet every day.

, The way you cook your vegetables is important, as it can affect the nutrients you derive. Steaming veggies with a small amount of water is the best method to preserve nutrients. Sautéing is okay, but definitely avoid deep frying your veggies., Tart cherries are one of the wonder foods when it comes to minimizing your arthritis symptoms. They have both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and may even offer pain-relief comparable to that provided by popular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDs).Mix some with almonds and carry them around to snack on during the day.


Strawberries, red raspberries, and dark grapes can also help diminish arthritis symptoms. These are all best consumed fresh, perhaps mixed with Greek yogurt and whole grains or nuts.

"
"
Eat turmeric daily.,
Add garlic.,
Make ginger tea.,
Add heat to your food with cayenne powder.",How to Minimize Arthritis Symptoms with Diet3," Another important component of your diet is seasoning. Turmeric, for instance, contains the compound curcumin, which is especially likely to help manage recurring joint pain.Specifically, it can help block inflammation. Season home cooked meals with ½ teaspoon of the spice, as well as a bit of black pepper.

, Fresh garlic can inhibit the production of inflammatory substances known as cytokines. Heating garlic can reduce its anti-inflammatory properties, so you should wait until your dish is fully cooked before adding a finely-chopped clove or two.Try adding garlic to sandwich spreads or dressings for salads.

, Another popular anti-inflammatory seasoning that can be consumed in many different ways is ginger. The easiest way to include ginger in your diet is by boiling a 1 to 2 inch piece of fresh ginger root on low for 30 minutes. Drink warm or cold.Try adding fresh, diced ginger to almost any dish — the flavor works well with both sweet and savory meals.

, The capsaicinoids in cayenne and other chili peppers have proven anti-inflammatory properties. If you’re not accustomed to spicy food, try adding ¼ teaspoon to the next dish you think might taste good spicy."
"
Fill a quarter of your plate with whole grains.,
Get tested for gluten intolerance.,
Avoid refined grains.",How to Minimize Arthritis Symptoms with Diet4," Whole grains should make up a substantial part of your diet, in part to provide fiber. Try to work them into every meal in the form of whole-wheat breads, brown rice, bulgur, whole cornmeal, or oatmeal, among other options.For instance, add barley to soups and stews, use bulgur as an alternative to rice, and bake with rye and whole wheat flour.
You may need to increase whole grain consumption slowly to decrease side effects such as bloating and constipation.

, A small percentage of people may actually experience increased inflammation after consuming a protein called gluten that is contained in wheat and some other grains. If you fear you may be sensitive to gluten, get tested. If you are gluten intolerant, you can still eat high-fiber, non-gluten whole grains.Amaranth, brown rice, buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum and oats can also be used in gluten-free cooking and baking.

, Highly processed refined grains are not only low in nutrients, they can also actually worsen symptoms associated with inflammation. Further, these sorts of ingredients increase the likelihood of developing other health issues aside from arthritis. Accordingly, remove white bread, white rice, and sugary pastries from your diet.Make sure the ingredients of any packaged bread begins with “whole grain”. Other terms are often used on packaging to imply that a product is healthy, even when it may contain predominantly unhealthy ingredients.

"
"
Eat a healthy diet.,
Quit smoking.,
Try a gluten-free diet.,
Try a ketogenic diet.,
Include more Omega-3 Fatty Acids in your diet.",How to Minimize Symptoms of Schizophrenia4," Studies suggest that people with schizophrenia tend to have more unhealthy diets than non-schizophrenic people. Lack of exercise and smoking are also common among people with schizophrenia. Research suggests that a diet low in saturated fat, high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, and low in sugar might be beneficial also in alleviating the symptoms of schizophrenia.Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a protein that is active in the parts of the brain associated with learning, memory, and higher thinking. While the evidence is as yet unclear, a possible hypothesis is that a high-fat, high-sugar diet leads to exacerbation of symptoms in schizophrenia.
Unhealthy diets can lead to secondary medical problems, such as cancer, diabetes, or obesity.
Eat more probiotics. Probiotics contain beneficial bacteria which improve the quality of the gut. Many people seeking a health-conscious treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia may want to include balanced diet which contains probiotics. Sauerkraut and miso soup are good sources of probiotics. Probiotics are sometimes added to foods and are available as a dietary supplement.Avoid products with casein. A small percentage of people with schizophrenia have negative reactions to casein, which is found in milk products., Smoking cigarettes is more common among people with schizophrenia than the average population. One study estimated that over 75% of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia also reported smoking cigarettes.Nicotine can lead to temporary improvement in thinking, which may be why many people with schizophrenia choose to smoke. However, this is a short-term improvement. It does not counterbalance the long-term negative consequences of smoking.
Most smokers started smoking before the psychotic features of schizophrenia appeared. Research is unclear on whether cigarette smoke may result in vulnerability to schizophrenia manifestation, or whether the higher rates of smoking are a side effect of antipsychotic medication.

, Gluten is the general name for the proteins found in most grains. Many people with schizophrenia also have gluten sensitivities. They may have a co-existing condition called Celiac Disease, which causes negative reactions to gluten.Celiac Disease is three times more common among people with schizophrenia. In general, people with gluten-sensitivities are more likely to experience mental health problems. This has resulted in a hypothetical connection between mental health concerns and gluten intake.
Research is inconclusive regarding positive benefits resulting from gluten-free diets.

, A ketogenic diet is high in fat and low in carbohydrates, while providing adequate protein. Originally used as a treatment for seizure disorders, the diet has been adapted for a variety of mental health concerns. In the ketogenic diet, the body begins to burn fat rather than sugar, avoiding the extra production of insulin.There is insufficient data to suggest that use of this diet eliminates symptoms of schizophrenia, but some people may wish to try this diet if their symptoms are otherwise resistant to treatment.
The ketogenic diet is also known as the Adkins diet, or the Paleo diet.

, Studies suggest that a diet high in Omega-3 fatty acids helps treat the symptoms of schizophrenia. Benefits from Omega-3 increase if your diet contains antioxidants. Antioxidants may play a role in the development of schizophrenic symptoms.Fish oil capsules are a good source for Omega-3. Eating cold-water fish such as salmon or cod raises Omega-3 levels as well. Other high Omega-3 foods include walnuts, avocados, flax seeds and other nuts.
Take 2-4 grams of Omega-3 per day.
Foods that are high in antioxidants, including vitamins E and C, and melatonin, have been suggested to help minimize the symptoms of schizophrenia."
"
Try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).,
Receive psychoeducational therapy.,
Consider electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).,
Use repetitive transcranial-magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat symptoms.",How to Minimize Symptoms of Schizophrenia5," Individual cognitive therapy has been shown to help people change maladaptive behaviors and beliefs. While CBT appears to have little direct impact on the symptoms of schizophrenia, it helps many patients stick to their treatment program, and has a positive impact on their overall quality of life. Group therapy can also be effective.CBT sessions should be scheduled once per week for 12-15 weeks for best results. These sessions can be repeated as needed.
In some countries, such as the UK, CBT is the most widely-prescribed treatment for schizophrenia other than antipsychotic medication. In other countries, CBT may be difficult to access.

, This is a form of therapy that primarily serves to better educate you about your symptoms and the way they affect your life. Research suggests that learning about the symptoms of schizophrenia will help you develop better understanding of the way these symptoms affect you, and empower you to manage them better.One of the characteristics of schizophrenia is lack of insight, impulsivity and poor planning. Learning about your diagnosis may help you make better choices regarding situations that negatively impact your life.
Education is a gradual process, not a short-term goal. This form of therapy should be an ongoing part of your work with a therapist, and may easily be combined with other forms of therapy such as CBT.

, Research suggests that ECT may have certain benefits for patients with schizophrenia. It is generally prescribed for people suffering from chronic depression. This is a treatment more commonly practiced in the European Union, and there is little research to support its use to treat people with schizophrenia. However, there are case studies in which people whose symptoms have been resistant to other treatments have responded favorably to ECT.ECT is usually given three times a week. A patient may require as few as three or four treatments or as many as 12 to 15. Modern ECT methods are painless, unlike the versions practiced decades ago in the early days of ECT.
Memory loss is the primary negative side effect of ECT. Issues with memory usually improve within a couple months after the last treatment., This is an experimental treatment that has shown some promising results in several studies. Data on this treatment is still limited, however. This treatment may be specifically used to treat auditory hallucinations.Studies show most promise for people with severe, persistent auditory hallucinations, or ""voices.""
The treatment consists of application of TMS for 16 minutes per day for four consecutive days.

Find a wall to use for measuring.,
Remove all bodily obstructions.,
Stand up straight.,
Position their legs together.,
Place their hands and arms to the side of their body.,
Ask them to look forward.",How to Measure Height1," You are looking for a wall that has unobstructed access. It should be solid without a window or other cut-outs. It needs to be wide enough to fully fit the person’s shoulders without them touching anything else. The floor in the area should be level as well.


It is even better if you can find a wall that faces a mirror. This will allow you to track your movements during the process, which usually results in a more accurate final number.;
, The person whose height is being measured should take off their shoes. Place them to the side and stay barefooted (or wear socks) for the duration of the measuring process. Take down any hair accessories that could interfere with measuring process, such as a ponytail. If the person is wearing a bulky coat or jacket, have them take it off.One of the reasons that bulky clothing must be removed is so that you can observe body posture and make sure that the person is standing up perfectly straight when measured., Move to the wall for measuring. Place the person to place their back against the wall. Ask them to hold themselves up nice and straight for the entire time. When you look at their profile from the side, you should verify that the backs of their feet, head, shoulders, and bottom all lightly touch the wall., Ask the person to pull their legs slightly close to one another. Their weight should be balanced between both feet. Their knees and ankles should be close to touching or actually touching one another.For some people with knee conditions this may be an uncomfortable position. Check with the person to make sure that they are not experiencing any pain.

, Your subject may want to clasp their hands before them or cross their arms, however, this will have an effect on their posture and final height measurement. Instead, ask them to purposefully hang their arms loosely at their side.If you are measuring a child, you might tell them to keep their body as straight as a board and their arms as limp as noodles.

, Point out a spot across the room, at eye level height, and request that they focus on this area while you complete the measurement. Circle around the person and make sure that their eyes and ears are horizontal to one another in profile. This is called the “Frankfort Plane” alignment and indicates that their head is in the correct position.To correctly observe the Frankfort Plane, you will need to be as tall, or taller, than the person being measured. So, have a step-stool nearby to assist you, if needed.
If you are measuring a child, watch to see if they move their head around after taking a breath. If this is the case, you will want to re-position their head and then take a quick measurement."

Understand that treatment of chronic illness requires the involvement of society as a whole-chronic disease is more than a health problem—it’s an epidemic.",How to Manage Chronic Illness," Many individuals are ill with symptoms and do not know what is wrong with them. Many go without treatment for years. A critical public health problem and of growing concern worldwide is illness associated with the environment. Some people who experience intense, ongoing or cumulative, low level exposure to one or more chemicals or irritants become sensitive to them. People with environmental illness(es) often become ill and develop a range of disorders marked by debilitating symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. Frequency or severity of these symptoms are made worse by subsequent exposures, even at very low doses to a wider range of chemicals and irritants. It is a very serious condition.;
, Be aware that the following symptoms may also be caused by many different illnesses, therefore, a correct diagnosis is extremely important. Don't procrastinate seeing a doctor because you want to avoid dealing with it. It is always best to catch any illness or condition as far in advance as possible.


Central nervous system - fatigue, tension, headaches, confusion, memory loss, depression, hyperactivity, sleep disturbances, dizziness
Gastrointestinal - bloating, nausea, constipation, cramps, diarrhea
Genitourinary - frequency, incontinence
Skin - eczema, flushing, rashes, hives
Musculoskeletal - muscles spasms, joint pain, backaches, swollen limbs
Respiratory - frequent colds, bronchitis, asthma, shortness of breath
Cardiovascular - rapid heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, hypertension, migraines
Ear, eye, nose, throat - nasal stuffiness, earaches, watery eyes, sinus infection, congestion

, Multidisciplinary intervention is communication and collaboration among doctors, nurses, caregivers, counselors, and other professionals. This is to improve satisfaction among participants and improve patients’ satisfaction with quality of care.The patient as well as their medical team need to learn how to manage the particular illness as many illnesses are very complex. The more the individual learns about their illness the better chance they will have to improve their health and keep their independence. A good self-management program for chronic illness is to put in place a team conference proposed plan of management


Individualized Care Plan
Follow up with physician discussion of further therapy
Regular review of care plan in team meeting
Linking with care providers in the community for collaborative management
Re-evaluation using objective tests to determine progress in patient's health and care plan
Self management and community linkage
Coaching, building capacity and offering guidance in self management strategies
Assisting in developing community linkage. Work with every available resource to treat both the patient and the illness. There is a great need for community-based programs. These programs can cut financial cost, be more easily accessible, help the individual to manage their illness, and improve their overall health.

, Walking benefits the patient's lungs, heart, and mind. One should walk or exercise at least three times a week and go at one's own pace. The individual may have to start off very slowly and build up endurance, but in the end it is one of the best exercises that can be done and most people can do that. Some may have to use canes or rollators to do this, but that is okay. They may also use an electric scooter to be able to go greater distances, especially in the summer time, when on vacation. This enables the individual to keep their independence.

, For some people with chronic illness, however, a massage can create more pain for a few days. Be aware of what works for you and those with your illness. It will vary.







Consider pool therapy: This is very beneficial if one is able to join a program that caters to those that have chronic illness. Some even have heated pools and classes just for the chronically ill, done under the direction of trained personnel. Exercises can be done in a heated pool and at the level that is best suited for the client. Some pools have jets in them and this can be beneficial for one's circulation.







Pharmaceutical prescription: Sometimes medications are needed to treat those who are very ill and it is important that they are followed up by their family physician. Do you research and consider the side effects, as well as the risk you take if your condition is left untreated. Know that just because you start a medication does not mean you will have to take it forever. Consider it part of your overall plan to be able to keep living, rather than in a constant battle of fighting to enjoy life.







Physiotherapy: Physiotherapy involves treatment at a clinic or at home. The therapist uses such treatment methods as a tens unit, ultrasound, moist heat, exercises, riding a stationary bicycle, and other treatment methods. The purpose is to relieve pain, improve mobility, motivate the individual to make life style changes, and to build up endurance. Some of their methods may then be continued at home with good follow up







Intravenous therapy: Intravenous nutrient therapy or IV is considered for patients based upon reported symptoms of fatigue and muscle pain. The patient is given a test at first to see if their body is low in magnesium. If it is, then they are tested with a small trial dose of magnesium combined with Magnesium, Sodium Bicarbonate, Vitamin C, and Beminal with C Fortis. This is a very safe method of treatment and done with nurses in attendance. Many patients get great relief after this type of treatment







Counseling: Programs for rehabilitation are community based models that offers assistance in the following: Employment assessment, re-entry into the work force with follow up, help to produce a pleasing resume, job search and interview skills etc. Other programs are more spiritually oriented and recognize that individuals have spiritual as well as emotional and physical needs







Follow good nutrition habits: Good nutrition means better health. One way to do this is to eat organically. Getting better requires clean air, clean food, clean water







Consider your spiritual path: Studies have shown that faith in God, a prayer life, and being involved in a congregation can lessen stress as well as physical symptoms. Friendships that are developed as well as feeling that there is a purpose in the pain or one's experience can help one feel better and sometimes even help them heal. Research has shown that those who pray sometimes heal faster than those who do not. Don't ignore your spiritual self in this journey of coping with a chronic illness.







,, As more of the population ages it is becoming a major problem. Every community needs to make sure that every thing possible is done to help our seniors and disabled to remain in their own homes as long as possible."

Dissolve vitamin C powder using distilled water.,
Add glycerin to the vitamin C mixture.,
Pour the serum into an amber apothecary bottle.",How to Make Your Own Anti Aging Creams with Vitamin C1," Mix a ½ teaspoon of vitamin C powder with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of distilled water in a small container. Make sure to mix the ingredients together until the powder is completely dissolved, to avoid a grainy mixture.


Only use distilled water, not just filtered tap water or plain tap water.
This is because the high oxygen levels in tap water can break down the ingredients faster.
Note that your water and vitamin C mixture will only be good for 2 weeks when refrigerated, and beyond that time period the serum should be discarded.;
, The function of glycerin is to make the solution smoother and moisturize the skin. Add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of vegetable glycerin to the mixture. If you already included glycerin in the original mixture, you should include less water.


In this case, the mixture will include 1 teaspoon of distilled water instead of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of distilled water.
Note that when glycerin is included, the mixture lasts for a month.

, Now, you are ready to store your vitamin C cream. Place it into the refrigerator to preserve its effectiveness and prevent breakdown.


Darker bottles are better, because exposing vitamin C to light will decrease its potency and oxidize it quickly, making it less effective.

Use the pencil mark method.,
Use a stadiometer.,
Measure on a horizontal surface.,
Use a specialized horizontal headboard and footboard device.,
Record the final measurement.",How to Measure Height2," Place a pencil in a horizontal position above the person’s head with the tip facing the wall. Lower the pencil until it reaches the top of their head, maintaining the level position. Slowly move the pencil tip toward the wall until it makes a mark. Get out a flexible tape measure. Place the tape against the wall and measure up from the floor to your mark.You can use any marking device, however, a pencil is best as you can erase the marks when you are finished. Just make sure to make a dark enough mark so that it is visible when you pull away.
Make sure that you keep the tape straight as you go up from the wall. It should also lay lightly against the wall. You can use a straight ruler instead if you so choose, making a wall mark every 12 inches and then adding it all up.
If you are measuring yourself you can do this method too, just make sure to keep the pencil level. It also helps if you are using a wall opposite a mirror so you can track your movements.

, This is a piece of medical equipment composed of a measuring board affixed to the wall with a drop-down (adjustable) rod at the top. Have the person stand against the board and then adjust the rod so that it rests on the top of the person’s head. With a manual stadiometer, you will need to write down the height where the rod meets the board. With a digital stadiometer, the height will be displayed immediately after you adjust the rod.It is not necessary to push the measuring rod down upon the person’s head. It is enough to lightly touch the head with the rod.

, To get an accurate number you will need to have the person lay down on a firm area. You can use an examination table in a doctor’s office for a small child. Or, a firm bed if you are measuring an immobile adult. Ask the person to look toward the ceiling. Lightly press their knees together and down until they contact the flat surface. Use a measuring tape to measure from the base of their feet to the top of their head.Be aware that this method is less accurate when used with taller persons. So, try to use a stand-up wall method whenever possible.This is often a good option for children who are moving around a great deal, but who are too big for the infant measuring device and too wiggly to stand up against the stadiometer.
You can also make a pen or marker mark at the base of their feet and at the top of their head and measure between the marks. This works well if you don’t mind marking up a bedsheet or if you are measuring on a paper surface (like at a pediatrician’s office).

, This is the preferred way to measure infants. You will lay the infant down in a measuring area. You then pull the headboard and footboard toward the baby until they meet its head and feet, respectively. You measure from board-to-board to determine height.Some of the more advanced measuring devices found in pediatricians’ offices will actually show a digital display of the final measurement or distance between the boards.

, If possible, it is always easier to have one person doing the measuring while another person writes down the resulting numbers. However, if you are doing everything on your own, just make sure to write down the numbers as soon as you have them to preserve accuracy.Record all of your measurements to the nearest 1/8th of an inch (0.1cm).It is a good idea to take all measurements twice, if possible. Compare the two results to see if they are close enough to one another to indicate accuracy. If they are more than 1/8 of an inch apart, then you may want to measure one more time."

Purchase and download a measurement app.,
Open the app.,
Point your camera at the object.,
Take a clear picture of the object.",How to Measure Height3," Go to the app store and search for a “measure app.” You will see a number of options pop up, including the Easy Measure app. Read through the reviews and look over the pricing before you buy. Choose the one that best suits your needs and download it.


For example, Easy Measure has a variety of attractive features. It comes with an animated tutorial explaining how to tackle measuring challenges. It also allows you to take a photo of the object measured and store it alongside the measurement for easy reference., When you are ready to measure an object, you’ll need to get within eyesight of it and take out your phone. Start up the application and complete any requested calibrations. Try out a few different ways to hold your phone in order to keep it the most stable.

, Place your camera at eye level and direct it toward the object in question. Make sure that you pull your fingers out of the way as well. Move forward or backward to get the entire object into the view frame. This may take a bit of practice, so give yourself ample time.Part of the calibration process involves setting the correct camera height. It is best if you subtract 4 inches from your height and use that number (just so long as you keep the camera at eye level).

, Snap a few photos of the object and wait for the measuring magic to take place. The app will display the height of the object and you’ll have the option to save this information for later or even share it on social media.If you doubt the accuracy of the final measurement, do a few test runs on objects close to you. Use the camera to measure these objects and then take a traditional tape measurement as well. Compare the two numbers and they should line up to 1/8th of an inch.

Create a mixture of vitamin C and distilled water.,
Add 3 teaspoons of almond oil to the mixture.,
Add a ½ teaspoon of olive oil to the mixture.,
Add 3 drops of geranium essential oil.,
Add 3 drops of lavender essential oil.,
Add 2 tablespoons of beeswax.,
Add a 1/4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil.,
Add 1 tablespoon of shea butter.,
Mix all the oils into the mixture and simmer.,
Transfer your cream to an apothecary bottle or keep it in the jar for storage.,
Apply the vitamin C cream to see effects.",How to Make Your Own Anti Aging Creams with Vitamin C2," Mix a ½ teaspoon of vitamin C with 5 teaspoons of distilled water in a glass jar. Mix it well, because vitamin C takes time to dissolve.


Stir it frequently until it is fully dissolved, without leaving any grainy particles in the mixture.

, The benefits of almond oil include protecting the skin from sun damage, rejuvenating and softening the skin, and reducing scarring, inflammation, and skin irritation.


Almond oil is rich in vitamin A, B, and E which are great for skin health.

, Olive oil is rich in vitamin E, which helps moisturize the skin and fights against free radicals and skin irritations.

, Geranium oil can reduce the appearance of scarring, improve blood circulation to the skin, tone up skin, and cause new cells to regenerate. Geranium comes from a plant named Pelargonium, which is often used to treat many skin problems.


Geranium oil is classified as antiseptic, astringent, tonic, and anti-infectious.

, Lavender oil soothes the skin very well and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles on the face.


Lavender contains phytochemicals, linalool, and linalyl acetate that improve overall skin health.

, Beeswax offers anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antiviral benefits. Creams, lotions or soaps containing beeswax can greatly improve dry, rough skin.


This can reduce the effects skin aging, especially wrinkles.

, Vitamin E is an important antioxidant because it protects cell membranes and prevents damages to the enzymes associated with them. Vitamin E helps inactivate free radicals, making them less likely to cause damage and reducing skin aging.


Applying vitamin E to the skin can reduce the damage caused by sun exposure and limit the production of cancer-causing cells.

, Shea butter is also known as an all-natural vitamin A cream. It is known to be a superb moisturizer, and good at combating dry skin. Because of its anti-inflammatory and moisturizing properties, shea butter is lauded as an anti-aging cream.


The chief causes of aging are inflammation and sun damage.
Therefore, the damage reversal properties of vitamin A may be beneficial for wrinkle reduction and collagen renewal.

, Place the glass jar into a pot filled with 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of water and simmer the mixture. Mix together all the ingredients thoroughly to create a smooth and easy to apply mixture.


Let the jar sit without its lid until the ingredients have melted.
Stir occasionally.
Once the mixture has melted and it is evenly combined, pour it into a small glass jar.
Let it sit at room temperature until the cream solidifies.

, After the cream has solidified, transfer it into an apothecary bottle or keep it in its jar. Then, keep it refrigerated.


The vitamin C cream will only last for 2 weeks.

, After you finish creating your cream, apply a small amount to your skin to test it, because some people are very sensitive to ascorbic acid (Vitamin C).

Incorporate fun activities when kids brush their teeth.,
Motivate your kids to stick to healthy dental habits.,
Use a reward system to encourage good dental health.,
Explain the importance of healthy teeth.,
Help your child understand dental hygiene with activity sheets.",How to Make Dental Health Fun for Your Kids1," Kids will be more motivated to complete their brushing and flossing if they find it enjoyable. You can turn tooth brushing into a game — for example, brush with your kids and see who can build up bubbles with the toothpaste.You can also make brushing more fun for your kids by playing a song in the background while they brush their teeth. It could be their favorite tune from a kid’s show or a cartoon. You and your kids can also make up a little dance as you go along.;
, You can use a star chart to remind your kids to brush and floss their teeth every day. This will help your children feel like they are being rewarded for dental hygiene, and they are less likely to view brushing and flossing as a chore.If you use a star chart, arrange a graph with your children’s names on the top and the days of the month listed down the side. Put a star under your children’s name for every day that they brush at least twice and floss once.
To engage your kids more, let the kids put a sticker by their own name once they’ve finished their dental hygiene for the day.
The star chart may be too complex for very young children, and older children may find the chart immature. This system will be most effective when kids are between three and eight years old.This method can be especially effective if you have multiple kids, as they may compete to get the most stars.

, Rather than criticizing or punishing your children when they fail to brush and floss regularly, reward your children for brushing two times a day, for two minutes each time, and for flossing daily. Keep track each week — then, at the end of each week in which your child has consistently brushed and flossed, give the child a treat. The reward should not be soda or candy, for obvious reasons. Reward ideas include:


Give children a healthy snack.
Allow children to stay up 20 minutes past their bedtime.
Allow children to pick a fun daytime activity for the family.
Buy children a small toy or book from a local store.

, Ask your kids about the ways that we keep our bodies healthy: answers will include sleeping, running, eating vegetables, and bathing. Then explain that brushing and flossing teeth is just as important.Explain them how important it is to have healthy teeth and give them examples of negative situations that others had when didn't brush (such as having to go to the dentist and get a cavity filled).
Putting this in terms that your kids understand will impress upon them the importance of daily dental hygiene.

, Activity sheets are a fun, visual-based resource which present material to kids in an easy-to-understand manner.Post a few activity sheets in your child’s bathroom; this will visually remind them about fun and important aspects of dental health. Activity sheets can be found online with a quick search and are also available at most children’s bookstores. Find activity sheets that teach your children about:


How to brush their teeth.
How to floss their teeth.
What cavities are and how to avoid them.
When they can expect to lose their baby teeth.
The importance of keeping permanent teeth healthy.

Let your child select their first toothbrush.,
Show your children how to brush their teeth.,
Show your children how to floss their teeth.",How to Make Dental Health Fun for Your Kids2," Children’s toothbrushes are designed in fun shapes and playful colors that appeal to children and will motivate them to brush their teeth regularly.However, make sure that the toothbrush is what your dentist has recommended for your child: it should come with a small head and soft bristles.


You can also let your child choose their brand of toothpaste as well. Many companies make child-specific toothpaste, which is often flavored and will not leave your child’s mouth with a “burning” sensation., Squeeze a pea-sized dollop of toothpaste on your child’s toothbrush, and show them how to brush across the chewing surface of their molars, along the inside of their teeth (by the tongue), and along the outside of their teeth.


Show your children that they should not mash the toothbrush hard against their teeth, and that they need to brush upwards from their gums, so they don’t damage the gum tissue.
Make it clear to your kids that it’s important to brush for a full two minutes. It will help your kids bush for two full minutes if you set a timer for them (or teach them to set their own timer).Without a timer, it will be hard for children to accurately estimate two minutes, and they will almost always stop brushing too soon.
There are some children's toothbrushes that have battery-powered lights that will indicate when your child should brush (a green light) and when to stop (a red light). This can help ensure your child brushes for the correct length of time.
During brushing and before finishing explain them not to swallow the toothpaste and teach them how to get rid of the excess in the sink.

, Flossing can be difficult for children, especially younger ones who lack fine motor skills. Teach kids to gently press down between their teeth and to work the floss against the side of each tooth to scrape off food residue and plaque.


Children are frequently uncomfortable with the sight of blood, and can be squeamish when flossing since it will occasionally cut their gums. Let kids know that if they floss regularly, their gums will stop bleeding altogether.

Visit the dentist regularly.,
Schedule an appointment before your child’s first birthday.,
Don’t describe the dentist in ways that will frighten your children.",How to Make Dental Health Fun for Your Kids3," Start taking your kids to the dentist at an early age so that they get comfortable with their dentist and are not afraid.Make sure you select a dentist who has worked with many kids before, since this will make it easier for both you and your children to trust their dentist.


Your pediatric dentist should have a clinic that is suitable for kids as well. It should feel welcoming and child-friendly. Avoiding traumatic or scary visits to the dentist when your child is young will actually help ensure their oral health as adults, as they will be less likely to fear going to the dentist.

, It’s important to start taking your child to the dentist regularly while they’re still young. This will encourage them to trust their dentist, and to feel comfortable around the dental equipment.Taking your child to the dentist early and often will allow your dentist to frequently assess their general oral health and catch any cavities or other problems as soon as they develop.

, Especially before your child’s first trip to the dentist, avoid any use of words like “shot,” “hurt,” “drill,” and “pain.”These terms may needlessly frighten children, and make the dentist visit worse than it would otherwise be. When explaining to your child why they need to see a dentist, or what the dentist will do in their mouth, explain the visit with optimistic terms. Say something like:


“The dentist just wants to count your teeth and make sure your smile is bright.”
“The dentist is going to open your mouth and have a look inside.”

Make sure they rests in a quiet, comfortable spot with access to fresh air.,
Give her/him liquids, like water and herbal tea.,
Prepare the person’s comfort food.,
Help the sick person stay clean.,
Play a favorite game or watch a favorite movie or show.,
Express your sympathy and desire to make her feel better.,
Be willing to listen.,
Read to her.",How to Help a Sick Person Feel Better," The sick person may have a high temperature and can feel chilled in a room that is too cold, or uncomfortable in a room that is too hot. As well, loud noises and a stuffy room can make the sick person feel worse, rather than better. Ensure the person is set up on a bed, couch, or comfy chair that is in a comfortable spot in the house and that a window is open to allow fresh air into the room.


You can also make the person feel more comfortable by making sure they have access to warm blankets and lots of pillows, especially if they have a cold or a flu.
A sick person may need to get up to 10 hours of rest. Encourage the person to rest when they are tired so that they can recuperate better.;
, Most ill people suffer from dehydration due to symptoms like diarrhea or fever. Make sure they stay well hydrated by giving them glasses of water and cups of warm, comforting herbal tea. Encourage them to take small sips of the liquid and to try to finish at least three to four cups of water or tea. Though providing beverages is a simple gesture, it can be reassuring to the person, as they may not be able to get water or tea for themself due to their illness.


The average adult needs to drink eight 8 ounce glasses of water or more every day and should urinate at least three to four times a day. Gauge the sick person’s hydration level and note if she does not go to the bathroom often during the day. This may be a sign she is dehydrated.

, Most people will have a go to comfort food they crave when they are ill, such as chicken noodle soup. Studies have shown that sick people crave chicken noodle soup because it contains a protein in the form of chicken, a hearty chicken broth full of vitamins, minerals, and some fat, noodles to keep you full, as well as vegetables like carrots, celery, and onion, which contain vitamins and antioxidants. In general, soups make good comfort foods for a sick person as they are warm, filling, and easy to digest.Avoid giving the person unhealthy foods high in trans fats and empty calories, as this will not support her immune system as she recovers from her illness. Nourishing foods like soup, porridge, oatmeal, and fruit smoothies are all good meal options for a person who is feeling ill and weak.

, Depending on how severe the person’s sickness is, she may have a difficult time bathing herself or maintaining a level of cleanliness. It is very important that the sick person be kept clean to avoid more serious illnesses or infections. If the person is very ill, she may have a home nurse who is attending to her bathing needs.


You can help make the sick person feel better by assisting with the changing of the bedding every day and helping to person to change positions in bed. If the person is very physically weak, she may have a hard time turning over on her own in bed. You can assist her home nurse or ask someone in the house to help you lift and turn the person at least once a day to prevent the development of bedsores.

, Another simple way to cheer up a sick person is to distract her from her illness by suggesting you both play a favorite game or watch a favorite movie or show together. Spending quality time with the person doing something easy and fun can make the sick person feel less weak and give her something else to focus on besides her illness.


You can also bring her favorite novel for her to read on her own to her to distract her from her illness and provide some entertainment for her.
You can both also do a fun craft or a small project together that involves multiple visits to see the person. This will give the sick person something to look forward to and allow you to spend quality time more often with the person.

, When you first visit the sick person, it’s important that you tell her you care for her and are rooting for her to get better. You should also offer to help her in a clear and direct way. Rather than ask, “What can I do?” or “Tell me what I can do to help”, you can offer to help the person with specific things. For example, “I’m going to the grocery store later, I can pick up some chicken noodle soup for you” or “I’ll be close to the pharmacy later, can I get your prescription for you?” This will make it easier for the person to accept your help with little effort.When trying to cheer the person up with words, avoid using phrases like “Look on the bright side” or “It could have been much worse”. These phrases, though full of good intention, can make the person feel guilty for being sick or feel she does not have a right to be sick when there are other people less fortunate than her.

, Most sick people tend to feel better when they have someone who is willing to listen to them talk with empathy and understanding. Rather than tell the person she looks fine or that she doesn't seem all that sick, try to listen to the person talk about her feelings and emotions about her sickness or illness.


Avoid forcing an opinion on the person and focus instead on being there as a sympathetic ear. Many sick people find it helpful to know someone is sitting with them at least once a day and listening to them talk. Often, being sick can be a boring and lonely experience. Having someone who is willing to listen can help a sick person feel acknowledged and cared for.

, If the sick person is too weak to talk or sit up, you can comfort her by reading aloud from her favorite novel or story. This will help her remember she is not alone in the room and that she has someone who cares about her.

Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about surgery if this injury continues to occur.",How to Heal a Pulled Trapezius Muscle," The job of the trapezius is to support your head. When you injure your trapezius by pulling it, its going to have a harder time doing its job. Because of this, you might find that you have a hard time moving your head, neck and shoulders like you normally do., Aside from being the workhorse that keeps your head up, your trapezius is also connected to your arms. When your trapezius gets injured, one or both or your arms might become weak, as if there is nothing supporting it (or them)., When the muscle fibers in the trapezius get stretched too far, or get torn, the muscle fibers also contract at the same time and become tight. When this happens, it can create a of block of sorts that doesn’t allow enough blood to get to the area.


This lack of blood can cause your muscles to spasm (it will feel like your muscle is twitching under your skin) or stiffness (which will feel like your muscles have turned to cement).

, As mentioned above, when the muscle fibers in the trapezius constrict, they let less blood into the area, which also means the area gets less oxygen. Oxygen helps break up lactic acid, so when there is not enough oxygen, the lactic acid builds up and creates pain.The pain can be described as sharp pain, a stinging sensation, or feeling like your muscle has been tied into knots.

, On top of the muscle spasms and pain caused by insufficient blood flow, not having enough blood in the area also causes a strange tingling sensation that you will most likely feel in your arms. This happens because the muscle fibers in the area are constricted.

, Depending on your pain tolerance, you might feel more or less tired than other people suffering from the same injury. This is because when your body is in pain, your mind goes into overtime trying to find a way to control the pain. This can make you feel really tired and like you have very little energy.Someone with a high pain tolerance might feel a normal amount of energy, but this does not mean that they are any less injured than someone who is extremely fatigued.

, Like feelings of being super tired, pain can also affect your ability to concentrate. While the pain is not actually making your ability to concentrate any weaker, your mind might be so busy dealing with the pain that you psychologically feel like you can’t focus on anything.Even when you try to focus on something, the pain you are experiencing might distract. Its the same thing that happens when someone tells you not to think about an elephant and then all you can think about is an elephant.

, The pain you feel from the pulled trapezius might keep you up at night. In this instance, its not your brain trying to keep you from thinking about the pain, but the actual pain itself that is keeping you up.


You might find that every time you try to roll over you feel a sharp pain in your back or head.

, Trapezius muscles are connected to the neck muscles and to dura matter (a thin tissue that is pain- sensitive and covers the brain). Any damage to the trapezius muscles can cause headaches because the pain can be easily felt by the dura matter and the brain can interpret pain easily., This is one of the best ways to get your trapezius on the road to recovery. The PRICE therapy is actually a series of things that you should do. The following steps will go into the details of each part of the therapy.They include:

Protect.






Rest.






Immobilization.






Compress.






Elevate.

, If your trapezius gets hurt more than it already is, it could lead to an even more serious injury, such as a tear. To keep this from happening, you need to protect your pulled muscle. In order to protect your muscle, avoid the following:

Heat: Avoid hot baths, heat packs, saunas or any hot environment as heat causes blood vessels to dilate (open up), therefore increasing the risk of bleeding, as more blood will flow to dilated blood vessels.






Further movement: Any excessive movement of the affected area may cause further injury.






Massage: Pressure to the affected area may contribute to further injury.







, You should avoid any activity that may cause further injury to your pulled muscle for at least 24 to 72 hours. As it is, the pain you feel will probably automatically keep you from doing anything crazy, but a reminder never hurt. Rest helps promote the healing process without causing further damage to your injured muscle., As mentioned above, its generally best to give your muscle a rest when it gets injured. Normally a hurt muscle, like a calf muscle, can be wrapped against a splint to keep it immobilize. The trapezius is a bit harder to wrap. In fact, normally you won’t wrap your trap, but your doctor might recommend that you wear a soft neck brace to immobilize your neck and keep it from doing further damage to your trap., Put an ice pack or a bag of ice on your neck and shoulders to keep the swelling down and the pain you feel to a minimum. The ice will stimulating the flow of lymph fluid, which carries important nutrients to the damaged tissues surrounding the injury. Lymph fluid also removes waste from cells and body tissues which is an important function during the tissue regeneration process.You should place your ice pack or back of ice on your trapezius for 20 minutes at a time. Wait two hours and then put the ice pack back in place.






You should repeat this process four to five times each day during the first days (24 to 72 hours) of your muscle injury.







, Make sure that the affected area is always elevated. In trapezius muscle injuries, you will want to keep your back and shoulders slightly upright when you sleep. Try putting several pillows behind you so that you are propped up at a 30 to 45 degree angle. Doing this promotes good blood circulation to the injured area and speeds up the healing process., Painkillers work by blocking and interfering with the pain signals going through the brain. If the pain signal does not reach the brain, then pain cannot be interpreted and felt. Pain killers are classified as:

Simple Painkillers: These can be bought over-the-counter (OTC) at a pharmacy and includes Paracetamol.






Stronger Painkillers: These are taken when pain is not relieved by OTC painkillers. These can only be prescribed by a doctor and include codeine and tramadol.







, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by blocking specific body chemicals that cause your pulled muscle to become inflamed. causes the affected area to get inflamed.. However, NSAIDs should not be taken in the first 48 hours of injury as they can delay healing. In the first 48 hours, inflammation is one of the ways your body deals with the injury.Examples are Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Aspirin.

, For help strengthening the upper trapezius muscle and maintaining its optimal function, you may be referred to a physical therapist. Specific exercises aids in preventing upper trapezius pain. The following exercises may be performed with 15 to 20 reps every hour during the day.Scapular Pinches. You will be instructed to move your shoulders back in a circular motion, and then pinch shoulder blades together.






Shoulder Shrugs. It is done by raising the shoulders up until it reaches the ears and then lower it back.






Neck Rotation. Rotate the head to the right first, and then repeat on the opposite side.







, Once your trapezius feels like it has returned to normal, you should begin some gentle exercises to make sure that it does not get injured again. There are several exercises you can do to strengthen your trap. You may want to consult a physical therapist or muscle specialist again before doing this exercises if you are not sure that your muscle is fully healed.Try shoulder touches. Stand straight with your shoulders relaxed. Slowly look forward and then move your head so that your ear moves toward your shoulder. Your ear should be as close to your shoulder as possible without it hurting or feeling like you are straining it too hard. Hold this position for 10 seconds and then do the same thing on the other side of your body.






Try chest touches. Stand straight with your shoulders relaxed. Slowly tilt your head so that your chin goes towards your chest. Make sure that your shoulders stay down and rested while you do this. Hold this position for 10 seconds. Do this exercise two or three times a day.







, If your have very severely pulled or torn your trap, you may need to get surgery, particularly if it doesn't seem to grow stronger, even when you try to strengthen it with exercises. However, this is only considered when all of the other methods have failed. The surgery repairs and reconnects the damaged trapezius muscle tissue to help it regain its function."

Use the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ).,
Fill out the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire.,
Use the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire for low back pain.,
Consider the Treatment Outcomes of Pain Survey (TOPS) instead.,
Measure pain with the visual analog scale (VAS).,
Use the numerical rating scale (NRS) instead.,
Use the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) to gauge pain progress.,
Try the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale.,
Use a dolorimeter to test your pain threshold or tolerance.,
Get a functional MRI brain scan to objectify your pain.,
Use facial analysis to determine pain.",How to Measure Pain," The MPQ (also called the McGill pain index), is a scale of rating pain developed at McGill University in Canada in 1971.It's a written questionnaire that allows people in pain to give their doctors a good idea of the quality and intensity of pain they're feeling / experiencing. Patients basically choose descriptive words from different categories that best describes their pain.


The MPQ is a well-validated measure of pain with extensive clinical research backing up it's relative accuracy.
People can rate their pain in sensory terms (sharp or stabbing, for examples) and choose affective terms (sickening or fearful, for examples), so a doctor or therapist can review 15 total selected descriptors.Each selected descriptor is rated on a 4-point scale that ranges from none to severe, so the type and intensity of the pain can be better understood by health professionals.;
, The BPI is a questionnaire used to measure pain developed by the Pain Research Group of the WHO Collaborating Center for Symptom Evaluation in Cancer Care. The BPI comes in 2 formats: the short form, which is used for clinical trials; and the long form, which contains additional descriptive items that may be useful to a doctor in a clinical setting.The main purpose of the BPI questionnaire is to assess the severity of a person's pain and the impact it has on their daily functions.


The BPI questionnaire is best for people with pain from chronic diseases, such as cancer, osteoarthritis or low back pain.
The BPI can also be used to assess acute pain, such as postoperative pain or pain from accidents and sports injuries.
The main areas of assessment for the BPI include: location of pain, severity of pain, impact of pain on daily activities and response of pain levels to medication.

, The ODI is a numbered index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain questionnaire developed in 1980 and used by health care professionals and researchers to quantify disability caused by low back pain.The questionnaire contains 10 topics concerning pain intensity, sexual function, social life, sleep quality and the abilities to lift, sit, walk, stand, travel and care for yourself.


The ODI is a 100-point scale derived from the questionnaire and considered the ""gold standard"" for measuring disability and estimating quality of life in people with lumbar spinal pain.
The severity scores from the questions (ranging from 0-5) are added up and multiplied by two to obtain the index, which ranges from 0-100. Zero is considered no disability, whereas 100 is the maximum disability possible.
ODI scores between 0-20 indicate minimal disability, whereas scores between 81-100 indicate either extreme disability (bed-bound) or exaggeration.
The questionnaire is more accurate for people with acute (sudden) low back pain than it is for those with chronic (long term) back pain.

, The TOPS is the longest and most comprehensive survey for patients with chronic pain.The survey is designed to measure quality of life and function for a variety of causes of pain. The TOPS actually contains items from the BPI and ODI questionnaires, as well as questions on coping styles, fear avoidance beliefs, potential substance abuse, satisfaction levels of treatment and demographic variables.


The full TOPS contains 120 items and is about as thorough of a questionnaire that measures pain that you'll come across.
TOPS gives quantitative information on pain symptoms, functional limitations, perceived disability, objective disability, treatment satisfaction, fear avoidance, passive coping, solicitous responses, work limitations and life control.Because of the time it takes to fill out the TOPS, it may not be appropriate for people in severe pain.

, Unlike the multidimensional scales of pain determined by questionnaires, the VAS is considered a unidimensional measurement of pain because it just represents the pain's intensity, or in other words, how much it hurts.When using a VAS tool, people specify their level of pain by indicating a spot along a continuous line between two end-points. Usually a VAS tool looks like a slide ruler that's not numbered on the side the patient uses. It's appropriate to use for pain caused by all conditions.


On the back of most VAS instruments (where the patients can't see), there's a numbered scale typically from 1-10 where the doctor or therapist can make note of in their charts.
The VAS is the quickest and probably the most sensitive single-item measure for pain levels, although it doesn't indicate the type, duration or location of pain.
Many questionnaires use a VAS drawing to determine the perceived intensity of a person's pain.

, In a busy health clinic, time is often precious, so another quick and easy tool to use to measure pain is called the numerical rating scale. The NRS is similar to a VAS, except the scale is numbered, sometimes from 0-10 or occasionally 0-100, which is a little more specific.Zero represents no pain, whereas the highest number on the scale represents the worst pain imaginable.


The NRS can look like a slide-rule tool or it can be a printed scale on a piece of paper. The person with pain chooses the number that best represents their pain level.
Like all visual or numbered scales, the NRS measurement is subjective and based on the person's perceptions.
The NRS is useful for health care practitioners who want to gauge their patient's response to treatment by measuring pain levels at specific time intervals (like every week, for example). The NRS is also used in the hospital for acute pain, and to gauge a patient's response to a specific intervention, such as administration of pain medication.
Unlike the VAS, the NRS has the advantage of being administered verbally, so the patient doesn't have to move, read or write anything.

, The PGIC scale is helpful for describing your improvement (in terms of pain) over time or as a result of some sort of therapy.The PGIC asks you to rate your current status based on 7 choices: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse. The PGIC is helpful for practitioners to understand how their patients are responding to treatment.


The PGIC can be used for a wide variety of conditions and treatments, but it lacks more descriptive language to describe pain.
The PGIC is often used in conjunction with other scales or questionnaires because it provides information on changing pain levels over time, but lacks pain intensity and pain quality measurements.

, The Wong-Baker scale is especially useful for children and adults who might have trouble rating pain with other scales. The Wong-Baker scale uses a series of six faces to help patients identify what level of pain they feel. The scale gives patients options ranging from ""no pain"" to ""the worst pain.""The first face is smiling and a patient might point to that face to indicate that she is having no pain at all, while the last face is frowning and crying and a patient might point to that face to indicate that she is in severe pain.

, Dolorimetry is the measurement of pain sensitivity or pain intensity by instruments that can apply heat, pressure or electrical stimulation to some part of your body. The concept was developed in 1940 in order to test how well pain medication worked, although the devices used to cause pain and have advanced quite a bit over the decades.Lasers and various electrical devices are now used to test your tolerance to pain — but not measure pre-existing pain from some disease or injury.
Dolorimeters are calibrated to determine how much stimulation (from heat, pressure or electrical impulses) you can take before you describe it as painful. For example, most people express painful sensations when their skin is heated to 113 °F.
In general, women have higher pain thresholds than men, although men have greater abilities to work through high levels of pain.

, New technology and breakthroughs are allowing doctors and researchers to evaluate pain levels from fMRI brain scans, which might eventually replace the dependency on self-reporting (via questionnaires and visual scales) to measure the presence or absence of pain.The new tool (an fMRI given in real time) documents patterns of brain activity to give an objective assessment of whether someone is in pain or not.


Using functional MRI scans of the brain and advanced computer algorithms, researchers claim that they can detect pain 81% of the time in patients.
Because the sensation of pain causes certain identifiable brain patterns, this new MRI tool can substantiate a person's pain and also expose someone who may be faking it.
Although the technology can detect pain within people, it cannot yet determine the extent (intensity) of the pain.

, We all know the common facial expressions that signify a person is in pain, such as wincing, grimacing and frowning. The problem is that facial expressions are easy to fake, or sometimes they are misinterpreted due to cultural reasons. However, advanced facial recognition software allows doctors and researchers to determine if a person is truly in pain and, to a lesser extent, the degree of pain they feel.Patients are typically videoed while being physically examined or doing an activity that's meant to elicit pain, such as bending over of a person claims they have low back pain.
The facial recognition software analyses various points on the face for typical painful expressions and correlates the timing to an activity or exam — such as a practitioner putting pressure on a reportedly painful body part.
Facial recognition software if expensive and not meant for people to describe or measure their own pain, but rather for doctors / practitioners to prove or disprove the presence of pain.

Prepare a bag.,
Bring your medication.,
Bring a cell phone.,
Bring a notebook and pen.,
Bring ear plugs.",How to Make Your Hospital Stay More Comfortable1," You will need a large bag of luggage to carry all of the things with you that can make your stay comfortable. If you know that there is a high likelihood that you or someone you love will need to be rushed to the hospital, keep a bag packed by the door. That way you can run off as soon as it is necessary.


This is very common among couples who are expecting the birth of their child, but it is a good idea for those with chronic diseases as well. In the case of an emergency, you will already be prepared for a trip to the hospital.;
, Most doctors will want an accurate list of current medications. Typically, a comprehensive list of medications will be sufficient in lieu of the actual medication. But, the pharmacy might not carry your preferred brand of non-prescription medication, so sometimes it is best to bring everything with you.Keep in mind that most hospitals in the United States will refrain from giving home medications due to health and safety regulations. Unless medication is specialized (very expensive oral chemotherapies, etc.) then general medication for common illnesses will be provided by the hospital.

, The hospital phone might be hard to reach from your bed and your friends will probably have difficulty getting through to you when calling on the hospital line. A cell phone will make it easier to reach people, and, as an added perk, can provide a good source of entertainment., You will want to keep this on hand so you can write down questions for your doctors and record the things that they tell you. You often won’t have much time with your doctor, so you need to be prepared to get and give as much information as possible. This will also be useful, for example, when providing a record of your medication., Hospitals can be loud and you never know when your roommate will want to watch TV. Bring in ear plugs to block the sound. Alternatively, consider noise canceling headphones."

Identify your negative thoughts.,
Replace negative thoughts with positive ones.,
Distract yourself from your negative thoughts.",How to Manage Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder2," When you are away from your loved one, take note of any negative thoughts, assumptions, and beliefs that come into your head. Write them down or express them to someone like a therapist or close friend.Knowing what kind of negative thoughts you might expect can help you manage them.


Keeping a daily journal can help you get in the habit of recording your thoughts and feelings., When you have identified these negative thoughts, replace them with positive ones or disprove the beliefs that you feel.Controlling your negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones may help to calm you down.


For example, if your loved one leaves and you think “I may never see her again,” replace that negative thought with a positive one, such as, “I will see her when she gets home from work. We will eat dinner together and watch a movie.""
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a treatment plan for depression and/or anxiety that may help you replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Ask your doctor or therapist about beginning treatment.

, When you begin to feel anxious and start thinking negative thoughts, you will only feel more anxious.To keep yourself from dwelling on negative thoughts, distract yourself by:


Engaging in an activity like a hobby you enjoy
Focusing on completing work or household chores
Taking a walk or exercise
Visiting a place you enjoy, such as a museum or the movies

Practice breathing techniques to help calm yourself down.,
Try meditating.,
Use visualization techniques to relax.If you visualize settings that you find pleasant, you can reduce anxiety.",How to Manage Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder3," Breathing can be a great way to calm down when you are feeling anxious. Deep breathing is a known stress reliever. When you begin to feel yourself getting anxious, try this technique:Breathe in slowly through your nose for five seconds.
Focus your attention on listening to and feeling the air move as you breathe.
Place your hand on your chest and feel it rise as you breathe.

, Like deep breathing, meditating is another way to calm yourself by focusing on your breath and clearing your mind.Sit in a position that you find comfortable. If you sit on the floor, a pillow or mat can make things more comfortable.
Start off with some breathing exercises.
Focus your attention on your breathing. Gently bring your mind back to focus on your breathing as soon as it wanders.
Don’t judge or dwell on any thoughts that may come to mind.
Meditate for five minutes at least once a day. As you develop the habit of meditating, you can gradually increase the time you spend on it.

, Remove all distractions like television, computers, etc. and try the following technique when you feel anxious about being separated from a home or a loved one:


Start by spending a few minutes on breathing exercises and meditation.
Close your eyes and begin to imagine a setting that you find peaceful and relaxing. For instance, picture yourself in a sunny, grassy meadow with birds singing.
Use your imagination to explore the place you are visualizing. For instance, what birds do you see? Do you smell flowers? What does the grass feel like between your fingers?
When you feel relaxed and ready, open your eyes.

Talk to a psychologist about trying exposure therapy.,
Practice exposure therapy.If your doctor or therapist decides that exposure therapy is a good idea for you, and you are ready to try it, there are several techniques you can use.,
Ask your loved one to help you practice exposure therapy.",How to Manage Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder4," Exposure therapy is when a person is exposed to the thing they fear the most, but within a safe and supportive setting. In the case of ASAD, you would have to face your fears of separation. To do this, you would very gradually expose yourself to the anxiety provoking situation—such as being away from your home or loved ones—for short periods of time.A psychologist or trained therapist can develop a specific exposure therapy program that can help you overcome your anxiety.

, For instance, you might start just by thinking about being separated from your home or loved ones, and describe how you feel. Later, you might practice being separated from your loved ones or being away from home for periods of time that increase in length, and then discuss how you felt.


Even short-term exposure therapy treatments (three to six sessions) can help ease your anxiety.

, If your therapist approves, asking your loved one to help you can make the therapy process easier. To begin, have your loved one go into a different room while you practice calming techniques, such as breathing exercises, or work on banishing anxious thoughts.Gradually increase the distance and time that you spend away from your loved one.

Bring your own pillow.,
Bring a large thermos.,
Bring something to read.,
Bring something to watch.,
Bring music.,
Don’t forget the snacks.,
Bring your favorite toiletries.,
Pack a robe and slippers.",How to Make Your Hospital Stay More Comfortable2," Hospital pillows are typically wrapped in plastic. For a good night’s sleep, you should probably bring one of your own. Hospital blankets are not as bad, but for sentimental purposes it might be nice to have a favorite blanket from home as well.Just the smell of your own pillow can be very comforting and help with healing by decreasing stress hormones.

, Nurses can be very busy, so they may not always deliver you water in a timely manner. Also, hospital cups may be small, and won’t insulate your warm beverages very well. Be prepared with your own large thermos or mug so that you can have something to sip on all day long., Books are a good way to occupy an otherwise slow day. If you plan to spend a lot of time reading, don’t forget your reading glasses if you wear them., Hospital TVs are small and can be hard to hear if you have a neighbor who is also watching. Bring a DVD player or a tablet with an online streaming account. Don’t forget earphones. You’ll need them to drown out other sounds.Check with the hospital before you bring an expensive electronic item. Some hospitals discourage or will not allow you to bring these items, as they do not want to be held liable if they go missing.

, Bring a CD player, tablet, or smartphone. Keep a lot of music on the phone. With a pair of earphones, you’ll have a good way to waste away the hours or, alternatively, block outside sounds while you curl up with a book.Again, check with the hospital before brining these items.

, Hospital food can be hard to stomach. Bring things that will keep well without refrigeration and do not require much if any preparation.Be aware that, depending upon procedure, specific health conditions, or your reason for hospitalization, this may not be recommended. You may have specific dietary recommendations to follow while in the hospital. Check with your doctor first.


Consider bringing granola bars, pastries, and fruit.
Sugary treats are tempting, but they aren’t particularly good for your health. If you are in the hospital, they might not be the best option for you.

, Consider bringing your body wash, toothpaste, toothbrush, brush, shampoo, powder, and deodorant. The hospital should have some of these things, but they are typically of low quality. If you are attached to a particular product, especially a luxury product like a moisturizer, consider bringing it with you.

, Unless you want to share your rear end with the rest of the hospital, for the sake of your fellow patients, you should consider bringing something that is comfortable and covers you up better than a hospital gown. Bring non-slip slippers so that you can get in and out of bed with ease. If you are inclined to be cold, consider bringing a hat or coat as well.Alternatively, ask your nurse for multiple hospital gowns. You can wear one facing forward, the other backward, so that you are fully covered up.The hospital may also have pajama pants or a robe you can wear.

Ask for a longer bed.,
Ask for extra blankets.,
Ask if you can go on a walk.,
Move around a bit.,
Appreciate your caregivers.",How to Make Your Hospital Stay More Comfortable3," If you are tall, you might find your hospital bed a bit cramped. Most hospital beds, however, can be lengthened. When you nurse seems to have a little bit of time, ask if you can have your bed lengthened., Hospital mattresses are generally encased in plastic. Though there should be a fitted sheet on top of the plastic, this can make the mattress hot and get your bed sweaty. Ask for a couple of extra blankets to place under you for more comfortable bedding.Ask about warm blankets — many hospitals can bring you a warm blanket for additional comfort.

, If you have someone to accompany you, your nurse might be willing to let you go for a walk. This can be a welcome relief when you’ve been stuck in the same room for an extended period of time. If you are having trouble walking around, ask your nurse for a wheelchair.

, If you lie in the same place for too long, it will detrimentally affect your circulation and may ultimately produce bedsores. The nurses and certified nursing assistants are trained to help prevent bedsores, but you can also do your part by moving around a bit yourself if you can. This might mean getting up for a walk, but even moving around to different positions in the bed can help. Try to reposition yourself a little bit every couple of hours.

, You are more likely to get good care if you are nice and appreciative with your nurses. Ring for help only when you need it. How much your nurses visits will vary considerably with the severity of your condition.


After surgery, you are likely to be checked on every two to four hours. As time goes on you will be checked on less frequently.Remember that you are not the only patient in the hospital, and the nurse has many patients she must care for. It is important to be patient while being a patient.

Congrats, you've made your very own little 'Ill Pack'!
",How to Make a Kit for When You're Ill," You will need an old pencil case or make-up bag, or anything that is small and has a zipper. Make sure you don't buy anything too small, since you will need to put a lot of things inside your bag.
, These things are good to have with you when you are ill to prevent anything bad from happening. If you need more than just the items on this list, then make sure you add that too! These things include:

Tissues - you will want to put at least two packets in, as you never know when your nose won't stop leaking.
Lip Balm - tin or stick, it's never nice to have cracked lips.
Throat Sweets - they will line your throat when it needs a little help.
Mints - when you can't taste anything, a good chewing gum or mint is always nice.
Hand sanitizer - when you have just coughed, and your hands have lots of germs on.

, These items are not urgent, but very good to have at hand in your bag. These things include:

Camomile Teabags - when you fill a bowl of hot water, and add the teabags, you can get rid of mucus quick and easy.
Medicine - liquid or tablet, make sure you have some. If you have liquid, remember to take a meds spoon.
Ill Notes - for when you feel too sick to do P.E., or so the school knows you're taking medicine. Make your parents write at least three of them, signed.
Mini Handwarmers - good when you feel cold inside and out, and you need a bit of warmth.
Chocolate - when you're sick, you need a little treat to get you through the day!

, Put it at the bottom of your school bag or your locker, and get it out when you're feeling very sick. If you want, you can make more than one, and put them in various places if you have enough money and your parents approve.,"

Avoid slouching when you sit.,
Sleep on a supportive mattress.,
Do the wall test.,
Check your posture in the mirror.,
Strengthen your core muscles.",How to Grow Taller Overnight1," It is easy to have bad posture when you are sitting. You should always sit with your back straight, your shoulders back, and with your buttocks touching the back of your chair. If you are always slouching when you sit, your muscles can become weak and your spine may be fixed in an abnormal position. This can make you look appear shorter than you are.If you have to sit for long periods of time, try to stand up or walk around every 30 minutes if you can.
Keep your feet flat on the floor while you are sitting and your knees at a 90 degree angle. You may need to use a footrest or stool to maintain the proper position.;
, Find a mattress that offers good back support. Try out different mattresses before you buy one. If you sleep on your stomach, you will need a firmer mattress than people that sleep on their back or their side. You will spend about 1/3 of your life sleeping, so think of a quality mattress as an investment.Sleeping on your back puts the least amount of pressure on your spine. If you can not sleep on your back, try sleeping on your side. Stomach sleeping should be your last option.
If you sleep on your side, use one pillow for your head and place another pillow between your legs to keep your spine in alignment.
Support your neck with a pillow that fills in the natural curve of your neck.

, The wall test can help you determine your posture and identify any areas that need improvement. Stand with your back of your head and buttocks touching the wall. Your heels should be six inches from the baseboard. Once you are in this position, check the distance between your neck and the wall and your lower back and the wall.Your lower back should be one or two inches from the wall. Your neck should be two inches from the wall.
It may be helpful to have someone else measure for you.

, Stand sideways in front of the mirror. Your head should be straight and not bending forwards or backwards. Your chin should should be parallel to the floor. Your shoulders should be in line with your ears, and your stomach should be flat. Your lower back should have a slight forward curve (i.e. not too flat, not too curved, not a hollow back).It may be easier to evaluate your posture by having someone take a picture of you in this position.
Make sure you do this exercise in a full length mirror so you can see your entire body.

, Your lower back muscles and abdominal muscles make up your core muscles. These muscles connect to your spine and pelvis and help you have good posture. Strengthening these muscles can improve your posture.Exercises you should try include planks, standing abdominal exercises, and lower back exercises.
Stop doing any of these exercise if you experience pain. If you have severe back pain, see a doctor before you begin doing core exercise.While strengthening your core muscles won't make you grow taller overnight, it will help you improve your posture over time so that you will look taller for long term purposes.

, Having a well-balanced diet is one of the most important parts of maintaining a generally healthy body. Without a balanced diet, it'll be very difficult to maintain proper health.A balanced diet means that you consume foods from each food group most, if not every day.
In addition, you should consume a variety of foods within each food group. Having a wide variety of foods from food groups will allow you to consume a variety of different nutrients.Lastly, a balanced diet means eating the right proportions or servings of each food.If you eat mostly protein foods but very few fruits or vegetables, your diet isn't balanced. Following the appropriate portion sizes of each food group: 3-4 oz (card deck sized) of protein,1 cup vegetables or 2 cups leafy greens,1/2 cup chopped or one small piece of fruit,and 1 oz or 1/2 cup of grains.Balance your meals and snacks during the day. Aim for three to four servings of protein daily, five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables, and three to four servings of grains (1/2 being whole)., Protein is an essential nutrient in your diet. It will provide the building blocks for many functions of your body including maintaining lean muscle mass, rebuilding cells and supporting your immune system.Lean protein sources include: poultry, eggs, seafood, lean beef, pork, legumes (nuts and beans) and tofu.
Lean protein sources are low in fat and calories. This helps you get in adequate amounts each day without going over your daily calorie limit.
Consuming adequate amounts of protein has also been associated with a general healthy body. Some of these include: better management of your appetite and a healthy weight, support healthy cholesterol and lipid levels and better management of diabetes., Fruits and vegetables are two of the most important food groups. These foods contain the highest amount of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.High amounts of fruits and vegetables in the diet have been associated with a variety of beneficial effects on your general health including: decreased blood pressure, better management of blood sugar and diabetes, decreased risk of stroke and heart disease, prevent some types of cancers and decrease risk of blindness.Another thing to note about fruits and vegetables is that each color of vegetable or fruit contains different types of beneficial nutrients. In addition to eating adequate servings each day, make sure to choose a variety of different colors of items., Whole grain foods have been associated with a variety of beneficial health effects to help promote a general healthy body. Try making more of your grain choices whole.


Refined grains, or those that are more processed and not whole do not have as many nutritional benefits compared to whole grains. They're typically lower in fiber, protein and other beneficial nutrients.Whole grains to try include: 100% whole wheat pasta and bread, brown rice, whole grain oats, farro, millet, quinoa and barley.
Although all your grain choices may not be whole grains, health experts recommend trying to make at least 1/2 of them 100% whole grain. Some of the health benefits associated with whole grains include: increased fiber and other beneficial nutrients, reduced risk of heart disease diabetes and some cancers.If you are trying to lose weight, try limiting your carbohydrate intake.

, Although there is a wide range of processed foods (including both nutritious and unhealthy options), many are higher in calories, fat, sugar and preservatives.Most health experts recommend limiting processed foods or junk foods or eating them in moderation. Although they may not be the most nutritious choice, the occasional treat is appropriate.
Choose wisely when you're eating more indulgent items. Foods like chips, crackers, sweetened beverages, frozen meals, fast food, pastries or sweets shouldn't be a daily occurrence.
There are plenty of foods that are still considered very healthy and nutritious yet are still considered ""processed."" These are OK to eat on a regular basis. Some items include: canned vegetables (look for cans that say ""low-sodium""), frozen vegetables and fruit, pre washed lettuce and salad greens, and dairy products., Water is a vital nutrient in your diet and plays many important roles in your body. If you do not consume enough hydrating fluids each day, you run the risk of being dehydrated.Most adults need at least eight 8-oz glasses of hydrating fluids daily. However some experts recommend consuming up to 10–13 glasses daily.If you are physically active or perspire a lot during the day or during physical activity, you'll need to replace the fluid lost in addition to your regular daily intake.Consume caffeine-free and sugar-free beverages, as these are the healthiest and most hydrating. Items like water, flavored water, decaf coffee and decaf tea are appropriate.
Dehydration has many negative side effects ranging from very minimal issues to more serious health effects. Some include: fatigue, mental fogginess, headaches, mood swings, kidney stones and urinary tract infections., Some health and nutrition experts may recommend taking a daily multivitamin. These ""all-in-one"" supplements can serve as a back up to the days you do not eat a healthy diet or are unable to meet all of your nutrient needs through foods.Supplements may also be beneficial for those with food allergies or intolerances, are very picky eaters or have dietary restrictions (like vegetarians or vegans).
Supplements are not designed to replace food or to make up the majority of nutrient needs. Those who eat a healthy diet generally do not need to take supplements. In addition, if you have a healthy diet and lifestyle, vitamin supplements will not improve your health, cure or improve disease. They are only there as a backup.Always talk to your doctor about what supplements may be appropriate for you — supplements can interact with medications and are not always safe for everyone. Also inform all physicians of what supplements you're taking, how much and how often.

Write out your goal.,
Come up with a workout schedule.,
Decide between the gym or home exercise.,
Include cardio and strength training each week.,
Schedule some trial runs.,
Plan an exercise date.,
Keep your routine fresh.,
Make exercise fun.,
Plan rewards for yourself.",How to Have a Simple Workout Plan and Stick to It," If you want to start a simple workout plan and stick to it, it'll be helpful to have a set of clearly written out and specific goals.This may help you tailor your workouts to meet your needs.


Think about why you want to workout. Is it to lose weight? Is it to tone up your muscles? Or do you just want to feel more active?
Make your goals clear, timely and specific. These characteristics help make goals more realistic for you.For example, instead of saying ""I want to work out each week,"" say ""I want to jog three times a week for 35 minutes and do two days of strength training for 20 minutes.""
Knowing what your goal is and what you want to get out of your workouts will help you design a simple workout plan.;
, It can be hard to stick to a workout program if you don't know how to fit it into your busy life. Before you get started, draft up a workout schedule for your week. This may make it easier for you to stay on track with your exercise routine.Write out your schedule for the week. Schedule in each workout session that you plan on doing throughout the week. Note the time, location and what you're going to do.
Seeing your week at a glance can also help you see whether or not you're meeting the recommended goals of either 150 minutes of cardio or 40 minutes of strength training. You can adjust if needed.
In addition, keeping a regular weekly workout schedule and adding your exercise sessions in like an appointment may make it easier for you to stick to.
Some examples of a simple week's worth of exercise could be: doing a 10 minute walk three times a day for five days of the week, plus two at-home strength training sessions; or jogging for 45 minutes three times a week plus a 60-minute strength training class; or doing two 60-minute kickboxing classes per week plus a 60-minute spin class in addition to two bodyweight sessions weekly.

, After writing out your goals and looking at your schedule, think about where you'll be doing your exercise. Do you prefer going to the gym or sticking around home?


Gyms offer you a variety of benefits. You will have access to a large variety of cardio machines, weight machines and free weights and group classes. Some gyms may even have a pool or offer discounted personal training.
However, gyms generally come with a monthly cost. If a gym membership isn't right for you or you do not feel comfortable going to a gym, consider working out at home or around your neighborhood.
You can do a variety of workouts at home or around your home. If you have a safe neighborhood you can walk or jog. You can also do workout DVD's or online exercise programs in the comfort of your own home.
If you look at your schedule and find you're strapped for time, working out from home may be a good choice.

, Even if you're interested in a more simple workout routine, it's still important to include both cardio and strength training exercises. Both have a variety of health benefits and may help you reach some of your goals.


Cardio is any exercise that increases your heart rate and breathing pace. It's generally associated with decreased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, improved mood and sleep patterns and supports a healthy weight.Cardio can be anything that gets you to sweat a bit. For example: dancing, swimming, hiking, walking, stationary bikes, treadmills,stair climbers, or the elliptical machine. Aim for 150 minutes a week.Strength training offers you a different set of health benefits like improved bone density, decreased risk of osteoporosis and increased lean muscle mass. Go for 40 minutes weekly of activities like weight lifting, bodyweight exercises, or resistance tubing., You've got your goals written out, you've decided where you're going to exercise and you know to include cardio and strength exercises. Now it's time to try out different exercises to see which ones fit best into your lifestyle.


Take a week or two and try out different exercises, different times of day and different locations. This will help you see which things you truly enjoy and can actually fit into your lifestyle realistically.
Try waking up 30 minutes early and go for a quick jog or walk. If that doesn't work well, try doing a 30 minute walk on your lunch break or driving right to the gym after work.
You should also try different types of exercises. Maybe you don't enjoy running indoors, but love going for a jog outside. Try different cardio machines, try both indoor and outdoor activities and try group classes.

, Whether you meet up with a friend or family member or make friends with others in a regular group class, having that accountability with someone else makes you more likely to show up for your workout.Working out with others is a great way to get activity but also be social and have fun.Try going to group gym classes or asking friends, family members or co-workers to meet up for a quick exercise session.

, One reason people may drop their workouts or regular exercise routine is out of boredom. It can get old doing the same workout every week.


Try switching up the types of exercise you do. Exercising doesn't always mean going for a jog. Add in a few different types of cardio that you enjoy. Even playing exercise-based video games can count!Also try to change up the location of your workouts. It's great to work out in a gym when it's cold or rainy. But hit a scenic trail or hiking trail if the weather is nice., If you're not having fun or not enjoying exercise you might not stick with it long-term.There are a variety of activities that can count as exercise that are fun and exciting. Think about things that might not seem like traditional exercise but make you stay active. For example, plan a weekend hike or kayaking trip.
You can also play for exercise. If you enjoy playing sports like soccer, basketball or softball, sign up for a work team or local intramural team.

, Setting up rewards for yourself when you meet goals or stick with them long-term may be able to keep you motivated to exercise.Think about things that would be enticing to you. Maybe a new exercise shirt, new songs for your jogging playlist or a new set of walking shoes.
Also consider internal rewards. After you exercise think about how good you feel and the health benefits that you reap by exercising regularly.

Create a monochrome outfit.,
Tailor your clothing.,
Wear heels.,
Avoid wide belts.",How to Grow Taller Overnight2," An outfit that has clean lines in one color will make you appear taller. The darker the colors, the taller you will appear.

If you wear flats, try a pair of pointy toe shoes to elongate your legs.
Pairing your heels with a high-waisted skirt or high-waisted pants will make you look even taller.

, A skinny belt helps define your waist without cutting your body in half. Wearing a wide belt will actually make you look shorter.Your belt should be the same color or a similar color to your pants. A contrasting belt color will draw attention to your waist and make you look shorter.

Consider getting a moisturizer with an SPF.The sun effectively destroys our skin cells and one of the secrets to keeping skin fresh and young-looking is to incorporate a moisturizer with sun protection into our daily skin care regimens.Try getting a moisturizer with a 15-30 SPF (sun protection factor).,
Apply the moisturizer.",How to Give Yourself a Deep Cleansing Facial," Washing your face removes all of the oil, sunscreen and everyday pollutants from the environment that rest on the facial skin. It also helps prevent clogged pores, which in turn reduces the likelihood of developing breakouts. Finally, cleansing your face helps prepare the skin to absorb the products that you plan to apply to it.


Washing your face is something that you should do at least twice a day, even if you don't plan on giving yourself a full facial.;
, Wash your hands thoroughly and remove all of the makeup from your face.


Use your regular makeup remover to clear your face of any products.

, There are plenty of options out there, from $1 beauty bars to $40 cleansing lotions. Many estheticians, however, note that you don't have to spend a ton of money on a cleanser and that it is more important that you get something that is specific to your skin type.As a general rule, gel and foam cleansers are more suited for combination/oily skin, while cream cleansers are more suited for normal/dry skin types because they add a little extra hydration to the face.
If you have mild acne, you might want to try a cleanser with salicylic acid in it. Salicylic acid helps unclog pores to resolve and prevent lesions on the skin. One good option are Neutrogena's Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream or Power-Foam washes., You can also make your own cleanser using a few ingredients you probably already have on hand. Here are a couple of options:


Mix together 3 tbsp fresh apple juice, 6 tbsp whole milk and 2 tbsp honey. If you want the cleanser to be more of a warming cleanser, then pop the honey in the microwave for 10 seconds before you add it to the other ingredients.
Place 1/2 tablespoon of oats in a food processor and pulse until powdered. Then add 1 tablespoon almonds and pulse until powdered. Mix in 1/4 teaspoon of honey and 1/4 spoon of soy milk., Wet the skin using warm water. Then, apply a quarter-sized amount of cleanser to your face with an outward circular motion.


Once washed, rinse your face clean with warm water and pat it dry. Rubbing the skin vigorously on a towel will only redden and irritate your facial skin.

, Apply a spot treatment that you can purchase or make at home. Salicylic acid is one of the most commonly used acne spot treatments because it works to clear out the clogged poor and get rid of dead skin cells that help facilitate break outs. Benzoyl peroxide is another commonly used acne spot treatment, which works by killing the bacteria that causes acne, which in turn alleviates the inflammation caused by said bacteria.Some recommended spot treatments include Malin+Goetz Acne Treatment with active sulfur and salicylic acid and Clean and Clear Persa-Gel 10, which is a 10% benzoyl peroxide solution.For a DIY spot treatment, apply either tea tree oil or toothpaste to the affected area. Tea tree oil, which is an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory oil, is a great home remedy for people with sensitive skin, because it doesn't typically dry out or redden the skin like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid do.Dermatologists, however, recommend applying spot treatments conservatively to avoid overusing these products which can result in redness, dryness and flaking of the skin. Make sure that you're only using a pea-sized amount of any spot treatment., Exfoliation helps get rid of dead skin cells, which can clog up your pores and contribute to breakouts. In addition, exfoliation brightens your skin and gives it a nice glow, whereas skin that isn't exfoliated can have a ""dull"" appearance.Proper and regular exfoliation can also make you look younger because it exposes the new, fresh layers of skin beneath the old ones., There are plenty of skincare products that can you purchase from any drugstore to exfoliate your skin. Look for something that mentions exfoliation on the bottle, or defines itself as a ""scrub"" (intended to ""scrub"" away all the dead skin cells). If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you might consider a scrub with salicylic acid.


You can also buy products with gentle abrasive ingredients, such as jojoba beans, rice grains or corneal. These help with the ""scrubbing action"". Some products can have sharper particles, such as apricot pits and shells. If you have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, it's best to avoid these type of exfoliators., There are a number of DIY exfoliating scrubs that you can make right into your own home. Here are some options:


Mix together 1 mashed banana, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup soft brown sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1/4 tsp vitamin E. The sugar is the exfoliating agent, as it acts like little microbeads that clear off dead skin cells.
Blend a half dozen fresh strawberries with 1/4 cup of milk. The enzymes in the strawberries dissolve dead skin cells and the milk helps to soothe the area afterward.Combine 1 teaspoon of honey and 1 teaspoon olive oil. Separately, prepare a package of plain oatmeal. Use less water than the instructions call for so the oatmeal turns into a thick paste. Then add the honey-olive oil mixture to the oatmeal. The oatmeal exfoliates, while the honey-olive oil mix hydrates., Be gentle. A light, circular motion is all that is needed to slough off dead skin cells. If you scrub vigorously, you'll just end up with red and irritated skin.Rinse off with warm water and pat dry.

, Use a lip scrub to buff away any dead skin on your lips. For a DIY lip scrub, you can either use a damp toothbrush in gentle circular motions or mix together caster sugar and any oil of your choice, until you reach your desired consistency.


Once you've scrubbed the lips apply a lip balm to seal in the moisture. You can even make your own lip balm right at home.

, Steaming cleanses and deep cleans your pores because you sweat out a lot of impurities in the process, including pimples, blackheads, etc. In addition, the steam also hydrates both the deeper and outer layers of the facial skin and helps to reduce the size of your pores.

, You'll want the water very hot so it can effectively steam your face, so boil some water in your tea kettle or on the stove. You can then put the water in a large bowl or in your bathroom sink. Wait a few minutes to let the water cool just slightly so you do not burn your face.If you use a bowl, make sure it can handle boiling hot liquids.

, Place your face over the bowl for 2-5 minutes. To trap the steam so it goes directly to your pores to open them up, place a towel over your head to create a tent., To boost up the steam, snip open a bag of green tea, and add the contents to the water. You could also a few drops of essential oils, like lavender.

, A mask further cleanses the pores and removes impurities from the skin. You can also use hydrating masks that add moisturizing properties to your skin.

, If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you should get a mask with clay or sulfur to draw out impurities, such as Kiehl's Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Mask. If you have dry skin, use a hydrating mask, such as Nügg Hydrating Face Mask., If you don't want to purchase a mask, you can also make your own. Combine 1/2 teaspoon avocado, 1/2 teaspoon honey, 1/2 teaspoon yogurt, 1/8 teaspoon Brewer's Yeast, and 1/2 teaspoon cranberry, apple juice or kombucha in a food processor. Pulse until creamy and mixed together.Here are also some options for different skin types:


For normal or dry skin: Mix together 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup honey, 3 tbsp cream, and 3 tbsp oats.
For normal to oily skin: Mix together 1/2 cup pureed raspberries, 1/2 oats, and 1/4 cup honey.

, Rub the mask into your skin, avoiding the eyes and mouth area. Let the mask sit for 10-15 minutes to let it set. Don't, however, let it get to the crumbly, mummified stage. Remove the mask with warm water and a soft washcloth.If you feel any burning or warming sensations while the mask is setting, remove it. Your skin may be getting irritated.
When removing the mask, don't abrasively scrub it off, but instead let the warm water do its work to flush the mask out and off of your skin.

, Moisturizing is a key part of any skin care routine. Because moisturizers hydrate the skin, they help the face look healthy, smooth, and fresh.Moisturizing also has long-term benefits. Hydration is what enables skin to function at peak performance, meaning that skin cells can repair themselves quickly and turn-over fresh cells. This has huge anti-aging advantages in the long term. Studies have shown that people who use moisturizer develop wrinkles at a fraction of the rate of those with dry skin., You'll want to choose a moisturizer based on your skin type. If you have oily skin, look for lotions or gels instead of creams. If you have dry skin, look for a cream, which has more oil in it. The greater the oil content, the better absorption of the moisturizer into the skin to hydrate the tissue. If you have combination skin, try a lotion with no acids, such as Cetaphil, Aveeno, Neutrogena or Lubriderm.Avoid choosing a very light moisturizer for after a facial. Your skin has just been deep cleaned and will need to be replenished with moisture. Otherwise, the lack of moisture in the skin will cause it to begin to overproduce oil and clog your pores, which in turn will lead to break-outs.

, Recent studies have shown that higher SPF products are not any more effective and, moreover, that they may not be as high an SPF as advertised.One option is Neutrogena's Oil Free Facial Moisturizer with a 15 sunblock or Clinique's Superdefense Daily Dense Moisturizer SPF 25.

, Gently use your finger tips to massage the moisturizer into your skin, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies of your face.


Be sure as well to moisturize your neck - the skin there also deserves attention!

Nutrition.,

Visit a medical professional.",How to Grow Taller," Height is a polygenic trait, meaning that it's influenced by several different genes. Having two short parents doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be short, just as having two tall parents won't make you a towering giant. However, if most of the people on both sides of your family are short, then odds are that you'll be short, too. Don't be discouraged, though. The truth is that you can't know how tall you'll be until you reach full physical adulthood in your mid-twenties.


Calculate your projected height. Working in inches or centimeters, you can try to predict your height based on the height of your parents.

Add up your mom and dad's heights (in inches or cm).
Add 5 inches (13 cm) if you're a boy; subtract 5 inches (13 cm) if you're a girl.
Divide by 2.
The answer is your predicted height, give or take 4 inches (10 cm). Note that this isn't an absolute calculation, but it should be pretty close.;
, There might not be a lot you can do to increase your height, but you can take several steps to make sure your natural height isn't shortened by environmental influences. Drugs and alcohol are both thought to contribute to stunted growth if they're ingested while you're young, and malnutrition can keep you from reaching your full height, as well.



Does caffeine really stunt your growth? Scientific study shows that caffeine does not stunt growth.Caffeine does, however, have a higher chance of keeping you from sleeping soundly and regularly. Kids and adolescents need about around 9 1/2 hours of sleep, and caffeine may hurt your ability to get that much sleep.

Does smoking really stunt your growth? The effects of smoking and second-hand smoke on body mass index (BMI) are inconclusive, however, according to Columbia University's Internet Health Resource: ""the available research suggests that children who smoke, or who are exposed to second-hand smoke are shorter than those who do not smoke or are children of non-smokers.""Do steroids really stunt your growth? Absolutely. Anabolic steroids inhibit bone growth in young children and teens, along with lowering sperm count, decreasing breast size, elevating blood pressure and putting you at higher risk of heart attack.Children and teens who suffer from asthma and use inhalers that dispense small doses of the steroid budesonide are, on average, half an inch shorter than those not treated with steroids., Research suggests that growing teenagers and pre-teens need between 8.5 and 11 hours of sleep every night. Most of your growing takes place while sleeping. This is because your body grows and regenerates tissue while you're at rest. Make your sleeping environment as calm as possible, and try to eliminate loud noises and unnecessary light. If you have trouble falling asleep, try taking a warm bath or drinking a hot cup of chamomile tea before bed. Not getting enough hours of sleep will stunt your growth.


The human growth hormone (HGH) is produced naturally in our bodies, especially during deep or slow wave sleep. Getting good, sound sleep will encourage the production of HGH, which is created in the pituitary gland.
As a hormone, HGH is sometimes injected into the bloodstream under the supervision of a licensed doctor. HGH creams, powders, pills or non-prescription injections are medically suspect and can have serious side effects.Talk with your doctor before starting any course of HGH treatment.
Keep your body as straight as possible while sleeping. Your spine must be straight as possible. Lie on your back with your arms and legs stretched toward the foot of the bed. Do not exert any effort or pressure to stretch your limbs. Allow your body to be completely relaxed. You may let your head turn to the right or left and bend your arms if it is more comfortable to you. The important thing is to keep your body (torso and legs) as straight as possible. This position may prove to be uncomfortable for the first few nights, but your body will soon become accustomed to this manner of sleeping and before long you will discover not only extra inches, but also a more comfortable sleep.
Kick the 'pillow habit'. This is a very common mistake made by most of us because we are led to believe that a pillow allows for a more comfortable night's sleep so, through habit, we become attached and generally accept this as the most comfortable way to sleep. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The use of a pillow is an incorrect form of sleeping and should be avoided. While lying on your back with your head resting on a pillow, your neck is bent forward in a very unnatural position. In this position, your head is being pushed forward and your back is arched, also a very unnatural position. If you suffer from frequent neck or back pains, in the majority of cases you can probably blame in your pillow or mattress.
Make sure your mattress is firm and capable of giving your body full support. This is aid to in keeping you spine as straight as possible while sleeping. A soft or sagging mattress will tend to bend the spine and curve the torso in a sinking effect, which must be avoided. A good mattress will support the whole body, which will keep in a straight posture setting - a must for obtaining greater height. 


, Ensuring that you're getting all the vitamins and minerals that your body requires will help you grow to your full height. Include all of the following substances in your meals. Take a supplement targeted at your age group with breakfast each morning, and try to incorporate certain foods into your diet. Here are some specific suggestions:


Make sure to take in an abundance of carbohydrates and calories for that is where the body gains its energy to grow.
Get plenty of calcium (found in dairy products and green vegetables). Calcium promotes bone growth and can help prevent osteoporosis.
Taking 500 mg of niacin has shown to significantly increase growth hormone levels only when taken on an empty stomach.
Get sufficient vitamin D (which can be obtained through eating fish, alfalfa, or mushrooms, or spending enough time in the sun). Vitamin D promotes bone and muscle growth in children, and a deficiency has been shown to stunt growth and cause weight gain in teenage girls. If you don't like fish, consider a purified fish oil supplement (purifying removes mercury).
Take in a lots of lean protein (from meat, cheese, eggs, beans, tofu, seeds, or legumes). Proteins provide an essential building block your body needs in order to grow. At least one (preferably two) of your meals each day should include a high-quality protein.
If you think that the amount of protein in your diet is low then take protein powder once or twice a day.
Up your zinc intake (oysters, chocolate, peanuts, eggs, peas, asparagus, and supplements). A zinc deficiency can cause stunted growth in children . The best way to make sure you meet your body's daily need is by taking a vitamin or supplement that includes zinc.
Eat on a regular schedule. You should be eating 3 meals a day, with small snacks between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner. Try to schedule these events at roughly the same time each day. 4-5 hours is the time needed for insulin to disappear from your bloodstream so that growth hormone can work on building your tissue. This is the period of time that you should wait between meals. Proteins, which are absorbed slowly, should keep you from becoming hungry. Your last meal should be 3-4 hours before you go to sleep. Small amount of protein shake are allowed right before your bedtime.
Eat a steady amount of food. That's why dieting is not recommended as long as you're still growing. Not eating a good quantity of food will deprive your body of the substances detailed above, therefore stunting your growth. If you want to lose weight, decrease the amount of fats, sugar, and carbohydrates from your alimentation, but eat the rest of the foods in good, moderate amounts. Also, try losing weight through sports. After all, you can still lose weight later, but you must take the most out of your adolescence if you want to grow taller.


, Some childhood illnesses can stunt your growth. Most of them can be avoided by the routine immunizations you may have had as a baby, but stay on the safe side by ingesting plenty of Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruits, and lemons) and getting plenty of rest as soon as you notice that you feel sick.


Keep your immune system strong by eating whole, fresh foods. Try to avoid processed foods, foods with empty calories or high levels of fat, and hydrogenated foods, such as margarine or shortening.
Eat a wide variety of healthy foods. Eating one thing such as açaí berries or salmon for every meal, while not harmful, doesn't do all that much to keep your immune system at its strongest. Eat a variety of fruits, plenty vegetables, whole grains, protein sources such as milk, cheese, nuts and fish, and other foods rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids for a healthier immune system. Water is the basic solvent for all the products of digestion. It is essential for removing waste from our bodies and 6 to 8 glasses daily is considered healthy.


, Sadly, if your growth plates have closed as due to your age, exercising will not affect your growth rate.But if you enjoy swimming, biking, running, or yoga, among other sports, and you haven't stopped growing, exercise combined with the right diet and proper sleep should help you grow.


Doing stretches has some beneficial effects. Stretching is the most effective form of exercising when it comes to height increase. Doing intense stretching exercises can add a few extra inches to your height, even short after growth has stopped. For best results, you should do these exercise two times a day, after you wake up and before you go to bed. Start with easy exercises, then gradually move on to the more difficult ones.
Tickle Massage. This works best if somebody else does it for you: Massage your knee for 5-10 minutes. This should be very ticklish to some others. Massaging your knees with your hands allows your knees to release growth chemicals that helps you grow your bones.


, Many people rob themselves of extra height because they fail to realize that a good posture is essential for maximum height increase. Correct posture involves more than just standing straight and erect. You must train each part of your body to maintain its proper position. You must learn how to hold your head, your pelvis, your legs, sit correctly, walk correctly, plus numerous other do's and don'ts to assure you of achieving every possible inch of height. If you stand up straight, your bones will grow straight, and you won't get osteoporosis, which will obviously make you look shorter. So when you stand up and sit up straighter, not only will you look taller, but you will feel taller, and maybe even be taller.


Try the Alexander technique for better posture. Used by trained singers and actors, the Alexander technique improves posture by employing what the founder of the technique, F. Matthias Alexander, called ""good use of the body."" Classes teaching the technique are popular.

, Being taller might be nice, but it can't make up for a general lack of confidence. Participate in clubs, apply yourself in school, and make sure to take on a hobby you are successful with. These will all boost your mood, and a positive attitude will more than make up for any lacking height.

, If you come from a tall family and you're not growing by your mid-teens, or if your height hasn't changed much from before puberty to during puberty, then it's a good idea to see a doctor. Conditions that can stunt your growth (such as human growth hormone deficiency or autoimmune diseases) are fairly rare, but they do exist. If you're eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of rest, but you're still not growing, then it's time to consult a doctor.


Consider seeing a doctor, if you're a short adult. Though there are several childhood conditions (such as rickets) that can result in a short height as an adult, you should still ask a doctor about it. There may be ways to make sure that your bones and organs are healthy, even though you didn't grow to your full height.

Exercise.",How to Give Your Body a Basic Post Christmas Detox," On the outside of the body exfoliation and dry body brushing are fantastic ways to help to boost circulation and improve the appearance of dulling skin. They will both provide a great boost if you’ve neglected your face and body lately. It is best to use a gentle exfoliation mask or face wash every two days in your first week of detox, then drop back to once a week as you do not want to damage delicate facial skin. The body, however, will benefit from dry brushing everyday. Invest in a body brush and brush your skin daily, towards the heart, from your feet upwards, for glowing skin.;
, Most of us consume more rich foods and alcohol than usual over the festive period and now is the time to cleanse the body of those additional toxins. A great first step is to start each day with a cup or glass of warm pre-boiled, or cold bottled water, with the juice of a fresh lemon added. This is a fantastic detoxifier and your body will thank you for it! Avoid alcohol completely for the period of your detox and it is also preferable to avoid caffeine. If you don’t feel able to give up caffeine altogether another great tip is to swap your usual cup of tea or coffee for green tea. Green tea is full of antioxidants but as it does still contain caffeine we would suggest keeping it at one or two cups maximum per day. If a sweetening is required we would recommend a teaspoon of Manuka honey as the best choice. Smoking should also be avoided.

, Give your body a break from heavy, rich or processed foods including red meat and products that contain wheat. Keep dairy to a minimum but a probiotic yoghurt or boiled/poached egg is fine. Smoothies and homemade vegetable soups provide a great meal alternative on a detox and, if you can manage it, a day or two on blended fruit or vegetables alone would be the ideal start. If this is too ambitious try replacing your breakfast with a smoothie and your evening meal with a homemade soup and go for fish or chicken with rice or vegetables as your main meal.

, Patchouli, lemon, juniper, grapefruit or geranium oils are all great for detox. Add 6-8 drops to your bathwater or 2-4 drops to a carrier oil for detox massage. It is essential that you patch test any oils that you have not previously used 48 hours before including in your detox to check for any sensitivity.

, Exercise is a very valuable addition to any detox plan but don’t worry, it doesn’t have to be too full on. Yoga is a fantastic option for both mind and body and as little as ten minutes in the morning and ten in the evening will help you to remain focused, relaxed and better able to deal with cravings.

,
Take supplements with Vitamin E. Most supplements provide alpha-tocopherol, one type of Vitamin E, while foods provide mixed tocopherols, a full spectrum of Vitamin E. In addition, synthetic forms of alpha-tocopherol contain eight possible chemical subtypes but only four of these chemicals are useful for the human body because of the stereoisomers that result from the synthetic process.",How to Get Vitamin E," Vitamin E is an antioxidant, meaning that it protects cells from the damage that can be caused by oxidizing agents, such as free radicals. Vitamin E is also important to the immune system, cell signaling, the expression of some genes, and a variety of chemical reactions in the body.Aalpha-tocopherol, a serum containing vitamin E, may slow down tumor growth, as well as reducing the risk of heart disease.The liver absorbs alpha-tocopherol and then re-secretes it and distributes it throughout the body. Alpha-tocopherol functions as a potent antioxidant and protects cells from the damage that can be caused by high levels of free radicals (substances produced normally in all cells) and other oxidizing agents.;
, This means that it may possibly prevent heart attacks. 


Vitamin E also supports the immune system and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent.

, Vitamin E has some very specific health uses according to some medical experts. There are four main conditions that vitamin E has been said to help prevent or treat.Heart disease: Vitamin E may prevent the oxidation of LDL-cholesterol. This is believed to help prevent atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Vitamin E may also prevent platelets from aggregating and forming clots in the arteries around the heart — this is a major cause of heart attacks. Large studies have indicated that people who have higher vitamin E intakes tend to have lower rates of heart disease. There is no guarantee, of course, and some of the research is not as supportive of vitamin E as others are.
Cancer: Cancer represents well over 100 different diseases, so it may not be surprising that there are contradictions in the research on vitamin E and cancer. Several large and well-done trials have not found a significant benefit of taking supplemental Vitamin E. In fact, some studies have shown that taking supplemental vitamin E may increase the risk of prostate cancer.
Eye diseases: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts cause significant vision loss, especially in older people. One large well-designed trial found that vitamin E, along with beta-carotene, Vitamin C, zinc and copper did reduce the risk of developing AMD.
Memory and concentration: The research has been contradictory regarding using vitamin E to prevent memory loss and improve concentration.

, Vitamin E is fat soluble, so if you take too much vitamin E (usually as a supplement because it is really hard to get too much vitamin E from foods), it is stored in fatty tissue and can reach toxic levels.


The daily Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for vitamin E are 200 mg/300 IU (ages 1 – 3 years), 300 mg/450 IU (4 – 8 years), 600 mg/900 IU (9 – 13years), 800 mg/1200 IU (14 – 18 years) and 1000 mg/1500 IU (19 years and older).

, If you are taking any medication, talk to your physician before adding vitamin E as a supplement. Vitamin E can interact with a number of medications. These include: blood thinners (anticoagulants), anti-platelet agents such as aspirin, NSAIDs (such as Tylenol and ibuprofen), clopidogrel (Plavix), statins (that lower cholesterol levels), and chemotherapeutic drugs.


Some studies have shown increased risk of death for those individuals taking 400 IU or more daily. At this point we just don’t know enough about the effects of taking too much vitamin E in supplements. This is one reason many naturopathic physicians recommend getting your vitamin E by eating a selection of foods that contain the natural forms.

, Intake recommendations are made for various vitamins and minerals and other nutrients by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of The National Academies (formerly known as the National Academy of Sciences). These recommendations go through periodic reviews and represent the best recommendations that medical scientists can make. The FNB uses a number of different reference values:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): This is the “average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97% – 98%) healthy people.”
Adequate Intake (AI): This value is established when “evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA and is set at a level assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy.”
Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): This represents the “maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects.”

,, This means that if you get the synthetic forms of alpha-tocopherol you need to take about twice as much.


If you decide to get vitamin E supplements, most naturopathic physicians recommend a whole-food source of those vitamins. In other words, most naturopathic physicians would not recommend the synthetic forms.
In addition, because food sources contain the mixed tocopherols, if you get the whole-food source of Vitamin E, you will be getting the mixed tocopherols.
Supplements derived from whole foods generally have this information prominently displayed on the box. Brands include Nature’s Way, Garden of Life, Mega Food and Actives.

Experiment with herbs.,
Know when to see a physician.",How to Get Well Fast1," When you're sick, it's important to drink a lot of fluids. Water is the best beverage for staying hydrated, but juice and hot tea will also help.Staying hydrated can help loosen mucus in your sinuses.Hot beverages like tea can help relieve a sore throat and sinus problems, including runny nose, sneezing, and coughing.Adding honey may help further soothe a sore throat.Diluted sports drinks (mix one part water with one part sports drink) and electrolyte solutions can replenish essential minerals that may be lost through vomiting, sweating, or diarrhea.
Avoid alcohol, coffee, and soda.;
, Steam can help soothe sore throats and nasal congestion.You can use cool mist from a humidifier, or hot steam from a warm shower.You can also pour a bowl full of hot water and drape a towel over your head while breathing the steam from the bowl.


This method is not as effective for children younger than five. Often they are too young to know how to properly gargle., Rinsing your throat with saltwater can help soothe a sore or scratchy throat.To make an effective saltwater rinse, mix about half a teaspoon of salt in an eight ounce glass of warm water. Gargle, rinse, and repeat as necessary., Mucus buildup caused by colds and allergies can be painful, and may lead to infections.Blowing your nose offers temporary relief, but nasal irrigation can help remove pollen, dust, and dander, and may help reduce the chances of a sinus infection.Irrigating the sinuses can help relieve some cold symptoms, offering quick relief from a stuffy or runny nose.When flushing your sinuses, you must use sterilized or distilled water. You can buy a sterile solution at the drugstore. If this is not available, you can sterilize water by boiling it for five minutes, then allowing it to cool.There are many different types of sinus irrigation products available. Do not flush your sinuses if you are experiencing a fever, nosebleed, or severe headaches.Consult your physician to determine whether sinus irrigation can help you with your ailment.
If you're not comfortable flushing your sinuses, you can also try using over-the-counter saline sprays. These products are simply squirted into the nostrils to soothe irritation and relieve stuffiness., Over-the-counter medications can help relieve the symptoms of a cold or flu, and may help you get to sleep at night to ensure a restful sleep; however, children under six years of age should not be given any over-the-counter cold or cough medicine unless otherwise directed by your pediatrician.Antihistamines help reduce the body's response to allergens and can reduce runny noses and sinus congestion. Common antihistamines include cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra), and loratadine (Claritin).Cough medicine is available as both an antitussive, which suppresses the body's need to cough, and cough expectorants, which increase the production and secretion of mucus.A common antitussive is dextromethorphan (Triaminic Cold and Cough, Robitussin Cough), and the most common expectorant is guaifenesin (Mucinex, Robitussin Chest Congestion).Decongestants can help reduce congestion and open up nasal passages. This type of medication is often combined with antihistamines, cough suppressants, or pain relievers, and can be found in brands like Afrin and Sudafed.Pain relievers and fever reducers can help treat body aches, headaches, and fevers. Common pain relievers include aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen.Note that aspirin should never be given to children or teenagers, as it has been linked to a serious and potentially-fatal condition called Reye's syndrome., Studies have shown conflicting results on how effective vitamin supplements are in treating colds and illness. Some experts recommend vitamin C and zinc to help strengthen the immune system, but studies suggest that vitamin C must be taken consistently (not just at the beginning of an illness) to effectively strengthen the immune system. Care must be taken when using zinc supplements, as taking more than 50 mg per day over an extended period of time may cause health problems., Some studies suggest that certain herbs may help reduce the symptoms of colds and illness, though these products are not tested by regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, some herbs can cause side effects, especially when taken with other medications or supplements (this is known as the drug-herb interaction).As such, anyone wishing to experiment with herbal remedies should first consult a physician about what to try and how much to use. Common herbal remedies include:


Elderberry — Used to reduce congestion and promote sweating.Eucalyptus — Helps relieve coughs and cold symptoms. Commonly found in over-the-counter lozenges and cough syrups.Peppermint — Reduces congestion and soothes upset stomach. Peppermint should not be used with infants., Most colds and viruses will run their course within a few days, and typically do not require medical attention; however, some ailments are more serious and require a physician's diagnosis and treatment. Common illnesses that may require medical attention include:


Bronchitis — Marked by heavy coughing and mucus, often appearing yellow or green in consistency. These symptoms may also be accompanied by a persistent fever, pain in the chest, or trouble breathing. An x-ray will usually determine if you are suffering from bronchitis.Pneumonia — Also marked by heavy coughing, mucus, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia typically results from a bacterial infection that develops during the flu. Like bronchitis, an x-ray is usually required to diagnose pneumonia.Symptoms of pneumonia also include chest pain and shortness of breath.

Avoid touching your face frequently, particularly your mucus membranes, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Viral and bacterial infections are easily introduced into your body via these areas.;
, Touching other hospital patients isn't a good idea because they may be harboring antibiotic-resistant bacteria or dangerous viruses on their skin or clothing that can infect you and prevent you from getting well. It's also smart to avoid sharing towels, washcloths, razors or clothes with other patients while you're recovering in the hospital.


If you or any surrounding patients are coughing, then wear a surgical mask to reduce the risk of infection. Viruses and bacteria can travel relatively far distances within droplets of saliva and mucous.
The primary bacteria to be concerned with while you're recovering in a hospital are drug-resistant MRSA bacteria and Clostridium difficile (causes severe diarrhea).MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria because they are resistant to most antibiotics.MRSA bacteria developed many years ago due to over-use of antibiotics within hospitals.

, While you're trying to get well and heal in a hospital, you shouldn't touch any medical equipment or machines because you may disrupt their function or change the settings — which can put your life at risk. Medical devices, and diagnostic tools are also commonly contaminated with bacteria and viruses, even thought they are cleaned regularly. Some of the most deadly microorganisms can survive for days and even weeks on medical equipment.If a machine starts beeping or seems to be acting strangely, call a nurse immediately instead of trying to fix it yourself.


Each year greater than 18,000 Americans die from MRSA infections that they get while in U.S. hospitals.In addition to bacteria, dangerous viruses to be concerned about in hospitals include MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)., The best way to avoid other mishaps that can compromise your health and wellness while recovering in a hospital is by following directions and advice from caregivers, such as doctors, nurses and technicians.Although you likely know your body best, healthcare professionals know how to deal with diseases and symptoms the best.


On the other hand, if you sense that something isn't right and a mistake is made, trust your instincts and speak up.Another way to make sure you and your caregivers are on the same page is to ensure your hospital wristband is correct. Check for misspelled names and missing info, such as drug allergies.
If you don't understand why your caregivers are doing certain procedures, don’t be afraid to ask. Nurses and other hospital personnel are there to help you understand why certain procedures are necessary and what they entail.

, Sleeping soundly for between seven to nine hours a night on a regular basis is important for healing and getting well, especially while in the potentially stressful hospital environment.Getting the appropriate quality and quantity of sleep positively impacts your mood, behavior, mental functions, immune system and healing ability. While in the hospital, try to keep a regular schedule and don't nap too long in the afternoon (less than 45 minutes).


To stimulate a deep sleep, you need your environment quiet, dark and relatively cool. In a busy hospital, you may need to wear ear plugs and a comfortable sleeping mask over your eyes.
Avoid watching TV (especially scary movies) or using the computer just prior to bedtime. Try not to worry about your health or finances either. Read a funny book or listen to relaxing music or do other activities that are relaxing to you, such as crossword puzzles, word finds, or electronic games on your smart phone or tablet.
Make sure your mattress and pillow are comfortable. Hospital beds are adjustable, so position it so your body feels relaxed, but supported. You may also consider bringing a pillow and/or blanket from home.
Avoid consuming stimulants (caffeine, nicotine) and spicy foods just prior to bedtime.

, To get well and heal quickly, your body needs all the necessary nutrients, such as protein, vitamins and minerals. Don't skip meals while in the hospital and make sure that you stick to your prescribed diet.


After you get out of the hospital, continue to follow any special dietary guidelines that your doctor or surgeon have given you. You may benefit from including whole grains, lean meat, poultry and fish, low-fat dairy and lots of fresh produce (fruits and veggies). These foods will keep your immune system strong and allow your body to repair injured tissues.Fresh berries, in particular, are rich in vitamins and antioxidants.
Due to illness and/or reaction to medication, you may lose your appetite or feel nauseous, but it's important to get nutritious food in your body. Let the hospital staff know if you lose your appetite or if you feel nauseous.
If you're unable to chew your food very well, either blend it or consider taking some digestives enzymes just prior to meal times.
After you go home, avoid food that hampers your body's ability to heal itself, such as refined carbohydrates / sugars (soda pop, candy, ice cream, milk chocolate), artificial sugars (aspartame), trans fats and various preservatives.
Supplements that can boost your immune system include: vitamins A, C and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract and astragalus root.However, make sure that you check with your physician first.

, In addition to food-based nutrients, your body also needs lots of water to heal and to keep microorganisms at bay — the mucus membranes of your sinuses, nose and throat need to be moist. When your mucus membranes get dry, they are more susceptible to irritation, inflammation and infection.As such, keep yourself well hydrated by drinking at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of purified water daily while in the hospital — it'll keep your mucus membranes moist and give you a little more energy.


Avoid drinking caffeine-rich items, such as coffee, black tea, colas and energy drinks. Caffeine is a diuretic and triggers more urination, which can lead to dehydration.

, Your surgical care team will do what they can to keep you warm during and after surgery. Back in your room, keep yourself comfortably warm. Staying warm helps with blood circulation and allows your injured cells to get much-needed oxygen and nutrients.


Get a family member to bring a comfortable blanket from home — just make sure they wash / clean it thoroughly beforehand.
Keeping a hot water bottle or heated herbal bag under the covers can keep you nice and warm and promote sleep.

, Once you're able to, getting out of your hospital bed for some mild exercise (walking around and light calisthenics) is an excellent way to speed up your recovery and get well quicker.Staying in your bed constantly and not moving will keep you weak, stagnate circulation and increase your risk of blood clots and bed sores.When you feel up to it, ask your nurse or family member to help you up and walk with you to a common area. Use a cane or other support if you need to.
If you have to spend lots of time in a hospital bed, ask for special pads that help prevent bedsores and ""pneumatic"" stockings that help prevent blood clots.
For every day you spend in a hospital bed, it may require 4-5 days of movement after you leave the hospital to fully recover.So get moving before you leave the hospital, if possible.
You may also need to do some physical therapy while you are still in the hospital and possibly after you are discharged as well.

, It may seem strange that people should actively make the decision to get well, but many people have negative subconscious thoughts that can reduce the healing process.People can fall into a victim mentality, feel guilty for surviving and/or actually enjoy the attention from being ill, at least unconsciously, which gives their body mixed messages. As such, make the conscious decision that you truly want to get well and recover from your disease or condition.


Focusing on not wanting to be sick, rather than getting well, is not as powerful in convincing your mind / body to heal.
Use visualization to picture how your body might be killing off an infection or defeating cancer.
Whisper to yourself in positive words how you want to get well quickly and be healthy throughout your time in the hospital.

, Doctors and other medical professionals are taught to use statistics for treatments and prognosis — which is essentially the experiences of others as predictors of how a patient will or will not improve. But those statistics are just a guideline and don’t have to be predictive of how you get well, heal or survive. As such, strive to be the exception and not the mean (average) of the stats. For example, if your doctor says one week is the average time to get well from your condition, then use positive thoughts and optimism to get that down to five days.Doctors used to avoid negatively framing medical information and instead gave ""false"" hope in order to capitalize on optimism, but fear of medical malpractice and litigation has changed that for the most part.
If you get bad news or a bleak outlook, it is important to balance hopefulness with realistic expectations. Ask lots of questions and find out as much as you can about your treatment options.

, Fear, anger, pessimism and other negative thoughts are linked to greater risk of diseases and reduced ability to heal, so combat those feelings and thoughts with optimism.Try to face your fears of dying and dissipate your anger for being ill. Look to the bright side and try to make ""lemonade out of lemons"" as the saying goes.


Surround yourself with positive things. Turn off the news and don't watch violent, depressing TV shows. Watch inspiring comedy and educational programs. Listen to uplifting music.
Health benefits that positive thinking may provide include: reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, greater resistance to the common cold, lower rates of depression and increased life span."

Take NSAIDs.,
Ice the injury.,
Apply heat therapy.,
Use compression therapy.,
Elevate the injury.",How to Get Well Fast2," Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.NSAIDs are available in both over-the-counter and prescription-strength forms. Be sure to let your physician know if you are taking NSAIDs. NSAID use has been linked to increased risk of heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. Common NSAIDs include:Aspirin (should not be given to children or teenagers)
Ibuprofen
Celecoxib
Diclofenac
Naproxen

, Ice therapy is a common treatment for injuries, as the cold helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation.Ice should not be applied directly to the skin. Instead, you can wrap ice cubes in a clean dish towel, or use a frozen cold compress.


Apply a cold compress or ice pack for no more than 20 minutes, then remove the cold for 20 minutes before reapplying.Repeat as needed throughout the day. Discontinue use if the area becomes numb or if the ice causes pain.Ice therapy is most effective during the first 48 hours after an injury; however, you can continue to ice an injury for as long as the swelling and inflammation persist., Ice therapy is most effective for the first two days after an injury, as it helps reduce swelling and inflammation. Once swelling is down, experts recommend switching to heat therapy. Applying heat to an injury increases blood flow, which helps the injury heal. Heat can also help relax tight or aching muscles and joints.Much like ice therapy, most experts recommend applying heat therapy for 20 minutes on, followed by 20 minutes off before reapplying.Take a warm shower or bath to help soak an injury.Use a heat wrap or heating pad to treat the injury with ""dry"" heat. These are available at most pharmacies and drug stores.Do not lie down or fall asleep with heating pads or heating wraps. These can cause serious burns if left on for prolonged periods of time. Remove the source of heat if you become uncomfortably warm, and do not use heat therapy on unsupervised children.Never use health therapy if you have an open wound or poor circulation.

, Compression can help reduce or limit swelling following an injury. It can also provide some support, if the injury is in a part of the body that requires a range of motion. Common methods of compression therapy include elastic bandages and trainer's tape.


Do not wrap/tie a compress on too tightly. This may reduce blood flow, which can be dangerous.

, Slightly elevating an injured appendage can help reduce swelling by limiting blood flow to the injury. Elevation can be used in conjunction with compression and ice therapies.


Do not raise the injured appendage too high. Ideally the injured appendage should be raised slightly above the level of the heart. If this is not possible, try to keep the injured body part parallel to the ground, rather than at a downward angle.
Elevation is the last step of RICE therapy, which is recommended for many injuries. RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.

Allow injuries to heal.,
Allow bed rest for illnesses.,
Ensure that you get enough sleep.,
Get a good night's sleep.",How to Get Well Fast3," If you've suffered an injury, getting rest is one of the best things you can do. Try to avoid any activities that require using the injured body part or putting weight on that appendage.


The duration of rest will vary, but generally speaking it's best to allow the injury to rest for at least one to two days before trying to use or put weight on the injured appendage.

, Bed rest is one of the best ways to recover from a cold or flu. It helps the body heal at both the molecular and system-wide levels, and should be considered an important part of getting well after an illness., Most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night, but if you're recovering from an illness or injury you may need even more sleep.How much sleep you need is also affected by your age.Newborns who are under four months old require 14 to 17 hours of sleep each night.
Infants (between four and 11 months old) require 12 to 15 hours of sleep each night.
Toddlers (one to two years old) require 11 and 14 hours of sleep each night.
Preschoolers (between three and five years old) require 10 to 13 hours of sleep each night.
Children ages six to 13 require between nine and 11 hours of sleep each night.
Teenagers ages 14 to 17 require eight to 10 hours of sleep each night.
Adults (ages 18 to 64) require seven to nine hours of sleep each night.
Older adults (age 65 and older) require seven to eight hours of sleep each night.

, If you're feeling sick, injured, or just generally worn out with fatigue, you may need to get a better night's sleep.In addition to getting enough sleep each night, it's important to get quality sleep. Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to ensure a good night's sleep.


Stay on schedule. Try to go to bed at the same time each night, and if you can't sleep after 15 minutes, try getting up and doing something relaxing until you feel sleepy. Staying on a regular sleep schedule can help ensure that you get a good night's sleep every night.Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Caffeine and nicotine are both stimulants that can take hours to completely wear off. And while alcohol may make you feel sleepy at first, it tends to disrupt sleep patterns throughout the night.Keep your room cool, dark, and quiet. Use blinds or thick curtains to block outside light from your windows, and try earplugs or white noise to help you sleep through outside noise.Manage stress. Don't dwell on what you'll need to do in the morning. Just write it down and allow yourself to disengage for the night.You can also try relaxation techniques, such as yoga, meditation, and tai chi, to help manage stress and keep you calm before bed."

Try niacin supplements.Niacin, or vitamin B3, is an important nutrient that many diets do not have enough of.,
Consider biotin supplements.,

Ask about having the milia lanced.,
Learn about cryotherapy.",How to Get Rid of Milia," Milia are small white bumps that form on the face when dead skin cells get trapped beneath the skin's surface, forming small, hard cysts as a result.


While milia can occur at any age, it is most commonly seen with infants. Roughly half of all babies experience some form of milia.
Nearly all babies and most adults who suffer from milia get them because the skin has not been properly exfoliated.
Adults can also experience secondary milia, however, in which burns or rashes cause the skin to blister, thereby damaging the pore lining.
Milia will disappear without treatment. In fact, when infants have milia, most doctors will recommend that you do not attempt any special treatment. Merely wash your baby's skin with warm water and pat it dry with a soft towel every day.;
, Regular cleansing is an important step in treating milia at any age. A young child should wash their skin once a day, while a teenager or adult should wash their skin twice a day.


Use warm water to relax the pores as you clean your face.






Pat your face dry gently using a clean, soft towel.






Teens and adults should always use a facial cleanser. Facial cleansers are not usually recommended for babies and small children unless their faces seem unusually oily. Consider speaking to a doctor to see if you should use a facial cleanser, and if so, which one. If you can't contact a doctor, only use a mild moisturizing soap free of excess fragrances, dyes, or chemicals.







, Teens and adults should treat milia with an exfoliating treatment. You could either go for an exfoliating moisturizer or a targeted exfoliating product.


An exfoliating moisturizer is a good idea if your milia is widespread and accompanied by dry skin. The moisturizer will reduce the build up of dead skin cells below your skin and the exfoliating aspect will allow your skin to release the dead cells that have already accumulated. Look for a moisturizer that contains vitamin A. It should also be free of any heavy oils.A targeted exfoliating treatment is best if you have a few milia that you want to get rid of, but otherwise have no skin problems. Choose a targeted treatment containing salicylic acid. The treatment should be applied directly to the milia once daily until they disappear, but check the label to make sure., Retinol is commonly used to fight acne and signs of aging. It has exfoliating properties that keep your skin soft and clear. For best results, use a targeted retinol lotion and apply it directly to the area of your skin affected by the milia.Apply a pea-sized drop of retinol to the milia-covered area of your face every other night. Wait roughly 30 minutes after you wash your face before using the retinol.
Do not apply retinol to the upper eyelid since it can cause irritation and damage if it gets into your eyes.

, Milia can worsen with sun damage. This is especially true if you are suffering from secondary milia, which is caused by blistering. A sunburn can result in the spread or prolonged existence of milia, so cutting down on sun exposure will let you get rid of milia faster.


Stay out of direct sunlight as much as possible. When spending time outside, wear a hat to shade your face.
Apply a gentle oil-free sunblock specially formulated for facial care. A heavy, oily sunblock will only clog your pores more, making it harder to exfoliating the trapped dead cells causing the milia. A light sunblock can offer protection from the sun without clogging your pores, though. Look for a light one with a minimum SPF of 15 or above.

, You may be tempted to conceal your milia with makeup, but doing so will only prolong their stay. It will also welcome more dirt onto your face, making your milia harder to really get rid of.


Cosmetics and heavy creams stay on your skin, blocking your pores. In order to get rid of your milia, you need to be able to exfoliate away dead skin cells. Doing so will be much more difficult if your pores are blocked by makeup, though.

, Milia will disappear on their own in a few weeks and should not cause any discomfort or pain. They will usually crumble and fall off when you don't notice. You may end up causing pain or damage to your skin if you attempt to “pop,” poke, or scrape the milia away on your own.


Milia are not pimples, so popping them will not be able to make them go away. The hard cyst lying under your skin will remain there unless a professional can lance it. You are unlikely to have success attempting to do so on your own.
You are, however, likely to cause irritation and damage to your skin. You may even create a scar.

, It is thought to help maintain multiple systems in your body. Among its benefits, many believe that niacin helps maintain healthy skin and is capable of treating milia.


Note that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that niacin can get rid of milia faster.
If you do not already take niacin supplements, begin by taking a small dose of 100 mg daily. Do not exceed 1500 mg of niacin daily since large doses have the potential to cause liver damage.
Only use pure niacin supplements, since these are less likely to contain harmful toxins or additives.

, This co-enzyme and B-complex vitamin is also known as vitamin H.Most people take in enough biotin through diet alone, but if you suspect that you may need more, you can also take it in supplement form.


Biotin is thought to have multiple benefits. It supports adequate skin health, which means that it may help your skin to release the milia quicker.
Note that there are no scientific studies capable of backing this claim, however.
Adults should only take 25 to 35 mcg of biotin a day.

, Increasing the amount of CoQ10 your body gets can be done naturally and without the use of supplements. This vitamin is thought to help maintain many of your body's systems and functions and may help improve the health of your skin.


Note that there is no scientific evidence to support a direct link between CoQ10 and milia.
CoQ10 acts as an emulsifier, so it removes oils from the body. By allowing your body to flush these oils out more easily, it may be able to help the pores blocked with milia to flush out any dead skin cells, as well.
Your body produces CoQ10 when you exercise, and the vitamin can also be found in foods like meat and fish.

, A doctor will usually be hesitant to prescribe medication or medicated ointments for milia since true milia poses no threat and causes no pain. If you have a severe case of milia that will not go away and does not respond to exfoliating treatments, however, a dermatologist may be willing to physically remove the milia from your face.

, This is the most common method a dermatologist will use to remove milia.

The doctor will clean your skin with alcohol or antiseptic to minimize the risk of infection.






A sterile lancet or needle will be inserted into the top layer of skin right next to the milia. The dermatologist will then apply pressure using comedone extractor, causing the milia to pop out of the pore.






When done properly, this treatment will leave no scar and cause no skin damage.







, If the milia is located in a sensitive area, like the eyelid, your dermatologist may consider freezing it first and then removing it.


The dermatologist will clean your skin with alcohol or an antiseptic before proceeding.
After cleaning your skin, the doctor will use a small wand or tool to freeze the area affected by milia.
Once the skin is frozen, the doctor can lance the milia more easily.
When done correctly, the treatment will not damage your skin and should not leave any scars.

Focus on health, not weight.",How to Get Skinnier," You can start getting in shape and build your endurance for more serious exercise by just being a little more active in your day. You know how people are always talking about how French women stay so skinny? This is a good portion of what they do. Just burning those extra few calories can make a huge difference, helping you to reach the number of extra calories you have to burn each day to help slim down.


For example, start taking the stairs instead of taking the elevator or escalator. Walk to the store if it’s nearby and carry your groceries home, instead of taking your car. There are lots of ways that you can use your body every day.;
, Walking is a great form of exercise that will start preparing your body for major weight loss. It can really help build up your lung capacity and get your muscles loose and ready for activity. Even once you start proper exercises, you might want to consider continuing to walk every day.


For example, you can introduce even small amounts of walking to your daily routine by parking further away from where you need to go and skipping the car entirely for any location within a mile.
You can also make walking a regular part of your day, like going for a jog. Take a walk break eat your lunch, munching on a sandwich while you walk around the block.

, Sitting is not terribly good for your body and many studies have shown that it can have dangerous long-term effects on your body . However, standing to do the same tasks you normally sit for not only prevents those health problems, it can also burn a couple of extra calories.


For example, use a standing desk instead of a normal desk or stand up and lightly exercise while you watch TV.
When you stand for long periods, however, it’s important to take breaks. Move your knees around, stretch, and walk around for a bit. This will keep your joints and muscles from feeling too much pressure.

, While you can probably shed a few pounds by matching your diet to your activity level, several studies have found that adding exercise in to your regimen is 20% more effective than dieting alone.The common recommendation for how much exercise an adult should get is 30 minutes of vigorous activity a day. Shoot for an hour if you want to increase your chances of burning extra fat. You don't even have to do all of this exercise at once; as long as you maintain a high level of activity for at least 10 minutes at a time, you'll get the benefits.


For example, you can take a 15 minute jog around your block before you get in the shower in the morning. Go up and down the stairs at school or work for 15 minutes during lunch. While you're cooking dinner, do 15 minutes of squats. Round out the day with 15 minutes of plank exercises before you get in bed.
Another example would be to do burpees for 15 minutes when you wake up, bike for half an hour to get to work or school, bike another half an hour to get back, and finish up the day with 20 minutes of vigorous walking.

, Staying motivated is one of the biggest hurdles to getting in shape and burning fat but it's also the thing that makes the biggest difference in helping you slim down. Find ways to keep yourself motivated, such as by doing exercises that you really enjoy doing, so that you'll stick with your plan to lose weight.


Working out with a partner can be a great way to stay motivated. This not only makes exercise a great social activity and excuse to see a beloved friend or family member, it also gives you someone to be accountable to (which means no more excuses and procrastination). If you don't have a friend or family member that will exercise with you, join a local jogging group or other fitness club.
Listening to music, podcasts, or books can also help you stay motivated because it becomes your time to enjoy those things which you might normally not have time for.

, You'll want to avoid fad diets like Atkins and South Beach and especially anything with ""cleanse"" in the title. These diets can be nutritionally dangerous and there is significant evidence to show that people who do these diets, while they do lose weight, gain most of the weight back within a few years.The better bet is to make a real lifestyle change. Find a sport that can become a hobby for you. Bike to work. Switch to a vegetarian diet. Whatever works for you, just do that instead of relying in a diet of 100% potatoes to make you magically drop 50 lbs.

, You definitely don’t want to starve yourself. You should eat when you’re hungry and learn to listen to your body. However, many people do overeat so take a careful look at how often you eat and how much of that food you eat. Avoid a bunch of snacks in between meals and if you do snack, snack on veggies. You'll also want to try eating a smaller plate when you do have a meal.


Start off with just enough food to fill a salad or side plate. If you're still hungry 15 minutes after finishing your plate, you can go back for a smaller second portion.

, You'll want to be sure that you eat foods from the major healthy food groups, each in proper balance. Yes, fruit contains lots of nutrients, but you shouldn't make most of your diet come from fruit. Instead, eat lots of different foods from the different food groups and avoid diets which restrict your food groups. Your body needs many nutrients and unusual sources are often not enough to sustain your body long-term.


A well balanced diet should consist of about 40% vegetables, 10% fruits (heavy in fiber and vitamin C, low in sugar when possible), 30% whole grains and 20% lean proteins.
Sugar you should pass on as a category altogether.
If you do choose to eat dairy, be very careful: most dairy products contain a lot of unhealthy fat and calories in relation to the nutritional benefits. Mainly, you'll want to get the calcium that you would normally get from dairy from other products instead, like leafy greens and dietary supplements.

, You'll want to focus on foods with lots of nutrients and a naturally lower number of calories. These foods will allow you to stay healthy and feel more full, while actually eating less food. This can seriously help you lose weight. Look for some great examples like:


Citrus fruit, kiwi, and pears
Kale, broccoli, spinach, and brussels sprouts
brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, and barley
Salmon, anchovies, sardines, turkey and skinless chicken
Peas, white beans, lentils, and soy nuts

, You'll want to avoid foods which contain a lot of calories and relatively few nutrients. These can lead you to easily go over the number of calories you need in a day. Focus on those nutrient rich foods and pass on items like:Fried foods, like chips, french fries, and fried chicken
Sugary items like candy, ice cream, soda, and juice (yes, juice)
Heavily processed grains like white bread donuts, cakes, cookies, and pizza

, Diet and exercise are both habits. You might have bad habits right now but you can have good ones. However, as with any habit, it can take awhile to break your existing habits. When working to lose weight, you'll probably have a few false starts and you'll make a couple of mistakes. If you expect this off the bat, then you won't be disappointed in yourself when it happens.

When you feel disappointed, you'll be inclined to think that it's hopeless and quit. However, you can keep moving forward even after a setback. Just keep trying and you'll get there.







, There is mounting scientific evidence that bodies have a natural state that they want to be in: you might be naturally skinny or you might be naturally on the larger side.If you’re naturally larger, you’re simply going to have to work really hard to maintain a low weight. It will take time and effort to reach it and it will take effort to maintain it. The best thing you can do to stay skinny long term is to make real lifestyle changes and be consistent with those changes over a long period of time.

, If you’ve tried consistent diet and exercise changes and haven’t had much luck, talk to your doctor. You may have other health problems that are keeping you from losing the weight. Get evaluated for any conditions you may have and get their expert advice tailored to your specific situation.


You should also see your doctor before you start any diet or major weight loss regimen. Health conditions can make some diet and exercise changes dangerous for your health, so it’s a good idea to check with a doctor and be sure that your plan is safe for you body.
Get a second opinion when you don’t agree with or don’t understand what the doctor has told you. Medicine is more art than science and some doctors are not very positive on non-traditional body types or the current body of research. Find someone who understands your body and is willing to help you work towards your goal in a safe and positive manner.

, Especially if you’re a woman, your hormones can have huge effect on your weight. Everything from basic monthly menstrual cycle swings to thyroid problems can cause your body to put on more and more weight. If you've noticed that your weight gain peaks around your period or any other time of month, you should talk to your doctor.


Unfortunately your hormone levels aren't something you can check at home. You'll have to get evaluated by your doctor. Don't trust an internet list of symptoms and instead just get properly evaluated.

, Don't try to hit a particular number on the scale or fit into what you think is the ideal pants size. This is not healthy or realistic. It's fine to want to slim down but your focus should be on your health, not on your appearance. Try to shoot for a weight and fitness level where, for example, you feel good going up a few flights of stairs. Reach a weight where you feel energetic and happy. Don't worry about anything past that.


Realize that a healthy weight level is dependent on you. Every body is different. Some people can be perfectly healthy and in shape and still have a lot of padding. As long as your joints aren't stressed, your blood work looks good, and your lungs and heart are happily pumping, you're probably okay.

Spend five to 30 minutes outside in the sun between 10 am and three pm.,
Apply sunscreen after 30 minutes in the sun.,
Go for more time in the sun if you have a darker skin tone.,
Avoid tanning beds.",How to Get Vitamin D from Sun1," Your skin cells are stimulated to make vitamin D after they are exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun. To stimulate this process, you should spend five to 30 minutes in the sun without sunscreen between 10 in the morning and three in the afternoon. Do this at least twice a week and try to expose your face, arms, legs, and back to the sun.Your location on the planet, such as your latitude, doesn’t make a significant difference in terms of the amount of UVB rays you are getting when you sit out in the sun. However, factors like the season, the time of day, the amount of cloud cover, air pollution, and the melanin content in your skin can affect your body’s ability to absorb vitamin D.
In the winter time, it can be more difficult to get five to 30 minutes of sun on your face and arms. Try to still spend time outside during the winter months, even if it is cold outside.
Keep in mind sun that is filtered through glass does not have very strong UVB rays, so getting sun indoors behind a window will not give you necessary amount of exposure to the sun. You will need to go outside and expose your face, arms, legs, and back to direct sunlight.;
, After you have spent five to 30 minutes in the sun, you should apply sunscreen that contains at least SPF 8 or higher on any exposed skin. The UVB radiation from the sun will increase your risk of skin cancer if you do not protect your skin.You should make sure your skin does not feel like it is burning, too hot to the touch, tight, dry, or painful when you are in the sun. If you feel any of these symptoms, you should get out of the sun.
The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against UVA and UVB exposure. They recommend SPF 30 or higher. If you will be sweating or going in the water, look for a water-resistant sunscreen., If you have a darker skin tone, your skin contains more melanin and you may need to spend more time in the sun to get the required amount of vitamin D. You should spend 10–40 minutes in the sun between 10 am and three pm at least two times a week or 15 minutes at a time three times a week. After enough time in the sun, you should put on sunscreen.Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a higher risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune disease and cancer including colorectal, breast and prostate cancer. Individuals of African, Hispanic, and Indian descent are at a greater risk for these issues. So it is important that individuals with these backgrounds spend enough time in the sun and have sufficient vitamin D levels.

Tanning beds can also cause premature aging, a weak immune system, eye damage, and an allergic reaction to artificial UVB rays.Avoid using a tanning bed, even if you do not have time to go outside and sit in the sun during the day, or the weather outside prevents you from doing this.

Make a conscious effort.,
Eat something.,
Stay hydrated.,
Clean yourself up.,
Get off the couch and out of the house.,
Do something active.",How to Get up off the Couch After Sickness," Try do something active and make some progress every day. Sometimes you'll feel too sick to get up and really do it, but as long as you tell yourself you're going to really do something and really make a conscious effort, that's all you can ask of yourself. On the other hand, if you don't actually try you will not get anywhere. Don't lie to yourself. If you feel too sick, don't go running, you don't want to over stress yourself, but you don't want to lie to yourself either. Honestly judge your feelings and decide if you really feel too sick, or if you just don't want to run.;
, When we're sick it can be challenging to eat, because if we eat the wrong thing it can make us feel sick again or slow down the healing process. Still, it's very important to eat a sufficient amount of food every day because food gives you energy that your body needs to fight the virus, and boosts your immune system. Try to pull away from the ""comfort"" foods we all love to eat when we're sick, like pudding, jello, ice cream, salty crackers and soda, and instead try to go for things that will help you get better more quickly, like fruits, vegetables, and meat and cheeses. Try to stay away from things that are greasy, because they can slow down the healing process and put you back on the couch for a little while longer.

, One of the main ways viruses exit your body is through pee, so the more liquid you drink the better. Staying hydrated has many benefits for your body other than that as well. If you have a congestive illness, like a stuffed nose or wet cough, you may find that you get very dehydrated in the night. Something that may help with this is drinking a large glass of something with electrolytes in it right before bed, because electrolytes help you stay hydrated longer.

, Taking a shower and getting out of those pajamas that you've worn every day for the last week will help send your mind into healthy zone. Doing the things that you do every day, even when you're not sick, can trick your mind into believing you're no longer ill and helps it send the energy to you that you need in order to keep going. Also, by now those clothes are breeding grounds for germs, and probably just making you sicker, so change out of them, take a shower, brush your teeth and try to look presentable.

, Just getting up off the couch and moving around is all that's necessary when your body is still recuperating. Clean the house or go back to school or work. Go out with friends. You don't have to do anything particularly active, just go out to dinner or out to a movie. Staying away from the couch for most of the day will help tell your body you're all better and get you moving again.

, In the beginning when you're body is still getting over illness you may want to try something that isn't quite as active as running or soccer. Things like yoga, which is a great option because it loosens up your body after prolonged sickness, or swimming, which is a peaceful and sickness friendly activity, are best to start out with. If you feel up to it you can try things like an in-home exercise or dance videos. Who says that you have to be away from home to get active again? Devote a couple of minutes, it doesn't have to be much, to the videos or another activities and watch your body get back to the way it was before.

Understand chest congestion first.,
Wait it out one week in general.,
See a doctor before a week in some cases.,
Go in for a cough lasting more than four weeks.",How to Get Rid of Chest Congestion1," Chest congestion is the result of excess mucus and other fluids in your lungs.

Often nasal congestion leads to chest congestion.;
, If your congestion is caused by the common cold, it will usually clear up on its own in about one week without the use of prescription medicine. Most are viral infections, which can’t be treated with antibiotics. If it doesn’t improve after a week, you should make an appointment to see your physician. Viral infections can become bacterial and generally require treatment with an antibiotic.It's very important to also consult with a physician after a week if you have asthma or a weakened immune system., Set up an appointment if your congestion is accompanied by wheezing, or if you have a high fever lasting more than 3 days, experience bloody discharge from your nose or from your mouth when coughing, or have green nasal discharge with pain and a fever.


While some of these could be the result of a bacterial infection, they could also be indicators of something more serious., Coughing is common with chest congestion. And you don’t want to suppress a wet or ""productive cough"" that produces phlegm or mucus unless it’s severely impairing your breathing or sleep. Productive coughs helps clear your lungs and lower respiratory tract.

Use a stimulant laxative for the best chance at fast relief.",How to Get Rid of Constipation Fast2," Laxatives can occasionally cause dehydration, so you will need water intake to ensure fast recovery.

Ready the enema according to package instructions.
Lay on your side or with your buttocks slightly elevated.

To see if your home is at that level, buy a humidity gauge from a hardware store or pharmacy.Make sure you regularly clean the humidifier. They can fast become havens for mold, fungus and bacteria.Those with asthma should consult with a doctor before using a humidifier., Another option is to use steam to help break up mucus in the chest. You can do this by taking a hot, steamy bath with the bathroom doors closed and the vent turned off. You can also sit on a chair or on the toilet to breathe in the steam. Finally, you can boil a pot of water or run hot water in your sink before carefully leaning over the steam and inhaling it.

Amplify the effects of steaming by adding eucalyptus oil to your boiling water or sink of hot water. Eucalyptus is a natural decongestant., Scented products and bathroom sprays can create sinus irritation, which can then lead to chest congestion. Paint and household cleaners can also create problems for many people. Either don’t use these products or avoid overuse to reduce this irritation. Smoke is another powerful irritant that causes congestion for both the smoker and those around him or her. The best solution is to stop smoking, or to smoke outside.If you need to use paint or another potent substance, wear a face mask and open your windows to let the fumes escape.If allergies are causing your chest congestion, try to rid your home of those allergens that affect you., Try using a mattress cover if you’re allergic to dust mites, and keep pets off your bed if you’re allergic to pet dander. If pollen is a problem for you, keep your home and car windows shut and use an air conditioner to filter the air. You might also use a HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter."

Eat chicken noodle soup.,
Drink certain teas.,
Consider avoiding dairy.",How to Get Rid of Chest Congestion3," Drink more water and other fluids than you normally would. This will help thin mucus and break it up, making coughs more productive. Try to drink a tall glass of water or another fluid every 2 hours. Avoid caffeinated beverages and alcohol, however, because they are diuretics and can cause you to lose more fluids than you consume.You can also increase your fluid intake with broths, soups and teas. In fact, hot liquids help dissolve the mucus.
You can also put a hot water pack over your chest to help loosen mucus., Chicken noodle soup helps reduce lung inflammation. It also increases your body’s ability to move mucus through your body and get rid of it.Additionally, chicken noodle soup helps kill viral cells and can prevent the growth of new ones.Scientists aren’t certain why chicken noodle soup does these things. They think that the heat, salt, combination of ingredients found in most chicken soups, and the hydration it provides are the likely reasons., Studies have shown that both honey and lemon decrease the growth of microbes that cause infections. Honey in particular inhibits viruses and has been found to be an effective cough suppressant. Try mixing a teaspoon of both lemon juice and honey to hot water.Green tea appears to be effective in helping treat respiratory infections that are the prime culprit in chest congestion. It also has been shown to inhibit viral activity.While not scientifically proven yet, many find relief from adding thyme, marshmallow, licorice, ginger, cinnamon and clove to hot water to help loosen mucus.
To make a thyme tea, add 2 tablespoons of fresh thyme or 1 tablespoon of dried thyme to a cup of hot water, let it steep and then drain the thyme.
For a marshmallow tea, steep 2 teaspoons of the dried herb in one cup of hot water.
Brew a licorice tea by adding 45 drops of licorice tincture to a cup of hot water.
For a spicy tea, add a ½ teaspoon powdered ginger, a pinch of clove and a pinch of cinnamon powder to a cup of hot water., Because chest congestion is so often caused by allergies and other nasal congestion issues, consider cutting out or limiting dairy in your diet – particularly if you're allergic or sensitive to it. While the research is mixed on whether the casein in dairy products promotes mucus, it should be noted that casein is used to create adhesives, and some people think it makes mucus thicker."
"
Try a new way of coughing.,
Take the right supplements.,
Relieve nasal congestion.",How to Get Rid of Chest Congestion4," If you’re coughing a lot but not getting relief, try this to help loosen mucus. When you feel a coughing fit coming on, make a series of small and gentle coughs. Finish with a deep cough. The smaller coughs can help move the mucus, while the last cough can help get rid of it., If you choose to take a supplement, the National Institute of Health has found the following to be “possibly effective” in either reducing the symptoms of a cold, including congestion, or in helping prevent illness in the first place: Vitamin C, Vitamin D, ginseng, echinacea and zinc. The following have not been designated as “possibly effective”: olive leaf extract, garlic, elderberry, whey protein, probiotics, goldenseal root or Airborne. This isn’t to say they aren’t effective, but the research is not as supportive as for those listed first.


Be careful when taking supplements. Taking too much can be life-threatening. They can also be harmful to children, pregnant or nursing mothers, and other populations.
Talk with your doctor before taking them, and read the safety information thoroughly first.

, Often half the battle with getting rid of chest congestion is clearing your nasal passages, too. Post-nasal drip seeps down your throat and into your lungs. This often creates or makes chest congestion worse. Here are some home remedies for relieving nasal congestion.


Sleep with your head raised. Put 1-2 extra pillows under your head so that it’s raised 6-8” if you find yourself coughing a lot at night.
Irrigate your nasal passages with a neti pot or other saline nasal irrigation system. Make sure you sterilize the water as instructed. Deaths have resulted from using straight tap water.Yoga poses, such as the reclining bound angle, cobra and bow, may be helpful in opening up nasal passages. Don’t overdo it while sick, however, because too much exercise isn't conducive to getting better more quickly. Instead do them in mini-sequences."

Use an expectorant.,
Try an antihistamine for allergies.,
Use a chest rub.,
Suck on cough drops or lozenges.,
Take a cough syrup.,
Relieve nasal congestion.",How to Get Rid of Chest Congestion5," There are two types of cough medicines: expectorants and decongestants. Decongestants are used to temporarily dry nasal passages. An expectorant thins out and loosens mucus in your chest, thus helping to induce a productive cough. Look for one with guaifenesin.The FDA advises against giving cough or cold medicine to children under 4 unless directed by a doctor.Additionally, pregnant and nursing mothers, and those over 60 or who have chronic respiratory problems, asthma, heart disease, high blood pressure or an enlarged prostate should take cough medicines with care. Serious side effects can occur., Consider using an antihistamine if your chest congestion is allergy-related. They help to temporarily dry up nasal passages. There are two generations of antihistamines. The older ones, such as chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine (Benadryl), typically make people sleepy. They can also create concentration problems. Second-generation antihistamines, such as cetirizine and loratadine, have fewer side effects. They can still make you drowsy, though.


Drink extra fluids while taking an antihistamine due to their drying nature., Chest rubs like Vicks VapoRub can help loosen mucus and reduce coughing. Buy one containing camphor or menthol and apply it to your neck and throat. Never take them internally. Homeopathic chest rubs containing eucalyptus and myrrh can also be helpful.You can also make your own by mixing one part mustard powder and two parts all-purpose flour with just enough water to create a paste. Spread the paste on a dish towel, fold it and place it on your chest.
You can substitute an egg white for the water. Either way, never apply the paste directly to your skin as this can cause serious skin irritations., Look for one with menthol, which will help numb the back of your throat and decrease your cough reflex. Remember, however, that you don’t want to suppress a productive cough unless it’s seriously impairing your breathing or sleep.You can also try sucking on horehound candy if you have a productive cough. Horehound acts as a natural expectorant.
Try slippery elm lozenges for a dry cough. It will coat your throat and reduce coughing.Give Cold-EEZE a try. The active ingredient in the lozenges and sprays is zincum gluconium. Clinical studies have shown that Cold-EEZE can reduce the length and even the frequency of the common cold., There is a variety on the market, and you should select one based upon the type of cough you have. You can also make your own. For productive coughs, use herbs that act as natural expectorants, such as horehound, thyme, mullein, fennel and ginger.Simply slice 3 lemons and place them in a pan with honey and one of these herbs. Simmer it until the syrup thickens, strain it and let it cool.You can make another easy expectorant cough syrup by covering a thinly sliced onion with honey, letting it stand for 10-12 hours, and then straining the concoction. Take one tablespoon several times per day., Decongestants containing dextromethorphan or pseudoephedrine, saline nasal sprays, and nasal steroids help to temporarily treat nasal congestion.Antibiotics can be used but only if a viral infection becomes bacterial.


Don’t use decongestant nasal sprays for more than 3-4 days because they can lead to rebound congestion."

Get your mind off home by distracting yourself.,
Keep some photos with you.,
Reach out to those who are around you.,
Realize that you're missed too.,
Note when you'll meet up again or return to the place you came from.",How to Get Over Home Sickness," Think about the things that aren't so great back at home as a way of reminding yourself that the current experience is actually a good opportunity. For example, you might think about the times you and your family don't get along, make life hard for one another and even argue! Of course, there's no need to overdo this but it does serve you well to remember that life is full of ups and downs no matter where you are, at home or away. Thinking like this can quell the desire to rush back home.;
, Have photos of the people and places you care about. It's really easy to put some photos on your phone, portable music device, in cloud space, etc., for quick and easy retrieval. You can also print off photos and stick them in your diary, your wallet, a journal or anything else you use and look at regularly.


You could even include mementos, such as letters, notes, small things people have given you over time.
Voice messages can also be a useful memory to carry with you. Ask people you care about to leave you some good luck messages on your phone. Replay them when you feel down.

, A friend, an acquaintance, the people you're staying with, etc. are all good sorts to connect with. See the opportunities available to you to widen your circle of friends and chosen family rather than feeling overwhelmed. These are just more people who form part of your circle in the world, make the most of them.


Get on Skype or some other program and connect directly with the people you care about. Seeing them can make it feel as if they're right in the same room with you. Sing, dance, have a contest together, all over the video link!

, Although it can be easy to get wrapped up in missing others, it's highly likely there is at least one person (and maybe a pet or two) missing you too. It's a two-way street and it's an experience most human beings have in their lifetimes at some point. Be reassured by the reality that this is a learning experience and that others are going through it with you.


Ask loved ones and friends to send you drawings, photos and updates about what is happening where they are. They'll be thrilled that you're still interested in their experiences, as much as they're keen to hear about yours.

, Mark it on a calendar as something to look forward to. Book your tickets on time, if relevant; the tangible proof that you're returning can help a lot.

Get some sun.,
Take a “personal day.” Instead of using all your vacation days at work for holidays, devote a day to your favorite activities.,
Rearrange your office or your house.,
Stop using Facebook while you are in a funk.,
Get out of town.",How to Get Out of a Funk1," A lack of Vitamin D may result in mild depression (a funk), which is sometimes related to the changing seasons. Fortunately, the sun's rays provide all the Vitamin D that you need.Each day, try to get out in the sun with your face and legs or arms exposed for 20 minutes. That is enough time to absorb Vitamin D without damaging your skin. Most people get this amount of exposure incidentally, for instance while walking to the mailbox or checking the mail. Be sure that you don't overdo the amount of time you spend in the sun without sunscreen.
In wintertime especially, some people suffer from what is known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) because the short, dark days don't furnish enough Vitamin D. If you find that your funk seems to be related to the changing seasons or dark, dreary winter days, talk to your doctor about SAD and available treatment options, which might include phototherapy using a special light box that mimics the sun's rays.;
, You may be in a working rut where you have forgotten what it’s like to enjoy the moment.


Take yourself out to lunch, to the theater, or to a sporting event. If shopping energizes you, try a little retail therapy-- but avoid it if you typically feel exhausted or depressed afterwards.
Consider using your free day to start or finish a project you've been wanting to work on but haven't found time for, like gardening or renovating a room in your home.

, A change can give you a new perspective. Don’t just move the things on the top of your desk, move the desk to the other side of the room.


Ensure that everything is clean and tidy. Simplifying and cleaning your surroundings can reduce anxiety and help you focus on the task at hand, instead of being distracted by the clutter around you. The process of cleaning itself can also be therapeutic, giving you time to focus all your effort toward one attainable goal.Consider going through your dresser and closet and getting rid of clothing that you don't wear. Sometimes getting rid of all the things we have in excess of what we need can be liberating, and if you donate it you will feel good about helping someone else., Make Internet surfing and TV watching off limits after work for one week. Replace that time with hobbies and social activities.


A 2013 study found that people who use Facebook are less satisfied by life. Watching other people’s successes can make you feel inadequate. Similarly, spending too much time watching television or movies zaps your creativity, allows your body to sit sedentary for far too long, and leads to feelings of boredom and a lack of cognitive exercise. Take a break from reality shows, glamorous movies and social media so that you can get more satisfaction out of life., Although you shouldn’t run away from your problems, a temporary change of scenery can do you good. Buy a plane ticket or plan a roadtrip that is two or more days long.Think about the kind of environment you spend all your days in, and pick somewhere to visit that is very different from your normal scene. This will help change the sensory cues that are input into your brain every day, shaking things up and helping release creativity and imagination.What type of environments make you feel most alive and energized? Do you crave the bustle of the big city, or the quiet of the woods? Do you like the shushing of the ocean waves or the wind on a mountain top? Think of where you feel most free and fulfilled, and plan to go there, even if you can only spend a day.

Exercise for at least one hour each day.,
Leave the car at home.,
Stop drinking or using drugs.,
Get up earlier.,
Treat yourself to a haircut, a manicure, a massage, or a spa day.,
Eat healthfully for a few weeks.",How to Get Out of a Funk2," If you already exercise, change the time you exercise or the type of exercise you do. A fitness class, like boot camp, can renew your motivation and boost your metabolism.


Exercise has been shown to increase energy and reduce anxiety, and can also provide catharsis for anger or sadness (not to mention improving the quality of your sleep and helping your body to fight off illness).Consider a group exercise class if you've never tried one before. Many people find that being a part of a group helps increase motivation to show up and do your best. Alternately, consider weight lifting or boxing as a way to relieve anxiety by literally that energy out on exercising.

, Replace driving with walking whenever possible. Each time you exercise, you can release more endorphins that will make you feel happier.


Scientists think nature can help you solve problems and improve your mood. Walking in a wooded area or on a trail may do more to get you out of a funk than walking in a city., Alcohol is a depressant and will leave you feeling sad or unmotivated in its wake, and many drugs have the same effect. Try going dry for a few weeks to see if this is the root of the funk.If you need help or tips to stop drinking, this wikiHow article may be helpful. Similarly, if you need help with a drug addiction, this wikiHow article may be for you. If you do suspect you have a problem with drug or alcohol addiction, see your doctor right away. She will be able to help you safely quit.

, Change your schedule so that you work out in the morning or go for a walk before work.


Too much sleep can backfire by causing you to be more fatigued than you were before. Most adults need about 7-9 hours of sleep per night.The right amount of sleep should leave you feeling rested when you wake, not groggy or desperate for more.
Use the extra time wisely to do things that get you out of your rut-- not to watch TV or spend time on Facebook.

, Better yet, plan a day when you can do this with a good friend.


Taking care of yourself and nurturing your body can help to alleviate feelings of stress. Deep tissue massages are especially good for this purpose,but anything that makes you feel good about yourself will help.
If you can't afford to see a professional for a treatment, take a hot bath with epsom salts and a few drops of your favorite essential oil like lavender or orange oil for aromatherapy. The salts sooth sore muscles and help ease tension out of your body., Fast food and junk food can affect your health and your mood over time. Make half of each meal with fruits and vegetables, and then fill in the rest with whole grains and lean proteins.


Several studies have found that junk food affects a child’s concentration, mood and performance in school. The same is likely true for adults, who can suffer from a funk at work or in general because of high calorie foods with low nutritional content.Try nuts, berries, broccoli, pumpkin seeds, sage, oily fish like salmon, and whole grains to boost your brainpower, or consider taking an Omega 3 supplement."

Set goals.,
Survey your relationships.,
Call up an old friend.",How to Get Out of a Funk3," People often experience a funk after they have met a goal and suddenly find themselves without any specific purpose to motivate them. Set a short-term goal and long-term goal, complete with rewards if you meet your goals.Consider telling a friend about your goal so that she can serve as an accountability partner and help motivate you to achieve the goal. If you set a goal to run a 5K in two months and you tell your friend, she can ask about your progress in training and then ask how the race went. But if you tell no one, you'll find it harder to get out and train to meet your goal.

, If you find yourself surrounded by negative or cynical people, you can lose your motivation and lust for life because of their influence. Limit time with these people or ask them to be more positive for mutual benefit.


Facebook and other social media are major sources of this type of input. Never before in history have we had so many social relationships that we utilize on a daily basis, even though the relationships are more often than not shallow acquaintances we don't actually know. If you find that your Facebook or Twitter feed is full of people who complain, criticize, or post depressing news routinely, hide or unfriend them. This type of consist negative input will not help you get out of your funk.

, Renew your connections with the people who are most important to you, especially those who bring out the best in you.


Reconnecting with people who have meant a lot to you throughout your life can help remind you of where you have been as an individual, how you have changed, and where you are going in life.
Think about the friend who is guaranteed to make you laugh and feel alive and energized, and call up that person and ask to meet for dinner and dancing. Dress up, have fun, and let yourself really let loose.

Stick to a consistent bedtime to help set your body’s internal clock, and you’ll be on your way to a fresh face in the morning in no time.,

Put them away about half an hour to an hour before sleeping.

, To help you look your best in the morning, experts also recommend sleeping on your back to reduce sleep lines upon awakening. Sleeping on your back can also help to reduce face puffiness and the formation of early-onset wrinkles. You can also try sleeping with more pillows under your head, propping up your body at a 25-30 degree angle, which some research finds reduces dark circles formation by eliminating blood pooling in the tiny vessels of the face during sleep., This may help reduce lower facial wrinkles caused by the bending forward of the face when sleeping with a pillow., Whether you hit the snooze button constantly in the morning, or only delay getting up by five minutes, using the snooze button at all will make you feel more tired. Sleep experts say that hitting the snooze button disrupts the inertia of your sleep, which in turn will make you feel (and look!) more tired throughout the morning. When you first wake up in the morning and feel like you want to go back to sleep, that is normal sleep inertia; however, allowing your body to go back to sleep and having to repeat the process again a few minutes later will cause your brain to feel this pronounced grogginess longer after you do finally get up. If you want to feel and look more awake right away, avoid post-snooze sleep and the snooze button!, Your body’s internal clock is extremely sensitive to light and darkness, so try to avoid confusing it by telling it to be awake when you’re still in the dark. A hefty dose of sunshine when you first wake up in the morning is one of the best ways to trick your body into waking up. And if you feel like you’re awake, you will look like you’re awake. If you open the curtains to overcast skies or you wake up before dawn, turn on a very strong light in every room you get ready in. For best results, try using the type of lightbulb used to treat seasonal affective disorder., If you have the willpower to wake up and do your full workout, that’s great! For many people though, just getting up in the morning is hard enough. Even if you feel extremely tired in the morning, another great way to perk up your appearance is to get the blood moving by taking a brisk walk around your room, doing a couple of jumping jacks, or stretching for about 5 minutes. This light exercise and stretching will help wake up your mind and body, and it will give you an alert look and a rosy, healthy glow., When you wake up feeling tired it can be tempting to skip the shower altogether for a few extra minutes of sleep; however, taking a shower is a great way to wake up in the morning. Adjust the water temperature to be as cool as you can handle it, and use an exfoliating scrub on your face and body. Exfoliating will scrub off the grime and bacteria from the previous day and brighten the skin, which will help you look more awake. Cold water also causes the blood vessels to constrict, which reduces redness and swelling, so your face will look more rested. Be sure to put moisturizer on afterward since dehydrated skin will look unhealthy and make you look tired., Sleep experts say that waking up and immediately reaching for your coffee is one of the worst ways to wake up. It gets your body in the habit of needing caffeine and makes your body think that it can’t possibly wake up without it when in fact it can. This means that on days when you don’t have enough coffee or any coffee at all, you will look way more tired than you really are because you’ve tricked yourself into thinking you’re sleepy. Instead, reach for a large glass of cold water and drink it briskly. This will wake you up and hydrate your skin, helping you look awake. Also don’t forget to eat breakfast rich in fiber and protein, which will set you up for a day of productivity., It may seem strange, but one of the most tried and true remedies to look awake and refreshed in the morning is to use cold spoons to de-puff your eyes. Place two spoons in your freezer while you get ready in the morning. Once they have cooled, gently press the spoons (curved side in) to your eye sockets. The combination of the cold and the pressure will make under-eye bags disappear, which will make you look wide awake and well-rested. Keep the spoons on your eyes until they are no longer cold, about 5 minutes., Red eyes are a sure sign that you are fatigued, so taking measures to make your eyes look white will immediately make you look less tired. There are several ways to do this depending on how much extra time you have in the morning:Use over-the-counter eye drops to clear up bloodshot eyes.
Apply a cold compress to your eyes for 10 - 15 minutes in the morning to help shrink the blood vessels around your eyes.
If you wear makeup, apply eyeliner that matches your skin tone to the inner lash line, called the waterline, of your lower eyelid. This will make the veins in your eyes less noticeable and the whites of your eyes will look brighter.

, Many people suffer from dark under-eye circles even when they are well rested, but still these circles are associated with fatigue. In fact, dark under-eye circles are not caused by a lack of sleep, these shadows are just more apparent when you’re tired because a lack of sleep makes you paler and more hollow-eyed. Whether the circles are chronic or because you pulled an all-nighter, there are ways to reduce their appearance and help you look less tired:Applying cold compresses (especially cold spoons!) will help get rid of dark circles as well as puffy eyes.
Try using saline washes or sprays to rinse away any nasal congestion, which can affect your blood pressure and pool blood in the veins and capillaries under your eyes.
Take a moment and gently massage your under-eye area with a cool wet washcloth or a frozen cotton swab for about 5 - 10 minutes. This will help disperse any blood pooled in the veins and capillaries under your eyes.
If you wear makeup, use a thick concealer with a yellow undertone to hide dark under-eye circles.

, On days where you need a little more help to look less tired in the morning, reach for a moisturizing product designed to perk up your skin. Look for products that contain refreshing ingredients like caffeine or green tea, which will help awaken your skin up from the inside out. To enhance the effectiveness of these products further, try keeping them in the refrigerator to that they are extra cool and refresh when applied to the skin."

Get comfortable.,
Cut out stimulants.,
Turn off the electronics.,
Stop your racing mind.,
Keep snacks light before bed.,
Stay on schedule.,
Try melatonin.,
Try a sleep aid.,
Understand when to see a doctor.",How to Get to Sleep and Feel Refreshed in the Morning1," Don't wear any clothes that are too tight or restricting or that will keep you too warm at night. They can keep you from falling asleep because you aren't comfortable, as well as make you restless later. One study even found that wearing tight clothing at night suppresses the release of melatonin, which is necessary for falling and staying asleep., Caffeine can interfere with your sleep even if it has been six hours since you last had any, so make sure to stop drinking it early.Another stimulant to avoid is nicotine; it's best to try to quit smoking and using all other nicotine containing products (vaporizing nicotine, chewing tobacco, patches, and gum) altogether if you are having trouble sleeping.Keep in mind that you may have a period of withdrawal as you are cutting out nicotine, and this may interfere with your sleep.Be sure to discuss any issues you are having with your doctor.

, At least an hour before you want to sleep, turn off your computer, phone, and television. The bright lights of the screen tell your brain to stay awake, so to get your mind ready for bed, they need to go.The blue light from screens is especially responsible for causing sleep disturbances., If you find you can't sleep because your brain keeps going, stop trying to sleep. Go try another activity for a time, such as reading a book. You'll begin to feel sleepy, and when you do, return to bed. This practice helps you to associate your bed with one thing--sleep.Another way to slow down your mind is to try meditation, as it clears your mind of thoughts if you do it properly. It also relaxes you, helps to regulate your sleep, go through more REM cycles, and sleep better overall.One simple meditation is to concentrate on your breaths. Take deep breaths in and out, focusing solely on your breaths.Try counting to four each time you inhale, and then repeat four counts each time you exhale to help slow your breaths. You can also use a guided meditation app to help you learn how to meditate.
Also, have a pen handy. That way, if you think of something you must do tomorrow, you can write it down instead of worrying about it., Big meals can cause indigestion or make you full enough that it keeps you awake. If you need a snack before bed, keep it light and have it at least 45 minutes before bed.Eating too much sugar, saturated fat, and not enough fiber can interfere with your sleep, so try to stick to a low sugar, low-saturated fat, and high fiber diet., Try going to sleep at the same time every night, as well as waking up at the same time every morning. This trains your body to want to go to bed when it's time for you to go to bed, helping you get to sleep easier., Melatonin is a hormone that tells you to sleep. Your body already produces it, but you can also take a supplement. It is relatively safe, though it can cause headaches, dizziness, and irritability, as well as make you drowsy the next day. Therefore, you should try it out on a weekend when you don't need to be anywhere in particular.


Orally, you can swallow a pill or buy lozenges that you leave to melt under your tongue. You can also use a cream that you rub into your skin.Usually, you take 0.3 to 0.5 milligrams near bedtime to help you get to sleep. The body generally produces 0.3 milligrams or less per day, so you can start with less than that (0.1 milligrams) and work your way up to a dose that helps you, up to 3 milligrams as an adult.However, keep in mind that more melatonin is not necessarily better. You may want to try a time release melatonin supplement if you have trouble staying asleep.Melatonin can react with other medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and blood pressure medications. Always check with your doctor first before starting a new supplement or over-the-counter medication., Over-the-counter medications can help you sleep. Most are antihistamines that make you drowsy. However, if you take them too often, they won't be effective anymore and may have long-term side-effects, such as dementia.Plus, they can make you groggy the next day.The two main categories are diphenhydramine, which is the main ingredient in Benadryl and Unisom SleepGels, and doxylamine succinate, the main ingredient in Unisom SleepTabs. Both of these are antihistamines that can make you drowsy in the day, give you blurred vision, and dry out your mouth.Always check with your doctor first. You shouldn't take these drugs if you have certain conditions, such as liver disease, asthma, glaucoma, or sleep apnea., If you're getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep a night, and still not feeling ok in the morning, you may need to see a doctor. You could have a sleep disorder such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome, or primary insomnia.Insomnia is a chronic condition where you can't go to sleep or you wake up often during the night.Sleep apnea keeps you from getting restful sleep because you stop breathing while you are sleeping. Restless legs syndrome is a tingling feeling in your legs that can keep you awake. Narcolepsy can cause you to fall asleep at almost any time against your control.Narcolepsy can also affect your sleep at night, such as by causing insomnia, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness, and bringing about a sudden need for sleep."

Vegetables, such as sprouted radish seeds, Chinese broccoli, and spinach, The best way to get vitamin D is through skin exposure. Take 10 to 15 minutes of your day and expose your bare skin to sunlight, which will trigger natural vitamin D production in your body.


If you can't get enough through sun, try to eat more foods with vitamin D, such as cod liver oil, tuna, salmon, mackerel, cheese, yogurt, and milk. These can be extremely helpful during winter months when you get less natural sun exposure., There are a number of supplements that can help you with your cramps as well as anxiety and restlessness associated with periods. Always check the dosing information and possible interactions with your doctor or gynecologist before starting a supplement regiment. Common supplements that are helpful for period symptoms that can cause insomnia include:

Learn about the hormones.,
Recognize period symptoms.,
See your doctor.",How to Sleep when on Your Period4," Part of the reason you may be unable to sleep is hormones. During your menstrual cycle, your levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone fluctuate in specific ways and cause insomnia. This is especially true during the time right before your period.Excessive sleeplessness during or right before your period may also be a sign of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), a condition more severe than Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) that most women suffer., There are certain symptoms you may experience during your period that may cause sleeplessness. During your period, you may be bloated or experience cramping, which can aggravate you enough to keep you awake. You may also suffer from headaches, nausea, an upset stomach, and increased body heat.


Psychological symptoms of your period may also include depression, anxiety, crying, and irritability, which may also cause you to have trouble sleeping., If you find that you have many nights of sleeplessness or that it happens every period, see your doctor. She may be able to help you figure out is there is an underlying problem or figure out additional medical options that might help you sleep better while on your period.

Skip the alcohol late at night.,
Take your pets out of the bedroom.,
Drown out the light.,
Cool down your room.,
Remove noise from the room.,
Change positions.",How to Get to Sleep and Feel Refreshed in the Morning2," Though alcohol can help you fall asleep, it can also make you restless later at night, meaning you won't wake up as refreshed.Stop drinking at least 2 hours before bedtime.Alcohol diminishes your ability to go into REM sleep, so you get less good quality sleep. Also, if you drink too much, it can affect your breathing, making your sleep not as sound., Your pets most likely do not sleep through the night like you do. They move around, make noise, and get up. These activities can wake you up, leaving you less rested. Try locking your pets out of your room for a night to see if you sleep better., Light tells your brain to wake up, so whether it's light from streetlights, the hallway, or even your bedside clock, it can keep you up. Blue light emitted by electronics like your TV, computer, and smartphone can also raise your cortisol levels and cause major sleep disturbances.Use dark curtains on the window, especially if you have a good amount of early morning light, and place towels under doors if you need to do so. Cover up your clock so it's not shining so brightly., In the same vein, your room should be cool enough for sleeping, as you'll toss and turn if you're too warm. Generally, you should aim for 65 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit.Studies show that people sleep better and for longer periods of time in colder rooms. In fact, studies have shown that a cool room can even help people who suffer from sleep apnea sleep better. Your body follows circadian rhythms when it comes temperature, cooling down as you get closer to nighttime. However, if your body runs a bit hotter overall, you may have trouble falling asleep if you're not in a cool room, as your body can't cool down for sleep.Be aware that temperature above 75 degrees or below 54 degrees can make it harder for you to sleep., That is, you should definitely turn off noises such as the television and radio, but you should also take out anything smaller that makes noise, such as a ticking clock. Even small sounds can keep you awake or wake you up.If you can't stop certain noises, try earplugs or a white noise app to drown them out., Just because you've slept on your back your whole life doesn't mean that's the best position for you. Try sleeping on your side, or if you must stay on your back, maybe you need to support your knees and back with pillows to help keep you comfortable throughout the night."

Try a gentle alarm clock.,
Be in the sunlight.,
Drink water.,
Have some coffee.,
Give yourself energy.,
Try exercise.",How to Get to Sleep and Feel Refreshed in the Morning3," Your body doesn't like to be jolted out of sleep, and you may feel more groggy if you have a loud, obnoxious alarm clock. Try one that has a more gradual alarm, such as one that slowly gets louder.Try using an alarm app that will wake you up slowly., As soon as you can in the morning, try to get some sunlight. Either step outside or let sunlight into your bedroom Sunlight tells your body to wake up, so you'll be awake to start the day.Your body's natural rhythms are set by the sun and night. Basically, the sunlight tells your body it's morning, and it's time to start the day., You lose water during the night from sweating and through breathing. Make it one of your top priorities to drink a glass of water early in the morning, prepping you for the rest of the day., Though you want to skip the caffeine later in the day, you can use some in the morning to get you going. Just don't go overboard; 1 to 2 cups is sufficient. Try programming your coffeepot to start brewing just before your alarm. The smell will help you wake up, plus you'll have coffee ready to go., Just like your car needs gas to go, your body needs food to go. Give it what it needs by having a breakfast complete with protein and a complex carbohydrate, such as peanut butter on whole wheat toast. Skip overly sugary breakfasts, such as sugary cereals or waffles with syrup.However, keep in mind that sugar can hide in all kinds of foods. For example, some studies have shown that bread, including whole wheat bread, may increase your blood sugar as much as eating two tablespoons of sugar.Check the ingredients list on anything you eat to be sure.


Try oatmeal, which is packed with fiber and is a complex carbohydrate. Use fruit to sweeten it, and add some protein, such as a few almonds or peanuts.Eat Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt has more protein than other yogurts, so it's a great choice for the mornings. Try it plain with some fruit to add sweetness., Nothing wakes you up like a morning workout, so try jogging or an aerobic routine in the morning to get your day going. As an added bonus, people who exercise tend to sleep better at night, so you'll have a more restful night later.Avoid doing anything too strenuous in the evening hours because this may keep you up at night."

Improve your own sleep habits.,
Expose yourself to light.,
Manipulate your alarm clock.,
Entice yourself with morning smells.,
Invest in smart alarms.,
Buy a Clocky alarm.,
Get a sunrise simulating alarm clock.,
Familiarize yourself with the different stages of sleep.,
Understand how the snooze button affects sleep.,
Learn why good sleeping habits are important.",How to Stop Hitting the Snooze Button," Our bodies are good at regulating sleep/wake cycles on their own. Improving sleep schedules and practicing good sleep hygiene can result in us feeling more rested in the morning. This means we're less likely to reach for the snooze button when the morning comes.


Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, including weekends. Go to bed early enough so that you can get seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Our bodies will begin to adjust to that sleep cycle and begin moving into lighter stages of sleep in preparation for our alarm. In fact, if you're on a regular sleep cycle you may end up waking up before your alarm goes off at all.Avoid eating heavy protein-based meals before bed. Protein is harder for the body to digest, which can keep you up at night. Some studies indicate whole grains might promote sleep.Avoid the TV and the computer Blue light emitted by many electronic devices energizes our brain and makes sleeping difficult. You should strive to power off all electronic devices an hour before you aim to go to sleep.While alcohol can make you sleepy, drinking before bed decreases the amount of REM sleep you experience. This means when morning comes you're more tired, which might result in reaching for the snooze button.Avoid coffee and other caffeinated beverages before bedtime. Coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, chocolate all contain caffeine and this may interfere with your ability to fall and stay asleep. Avoid drinking coffee in the evening. Even drinking caffeinated beverages in the afternoon or drinking too much caffeine early in the day may affect your sleep.;
, Our circadian clocks are wired to wake us up in the presence of sunlight. Exposure to natural or artificial light early in the mornings can help us feel energized at the beginning of the day. This can help us get up and get moving rather than hitting snooze.Try opening your blinds or curtains as soon as you wake up. You could even leave curtains open overnight so the natural sunlight creeps in gradually as morning comes.
If you don't have a window near your bed, try flipping a light switch on immediately. If you share a bedroom with a significant other or roommate, try immediately leaving the bedroom and turning a light on in the hallway.

, Oftentimes, we press the snooze button out of convenience. If you change where your alarm clock is set up, this might reduce your likelihood of pressing snooze in the morning.


Set up your alarm clock on other side of room. Simply having to get up, cross the room, and turn the alarm off sometimes wakes us up enough that we do not want to go back to sleep.Set up multiple alarm clocks. Having a variety of alarms you need to turn off can take extra time. This means we start feeling awake before the temptation to press the snooze button arises.
Adjust alarm by a few minutes. Sometimes, hitting snooze is simply a comforting habit and the extra 10 minutes are gratifying. It becomes a problem when 10 minutes turn into 30 minutes or even an hour, however. If you're really addicted to the snooze button, adjusting your alarm 10 minutes before you need to get up allows you to indulge the habit without it having too much effect on sleep.

, If you associate certain smells with morning time, your brain might be wired to get up in their presence. Try creating scents that motivate you to get out of bed and forgo the snooze button.


Coffee is a morning staple for many. If you have a coffee pot with a timer, try setting it to begin brewing 15 minutes before you need to be awake.Peppermint and citrus fruit also have the power to wake us up. Using a citrus scented hand wash in the bathroom might motivate you to remain moving in the morning., Smart alarms are a relatively new technology that monitor sleep cycles in order to wake you up when your body begins to enter a lighter stage of sleep. This results in you feeling less groggy when the alarm goes off, as you're physically prepared for morning.


Prices range from affordable to very expensive. Mobile device versions, which connect to an iPod or Android, are generally $99. Stand alone alarms are about $150.Some alarms attach to your wrist while others involve the use of a headset. They monitor brain activity and sleep patterns and are scheduled to go off when you're ready to wake up.There is also a 99-cent app called Sleep Cycle, which analyzes sleep patterns using an algorithm. The app may be less accurate, however, than more expensive devices.There are some phone apps in which you can only deactivate an alarm by completing a math problem or vigorously shaking the phone. Such activities might help wake you up in the morning, meaning you're less likely to press snooze and fall back to sleep.

, A Clocky alarm clock is a robotic clock that moves around the room when the alarm goes off. You have to chase and catch Clocky in order to turn the alarm off, and while there is a snooze option it can be disabled. Clocky costs around $40, but can be more or less depending on the retailer., As stated, sunlight can help get you out of bed fast. If your bedroom is not near a window, a sunrise simulating alarm clock can be a big help.


Sunrise simulating alarm clocks come with a built in light that gradually brighten in the hours before an alarm is scheduled to go off.Sunlight alarms are ideal for people who are already the morning type. If you have existing issues waking up, the sunlight alarm is not likely to have any major effects on your sleep cycle., The reason the snooze button can be bad for rest is related to the different stages of sleep. Alarms often interrupt the brain during crucial moments of rest. This drives your desire to hit the snooze button.


REM sleep is the deepest stage of sleep during the sleep cycle. The body has a natural clock that regulates sleeping and waking, and about an hour before we need to be up we start moving out of REM sleep in preparation for morning. Sleep gets lighter, body temperature rises, and hormones designed to spark energy are released.If we don't have a normal sleep/wake cycle, our alarm clocks often cut REM sleep short and we wake up before our bodies have begun preparing for the morning. This often results in people feeling tired or jolted, and hitting the snooze button for added sleep., Sometimes, with sleep, less is more. Oftentimes, especially if we do not have a regular sleep/wake cycle, hitting the snooze button results in us feeling more tired.


If you wake up during REM sleep and then hit the snooze button, you may return to deep sleep mode. Waking from deep sleep mode before moving through a lighter stage of sleep shocks our bodies. This is known as sleep inertia.Hitting the snooze button doubles the impact, causing feelings of grogginess later in the day.It's better to set your alarm for the actual time you get up and allow yourself to get the REM hours uninterrupted. If your alarm is set for 8AM but you always end up hitting snooze until 8:20, for example, just set your alarm for 8:20., While there is no scientific consensus on the exact reasons humans sleep, the effects poor sleep habits have on the mind and body are well documented. Understanding the consequences of poor quality sleep serves as a great motivator to eliminate the snooze button.


Our brains prep for the coming day when we sleep and high quality sleep aids in memory, learning, and problem solving. Sleep deficiency can alter activity in certain portions of the brain, leading to issues with concentration, controlling your emotions, and making decisions.Physically, not sleeping can take a toll on our bodies. Risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke increase with poor sleeping habits. Sleep deficiency also increases the risk of obesity and causes hormonal imbalances that trigger hunger, fatigue, and mood swings."

Sleep at least 8 hours a day.,
Avoid stimulants.,
Create a perfect sleep room.,
Create a sleep routine.",How to Look Refreshed when You Wake Up2," Sleep will really improve your healthy look. The younger people are, the more sleep they need, with teens needing up to ten hours, and even younger kids needing more., Most people drink or eat stimulants throughout the day. Avoiding stimulants like coffee, tea, or soda for four to six hours before you decide to go to sleep could help you get a good night’s rest., There are multiple ways to improve your sleep by adjusting the stimuli around you. While you may fall asleep easily some nights and are restless others, science provides a few guidelines for a better night’s sleep.


Turn down the thermostat. Going to sleep quickly, and getting better overall sleep, is assisted by cooler temps between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15-21 Celsius). Not only that, but cooler environments promote deeper, longer sleep, while humidity has been linked to wakefulness and worse overall sleep.Turn your room into a cave of darkness. When your eyes detect a lessening light, they send a message to the brain and the hormone melatonin begins to rise, signaling a need for sleep. The entry of light during your typical sleep cycle reverses that process, and wakes the body up by raising body temperature, lowering melatonin, and otherwise getting people ready for the day., Incorporate a few ways to relax yourself before sleep so that you’ll be completely rested and accustomed to sleep after the same routine. Try a few of the following ideas to spur your imagination:


Use various forms of exercise to improve your sleep. Yoga before bed is a perfect way to limber up, relax, and get ready to sleep.
Try reading or writing a few pages. Reading lowers stress levels in the body fairly drastically for the amount of time reading. Just six minutes has been shown to significantly lower the heart rate and ease the body.Take a hot bath or shower. When you take a hot bath, your body temperature rises to abnormal levels. Upon getting out, the temperature quickly cools and leads to relaxation. Some studies have shown a direct correlation between temperature decline in proximity to sleep onset."

Apply moisturizer after your nightly shower.Moisturizers work on all types of skin: normal, dry, oily, and sensitive.,
Get rid of the dark circles under your eyes.",How to Look Refreshed when You Wake Up3," Sun exposure causes several skin problems like age spots and wrinkles. Try to minimize sun exposure so that your skin looks refreshed in the morning.


Use sunscreen religiously. SPF of 15 or more is recommended. Remember to reapply regularly, especially if you’re exercising.Find shade during the hottest points of the day. Try not to be in the sun during the middle of the day. Seek shelter and keep your skin looking young and healthy.
Be delicate with your skin. Don’t use abrasive soaps or chemicals when cleaning. Be sure to shave with the grain rather than against it. Follow up cleaning by patting dry instead of rubbing harshly., Retinoids are in products like Renova, Retin-A, Tretinoin, and some over-the-counter items. They help fight acne, lines, spots, and freckles, as well as boosting the collagen., There are a variety of ways you can use makeup to either benefit or hurt your skin. Try a few of the tips below to make your skin look better while still using makeup.


Clean your makeup brushes regularly. Some studies have shown a majority of women don’t clean the bacteria-collecting brushes. Clean the brushes once a week with warm water and a bit of facial cleanser.Remove your makeup before you go to sleep. Keeping makeup on overnight can cause yeast growth, rashes, and bumps called milia cysts. Use an oil-free cleanser to wipe your skin clear of makeup.Stay free from oil-based makeup. Most people have some spots of oily skin, and adding an oil-based makeup can lead to multiple problems. Alleviate clogged pores, extra blemishes, and acne by staying away from products with extra oil., Unclean pores can get clogged and appear larger. Clear out the dirt and oil by exfoliating with a light brush and facial cleanser every night., They protect your skin and even it out, hiding blemishes in the process., Try a few of the following solutions: Tea bags, spoons, or cucumbers.

On top of that, exercise aids in circulation which feeds skin cells with oxygen and nutrients, it dilates the skin, and reduces inflammation.There are multiple ways exercise makes you look refreshed.


Clean your skin before you work out to help keep your pores unclogged.
Keep your skin cooler and cleaner by wearing moisture-wicking clothing to get the perspiration away from your skin. This also helps prevent acne.Exercise in a cool environment that helps keep your body temperature down. This can help prevent flare-ups of some skin conditions.Apply a skin moisturizer. Using skin moisturizer before exercise helps repel sweat, and applying afterwards – especially after swimming – helps fight dry, cracked skin and unhealthy appearance.Exercise reduces stress and anxiety. Feel happy about your condition, your confidence, and your fitness. Even just 15 minutes of exercise can reduce anxiety levels., Studies have shown that alternating hot and cold treatment, even including a sauna, has great benefits. Blood flow is increased, the metabolism speeds up, depression is minimized, and the body is stimulated. After you're cleaned up, alternate between the coldest temperature you can tolerate, then the hottest, and finish with the coldest again., Smoking has been related through studies to a variety of skin aging issues as well as skin conditions like psoriasis. The heat from the cigarette directly affects the skin, and the elasticity is worsened because the blood vessels are constricted. On top of that, levels of vitamin A are reduced., Eat meals healthy for your body, those high in fiber with minimal fats, especially saturated fat. These diets boost energy and mood, while poorer diets make you drowsy and miserable.Choose foods with folic acid and Vitamin B12, like leafy green vegetables and beans, to reduce symptoms of depression. Eat plenty of fruits. Some studies have linked eating fruit to better physical health, and better feelings about personal health.Eat fish often. Multiple studies have linked eating plenty of seafood to lower levels of depression. Try to fit fish with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids into your daily diet., Drink about 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water per day. Drinking plenty of water has been shown to increase blood flow and elasticity of the skin, making it appear thicker, moister, and healthier."

Get enough sleep.,
Decide on a schedule.,
Create a nighttime routine.,
Make your bedroom conducive to sleeping.,
Don't hit snooze.",How to Make Yourself Wake Up1," Getting enough sleep will make waking up easier. The National Health, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends that adults get about seven to nine hours a night, though each person is different. Make sure you are getting your recommended amount of sleep if you are having trouble waking up., If you fall asleep and wake up at the same time every day, you'll find it much easier to wake up in the morning.Your sleep schedule will most likely be based on your work or school schedule. Decide when you need to be up in the morning to get ready and count back seven or nine hours, depending on how much sleep you need. You should keep this schedule even on weekends.


Another benefit of a sleep schedule is it helps you get better quality sleep, meaning you wake up feeling more rested., Make a plan to enjoy relaxing in bed by yourself or with your partner without a TV or electronic devices. Take a bath, sip some chamomile tea, or try meditation to cue the release of sleep hormones.Start your routine at least an hour before you need to be asleep. If you can't remember to start at the right time, set an alarm on your phone to tell you when you need to start winding down.
The blue light from electronic devices is particularly stimulating and suppresses the production of sleep hormones.It's best to turn them off about an hour before bed to help cue your brain to sleep.

, Make sure your room is dark, including blacking out the windows and even covering up the light from your alarm clock. In addition, try to block out any noise, either through earplugs or white noise. Finally, make sure your bed is comfortable for sleeping, including your pillows, sheets, and blankets., Get up as soon as your alarm goes off. Resist hitting the snooze button, or setting multiple alarms, as this can make you more groggy. Those five or 10 minutes of extra sleep are tempting, and you may think it will help you feel more rested, but it can actually make it harder for you to get up. This is because if you fall asleep, you are restarting your sleep cycle,and the beginning of the sleep cycle is the most difficult point from which to try and wake up.


You should not hit the snooze even when you have time to sleep in, as it sets a bad precedent.
If you have trouble responding to the alarm, try one that gets louder, moves across the room, or adds light to the sound.

,, Ask your local American Red Cross for information on what they suggest every family prepare to do. Then develop your own plan, writing down the steps on paper.
Talk about potential disasters and emergencies and how to respond to each using your family plan. Choose a meeting place, other than your home, for family to gather in case you can't go home.
Give this emergency plan to all your family members. Have a family talk and give them a copy. Leave a copy in a prominent place in case other adults (e.g., babysitters) are in your home during an emergency.
Choose someone outside your home who can be an ""emergency check-in"" person in case someone cannot reach you or your family. Keep this person's telephone number and address with your plan and first aid kit. Give this number to friends and family members, including any children.

, This includes the following:


Water. Each person needs 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water each day.
Food. Store canned foods such as soups, beans, vegetables, fruit and juices, peanut butter, etc. Keep a non-electric can opener ready. If you have pets, stock up on dry or canned pet food.
Personal-care. Store soap, toothpaste, contact lens solution, feminine hygiene products, nursing pads, clothes, etc.
Baby care. The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend breastfeeding for optimal infant nutrition. Breastfeeding remains the best infant feeding option in a natural disaster situation. Even when experiencing diarrhea, food-borne illness, or extreme stress, breastfeeding mothers continue to produce ample milk for their babies. Also store baby supplies such as diapers, wipes, baby food, bottles, etc.
First aid kit that is custom-made for your family and the risks that you might encounter.
Other supplies. Make sure you have large plastic bags that seal for water-proofing important papers, a battery-powered flashlight and radio with extra batteries or a wind-up radio, and a first-aid kit.

It also releases endorphins into your body, which will make you feel good as you wake up.As soon as you wake up, stretch your arms up over your head, towards the top of your bed. Feel your whole body stretch out, and breathe deeply a few times.You can also stretch your legs. Laying on your back, bring one leg up to your chest and hold it. Next, lift that leg straight up in the air in front of you. Switch to the other leg and do the same. Afterwards, you can bring both legs up to your chest at the same time, then roll your knees to one side and then the other., You can also try basic bodyweight exercises, such as push-ups and squats. Try spending about five minutes on both.For push-ups, get down on the floor face-down. Your body should be straight out with the balls of your feet on the floor. Place your hands flat on the floor, and push your body up and down. Don't go all the way down to the floor and keep your back straight.If you can't do them on the floor, try pushing off a wall.
For squats, with your feet at shoulder-width, put your hands at the back of your head. With your chest straight, bend your knees to lower yourself towards the floor. Return to the standing position and repeat. Do not let your knees go past your toes., For at least 30 seconds, walk in place. Try pulling your heel all the way up to you buttocks. You can also do bicep curls at the same time by holding your arms face-up and front of you (bent at the elbow) and bringing them up to your chest as you bring up your heel. You can do this exercise for longer, if you prefer."

Expose yourself to light when you get up.,
Take a shower.,
Try caffeine.,
Set your alarm clock to music.,
Get a laugh in.,
Start a routine that makes your morning easier to handle.",How to Make Yourself Wake Up3," Light tells your system that you are ready to get up and stops the production of melatonin, a hormone that makes you sleepy. By spending a few minutes in sunlight, either by opening your blinds or going outside, you're signaling to your body that it's time to start the day.If you live in a grey and cloudy climate, consider buying a sun lamp to increase your exposure to light in the mornings.
In addition, one study showed that people who were exposed to more sunlight in the morning had a lower BMI overall than those who had more sunlight later in the day. The reasoning is that because sunlight early on regulates your natural circadian rhythm, it also maintains how your body uses energy., Taking a shower, whether warm, hot, or cold, can help you wake up in the morning;however, a cold shower is more likely to shock you awake if you really need the jolt.

, Caffeine can be beneficial in helping you wake up. It can give you an energy boost in the morning, especially if it's something you're used to doing. The key is to keep your caffeine consumption in the range of 200 to 300 milligrams per day.To help gauge how much caffeine that is, a cup of coffee can have anywhere from 80 milligrams to 175 milligrams. On the other hand, most U.S. brands of tea have about 40 milligrams a cup, whereas sodas are generally in the 35 milligram to 45 milligram range., Instead of a annoying beep or buzz, set your alarm to play a song you love. Music can increase your energy, and if it's a song you enjoy, you'll be more inclined to jump out of bed., Studies have shown that laughing increases alertness; therefore, whether you read the comics or spend a few minutes perusing internet memes, laughing in the morning can help you wake up., Set out your clothes at night, and place your coffee maker on an automatic timer. If you have an established routine, it can help get you moving when you wake up."

Your condition may require hospitalization in case of chronic symptoms or serious signs, such as severe edema or blurred vision.;
, Hydralazine is a vasodilator that is widely used in treating postpartum preeclampsia for lowering the blood pressure quickly, in 10 to 20 minutes. It works by causing peripheral vasodilatation in the arteries, leading to arterial relaxation and lowering blood pressure,


Hydralazine can be given intravenously or by intramuscular route with a dose of 5 mg to be given every fifteen minutes, until a total maximum dose of 20 mg is reached.
The patient is supposed to have lower blood pressure readings after administration, but if not; doctors usually switch to another antihypertensive agent.
Hydralazine may have some side effects such as a sudden drop in blood pressure, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), or headaches.

, Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker that has a vasodilator effect on the peripheral blood vessels rather than the cardiac muscles. It acts by interfering with the calcium movement at the vascular membranes, resulting in decreased vasoconstriction and therefore reduced blood pressure,


Nicardipine is given in the hospital through an intravenous route with a dose of 5 mg an hour as an initial dose, to be reduced by half til a 15% reduction in blood pressure readings is achieved.
The patient may develop headaches after its usage. For mild cases; Nicardipine tablets can be administrated by the doctor as Pelcard SR to avoid a continuous raise in the blood pressure and the development of other complications.

, Sodium Nitroprusside is a vasodilator that is used in severe cases, as it has a very rapid action (within one minute). It uses peripheral vasodilatation to lower the blood pressure.


This drug is given intravenously with a dose of 0.2 microgram / kg to be increased up to 10 microgram / kg to obtain the desired decrease in blood pressure.
However; this drug has some side effects such as rebound hypertension, headache and cyanide toxicity.

, Labetalol is a non-selective B receptor blocker and selective alpha one blocker, these two actions give it a powerful antihypertensive effect by acting on the alpha one receptors and a type of Beta receptors located at the smooth walls of the systemic vascular system, aiming to reduce the peripheral resistance and so lowering the blood pressure.


Labetalol can be given as an intravenous infusion in hospitalized cases to give a rapid action in about five minutes, with an initial dose of 20 mg. Labetalol tablets are also available for mild preeclampsia cases, and are to be taken under doctor’s prescriptions only.
Overdoses should be avoided to prevent sudden hypotension. Doctors should pay increased attention to women with cardiac failure or asthma while taking this drug.

, Diuretics shouldn’t be used due to the risk of additional hyperuricemia (Increased serum uric acid) or hypokalemia (further decrease in potassium levels), and to prevent an additional decrease in the blood circulation, as a result of renal dysfunction that fails to reabsorb nutrition as potassium, or to eliminate uric acid.

, Magnesium Sulfate is the main therapy line used to treat seizures that arise from postpartum preeclampsia. It is thought to act directly on the brain causing cerebral vasodilatation and increasing the blood perfusion to the brain, thus decreasing the vasospasm from preeclampsia,


It is mainly given through intravenous injection with a dose of four to six gm over twenty minutes as an initial dose, then to be given as an IV infusion with an adjusted dose of 2 gm per hour.
Magnesium sulfate was found to be more powerful in controlling seizures than other drugs as phenytoin or diazepam., Blood pressure should be monitored all the way through the pregnancy months and after delivery, especially if the patient complains of hypertension before getting pregnant or if it developed while having her baby.


Any signs of unusual blood pressure readings should be carefully observed and watched by the doctor and controlled with safe drugs that can be administrated during pregnancy.
Methyldopa is an example of a safe drug to be given to pregnant women without any harm to their babies. However; some doctors reported the development of depression in women using Methyldopa. It’s available as Aldomet tablets to be taken up to three times daily or as doctor’s orders.

, Note that the aim while treating emergency cases of postpartum preeclampsia is to lower the blood pressure readings to be less than 160 / 110 mmHg.


In emergency cases hospitals may receive some cases with hypertension readings of 200 mmHg or more for the systolic readings, which highly indicates cerebral hemorrhage and damage. Lowering the readings to 160 mmHg or less is critical to prevent further cerebral damage.
This can be done using Sodium Nitroprusside, Nifedipine, Hydralazine or Labetalol through the intravenous route, then careful monitoring and observation of the patient’s state is required to gradually decrease her blood pressure til it is within the range of 130-140 / 100-95 mmHg.

, Extra care should be taken if the mother has any other chronic underlying diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiac disorders, renal diseases, obesity, smoking, hypertension or a previous preeclampsia condition.


All of this information can be found in the mother’s medical profile and from a good follow up with her. A close follow up should be made after her delivery.
Any signs of edema, or excessive high blood pressure readings should be noted and treated immediately, other complication signs such as seizures or blurred vision must be treated at once.

, Serum creatinine and uric acid levels, plus protein concentrations in urine provide a good indication of the kidneys state and actual function, so they should be observed closely.


When the medical team find no worries in her test readings, and if her blood pressure readings are stable while on antihypertensive drugs, she can return home with strong recommendations on adhering to her drugs.
The woman will also need to practice constant observation of her blood pressure readings. She can easily keep a record of her readings with her, so she can ask her doctor about unusual signs that might develop.

, After returning home, the patient should attend all of her doctor’s appointments for continuous medical counseling and treatment.


Medical care is continued until the sixth week after birth to ensure that all normal values of blood pressure, kidney and liver functions have returned. Her doctor has to make sure that she is taking all of her medications as instructed and monitor her blood pressure.
The doctor should also physically examine her for any signs of swollen legs or face, headache or any other symptoms.

, In case of any future pregnancies, a woman with a history of preeclampsia or postpartum preeclampsia should be advised to take low doses of aspirin (75 mg) on a daily bases before sleeping.


Reports showed that aspirin helped in reducing the chances of preeclampsia in some cases, when the aspirin was given from 16 weeks of gestation til giving birth.
Moreover; it was found that hypocalcaemia (low calcium concentrations) can contribute to the occurrence of postpartum preeclampsia in many cases by increasing the elevation of blood pressure.
Therefore the woman should take daily calcium supplements or increase her dietary calcium intake to equal a dose of 500 mg calcium daily.

, Woman on any hypertension drugs should be switched to Methyldopa on becoming pregnant. She should then be observed and her blood pressure readings monitored to ensure that they stay within the normal range.

, There are some risk factors that can contribute to the development of preeclampsia after birth, these factors include:


Obesity or excess weight. Many reports showed that the more obese the pregnant woman was, the higher the risk of developing postpartum preeclampsia.
Hypertension (increased blood pressure) or the presence of proteins in urine is another contributing factor.
Cesarean section. If the woman gave birth via c-section during a previous pregnancy, there is a higher risk of her developing postpartum preeclampsia.
Certain chronic diseases can also increase the risk of postpartum preeclampsia, such as renal diseases or diabetes mellitus., The defined cause of preeclampsia is not well known. It could be due to placental abnormalities at the placental arteries, as these abnormalities can minimize the blood perfusion through the placenta, leading to the release of some chemicals that cause vasoconstriction and inflammation.


This leads to systemic damage and endothelial dysfunction, causing further vasoconstriction, capillary leakage, and low platelet counts.
All these changes can cause excessive elevation of blood pressure, escaping of fluids outside the cells due to endothelial cell dysfunction, and other postpartum preeclampsia signs that will be discussed below.

, Symptoms of postpartum preeclampsia happen after the child’s birth, from about 48 hours to six weeks after delivery. Some doctors refer to the latter as “late postpartum preeclampsia”.


Postpartum preeclampsia shows no signs during pregnancy, and the pregnant woman can actually have normal blood pressure while being pregnant. Symptoms include:
Very high blood pressure that can reach up to 180 mmHg for systolic readings, and 110 mmHg for diastole blood pressure. This can lead to other serious problems, such as edema, renal disorders, or cardiovascular issues.
Edema (swelling) in the lower extremities such as the legs, feet, hands or even the face or around the eyes.
The above changes directly affect many vital organs as the kidneys, kidneys are so sensitive and are affected by any change in the blood volume reaching them, and in this case; a decrease in the blood circulation causes a decrease in the normal blood supply to kidneys, this leads to a drop in renal normal functions.
Excessive gain weight or obesity as a result of the gathered fluids and water accumulated under the skin layers.
Other signs related to the central nervous system include severe headache, blurred vision, cerebral edema or seizures.
In severe conditions; pulmonary edema may develop as a result of continuous escaping and gathering of excessive fluids outside the cells due to the endothelial dysfunction, causing a dangerous problem at the affected woman lungs., Diagnosis mainly depends on the symptoms that a recently pregnant woman is experiencing after her birth. If she felt any of the previous symptoms; like excessive swollen legs, feet or face, very strong unusual headache with severe pain, blurred vision, chest or upper stomach pain, she should see her doctor immediately.


Tests that the doctor will perform are blood tests, blood pressure readings, and urine tests. Another less frequent test that is performed in case of chronic untreated cases of postpartum preeclampsia is an Electroencephalogram “EEG” to detect electrical activity of the brain.
A Magnetic Resonance Imaging “MRI” test can also be performed to detect seizures in the patient, and to check on other internal organs.

Drink plenty of water.,
Take your prenatal vitamins with food and water.,
Add sources of vitamin B6 to your diet.",How to Reduce Nausea During Pregnancy1," Some foods that provide the nutrients and calories necessary to sustain your pregnancy also soothe morning sickness. But don't be too concerned if your diet isn't as balanced as you'd like it to be during early pregnancy. Many women have a very short list of foods they can tolerate during the first trimester.The starch in whole grains and legumes reduces acid in your digestive tract, making nausea less severe. Combine complex carbohydrates with lean protein for an energy boost that may improve your condition. Examples of whole grains include whole wheat bread and corn. Examples of legumes include beans and peas. Lean protein can include any cut of meat or poultry where the fat has been trimmed, or meat alternatives such as tofu.Bland crackers will settle your stomach when you can't keep other foods down.;
, Fresh ginger is an alternative remedy for all types of nausea, and is safe for pregnant women to consume. Grate ginger root and sprinkle it into tea or seltzer water. You may also bake it into cookies. Store bought ginger ale or ginger candy can help, but read labels to make sure products are derived from pure ginger instead of artificial flavoring., Preparing small meals and snacks, and frequently consuming them, can help to reduce nausea. Overeating or gorging on food infrequently will increase the feelings of nausea right after you eat.Hunger pangs may trigger nausea, so try to start eating before you feel hungry, or immediately after you feel an urge for food.
Do not overeat. Eat until you are satisfied, then wait until the urge for food returns before you continue eating.

, The types of food that trigger nausea change from person to person and can even change throughout the course of your pregnancy. So, it is important to monitor the types of foods that make you nauseous during the different phases of your pregnancy and avoid them.Foods to steer clear of include fatty foods, spicy foods, foods with a strong odor and foods with unappealing texture. Foods you previously enjoyed may seem unappetizing during early pregnancy, and you should avoid eating foods that make you feel nauseous when you think about or smell them.Do not drink alcohol at any time during pregnancy. Besides subjecting the fetus to birth defects, it also exacerbates nausea.

, Doctors recommend that you drink at least 1.5 quarts (1.4 liters) of water per day to keep yourself hydrated and prevent vomiting.If food often seems unappetizing, drink small amounts of water throughout the day. Carbonated seltzer water might be more soothing to your stomach than plain water.
Make sure you are not chugging water first thing in the morning. Try keeping some saltines on the bedside table, nibble them in the morning, and wait at least 30 minutes after waking up to consume any water.

, The nutrients in your vitamins can overwhelm your digestive system and make nausea worse, so make sure to eat before you take the vitamins and drink plenty of water before, with and after taking your vitamins.If your prenatal vitamin still bothers you when taken with a meal, talk to your physician about switching to a less potent vitamin until your nausea spells subside.
Some prenatal vitamins contain extra vitamin B6 to combat nausea.

, Vitamin B6 can help control nausea. Try eating foods rich in vitamin B6, such as chicken breast, beef, chickpeas, potatoes, and bananas.You can also talk to your doctor about taking a B6 vitamin — 100mg twice daily should help with nausea.

Vitamin B6 supplements can be combined with ½ tablet of Unisom (doxylamine) — this combination nearly mimics an FDA approved morning sickness/nausea medication called Diclegis.
Do not use doxylamine if you are still breastfeeding another baby.

Drink lots of fluids.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Wear only one layer of clothes.,
Remember to take your prenatal vitamins.,
Take a fever-reducing medication.,
Avoid homeopathic medications.",How to Reduce Fever During Pregnancy1," It is always important you talk to your healthcare provider first to let her know your symptoms and to confirm there is nothing to be concerned about. Your doctor can also diagnose the underlying cause for fever and treat it instead of just treating the symptom itself.Some common causes for fever during pregnancy include cold, flu, food poisoning, and urinary tract infection (see next section for more details).
Do not wait to contact your doctor if the fever is associated with other symptoms, such as rash, nausea, contractions, or abdominal pain.
Go to the hospital if you have a fever and your water breaks.Contact your doctor if your fever does not improve within 24-36 hours or immediately if you experience a fever above 100.4 F.
A prolonged fever can have negative effects on the baby and/or increase the risk of miscarriage. If you are unable to get the fever down, contact your healthcare provider or midwife for further instructions.Unless your doctor advises otherwise, you can try the next steps to reduce fever.;
, A bath or a shower is an effective way to reduce fever. This is because when water evaporates off your skin it will draw heat and helps lower your body temperature.Do not use cold water as this can lead to shivers which in turn can increase your body temperature.
Do not use rubbing alcohol in the bath water because the vapors can cause harm.

, One way to reduce fever is to place a cool, dampened washcloth over your forehead. This helps draw heat out of your body and reduces your body temperature. Another way to bring down fever is by using an overhead or standing fan to help remove heat from your body. Sit or lie under a fan. Use it on a low setting so you do not get chilled.

, It is important that you keep your body well hydrated and replenish the water that is lost during fever.Drinking water helps keep you hydrated but also helps cool your body from the inside out.

, Often times, fever is a normal reaction that occurs when your body fights off an infection. Thus, it is important you get plenty of rest to allow your immune system to do its job.Stay in bed and avoid excessive stress and activity.
If you are experiencing dizziness, it is important you lie down and avoid moving around to reduce the risk of stumbling or falling.

, Do not overdress when pregnant, especially if you have fever. Wearing several layers of clothes can lead to overheating. If your body temperature remains elevated, it can lead to heat stroke or even premature labor.Dress in a single layer of light, breathable fabric, such as cotton, that will allow for proper air circulation.
Use a sheet or a thin blanket to cover yourself but only if needed.

, Prenatal vitamins can help boost your immune system and help maintain vitamin and mineral balance.Take your prenatal vitamins with plenty of water after a meal.

, Ask your healthcare provider or midwife if it is safe for you to take a fever-reducing medication, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Acetaminophen (or paracetamol) can be used to lower fever and can make you feel more comfortable, while your body fights off the underlying cause of fever.Acetaminophen is usually considered safe for pregnant women; however, it should not be taken in combination with caffeine (such as migraine pills).You should not take aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (such as ibuprofen) when you are pregnant. Taking these medications can affect your baby’s development. If you are unsure what you can or cannot take, ask your doctor.If acetaminophen does not bring down your fever, contact your healthcare provider or midwife immediately.

, Talk to your healthcare provider or midwife before taking any homeopathic or over-the-counter medications as some of these may affect your baby.This includes large amounts of vitamins, Echinacea, or any other homeopathic remedies.

Utilize aromatherapy.,
Do Yoga.",How to Reduce Nausea During Pregnancy3," Some home remedies, folk remedies and alternative treatments suggested to eliminate nausea during pregnancy have yet to be proven effective by medical science, while others are merely supported by anecdotal evidence. However, claims by women who have experienced nausea during pregnancy suggest that certain alternative therapies can provide relief, so they are worth considering., Acupressure, which is a method of applying pressure to certain points of the body to promote increased blood flow has shown some efficacy in treating nausea.Acupressure wristbands can be useful in dealing with pregnancy related nausea.

Recognize the symptoms of the flu.,
Identify the symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI).,
Recognize the signs of gastrointestinal virus.,
Know the symptoms of listeriosis.",How to Reduce Fever During Pregnancy2," A viral cold, also called an upper respiratory infection, is a common cause for fever during pregnancy. Most of us have experienced a seasonal cold at some point in our lives but with a suppressed immune system during pregnancy, the risk of getting a cold is higher.Symptoms are usually mild and include fever (100 F or higher), chills, runny nose, sore throat, muscle aches, and cough.Unlike bacterial infections, viral illnesses cannot be treated with antibiotics and usually resolve after your own immune system fights off the virus.
Drink plenty of fluids and try the normal home remedies mentioned in the first section to reduce fever and make yourself more comfortable.If you do not feel better within 3-4 days or if your symptoms worsen, call your doctor or midwife.

If you believe you have the flu while pregnant, you need to seek medical attention immediately.
There is no specific treatment for the flu besides treating the symptoms. Your doctor may recommend antiviral medication to lessen the time of the illness and reduce the risk of complications.Many pregnant women do need to be treated with Tamiflu or amantadine if they are diagnosed with the flu because some flu strains are more lethal to pregnant women than the general population.
Stay home and get plenty of rest and fluids. Follow the steps in the first section to reduce fever and make yourself more comfortable., A possible cause for fever during pregnancy (and otherwise) is a UTI, which is a bacterial infection that affects your urinary tract system (the urethra, ureters, kidneys, and bladder).UTI happens when bacteria gain access to your urinary tract and cause infection.Symptoms of UTI include fever, urge to urinate, burning sensation when urinating, cloudy or red-brown-colored urine, and pelvic pain.UTI can be effectively treated with certain antibiotics and thus, it is important you contact your doctor if you have any symptoms.You may also want to try cranberry juice although this has not been scientifically proven to treat UTI.If not treated, you can risk complications to yourself (kidney infection) or to your baby, including low birth weight, preterm delivery, sepsis, respiratory failure, and death.

, If your fever is associated with vomiting and diarrhea, you may suffer from a stomach flu (gastroenteritis), which is most often caused by a virus.Symptoms of stomach flu include fever, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, and headache.There is no treatment for viral stomach flu but luckily majority of the cases resolve on their own.

Take your prenatal vitamins.,
Eat for energy.,
Eat several small meals.,
Increase your water intake.,
Don't rely on caffeine for energy.",How to Reduce Fatigue During Pregnancy1," Pregnant women have many increased nutritional needs, and if you don't get the proper nutrition, you are more likely to feel fatigued. Prenatal vitamins are specially formulated to help supply the additional nutritional needs for pregnancy. Remember to take them every day.


Be sure to use a prenatal that contains vitamin B12, which helps fight fatigue.Also be sure that your vitamin contains at least 27 grams of elemental iron. Pregnancy-induced anemia can cause extreme fatigue for some women, and if your doctor tests your blood and determines that you have this condition, you may need to increase your iron up to 60 grams a day.If you have trouble remembering to take your prenatal vitamins, set them on your dining room table or wherever you eat dinner every day. You can also try setting a timed reminder on your phone to sound an alarm every day when you need to take your vitamin.;
, Pregnant or not, the body gets its energy from food.A healthy diet can make the difference between chronic fatigue and energy. You need three major macronutrients for energy: protein, carbohydrates, and fat.


Protein provides much of the energy your body needs to do the hard work of growing a human. When pregnant, you need about 70 grams of protein every day-- considerably more than the 45 grams recommended for non-pregnant women. Consider healthy food sources such as beans, dairy, tofu, chicken, and fish.Carbohydrates often get a bad reputation, but in fact they are one of the body's main sources of energy and vital to your health and ability to fight off fatigue. About half of your daily calories should be from carbohydrates, but remember to choose healthy sources like unrefined grains.Fats provide the most concentrated form of energy, and also help you to absorb some vital vitamins. While pregnant, you need to ensure that about a quarter of your daily calories come from fat.Avoid low-fat and reduced-calorie food options, which don't provide as many energy-filled calories to fuel the body. Eat healthy, whole foods with naturally occurring fats like avocado, nut butters, vegetable or coconut oil. Avoid margarine and saturated fats., Instead of eating three large meals a day, increase the number of meals you eat, but reduce the amount of food at each meal. This gives the body more boosts of energy throughout the day to fight pregnancy-induced fatigue.


Despite that popular cliché ""eating for two,"" you shouldn't double your food intake while pregnant; instead, increase your caloric intake by about 300 calories per day. Make sure your added calories contain protein and carbohydrates for energy, but ensure that they are nutritious calories and not junk food. For example, three hundred nutritious, fatigue fighting calories can be found in an apple, sliced and spread with your favorite nut butter; or in a cup of Greek yogurt with a handful of almonds and berries.

, It can be hard enough to drink enough water for non-pregnant women; during pregnancy, you need to increase your intake of water substantially to combat dehydration and fatigue. In fact, one of the first symptoms of dehydration is fatigue!Aim for a dozen eight-ounce glasses of water a day, if you live in a temperate area. In hot, humid areas, you will need even more.If you have trouble stomaching all that water, add some variety to make things more interesting. Try adding fresh fruit to your water or drinking non-caffeinated tea. You can also eat juicy fruits and vegetables like watermelon, lettuce, or tomatoes.
Try to not drink water two to three hours before bedtime to reduce the urge to get up to urinate.

, Even if you drank lots of caffeinated beverages prior to pregnancy, it's important that you only consume a moderate amount of caffeine while pregnant. Studies have shown that it is safe to drink a small amount of coffee, black tea, or hot cocoa while pregnant, but keep it to a minimum.


Limit your caffeine to no more than 200 mg per day.That's the amount found in one twelve ounce cup of black coffee or four cups of black tea.
Never drink energy drinks, energy shots, or pure caffeine while pregnant. These have questionable health risks even when you're not pregnant, and are linked with miscarriage and birth defects."

This symptom also requires an immediate call to your doctor, to ensure labor does not progress if you are not full term yet.
A small amount of spotting from the cervix can also occur during amniocentesis recovery, but if the bleeding becomes heavy or is accompanied by a loss of clear fluid, emergency medical attention is required. Bleeding or discharge from the site of the amniocentesis is also cause for concern.
A patient recovering from amniocentesis should also be on the lookout for signs of a developing infection, such as a fever, chills or discharge from the vagina or amniocentesis site. Antibiotics may be needed to keep the infection in check so it does not harm the mother or unborn baby.

, If the baby is moving more or less than what was typical before the amniocentesis, check with your doctor to see if an evaluation of the baby (such as an ultrasound) is warranted.

, Because this test is often used to screen for potentially serious issues with the baby, the wait for results can be a stressful time.


Spend time with your spouse, family members or close friends who can offer you the support you need during this difficult time of waiting. Remember that the large majority of amniocentesis results come back completely normal, so the odds of serious problem are usually slim. Professional counseling may also be helpful, particularly if the results of the amniocentesis are not positive and the baby has a genetic or developmental problem.

Note the possible symptoms.,
See a doctor immediately.,
While HELLP pregnancy is rare, it is a serious disease in expectant women, affecting both the mother and the baby in various ways.

,
Understand the possible causes.,
Get treatment.",How to Recognize and Treat HELLP Syndrome in Pregnancy," Particular reason for HELLP pregnancy has not been known yet. No doctor or physician can tell that why this happens.

Severe pain in the abdominal area.
Severe and constant headache.;
, If you feel any of these symptoms in the final trimester, visit your doctor at once. The doctor may order additional blood tests to look for other signs of HELLP such as:


Increased number of protein molecules in the urine.
Increased blood pressure.
Disturbed level of enzymes of liver.
Decreased number of platelets.

,, Although no particular cause is known as yet, there are certain risk factors for this disease in pregnant women. These reasons are mentioned below:


Pregnant women more than 40 years old
Previous history of HELLP
Obesity
Twin or multiple pregnancy
First pregnancy
Hypertension

The principal treatment can be the sudden, early delivery of your baby to save him from the disease. This disease is harmful for your growing baby as it can stop the growth of your baby. As well as bringing about increased blood pressure in the mother, it reduces the flow of blood and oxygen to the baby and that ultimately leads to the reduced growth of the baby.
If the mother is facing bleeding due to reduced number of platelets, then a blood transfusion is the way to overcome the syndrome.
If the situation is not too severe, then steroids can be helpful in decreasing the seriousness of this disease.

Consider confiding in someone you can trust.,
Treat yourself to funny movies, books, and other forms of entertainment while you are resting.,
Don’t distract yourself from your feelings so completely that you fail to fully process, and thereby heal from, the experience.,
Cry as much as you need to.,
Do art.,
Talk.,
Ask for what you need from your partner or support person.",How to Recover from an Abortion2," Who do you know who is compassionate and would listen without judgment? Think about which of your friends, family members, mentors, and other allies you feel safest around. They should be good listeners, able to reflect compassion, and pro-choice. Perhaps you know others who have had abortions, or who have supported loved ones who have. If you don't feel you can trust anyone in your close circle with this matter, there are other resources out there, such as Exhale, an after-abortion counseling talk line.

, Give yourself time just to laugh and feel at ease.

, Take time just to be with yourself, a significant other, friend, or supportive mentor.

, It is absolutely okay to feel grief. Don’t judge your feelings. Let them move through you.

, Try journaling, drawing, painting, collaging, songwriting, or any other form of creative expression that calls to you.

, You can even try talking into a recorder (a tape recorder, computer program... there are even iPhone apps for this nowadays) if you just need to get something off your chest.

,


If you are in a relationship, remember that, as difficult as your experience is, your partner is probably struggling too. He may feel guilty, conflicted, stressed. He probably feels remorseful to see you suffering, and feels some sense of guilt for causing your pain. He may not be good at conveying his true feelings, and may not know how to help. Ask for what you need. Tell him how he can support you. Men like to be of service in tangible ways. He will likely feel much better - and thereby be more confident, and emotionally present - if there is something clear-cut he can do, such as to buy you a heating pad and rub your back.
If you just need him to listen to your feelings, then tell him that, too. (Sometimes when women share their feelings with male partners, the men assume they need to ‘fix’ something. Instead of listening to what you’re saying, they’re listening for how they can help - and often become frustrated, and leave you feeling unheard. Lighten the load for both of you: tell him you just need him to listen, that’s all.)
If your partner is unwilling to support you, or makes you feel worse, remember that your needs come first right now. If he is being inconsiderate, insulting or guilt-tripping you, or simply unable to provide any support at all, it is best for you to take some space from him right now, and seek the support of friends who can truly be there for you. If he was not supportive of your decision or your healing, you have good reason to re-evaluate the relationship, but wait until the dust has settled and you’ve healed this issue before taking on a potentially stressful relationship reassessment. Also, learn to Recognize-a-Potentially-Abusive-Relationship.

Meditate or pray.

,
Seek guidance.,
Get the lessons.,
Communicate your feelings.",How to Recover from an Abortion3,", If you feel so moved, seek the guidance of mentors, counselors, or spiritual advisers you feel comfortable with within your own spiritual or religious tradition, or who are nonsectarian. Be careful to choose individuals who can treat you with compassion, not judgment. And remember that ultimately, you are your own best guide.

, Be open to receiving the message of the experience as a whole. What might this experience of being temporarily, unexpectedly pregnant have come here to show you? What life lessons did it bring up for you, or in your relationship? What parts of yourself do you know better now? What do you feel inspired to do with your life now that you did not before?


If you feel so moved, try communicating with the spirit of the aborted fetus - through prayer, spoken word, a written letter, art, music, or whatever medium comes naturally to you. You can tell it whatever you want to. Perhaps you are remorseful and want to apologize to it, to express your sorrow. Perhaps you want to wish that spirit a better home, a more ready parent. Perhaps you wish to tell it that you would love to be its parent when you are ready, but that’s just not now. Communicate whatever you need.

, You may wish to think about your reasons for not choosing parenthood at this time. What goals do you have that you wouldn’t be able to complete if you were to have to raise a child right now? Consider which of these goals are most meaningful to you. Can you nurture your efforts, or “brainchildren”, as you would your own child? This experience may bring to the fore “big picture” questions in your life, such as, “who am I? Where am I going? and, What is my purpose?” These are good questions to ask at any time. Welcome them, and be patient with the answers. Take time every day to meditate, pray, sing, journal, read self-help books, seek counsel, or do whatever it is that helps you discover your inner truth.

It’s a tricky skill to create vivid stories with simple language, but with practice you will be able to achieve this., Many classic bedtime stories end with the main character learning a valuable lesson or moral. Try to incorporate this into your tale as well, but write it in a way that is organic, not preachy.It helps if a character can figure out the moral of the story on their own without being told it by an adult.For example, the main character can learn the value of hard work by succeeding in a task in your story. This will be much better received by the child than including an adult stating, “Work hard and you will do well on your test,” for instance.

, Between 8 and 10 minutes is a good length for a bedtime story. It gives the children enough time to settle down and relax, but it doesn’t keep them up too long.Very young children may benefit from even shorter stories, those that take around five minutes to read.

Take a nap ahead of time.,
Sleep late the night before, and the night before that.,
Avoid heavy meals.",How to Stay Up Late1," A short nap will help you feel energized for a long night. Try to avoid napping for more than two hours or you might end up feeling lethargic and tired. Quick naps will be more likely to refresh you.


Power naps can be a good way to recharge yourself in the mid-afternoon before you stay up late. Find a comfortable place and lay down. You can even lay your head down on your arms if there is no place to go horizontal. Set an alarm for thirty minutes later, put on some soothing sounds from the internet, and you'll wake up feeling refreshed.;
, If you are already overtired from not sleeping the past few days it will be much harder to stay awake. Try sleeping in the two days before you know you’re going to need to stay up very late.


This also depends on what you'll be doing the night that you stay up late. If you have to stay up late to do physical labor like construction, a lack of sleep may not impact you that much. Generally, as long as you haven't been sleep deprived for a long period of time, your heart and lungs and muscles can operate equally well. It's your brain and cognitive functions that struggle on a lack of sleep. If you know you're going to need to think clearly and quickly the night that you stay up late then sleep will be very important.

, Heavy meals will cause you to feel sleepy as your body tries to digest what you have just eaten. Avoid heavy carbs and stick to lean meat and fruit if you are planning on staying up very late. Protein will help you stay up later because it stimulates the neurotransmitter orexin. Orexin boosts wakefulness, so eating a steak could be a good way to stay awake. Don't gorge yourself to the extent that you have an incredibly full stomach. Digestion will make you sleepy. Just snack on bites of steak or another lean meat."

Read as many bedtime stories as possible.,
Identify your audience.,
Start or join a writing group.",How to Write a Bedtime Story2," Attempt to read all kinds of bedtime stories, from classics to newly published ones. You will get a feel for the types of themes they convey, as well as how the language and rhythm is constructed.Read other children’s books as well. The more you familiarize yourself with children’s literature, the more prepared you’ll be when you write your own story.
Also, make it a habit to visit bookstores and libraries to see the variety of children’s books available.

, Think about whether you will be writing for younger readers, aged 2 to 6, or those a bit older, aged 7 to 11. Your audience will determine the vocabulary and sentence structure you use in your story. It will also help you identify the types of characters to incorporate.Younger children will be more open to characters like talking animals and dragons, while older readers could possibly prefer pirates, spies, etc.
By getting into the mind of a child, you will be able to create appealing characters and situations that the child can emotionally identify with. , Surrounding yourself with other writers is a great way to strengthen your own writing and stories. Members of a writing group can critique your work, offer suggestions and encouragement, and help keep you accountable to a writing schedule.


Websites are a good way to research writers’ groups in your area. The Writers and Editors Website, for instance, offers a way to search for writing groups in your area.Writing groups can be specialized regarding subject matter, like children’s literature, or be regionally based.

Be imaginative.,
Pick a topic or theme relatable to kids.,
Create unique, identifiable main characters.,
Make a small storyboard or outline.",How to Write a Bedtime Story3," Children's stories are not bound by the constraints of realism. They are designed to transport young minds to new places and guide them into dreams. You can be as wild and magical as your 6-year-old self wants to be.

, Make sure that the story is one that the child will be interested in reading. Children have to be able to identify with the characters and envision themselves in the story.Try to keep it light-hearted and based around something interesting or unusual.

, Think about the motivations for those characters, both the protagonist and the supporting characters.Your main character, or protagonist, drives the story. They will need to overcome obstacles and possibly transform a character trait before the end of the story.Another important character will be the antagonist, or foil, to your protagonist. They don’t have to be a villain, they just need to offer a counterpoint to your main character.Too many characters may be distracting and confusing.

, Both an outline and a storyboard offer a way for you to organize your story before you put pen to paper. You can sketch out the beginning, middle, and end of your story, as well as make a list of the primary characters. Doing this vital step will help you create a story that includes all of the necessary elements.An example would be something like this: Happy beginning, where everything is fine. An evil person does something bad (like stealing or breaking something). The main character searches for and catches the villain. The main character is rewarded and lives happily ever after.
The typical plot formula has been around since the time of the Greeks and is as follows: introduction of characters, conflict, increased action, climax, and resolution. Remember these when crafting your outline."

Be realistic about how long it will take you to write a good story. It can take up to a year.Carry a notebook with you so you can jot down ideas if you are away from home.

, Pictures can be what make a story most attractive for children. Even young children can understand aspects of the story by viewing the artwork.


If you plan to submit your story to publishers, the publisher will hire the illustrator for you., Once you’ve completed a first draft of your story, step away from it for a while. Then, come back and re-read it, with a critical eye toward deciding whether it is interesting and whether the characters are engaging. Make changes as necessary.

, Most bedtime stories are read to children by adults. By reading your story aloud, you will begin to see whether the printed words translate well to being conveyed audibly.

, If you have joined a writer’s group, take your story to your next meeting. Your fellow authors will be able to offer valuable suggestions for improving the flow or themes of your story.


If you aren’t in a writing group, you can ask for feedback from friends and family.
Children would be a great group to offer feedback. If you have no children of your own, ask a local school or library if you can read your story there.

Some publishers may only want an outline or a few chapters, while others may want the full manuscript.
You can call the receptionists at the publishing houses to confirm whether specific editors are still on staff., A well-written query letter serves as a pitch for your book. You should include information on target audience, page length, and your experience, as well as a brief introduction explaining why your story is different., Once you have written your bedtime story, you may be convinced it needs to be shared with children everywhere. That may be the case, but remember that editors receive more manuscripts for children’s picture books than for any other type of book."

Establish a pre-sleep routine.,
Read a book.,
Turn off all the lights.,
Keep electronics out of the bedroom.,
Listen to ambient noise.,
Clear your mind.,
Don’t wait out insomnia.",How to Make Yourself Tired So That You'll Fall Asleep1," Sticking to a sleep schedule will program your body to know when it’s bedtime. Try to go to bed at the same time every night and to rise at the same time each morning. Give your body other clues that it is time to slow down, relax, and drift off to sleep.


One tip is to slowly make your surroundings more dark. Dim light signals to your body that it is time to sleep. Avoid exposure to natural light in the evenings, for example, and, inside your bedroom, slowly dim the lights or progressively shut off lights.Make your room a comfortable space. Cover your bed with comfortable blankets and pillows. Also, ensure that the room temperature is to your liking. Flip your pillows, adjust your covers, or turn on a fan.
Do anything else that puts you into a relaxed mood. Try a warm shower if that does the trick, or have a cup of a warm, sleep-inducing tea like chamomile or “sleepy-time” blend.;
, If reading makes you fall asleep easily in class, then it should do the same at home during the evening. This is also a very effective strategy if you tend to dwell on the problems of the day — reading a book will let you decouple from those stress-inducing thoughts.Pick something that is easy or bland. Don’t distress yourself by reading the newspaper, for instance, or a horror novel. Pick a textbook or a dense novel, instead.

, When you’ve finally put your head down, make sure that you are in complete darkness. This is one of the most important factors in quality sleep. Light not only inhibits the release of the sleep hormone melatonin, but also stimulates the hypothalamus to raise the body’s temperature and produce cortisol, both of which inform the body to be awake and alert.Even if you fall asleep with lights on, you won’t sleep as soundly. If you live in the city, share a room with a night-owl, or always have to leave a nightlight on, wear a sleep mask to give yourself a fighting chance. Try also to use a low-illumination night-light., Televisions, phones, and computers tempt and distract us. They tell our brains to be up and alert. In fact, you should avoid using them before bed, because the particular kind of light they emit (blue light) can reduce the quality of your sleep.One study shows that two hours of exposure to light from iPads and other tablets at night reduced melatonin levels by about 22 percent. Consider ways of changing your routine if you are a heavy user of smart phones or tablets.Resist the urge to browse the internet if you’re having a sleepless night. Screens on computers, phones, and tablets are backlit, which will arouse you from sleep and lower your melatonin levels, making it harder for you to fall asleep.Set a time to stop all device use each night, such as 30 minutes before bedtime.
You can also download software, apps or changes the setting on some of your devices so that they reduce the amount of blue light emitted as it approaches bedtime. Your screen will instead look yellow or reddish, which is easier on your eyes and will not inhibit melatonin production.

, Ambient or white noise is a steady, low noise that hovers in the background and sort of pushes out other noises. Your preferred white noise might be light music, ""rainforest sounds,"" or even the sound of a rotating fan. The point is just to have low-level sound.There are free white noise generators that you can find online. If you prefer your phone, you can also buy ambient noise apps. These generators will help you to fall asleep more readily by dampening external sounds., If you are the fretful type, try to force out the stressful thoughts about the day, work, or school. Do not reenact problems or arguments from the day in your head. If you find you are prone to doing that, try playing music as described above — and focus all your thoughts on that music and let it carry you into slumber.


Quieting a worried mind can be hard. Let your thoughts wander. For example, try the standard technique of “counting sheep.” You might also try to think in mental pictures instead of words.

, Studies have shown that staying in bed, without sleeping, can actually worsen insomnia because your brain begins to associate bed with being awake. If you can’t fall asleep within 20 minutes or so, get up and do something else for a while like read. Then, when you feel tired again, go back to bed.Try changing places as a last ditch effort. If you can’t get comfortable in your bed, move to your sofa and try to fall asleep there. Sometimes the change will work.

Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day.,
Ease into a schedule gradually.,
Use lighting to your advantage.,
Avoid the snooze button.,
Eat light before bed.",How to Have a Good Bedtime Routine1," Consistency is key to establishing a good bedtime routine. You need to establish a regular bedtime schedule and strive to wake up around the same time each day.


Your circadian rhythm thrives on routine. It adjusts to having a regular bedtime and wake time. After a week of going to bed at, say, 11:00 every night and waking up at 8AM, your body will begin to get tired when bed time arrives and you'll feel more rested in the mornings.Try to stay on this routine, even on weekends. Strive to not sleep more than a couple of hours past your usual wake up time on Saturdays and Sundays.;
, If you're not on a regular sleep schedule at the moment, you'll need to ease into a new schedule. Do not go from being up until 2AM at night to having a firm 10PM bedtime. This sets you up for failure and will only result in you tossing and turning each night.


Make small changes slowly. For example, if you usually fall asleep at 1:00 AM and want to go to bed at 11 PM make adjustments in small increments. For the first three nights, try going to bed at 12:45. Then, push that back to 12:20. Keep moving your bedtime back by 10 to 20 minute intervals until you hit the right time., Lighting can help you wake up or fall asleep. Try exposing yourself to daylight in the morning and dimming the lights towards bedtime.


Your body has an internal sleep/wake clock that responds to light. You're hardwired to become energized in response to bright, preferably natural light. As soon as you get up in the morning, draw the blinds and let in the sunlight. If you don't have access to natural sunlight, or get up before the sun rises, you can try turning on the lights in your house or incorporating a short walk around the block into your regular morning routine.Too much light at night signals to your brain that it needs to stay awake. Dim or turn off the lights in your apartment or house as you near your bedtime. You should also avoid electronics like tablets, computers, and smart phones. The light from these devices stimulate the brain and may make you more alert before bed.If you have trouble staying away from your phone or computer, you can download an app that can convert the type of light emitted by electronics to a more soothing form that is less likely to interrupt sleep., In order to get higher quality sleep, which can help you establish a bedtime routine, avoid reaching for the snooze button in the morning.


The sleep you have during the 7 or 9 minutes between the alarm sounds again is not high quality. If you hit the snooze button multiple times, you'll end up more tired than you would have been if you simply woke up, as it takes a lot of energy to snap in and out of deep sleep quickly.Instead of setting your alarm to go off early so you can snag a few extra minutes of snooze time, set your alarm for when you actually need to get up. You will feel more rested without the extra sleep, even though this may be difficult for the first few days., Often, hunger pangs can prevent you from falling asleep fast. However, a heavy meal before bed can keep you up, due to discomfort or could potentially boost your energy. Stick to light, healthy snacks half an hour before bedtime.


Choose veggies, and foods high in healthy carbohydrates, and protein. Avoid processed foods, sugars, or refined carbs close to bedtime.Try spreading cream cheese and avocado on slices of turkey and rolling them up into small, bread free wraps. A fruit smoothie with spinach, frozen cherries, and fruit juice without added sugar can be satisfying before bed. Simple crackers and cheese or whole grain cereals also make healthy nighttime snacks."

Do something you enjoy.,
Exercise.,
Eat a healthy snack.,
Maintain conversation with the people you are with.",How to Stay Up Late2," If you’re spending your time doing something that you’re invested in you’ll be much more likely to stay awake. Try working on a project or building something with your hands. You could also try beating that video game that you really enjoy. However, the most active you can be while keeping busy the better. You won’t feel like you are about to fall asleep if you are in the middle of a kickball game! If you’re playing video games for long periods of time, make sure to give your eyes a break.

, Going for a run or lifting weights will naturally pump oxygen through your body and into your brain, making you more aware and awake. It might seem counterintuitive to exercise when you’re tired but it will be a huge boost. Studies show that going for a ten-minute walk increased participants’ energy for almost two hours. Exercising before you stay up late will help, but doing it in the middle of the night will be even better.

, Avoid eating candy bars or other junk food with a lot of sugar. This will give you an immediate sugar rush, but you’ll end up feeling even more tired once the sugar leaves your system ten or fifteen minutes later. Eating a lot of sugar will risk a crash.

, You’ll be much less likely to get tired or fall asleep if you are engaged in an interesting conversation with someone. Your mind will be alert. Try to engage in intellectual conversation that challenges your brain to think through ideas. The more you are willing to challenge your brain the less likely you'll be to fall asleep. Doing puzzles or word games is another good option.

Consume caffeine in moderate amounts.,
Set an alarm clock.,
Avoid comfortable sleeping areas.,
Keep the lights on.,
Chew something inedible.,
Jolt yourself awake with cold water.,
Listen to upbeat music.",How to Stay Up Late3," Don't think that having a very strong cup of coffee or multiple energy drinks will keep you awake; it will just cause your body to use all of the energy you have left and crash very quickly. The trick is to have it in small doses (1 spoon of instant coffee rather than two, or a coke rather than an energy drink) and keep consuming more regularly throughout the night. You should also aim to drink a pint of water after all caffeine hits. Caffeine causes your brain to dehydrate, which can cause you to feel very tired very quickly. , When you really can't stay up any longer, set your alarm clock to go off every 5 minutes. If you don't have an alarm clock but are staying up with somebody else, have them pinch you every now and then to keep you from falling asleep.

, Sit down in a really hard chair so it is uncomfortable to fall asleep. Lounging in a bed or on a couch will make it much more likely that you will end up falling asleep.

, If it doesn’t feel like it is nighttime you’ll be much less likely to fall asleep. Don’t hang out in areas with dimmed lighting if you are trying to stay awake longer.

, Chewing sends signals to our brain that we should be alert. . Your body will also think that you are consuming a meal. This will cause it to release insulin, which should cause you to wake up.


Chewing on an ice cube is a good option. Just don’t hurt your teeth or freeze your mouth.

, You don't need to drench yourself, but hopping into the bathroom and splashing some cold water on your face will help you feel alert again. This isn't a permanent solution, but if you finding yourself nodding off it's a great way to avoid passing out.If you are driving a car late at night, try rolling the windows down. The cold air should have a similar effect as splashing your face with cold water and the sound of the air rushing through the car will help you too.

, Don't play soft, soothing sounds - these will call you to feel relaxed and more tired. The idea behind upbeat music is to promote wakefulness and productivity. Studies show that playing music that matches the tempo of the work you are doing can help you be more attentive.Music with high beats per minute are less likely to cause you to nod off.

Exercise regularly.,
Go to the bathroom.,
Get comfortable.,
Fix your sleeping position.",How to Make Yourself Tired So That You'll Fall Asleep2," Working out during the day is an incredibly effective way to rest better at night. In fact, exercise seems to correspond so directly with sleep quality that many of our hypotheses about the purpose of sleep stem from our observations of how exercising depletes our energy reserves.Just be sure not to exercise within three hours of bedtime, as it can have a temporary stimulating effect., Make a stop at the bathroom just before bed. This will help you to clear your digestive system so that you fall asleep more easily — and stay asleep throughout the night. In the same vein, don’t drink large amounts of fluids in the hours leading up to your bedtime and which might wake you up in the middle of the night. Limit what you drink after about 8 pm., Make your body as comfortable as you can for sleep. If some of your clothing feels tight, don't hesitate to loosen or remove it. This includes your hair bands, socks, bra, and anything else that might feel like it's not letting blood circulate freely. Make sure that you have enough pillows and blankets to be comfy, as well.

, If you pay attention to how you sleep, you might notice that you are sleeping in a bad position or putting strain on your posture. Keep your back straight and make sure your neck is not resting too high or too low. If your bed is too firm or too soft, consider replacing it, covering it with a foam pad, or even sleeping with a body pillow to make yourself more comfortable.

"
Eat foods that are soporific.,
Keep meals light.,
Avoid caffeine and alcohol.,
Drink a warm, relaxing beverage.,
Consult a doctor about sleeping pills.",How to Make Yourself Tired So That You'll Fall Asleep3," Soporific means “sleep-inducing.” For example, some foods are high in the sleep-inducing amino acid tryptophan, like cheese, chicken, soy products, eggs, tofu, fish, milk, turkey, nuts, peanuts and peanut butter, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds. Choose foods that have these qualities, especially for dinner. To activate tryptophan more efficiently, favor foods that are high in complex carbohydrates but medium to low in protein. Carbs make tryptophan more available in the brain, whereas protein has the opposite effect. .
Plan “meals for sleep” that load up on complex carbs and tryptophan. Try pasta with Parmesan cheese, hummus with whole wheat pita bread, peanut butter on toast, sesame seeds sprinkled on salad with tuna chunks with whole wheat crackers on the side, or a baked potato with cottage cheese.

, Limit the amount of food that you eat in the late afternoon and early evening, as it can affect the quality of your sleep. Lighter meals are more likely to give you a restful night, for example, whereas high-fat meals and large servings prolong the work your digestive system needs to do, and all the gas production and rumblings may keep you awake. Some people find that highly-seasoned foods (e.g., hot peppers and garlic) interfere with sleep, especially heartburn-sufferers.Avoid them if you have heartburn troubles.

, Coffee and other caffeinated beverages can disrupt your sleep patterns. Coffee stays inside your system for up to eight hours after you drink it, so that cup you had in the afternoon could be keeping you up later at night. Try to go without caffeine in the later afternoon and early evening.Alcohol will also wreak havoc on your sleep patterns. When you drink, you tend to sleep more lightly and fall into fewer periods of deep sleep or restorative Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. So even if you think a drink or two helps you fall asleep at night, you'll likely wake up tired and not feeling rested., Many people swear by drinking a cup of herbal tea or a glass of warm milk before bed, and there is research to support them. Dairy products like milk are rich in tryptophan and stimulate the brain to produce sleep chemicals like serotonin and melatonin.Chamomile tea has also long been touted as an insomnia buster. In fact, recent studies have demonstrated that chamomile can reduce symptoms of anxiety and is a mild sleep aid in animal test subjects.If you don't have chamomile tea, try other caffeine herbal teas like lemon, ginger, and raspberry ginger.

, Medication should be a last resort. The fact of the matter is that sleeping pills are not a magic bullet. Many are habit-forming, meaning that you can become addicted to them, and also do not give you deep and restorative sleep you need, with side effects like drowsiness, headache, memory problems, and behaviors like sleep-walking.Save sleeping pills as a last resort. If you become dependent on them, sleeping will become even more difficult than before.

Choose appropriate pillows, mattress, and sheets.,
Select cool colors.,
Do not carpet your bedroom.,
Have dim lights only in the bedroom.",How to Have a Good Bedtime Routine2," If your bed or bedding is uncomfortable, this may be contributing to your problems falling asleep.


Good quality mattresses last 9 to 10 years. If yours is older than that, you may need to get a new mattress. Make sure you choose a mattress that you feel comfortable in, and is neither too firm nor soft to support your back. If you've been waking up with back aches, you may need a new mattress.Make sure there are no irritants in your pillow. Many pillows contain fabrics or materials some people are allergic to. Read the materials list on the label before you purchase any pillow to make sure it does not contain anything that bothers your system.When it comes to sheets, going an all cotton route is best for your sleep schedule. These promote air flow and breathability so you don't end up too hot during the night. If it's summer, you could take the comforter off your bed and store it until the weather gets cold again., The type of color scheme you have in your bedroom can actually affect your sleep cycle. You should select cooler colors, like blues, browns, and grays, over warmer shades like reds and oranges. Warmer colors actually raise your heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. Cool colors can help calm you down and promote relaxation, which is helpful for sleep., Carpeting is actually a bad idea in your bedroom due to the synthetic nylons found in many commercials carpets. Unfortunately, when you're renting or on a budget you cannot always replace carpeting with hardwood floors in your bedroom. If this is the case, look for all natural fiber area rugs and spread them across your bedroom. This may help you sleep better at night., As already noted, lighting has a dramatic effect on the sleep/wake cycle. Try to limit use of bright lights in the bedroom.


Keep dim lamps in the bedroom and avoid turning on fluorescent overhead lights if they're present in your room.Do not keep a television set in your bedroom. Avoid using your laptop or other electronics in the bedroom. Try powering off your laptop and smart phone half an hour before bed."

Consume caffeine early in the day only.,
Manage your workout routine in accordance with sleep.,
Establish a routine to wind down before sleep.,
Manage your stress.",How to Have a Good Bedtime Routine3," While you don't have to cut out coffee completely to better you sleep schedule, be conscious about when you drink caffeine and in what amount.


Moderate caffeine intake, which is around three 8 ounce cups of coffee a day, is not associated with any health risks. However, consuming even a moderate amount of caffeine late in the day affects sleep. As caffeine is a stimulant, it can increase alertness and even induce anxiety. This can easily result in trouble sleeping.Try to keep your caffeine consumption early in the day. Avoid drinking caffeinated beverages after 2PM. While coffee is a major culprit when it comes to caffeine, be aware some teas and many sodas also contain caffeine., Regular physical activity is greatly beneficial to forming a good sleep schedule. However, exercising too late in the day can make sleeping difficult.


Try to get some vigorous physical aerobic activity in, like jogging, 3 or 4 times a week. This can help with your overall health and also help regulate your circadian rhythm. However, do not engage in vigorous exercise within 2 to 3 hours before bed.If physical activity helps you unwind after a long day, try moderate activity like a brief walk around the block close to bedtime., Having established ritual you associate with bedtime can help signal your body that it's time to wind down and rest. Choose a low-key, relaxing activity to engage in close to bedtime.


Many people enjoy non-caffeinated tea as it has a calming effect for some. Try chamomile tea or SleepyTime teas sold at supermarkets.Reading is a great activity to slow your mind down in preparation for sleep. However, be mindful of the material you read. Anything too heavy may distress you, making sleep more difficult.Watching television can interfere with sleep, due to the light it produces. However, if there's a particular show that helps you calm down it might be okay to watch a small amount of television. Watch lighthearted programming over the news or drama shows. You do not want to watch anything that will cause you distress and interfere with sleep., Often, stress and anxiety can result in difficulty sleeping. If this is the case, finding ways to manage your stress more effectively throughout the day can help you regulate your sleep schedule.


Practicing meditation is a good way to help shut your mind off close to bedtime. There are a variety of guided meditations available on wikiHow, online and in books; there are even ones offered through smart phone apps. You can buy books on meditation online or from a bookstore or borrow copies from your local library.Journaling can help with troublesome thoughts. Try writing down your worries in a notebook half an hour before bed, then putting it aside. Writing it out might help you get negative thoughts out of your system so they don't bother you while you're trying to sleep.If you have habitual struggles with depression and anxiety, it might be a good idea to find a therapist or counselor. You can find one by searching online, going through your insurance provider, or asking for a referral from your primary care physician. If you're a student, you may have access to free therapy through your college or university."

Cut off the caffeine flow.,
Stop eating and drinking.,
Halt heavy brain work.,
Go to bed at the same time each night.",How to Settle Down for Bed Time1," You should halt caffeine consumption, at least, six hours before going to bed. Many of you probably love your coffee or green tea, but don’t ignore this advice if you can help it. Then you will have plenty of time to calm down, and it is more likely that you will sleep better. , Do not eat or drink within two-to-three hours of sleeping. The body needs time to digest, especially if you like to eat fatty food like chicken wings or spicy food like curry. If you stop drinking beverages, then it’s less likely that you will need to urinate during the night. , The brain needs time to decompress before it goes into sleep mode. At least an hour before bed, stop doing anything that works your brain too hard. Don’t calculate bills. Thinking about money is stressful, so don’t get your mind all worked up if you want some rest.
If you’re a student, put those textbooks away if you can. Staying up all night cramming for a test is not a great strategy. You might not perform very well if you are exhausted.
Put projects away. It’s great to work on art or try to make a change in the community, but thinking about important stuff right before bed won’t help you relax.

, Establishing a regular sleep pattern is one of the best ways to improve sleep. Turning in at midnight for a few nights, falling to sleep at ten the next, then following those two nights by staying up until two am is not beneficial. Choose a time to take slumber and stick with it! "

If you still feel stressed from work, go jog around the block! Get some fresh air and release remaining tension so you can rest better.

You might even find that non-musical sounds assist you in unwinding.


Any type of music. If classical musical makes you feel good, play that. If you need something a little more modern, try some recent jazz. Some people enjoy ambient music, which is often played at dance clubs in the wee hours. Usually slower, quieter music works best, but if heavy metal or hip hop helps chill you out, go for it!
Nature sounds. The sound of rain falling, ocean waves crashing, or turtles calling can help lull some people into sleep. That is because the sounds change in pitch and rate frequently. Fans or white noise machines. Many people need to hear background noise in order to fall asleep. You can run a fan on your preferred setting.

Block out the light.,
Keep it cool.,
Remove distractions.",How to Settle Down for Bed Time3," Be sure your bedroom is kept dark. If you work nights, it's very important to have thick curtains and blinds to keep out the sun so that you may rest comfortably during the day. Light stimulates melatonin production, and you need to maintain proper levels in order to sleep. , Set the thermostat a few degrees cooler than you have it set at during the day.

Choose comfortable and fun sleepwear.,
Use the right type of pillow.,
Set limitations for pets.",How to Settle Down for Bed Time4," What you wear impacts how you feel about yourself, so if you pick pajamas with pleasing colors, patterns, and styles that reflect your personality, you just might sleep better. Also, pay attention to the outside temperature before putting those pjs on. If you realize that you are too warm or too cold after getting under the covers, do yourself a favor and change into something else. , Your head, neck and spine need support when sleeping. Waking up with a sore back or a neck is no fun. Different pillows are made for different sleep styles, so choose based on your needs.


Back sleepers. Firm pillows should be used by those who generally sleep on their backs. You can use a pillow under the knees, too, in order to ease pressure on the lower back. Down or polyester-filled pillows will work; choose whatever suits your needs and price point.
Side sleepers. Firm pillows can also aid side sleepers, and using two—one that supports the neck and one under the knees—is beneficial. Long, firm body pillows are available, too. Investigate the different materials. Many people like memory foam because it conforms to your shape.
Stomach sleepers. If you sleep on your stomach, try placing a pillow underneath your hips. You might not even need one for your head.

, Pet parents love to have their dogs, cats or other animals close at all times. Those fluffy, loving creatures provide us with much joy. There are some safety concerns, though, so make careful decisions regarding allowing pets in your bed. Risk of illness. Although the risk is low, sometimes animals can transmit germs/bacteria to their humans, which can result in the human becoming ill. To prevent this from occurring, limit bed use for pets. If you can’t live (or sleep!) without your pet in the bed, make sure they see the veterinarian regularly for shots and checkups.
Puppies might act out. Some dogs/puppies can become more aggressive if they always sleep with humans. Additionally, puppies might take longer to learn how to potty.
Flea and tick risks. An animal that goes outside can easily pick up fleas and/or ticks if they aren’t given preventative sprays or medicine to deter the pests. Then, fleas and/or ticks could wind up in your bed. Fleas are just a nuisance, but deer tick bites can lead to Lyme’s disease.
You need space. If a few dogs or cats are taking up a big portion of the bed, you won’t have the space that you need to roll over or just spread out. Also, you might worry about suffocating a smaller animal, which definitely won’t help you sleep!

Set a light alarm for the morning.


If you follow your bedtime routine strictly, you can eventually stop using an alarm. Your body will wake when you feel rested.

Take your birth plan with you.",How to Write a Birth Plan," Begin your journal early in your pregnancy. Think about the big day long before it arrives.Write down everything that comes to mind about labor and delivery even if you do not yet know all the details involved.Periodically reviewing your journal entries will lead you to a list of priorities which will help you to know what to ask your doctor and how to proceed with your birth plan.Use your finalized list of priorities, along with input from your partner and your doctor, to create your final birth plan.Learn more about your doctor’s routine practices and the procedures for the care of both the new baby and the new mom at the place you have chosen for your birth.If you find something about the procedures that troubles you, talk with your doctor to be sure you understand and to consider possible options if needed.Include journal entries about the things that matter most to you. Do not overlook important family and religious matters.Think about your wishes for as many things as you can think of. Many areas may be routine or standardized procedures and can best be decided by talking with your doctor. Not every item needs to be included in your birth plan.;
, There are many areas that can be covered in creating a birth plan. Common issues to think about include the following:Who you want with you during your early stages of labor, including children, and during your active labor.Decide if you and your partner wish to work with a doula, which is a woman that supports the mother during and after the delivery, but is not a trained healthcare professional.Think about your desire to have the opportunity to be mobile, up and walking around, during your labor.Decide what is your position of choice for delivering the baby, giving consideration to standing, squatting, using foot stirrups, or on hands and knees.Consider any preferences you have regarding fetal monitoring.Consider your wishes for pain management, realizing that you may need to have a back-up plan depending on how the labor proceeds.Review the pros and cons of having an episiotomy and decide if this is an acceptable procedure or are there specific measures you prefer to avoid one.Ask your physician if they routinely perform episiotomies. Most do not, unless there is a compelling reason to do so.
If you are having the baby at a location other than a hospital, clearly detail your plans for medical transport should that become necessary.Describe your wishes for the environment in the room such as dimmed lighting, television on or off, music to be played, few interruptions, or frequent nurse presence.If music is an important factor, discuss if you would you like to provide your own.Describe methods you may want used to record the event including everything from a frequent journal entry by your partner to a video.Include your wishes regarding immediate skin-to-skin contact with your newborn following birth.Describe your plan for feeding your baby, either by breastfeeding or formula.If it is a boy, describe your wishes for circumcision.Keep in mind that no one will circumcise your baby without your written consent. Doing so is illegal and can be prosecuted as child abuse.
Discuss your preference for your partner to have extended visitation or to stay with you overnight., Most deliveries follow the predictable pattern of labor followed by natural delivery.Think about your wishes regarding potential problems during your delivery and include them in your birth plan. The most common complication is the unplanned need to have a cesarean section.A cesarean is considered a surgical procedure and is done in the sterile environment of an operating room. Therefore most of what happens would be beyond your control.Talk to your doctor so you will know what to expect if this becomes your method of delivering your healthy baby. Find out the areas that may be receptive to your input.You will be given a form of anesthesia that allows you to stay awake during a cesarean section.Examples of things you may be able to influence during a cesarean include the presence of your partner in the room with you during the procedure, and possibly having your partner cut the cord once the baby is delivered., The power of positive thinking and positive wording can be reassuring to you, your partner, and help your caregivers feel more at ease.Focus on listing your wishes by describing what you do want, avoid writing in a demanding tone, and avoid listing things you do not want.For example, instead of saying I do not want pain medications, consider wording that issue to say that you understand the pain management options and will ask for them if you need them.By wording things in a positive manner, you are creating a feeling of confidence within yourself that you are prepared to handle the labor and delivery of your child. This can help you to avoid the feeling that you are losing control of the situation., Either you or your partner may have certain needs that warrant attention.For example, you may need an interpreter in the room if your partner does not speak English or is deaf.You may also need to work with the facility regarding special equipment. If you or your partner are wheelchair-bound or need assistance with mobility, make that known in your birth plan., If this is not your first delivery, include any wishes you may have from any previous experience in your new plan.Think about your past labor and delivery situations. Focus on things you remember about your previous labor and delivery that made you feel comfortable and at ease.Also think about any aspects of that experience that made you feel more anxious or uncomfortable.Include any additional wishes based on your previous experience in your birth plan.Talk with your partner about his or her previous experiences and include the areas you both agree are important for this delivery., Your partner will be an important part of your labor and delivery so consider that person’s wishes as you create your plan.For your first experience delivering a baby, both you and your partner are facing several unknown variables. Take some time to address any concerns that your partner may have well before the labor starts.Talk about what happens during most labor and delivery situations and encourage your partner to speak freely about the areas that create some anxiety or fear., Once you better understand the anxieties and fears of your partner, take steps to address them.Take your partner with you to an appointment with your doctor. After having discussed your wishes with your partner and are more aware of any fears or concerns, allow your partner an opportunity to speak directly with your doctor to address questions, calm anxieties, and quiet any fears.Visit the hospital or facility together where you are planning your delivery. This is an excellent way to address anxieties of both you and your partner as you spend a few minutes in an actual birthing room, and the new-born nursery area, if the facility permits that type of visit.Your visit to the birthing center will help you and your partner to answer questions about the unknown, reassure one another about certain aspects of the delivery, and help both of you to add or remove some items on your birth plan., Do not force your partner into a situation.Use positive language in your final plan that may help provide comfort for your partner. This may include opportunities for your partner to participate in certain steps provided they are comfortable.For example, your partner may be fearful of cutting the umbilical cord. If it is your wish that your partner cut the cord, try wording your birth plan in such a manner that addresses both your wish and your partner’s fear. For example, state that your partner will cut the cord provided he or she is comfortable doing so when that moment arrives., Talk with your doctor about your final birth plan to be sure your wishes are reasonable.Sometimes physician practices, and hospital or facility policies, dictate some procedures. Be sure your doctor understands what your wishes are, but also understand that you may need to make some adjustments in your birth plan based on the final input from your doctor.Review any comments or concerns your doctor may have discussed, that you had not previously considered, with your partner. Your partner’s opinion is important as you work through any final matters.Nobody wants last minute surprises. Include your partner’s input in the final decisions.After taking the time to think about any issues your doctor brought to your attention, and discussing them with your partner, create your final plan.Avoid waiting until the last minute to finalize your plan. There are many factors involved with delivering a baby, and sometimes the baby’s schedule to arrive may be earlier than what you had planned for., Once you have compiled the final list of your most important details, make sure it is simple and easy to understand.Birth plans should be about one page in length and follow a format that is logical, briefly worded, yet makes your wishes clear.One format that can be used is to provide your personal and relevant medical information at the top, then insert bolded headers that address the categories you wish to cover. For example, provide a bolded section header titled Pain Management, and include a brief statement beneath that describes your wishes.Templates are available that you can use if you prefer, or your doctor’s office may have a template they can provide. Many available templates appear lengthy so it is up to you to choose only the most important issues.Remember to keep the information to about one page and only include headings that are relevant to your situation and the wishes of both you and your partner.You want to communicate your wishes, but your doctors and nurses may be limited by time and other delivery matters that could prevent them from fully comprehending a lengthy and detailed list., Your birth plan is an important tool for those closest to you to understand.Some of the people that you share your plan with may be responsible for part of your care and the care of your newborn baby.Discuss your wishes with your family and close friends so everyone understands and agrees to honor your wishes before the big day arrives., In creating your birth plan, do not overlook important details.Include your name, your partner’s name, your doctor’s name, and your due date.Include any information about your medical health that may be relevant such as if you have gestational diabetes, a recent strep infection, if you are wearing contacts, and your blood type. Women that are Rh negative need certain injections following birth.Include any relevant medical information about your partner as well. Your doctor can advise you of any health-related information that is important to note about your partner., Don’t forget to pack several copies of your birth plan in your bag that will go with you to the hospital.In most cases, you will have at least one doctor with you, several nurses, possibly a nursing aid, and possibly an anesthesiologist depending on your pain management wishes or if a cesarean section should become necessary.Plus, your new baby’s pediatrician will be present during your delivery to take care of the health needs of the baby.The new pediatrician’s role is well outlined, but you may have some wishes that need to be communicated to that physician as well.Bring enough copies of your plan so that everyone involved in your labor and delivery are aware of your wishes.Beyond your family and friends, consider providing copies of your birth plan to your doctor, any partners in the doctor’s practice that may be part of your delivery, your delivery nurse(s), nurses in the new baby nursery, and any other medical professionals that may have a role in the delivery process and post-delivery care of yourself, and your new baby.

Ease your child into the idea of going to bed.,
Give your child a snack.,
Talk to your child.,
Pay more attention to your child.,
Provide your child with greater freedom.,
Be a good role model.,
Take your child to a psychologist.",How to Reduce Bedtime Tantrums1," Instead of abruptly saying, “Time for bed,” let your child know about 15 minutes before bedtime that they need to go to bed soon. You might say, for instance, “Honey, 15 minutes until bedtime.” This will give your child time to adjust to the idea of going to bed and reduce the likelihood that your child will outright refuse., If your child is overtired, they might be placated by administering a snack. Don’t provide a large meal to your child before bed or they might gain an energy boost that will keep them up all night. But a small snack like a few apple slices and a small cup of milk or juice can make your child enjoy bedtime and reduce their likelihood of bedtime tantrums.Don’t let others convince you that giving your child a snack is “bribing” them to reduce their bedtime tantrum frequency. In reality, it’s merely treating your child as a child, and finding a win-win scenario for the both of you., Your child might throw bedtime tantrums because they don’t have the emotional self-knowledge to communicate what they’re feeling. Help your child stay in touch with their emotions and improve their communication skills by talking with them about bedtime tantrums in terms they understand.For instance, you might say to your child, “I’ve noticed you often throw tantrums at bedtime. Do you like bedtime?” If they answer that they do not, ask a follow-up question like, “Why not?”
Listen carefully to their answers and try to find a solution based on your conversation.
For instance, if your child doesn’t like bedtime because they have to sleep in the dark, provide your child with a nightlight.

, Bedtime tantrums are often caused by feelings that the parent does not pay enough attention to them. In order to reduce your child’s bedtime tantrums, you should move to make your child feel more appreciated and loved. For instance, you could:tell your child you love them
read your child a book at bedtimeplay a game with your child before bedtime
praise positive behavior like sitting down at dinner time and cleaning up when asked

, Some bedtime tantrums are inspired by years of going to bed at the same time. If your child is growing up and wants to stay up a bit later to read a book or study for a test the next day, allow them to do so.One thing you should not allow before bedtime is screen time. Viewing a phone, tablet, computer screen, or TV screen can disrupt the signals that tell you it’s time to sleep, meaning that you – or your child, in this case – will spend longer trying to get to sleep after putting your head to the pillow. Disallow these devices within the hour before your child’s bedtime.You should still set limits for your child, even if you extend your bedtime. For instance, you might say, “I’ll let you stay up 30 minutes longer, but no more than that, okay?”

, If your child sees that you respond to stress and disappointment in a positive, healthy way, they are less likely to throw tantrums at bedtime (or any other time). Don’t yell at your child or others, don’t throw things, and speak kindly to and about others.If you have trouble controlling your temper, consider talking to a trained therapist. A therapist can help you determine why you have a poor temper and help you find ways to change your behavior.

, If, despite your best efforts at reducing tantrums, you haven’t been able to do so, you should consider taking your child to a therapist. Getting your child to talk to a child psychologist is especially important if your child’s bedtime tantrums involve violence, including incidents like your child holding their breath until they faint. The child psychologist will help you identify what the issue is and provide solutions for the bedtime tantrums."

Acknowledge your child’s reason for the tantrum.,
Ignore the tantrum.,
Give your child a time-out.",How to Reduce Bedtime Tantrums2," When your child throws a bedtime tantrum, you might help the situation by recognizing what the tantrum is about. Generally, a bedtime tantrum occurs because the child doesn’t want to go to bed. When the tantrum begins, you could be able to end it quickly by saying, “Yes, I know that you want to stay up later but it’s important to get enough sleep so you can have a great day tomorrow.”, Part of why kids throw bedtime tantrums is because they want you to pay attention to them. Once your child’s fussing has evolved into a full-on tantrum, you should shut it down by ignoring it. By denying the child attention, you remove their motivation to continue their bedtime tantrum, or throw future bedtime tantrums. Unless your child is demonstrating dangerous behavior, you should let them cry themselves out alone.Simply leave your child in its bedroom, switch the lights off and say “Goodnight.”
If your child is demonstrating dangerous behavior – harming themselves or others, or damaging property – you should stay in the room with them and remind them that they cannot engage in violent behavior. For instance, you might say, “You cannot throw things in the house. That is not nice.”, If you find that ignoring the tantrum isn’t working, the next-best thing is to try giving your child a time-out. Time-outs are temporary periods of isolation for the child who is throwing a tantrum. Time-out communicates that you do not approve of your child’s bedtime tantrum and that they will suffer consequences for throwing future tantrums. You can give your child a time-out for between two and five minutes in a room of your choice.Ensure the room is not a location where the child can engage in fun activities like playing with games or toys, or watching television.
Time-out is ineffective for kids younger than three years old."

Don’t try talking your child out of it.,
Don’t give in to the bedtime tantrum.,
Don’t get angry yourself.,
Avoid administering drugs.",How to Reduce Bedtime Tantrums3," Once your child is in the throes of a bedtime tantrum, they are beyond the reach of reason. Trying to show your child the error of their way through rational dialogue will prove futile. Even if you agree to your child’s demands at bedtime, the child will likely remain enraged for some time. And by giving them prolonged energy and attention, you’re only increasing the likelihood that the child will throw another bedtime tantrum., If you allow your child to stay up past their bedtime because they throw a tantrum when it’s time for them to go to sleep, you’ll only be reinforcing the tantrum behavior. Next time your child wants to stay up past their bedtime, they’ll throw a tantrum again. Insist that your child goes to bed when you decide, and don’t fold under pressure from your child., Bedtime tantrums can be extremely frustrating for parents. However, it is important to avoid becoming angry at your child for throwing a tantrum. Your anger will only fuel your child’s own feelings of rage, fear, and frustration. Don’t curse at or strike your child. Don’t throw things or engage in other destructive behaviors.The best way to avoid getting riled due to your child’s bedtime tantrum is to leave them alone and walk away from the situation.You could also try self-calming techniques like breathing in and out slowly. Close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose for three seconds, then out through your mouth for five seconds.

, Some parents turn to quick-fix drugs like Risperdal, Ritalin, and Adderall in order to reduce their children’s tantrums. However, these drugs come with significant side effects, including a high potential for addiction. Instead find ways to modify your child’s behavior.There are occasions where drugs are necessary, but you should only ever administer them after close consideration and consultation with a medical professional. Always consider the side effects and risks involved in giving your child medications.

Use pillows to prop yourself up.,
Prepare to do a gentle ab workout two to three times a week.,
Do heel slides.,
Try alternating heel drops.,
Practice double heel drops.",How to Work out Your Abs While Pregnant1," Prepare for your ab workout by laying down an exercise mat and using a pillow or several pillows to prop yourself up so you are lying on your back and your upper body is supported by the pillows and your elbows.The idea is to keep your heart above your navel so you do not put undue stress on your organs, especially when you are carrying extra weight due to pregnancy.;
, Because you are going to be doing gentle, simple movements to strengthen your abs, plan to do your workout routine a few times a week. Set aside time in your day to focus on building your core so your body can better support your baby.However, do not overwork the abs as this could result in injury or fatigue of the very important core muscles during pregnancy.

, Ease into your exercise routine with heel slides, which are simple movements that work your abs without putting too much stress on your body.Start by lying on your back, with your upper body propped up with pillows and your elbows. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the mat.
Contract your abdominal muscles by tucking your chin and squeezing your abdominal area. Slide your right heel forward so your leg lies straight on the mat. Then, move it back slowly so it is bent again. Repeat this with your left heel, breathing out as you straighten your leg and breathing in as you bend your leg.
Do 15-20 reps on each leg, inhaling and exhaling for each movement. You should also do a kegel with every movement, squeezing your pelvic area as you slide each heel., Once you feel comfortable with heel slides, move on to alternating heel drops. Set yourself up by lying on your back, propped up by pillows and your elbows. Bend your legs and place your feet flat on the exercise mat.Contract your abdominal muscles and do a kegel as you lift both bent legs off the mat.
Slowly lower your right leg so your heel touches the mat. Then, lift it back up off the mat. Make sure you squeeze your abdominal muscles as you lower and lift your heel. Breath out as you lower your leg and breath in as you lift your leg back up.
Repeat this movement with your left leg, squeezing your abdominal muscles as you lower your heel to the mat and then lift your heel back up.
Try to do 15-20 reps on each leg, breathing in and out for each movement. Take your time with this exercise, as it is more challenging than the heel slides exercise.

, Begin on your back, propped up by your elbows and pillows, with bent legs and your feet flat on the mat. Squeezing your abdominal muscles and do a kegel.Slowly lift both legs off the mat so they form a 90 degree angle. Breathe out as you lower both legs back down to the mat so your heels touch the mat.
Inhale as you lift both legs off the mat again and exhale as both heels touch the mat. Continue to do these movements, being sure to activate your abdominal muscles and breathing slowly and evenly.
Do 10-12 reps of these exercises, as these are more challenging than the previous exercises.

Bring your lunch from home.,
Ease nausea with bland foods.,
Increase the iron in your diet.,
Eat more foods with protein.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Work During Pregnancy1," Bringing your lunch, and breakfast, if you eat it at work, from home can help reduce the risk that you’re going to get nauseous. It also helps make sure you are getting proper nutrients for your body.Avoid greasy fast food and heavy meals from restaurants. Instead, pack lunches that are full of complex carbohydrates and protein.
For example, for breakfast you can eat smoothies with Greek yogurt, spinach, chia seeds, and fruit. Oatmeal, eggs, sweet potatoes, nut butters, turkey sausage, and veggies also make good ingredients for breakfast.
Easy lunches include whole wheat pitas stuffed with spinach, veggies, and lean meat or a turkey burger. Salads topped with nuts and seeds and lean meats can also be portable and easy. You can also try mixing quinoa or brown rice with lean meats, veggies, avocado, and herbs and spices.;
, You may be feeling great and productive, but then suddenly you’re hit with a wave of nausea. Pregnancy nausea can ruin a good day and keep you from working. To help with this, eat bland snacks like crackers often to help ward off morning sickness.Ginger ale and ginger tea may help with nausea. Ginger is a natural stomach calming ingredient.
Avoid things that trigger your nausea. You don’t want to add a reason to be nauseated.

, To help keep from feeling too tired, add more iron to your diet each day. Iron-deficiency anemia can lead to fatigue, which can make working even more difficult. You should get around 27 mg of iron each day.To get more iron, add whole grain foods into your diet, along with lean beef and porch, dried fruit without added sugar, beans, and green leafy vegetables.Always talk to your doctor before taking supplements while pregnant.

, Protein is important for keeping your energy up. It is also important for your baby. To figure out how much protein you need, divide your pre-pregnancy weight by two. That’s how many grams you need each day.Protein-rich foods include seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, unsalted nuts, seeds, eggs, beans, and soy products.

, Staying hydrated is extremely important when you are pregnant. Dehydration can lead to lethargy and mental fatigue, so staying hydrated can help you not only give your baby what they need, but also keep you focused and energized at work. You should drink at least 10 eight-ounce glasses of water each day while pregnant.Keep water bottles at your desk so you can drink from it throughout the day.

Steep the tea.",How to Use Raspberry Leaf Tea During Pregnancy," While many midwives believe drinking red raspberry leaf tea during pregnancy is safe, others do not think it's safe, so it's always best to consult your doctor before you start drinking the tea. For one, any kind of herbal tea or supplement can have interactions with other medications and conditions, so it's important your doctor knows about it. She can tell whether it's safe to use.;
, Some doctors feel like the tea is not safe to drink in the first trimester of your pregnancy. They believe it can cause contractions leading to miscarriage.Others feel the tea is safe throughout pregnancy.To be on the safe side, limit yourself to 1 cup of tea a day during your first trimester, or don't drink it at all., Once you reach your second trimester, it's considered safer to drink more of this tea. You can drink as much as 4 or 5 cups a day of this tea. Once again, though, ask your doctor before increasing your intake of this supplement., The main reason it is taken is to shorten labor, and some studies have shown it is effective and safe for this purpose. It may also reduce your risk of tearing when you give birth, and you'll be less likely to need forceps or a cesarean section.People also believe that it will decrease your pregnancy pain, increase your milk supply, and decrease your bleeding after birth. In addition, it does supply a number of vitamins, such as vitamins C and E, calcium, iron, magnesium, and manganese, as well as B vitamins., Like any supplement, you may have side effects from this tea. For instance, you may experience nausea or even mild diarrhea. If the side effects are too severe for you, stop taking this supplement., If you have a raspberry plant in your yard, you can simply pick the leaves from the plant. You may also be able to find them at your local farmer's market. You can pick the leaves any time of year., Make sure to rinse the leaves thoroughly in fresh water. Leaves can have residue from pesticides and other chemicals in the air. Drain the water off., Pat the leaves dry with a towel. Spread out the leaves on a clean, flat surface, and allow them to dry. Once they are dry, you can store them in an airtight container.Instead of finding and washing raspberry leaves yourself, you can simply by red raspberry leaf tea at a health food store.

, Boil a cup of water to brew your tea. You can prepare it as you would any loose-leaf tea., You need about a tablespoon or a little less per cup of water. You can use any type of tea strainer you wish to brew it, including the mesh ball strainers., Let the tea steep for about 5 minutes. Once the tea is done steeping, drink as you would any tea. You can add sweetener if you prefer.Some suggest letting it steep for 10 minutes is better than 5 minutes.Try chilling the tea and adding a squeeze of orange juice."

Advocate for later school start times.",How to Help Your Teen Get More Sleep," During the school year, all teens seem to have the same sleep schedule: they stay up too late and get up early on weekdays, then sleep until noon on weekends. Inconsistent sleep schedules, however, confuse the body’s sleep rhythms and make it harder to get enough quality shut-eye.Don’t let teens stay up (or stay out) much later than normal on weekends, and try to keep the same evening patterns in your household regardless of what day it is. Schedule weekend morning activities for around the same time that school starts.
Set an alarm, throw open the curtains, or bang a drum if necessary to help your teen wake up at the normal time on weekends. Eventually, with your encouragement, he or she will begin to go to bed at a more reasonable time.
Do your part to maintain sleep schedule consistency for your teen during holiday breaks and summertime as well.;
, If your home is bright, noisy, and hectic right up until bedtime, you shouldn’t be too surprised if your teen doesn’t want to go to bed or has trouble falling asleep. Everyone benefits from having a “wind-down” period of one to several hours before bedtime.As the evening progresses, turn down or turn off lights, lower the volume on (or even better, turn off) TVs, stereos, and other devices, and encourage calming activities like reading or taking a warm bath or shower.
It might seem like a bad joke taken from a song from the 1980s, but getting your teen to “wear his sunglasses at night” might help bring on a desire to go to bed. Our bodies respond to darkening conditions by producing more melatonin and encouraging sleep, so ask your teen to try donning shades in the evening., Many teens view their rooms as personal sanctuaries and want to spend a significant amount of time in there. Depending on the room, the bed may become a work desk, lounging area, snack spot, and so on. However, it benefits your teen’s sleep rhythms if his or her brain associates being in bed exclusively with sleeping.If you don’t have room to give your teen a work desk, provide some room at the dining room table for homework. Encourage snacking in the kitchen and lounging in the living room. Consider removing distractions like TVs and game consoles from the bedroom.
Make the bedroom itself more sleep-friendly by hanging blackout curtains and ensuring a comfortable temperature with circulating air.

, Regardless of age, each person has unique requirements when it comes to sleeping time per night. While it is typically stated that teens need about nine hours of sleep nightly, some may get by just fine with a bit less, while others may need more to feel rested and refreshed. Finding a teen’s ideal “sleep number” is an important step toward ensuring that adequate nightly rest is achieved.The best way to determine any person’s ideal sleep time is to average out how long he or she sleeps when there is no need to wake up at a specific time. For instance, you can keep track of how long your teen sleeps when he or she doesn’t need to get up on a Saturday morning. If the number is 9.5 hours, use that as the goal for your child to achieve each night., It may seem like an impossible task to get any teen to put away the smartphone, shut down the computer, and turn off the TV. However, the light emitted from electronics screens can trick our bodies into delaying melatonin production, which in turn disrupts normal sleep patterns.You should try to enact a “no screens” policy for at least one hour before bedtime. It will probably work best if you make it a blanket policy for everyone in the household — for instance, no screen devices after 9 pm for anyone.
Replace looking at screens with reading a book, listening to calming music, taking a warm bath or shower, drinking herbal tea, meditation or prayer, or other relaxing activities that help spur melatonin production., Even if a soda or coffee does not seem to give you a jolt of energy, a small amount of caffeine can interfere with normal sleep patterns for hours. In most cases, it is usually best if teens avoid caffeine after early afternoon. This is actually a good policy for adults as well.Nighttime snacking can also make it harder to fall asleep, especially when sugary or fatty foods are consumed. Teens can be prone to snacking even when they're not hungry as they try to assert control over when and what they eat. Make sure a healthy, filling dinner is available and limit available snacking options to things such as carrot sticks, apple slices, or almonds., Even if it is healthier than a soda or junk-food snack, moderate to vigorous exercise in the evening can stimulate the body and make it more difficult to get into “sleep mode.” So, while exercising during the day is great for a teen’s health and can help wear him or her out (thereby making it easier to fall asleep), it should be avoided in the evening. Stick to a relaxing walk after dinner., Teens can be expert procrastinators, waiting until the last possible moment to do homework, study for a test, or write a term paper. Pulling an ""all-nighter"" or working into the wee hours obviously has a negative impact on sleep, but so too does doing schoolwork right up until bedtime.You want your body and your brain to wind down and ease into sleep mode, but cramming for the next day's test or trying to figure out algebra homework will instead keep your brain's engine running at full speed.
Productivity is the key: by making use of study hall, the wait for the bus, or ten minute blocks of ""down time"" here and there, a teen can get more done during the day and have enough time for sufficient sleep at night., When employed in moderation, napping can help restore focus and energy during the day. Indeed, in some parts of the world teens in school take scheduled daily “power naps.” However, naps that are too long or poorly timed can interfere with nighttime sleep.For teens, it is usually best if naps last no longer than 30 minutes. A need for longer naps may indicate inadequate nighttime sleep. Also, naps should be avoided beyond late afternoon, since evening naps can interfere with the nighttime routine. If your teen is tired in the evening, suggest that he or she call it a night a bit earlier.

, Every human body needs a certain minimum amount of rest to function properly, and will get it one way or another. If a teen is consistently not getting enough sleep, ongoing lethargy, lack of focus, and mood swings may occur as the body seeks needed rest. Even more worrisome, the body may simply demand sleep while the teen is driving, for instance.Of course, teens may not necessarily be persuaded by perfectly rational arguments about how not getting enough sleep hinders academic performance and increases the risk of car accidents. You might, however, find a little more success by appealing to a teen’s vanity, by pointing out that insufficient sleep increases the likelihoods of acne and obesity.Regardless of what methods work best with your teen, the important thing is that you talk to him or her about the importance of sleep. Don’t just impose a new bedtime or command changes in habits. Include your teen in the process of making changes for the better — and set a good example by making positive changes to your own sleep habits as well.

, Between homework, extracurricular activities, after-school jobs, family responsibilities, and busy social calendars, it should be no surprise that many teens feel like they don’t have enough time for sleep. In fact, over half of American teens are significantly sleep-deprived during the school year, averaging six or fewer hours of sleep per night.Talk to your teen about the dangers of overextending oneself. Help him or her to learn to say “no” sometimes — or do it for him or her when necessary.
Hectic schedules create stress, and excessive stress and inadequate sleep can create a vicious cycle. Stress makes it hard to sleep, a lack of sleep increases stress levels, and round and round it goes.
These wikiHow articles on teen stress and high school classroom stress provide helpful stress reduction tips.

, When stress and sleeplessness combine into a vicious cycle, depression can easily join the mix and further exacerbate sleep issues. Over half of American teens exhibit moderate or significant signs of a depressive mood, and many of them experience sleep disruptions as a result.Signs of depression can vary greatly, but keep an eye out for changes in mood (such as constant irritability or nervousness), social habits (like withdrawing from normal activities or friendships), or daily routines (like changes in eating habits or interests).
If you suspect possible depression, seek guidance from medical professionals and trained therapists. Talk to your teen and reassure him or her that you are there to help and want to work through things together.

, If your teen employs good sleep habits and still seems tired all the time, you may want to consider whether he or she is suffering from a sleep disorder. Common conditions like narcolepsy, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, and sleep apnea aren’t limited to adults. Fortunately, many common sleep disorders can be treated effectively.While not technically a sleep disorder, some teens may have disrupted sleep patterns due to the changes in melatonin production that are common during that period of development. They may benefit from simply taking low-dose (2-3 mg) melatonin supplement tables, which are available over the counter as a vitamin. It is best to consult a doctor first, though.Only a physician can properly diagnose a sleep disorder and recommend proper treatment options, which may include a range of medications, for instance. Whether prescription or over-the-counter, it is always safest and best to consult with your teen’s doctor before turning to sleep medications.

, It turns out that your teen can legitimately blame human biology if he or she wants to stay up late and sleep in late. Circadian rhythms change during the teen years (along with the many other changes going on), and tend to put teens on a later sleep schedule. The fact that many middle and high schools start early in the morning, then, works against nature and sufficient teen sleep.While changing entrenched schedules is a slow process, schools in the U.S. that have moved start times to 8:30 am or later have seen improvements in attendance and performance, and decreases in trips to the school nurse and guidance counselor.While you wait for your school district to enact a later start time, you can help your teen out by encouraging him or her to do as much preparation as possible the night before (bathing, laying out clothes, packing up supplies and lunch, etc.). That way, your teen can sleep in a bit longer in the morning. Don’t let your teen skip out on breakfast, though; prepare a healthy, on-the-go breakfast like a cereal bar, yogurt smoothie, or dried fruit and nuts.

Wearing loose work clothes can help keep you comfortable during your day. Wear low heels as your pregnancy progresses.If your job has a more relaxed dress code, you can wear leggings, soft sweaters, and flowy dresses.

, Your doctor may suggest that you avoid some tasks during your pregnancy. Some jobs cannot be performed by pregnant women. Your employer should have a legal obligation to assign you safe duties for the duration of your pregnancy.Most pregnant women should avoid heavy lifting, exposure to toxins, long work hours, excessive standing, excessive temperatures and noise, and heavy vibrations.

Manage your stress level.,
Schedule appointments before work or during lunch breaks.,
Tell your employer about your pregnancy.,
Review your rights as a pregnant employee.",How to Work During Pregnancy3," You may not be able to do as much as you could before without resting, and that is okay. Take rests throughout your work day when you need them. Go to a quiet, calm place, turn off the lights, and spend a few minutes with your feet up and eyes closed. This can help you destress and reenergize.You also may want to take short cat naps during your lunch break for a quick recharge.

, Work can be really stressful! However, it’s important to keep your stress level down when you are pregnant. Prioritize your duties and projects, make to-do lists, and delegate work when you need to. If you can’t do something, let them know so someone else can, and don’t worry about things that aren’t important right now.Talk about your frustrations or stressors with supportive coworkers, friends, or family members.

, You will need to see your doctor often during your pregnancy, and you cannot miss those appointments. To minimize the amount of work you miss, try to schedule appointments before work or during your work breaks. You can try after work, but you may be too tired.Keep a record of your visits in case someone thinks you are not doing your job and cutting out of work.

Purchase a home pregnancy test.,
Figure out when to take the test.,
Read the instructions carefully.,
Prepare yourself.",How to Use a Home Pregnancy Test1," There are many different brands of home pregnancy tests on the market, but it doesn't really matter which you choose. All home pregnancy tests work the same way - by detecting levels of the hormone hCG in your urine. When purchasing a pregnancy test, check the expiration date on the box and ensure the box is fully intact, with no wear and tear, as this could affect your result. Think about getting a brand that provides two test sticks in the box, especially if you're planning on testing early. This way you can wait a week before trying again, if you get a negative result first time round.Some experts advocate buying a pregnancy test from a large store that has a high turnover so that you are more likely to get a newer pregnancy test, rather than one that has been sitting on a shelf for months. Similarly, if you've had a pregnancy test lying around at home for several months, consider throwing it out and getting a new one, especially if you've been storing it somewhere warm or prone to dampness, as this can affect the results of the test.Some brands claim that they can accurately detect pregnancy on the day of your missed period or even earlier. While it's true that the the tests may be sensitive enough to pick up on higher hCG levels in your urine, it may be too early in your pregnancy for your body to actually produce higher levels of hCG. In this case, you run the risk of getting a negative result, even though you might indeed be pregnant.Many of the generic brand drugstore pregnancy tests are actually produced in the same factories as the big name brands, and use the same technology. So don't worry about the quality of the generic brands if you're trying to save some dollars.;
, Most experts advise that you should wait at least one day after your missed period before taking a home pregnancy test, though waiting a week is considered best. This can be tough when you are anxious to find out if you're pregnant, but waiting allows for a higher degree of accuracy when taking the test, as hCG levels rise rapidly in pregnant women.hCG develops in a woman's body only after a fertilized egg implants in her uterus. Implantation of the fertilized egg typically occurs on or around the 6th day after the sperm and egg have merged. This is why home pregnancy tests won't pick up on any hCG if you take the test too early, even if you are pregnant.It's best to do the home pregnancy test first thing in the morning, when your urine is most concentrated and hCG levels are highest., Although most home urine tests are pretty much the same, it is important to follow manufacturers' instructions. Specifics may vary for each pregnancy test, such as the method of collecting the urine, the length of time you need to urinate on the stick for and the symbols used to indicate whether you're pregnant or not.It's better to familiarize yourself with the symbols used in advance, as you don't want to be anxiously scrambling for the instructions when the test throws up its results.
There should be a toll-free number on the box or instructions which you can call if you have any questions or concerns about the method of taking the test or the product itself., Taking a home pregnancy can be a nerve-wracking experience, particularly when you're anxiously hoping for one result or the other. Take the test privately and give yourself as much time as you need, or have your partner or a close friend stand outside the bathroom door to talk you through it. Wash your hands with warm water and soap, then carefully remove the testing stick from its wrapper.

Wear the pad for short periods of time.,
Use the lower temperature settings.,
Use on a localized area.,
Use the heating pad while awake.,
See your doctor for abdominal pain.,
Use a heating pad to warm the bed.,
Wrap the heating pad in a towel or blanket.",How to Use a Heating Pad During Pregnancy1," The most important thing to remember while pregnant is that your core body temperature needs to be kept lower than 102.2 degrees. Because of this, you need to ensure that you do not use the heating pad for too long.


The normal cut off for a heating pad is 20 minutes. This should be the right amount of time to use it for one session. Make sure you give yourself a break between uses so your body has time to cool back down.;
, With excessive use or on high settings, heating pads can cause skin burns or increase your body temperature too much. Do not sleep while using a heating pad, and keep the pad on the lowest setting that gives you relief.


Generally, you should start with the lowest setting and moving up. However, you should never use the highest setting while pregnant., A heating pad should not be used to heat large areas of your body. This is not good for your skin or your body temperature. The more of your body that is exposed to the heating pad, the higher your body temperature will rise.


Instead, just use the pad on your back, knee, or shoulder, one area at a time., Make sure you only use the heating pad while you are awake. If you use it while sleeping, this can cause serious problems. You could accidentally leave it on and burn your skin or heat your body temperature too high.


Make sure you turn it off before you get into bed and don't use it in bed at all. You don't want to accidentally fall asleep with it on., If you are having pains in your abdomen, you should see your doctor immediately. There could be something more serious going on with your baby. For any pains near the abdomen, you should not use the heating pad. Although there is no direct evidence that the electromagnetic forces involved with powering heating pads can cause harm to your baby, it is possible that sustaining a temperature of over 103 °F (39 °C) may cause developmental problems.


Due to this possibility, do not ever place a heating pad directly on your abdomen.
Consider substituting a warm extra blanket for the heating pad, and be sure to remove it when your skin is quite warm to the touch., If you are nervous about applying heating pads to your body while pregnant because of skin care or the small volume of electric currents they emit, you may wish to consider ways to get some of the benefits of a heating pad without direct contact. Turn on an electric blanket or heating pad and place it under your blanket or in between your sheets to warm the bed. Remove it or turn it off once you are ready to go to bed or lay down.


This will enable you to enjoy the warmth the heating pad would provide without direct contact with the pad or the flow of electric currents.

, To subdue the effects of a heating pad, you can cover it with another piece of cloth, such as a towel or blanket. Wrapping a heating pad in another layer of clothing, such as a sweatshirt that no longer fits, makes it safer to use a heating pad on your muscles.


If your back hurts, try placing the heating pad beneath a lightweight pillow that you position behind your back while you recline on a couch or bed. Just remember that the pad is on and that it should be turned off before you fall asleep to prevent a fire or burn hazard.

Ready, set, go!,
Use the dropper to place a small amount of urine onto the test stick.,
Wait the stated amount of time.,
Check the results.",How to Use a Home Pregnancy Test2," Sit on the toilet and urinate either on the testing stick or into the small plastic cup provided, depending on the type of test. You should try to use a midstream sample, which means you should pee a little first before you collect any urine in the cup or insert the stick.If you need to urinate directly on the stick, make sure to follow the instructions carefully. With some tests, you need to urinate on the stick for a very specific time, for example exactly 5 seconds, no more no less. Use a stopwatch to help you time it, if necessary.
When urinating on the stick, make sure to place the absorbent end of the stick into the urine stream and turn it so that the display window faces upwards.

, This is only required for the plastic cup method. Drop the urine into the well indicated on the stick. Alternatively, some brands require that you dip the absorbent end of the test stick into the collected urine. Hold it there for 5 to 10 seconds, or for the amount of time indicated in the instructions.

, Place the testing stick on a clean, level surface with the result window facing up. Wait time is typically between 1 to 5 minutes, though some tests may take up to 10 minutes to give an accurate result. See the instructions to find out the required amount of time for your particular test.


Try not to stare at the stick for the duration of the waiting period; time will seem to go slower and you'll become even more anxious. Do something to distract yourself, like making a cup of tea or doing some stretches or exercises.
Some sticks will have a little timer symbol or line to show that the test is working. If your test stick is supposed to have this function and nothing appears on the screen, it is likely that your test is not working properly and you may need to use a different one.

, Once the amount of time stated in the instructions has passed, check the test stick for results. The symbols used to indicate whether you are pregnant or not vary from test to test, so read the instructions again if your are unsure. Most home pregnancy tests use something like a plus or minus sign, a coded color change, or the words ""pregnant"" or ""not pregnant"" on a digital display.Sometimes a line or symbol will appear only very faintly on the display screen. If this happens, you should still consider it a positive result as this indicates that the test has picked up on hCG in your urine. False-positives are very rare.If the results are positive: You should make an appointment with your doctor to have the pregnancy confirmed. This is usually done using a blood test.If the results are negative: Wait another week and if you still haven't started your period you should do the test again. False negatives are fairly common, especially if you miscalculated your ovulation date and took the test too soon. This is why many home pregnancy tests come with two test sticks. If the second test comes back negative, make an appointment with your doctor to find out if there is some other problem affecting your menstruation or causing symptoms of pregnancy."

Use a pre-made cold compress.,
Make your own cold compress.,
Try alternating cold and warm treatments.",How to Use a Heating Pad During Pregnancy2," Some women find that cool treatments improves the pain relief or inflammation if used first. If you experienced a specific and minor injury to your lower back, use a cold compresses to treat the pain for the first few days. Start with a pre-made ice pack or cold compress to cool the area. Leave the pack on for no more than 20 minutes before taking the compress off., Instead of a pre-made muscle ice pack, you can make your own cold compress by filling a Ziploc bag with ice, filling a water bottle with cold water, wetting a washcloth with cold water, or grabbing a bag of frozen vegetables and wrapping it in a towel. These can be applied to the skin instead of treatments with a heating pad.


The same time limit applies to these methods as well. Skin that are exposed to cold conditions for too long can develop frostbite., Switching back and forth between warm and cool treatments may relieve muscle or backaches more quickly, and alternating the two treatments may help prevent overheating your skin.


Cooling your skin and muscle before applying the heating pad may help the pad seem warmer on a lower setting.

Select a wedge-shaped pillow.,
Try a U-shaped pillow.,
Opt for a C-shaped pillow.,
Select a J-shaped pillow.,
Try a full-length pillow.",How to Use a Pregnancy Pillow1," Use wedge-shaped pillows to prop your head or back while sitting or reclining or to support your back or belly while lying on your side. You can even use wedge-shaped pillows to prop a hot water bottle up against your back.Wedge-shaped pillows are convenient because they are small and easily portable. However, because they are small, you will still need to use a regular pillow for your head.
Choose from a crescent-shaped or triangular-shaped wedge pillow.;
, Use a U-shaped pillow to support your whole body from your head and neck to your back, belly, knees, and ankles. This pillow is great for women who are used to sleeping on their back. It is also convenient for women who toss and turn during the night since you do not need to readjust the pillow.The U-shaped pillow is typically the most expensive pregnancy pillow. It is also the biggest pregnancy pillow. So if you have a small bed, look into getting a smaller pillow.

, C-shaped pillows are smaller than the U-shaped ones, so they are great if you have a mid-sized bed. These pillows provide support for your head, neck, back, and pelvic area. They are great for relieving pelvic tension and reducing water retention in your legs and ankles.The only drawback is that you will need to adjust the pillow throughout the night as you switch sides.
This pillow shape is also recommended for plus-size women since its asymmetrical shape allows you to shape the pillow in a variety of ways., The J-shaped pillow is similar to the U-shaped pillow, only smaller and without the extra side. So if you have a mid-sized bed, look into this pillow. This pillow is great for head, neck, and back support., Also known as I-shaped pillows, these pillows are straight and run along the length of your body. They look like regular pillows, only longer. You can wrap your arms and legs around them. However, they do not provide much back support.Flexible versions of the full-length pillow are available as well. The flexible ones bend and conform to your body, but they are generally more expensive.

Schedule a visit to your healthcare provider when you think you may be pregnant.,
Expect a time of considerable change during the first trimester.,
Anticipate an end to early discomforts in the second trimester.,
Start feeling the baby’s movements around week 18 to 20.,
Expect to need more rest in the last trimester.,
Feel some discomfort mixed with emotions as the forthcoming birth approaches.",How to Understand the Stages of Pregnancy," From the moment you conceive, your body begins to make adjustments, with changes in hormone levels, circulation, blood pressure and breathing and metabolism generally. Monitoring these changes from the beginning of pregnancy is vital to understanding all of the stages of pregnancy and how you are progressing through them.;
, This is the time when the fertilized ovum starts to develop.


The earliest signs of pregnancy include tiredness, mood swings, and around the eighth week, morning sickness symptoms may appear.
Hormonal changes can be exacerbated by normal anxieties about pregnancy and motherhood, and weight gain of about 2 1/4 lbs or a kilo is normal.
By the end of the thirteenth week, the risk of miscarriage is reduced by around 65%, morning sickness should be over and the development of the baby’s vital organs and structures is complete.
Tests for chromosomal abnormalities and inherited disorders are usually done at around 11 weeks.

, During this stage, the expectant mother can look and feel incredibly well, more relaxed and happy. Weight gain continues and there may be changes to breasts, skin and hair.

, This is a time of rapid growth for the baby who will measure about 5 to 5 1⁄2 inches (12.7 to 14.0 cm) and weigh about 5 1/4 oz when 18 weeks old. The baby can now hear and respond to outside noises and becomes quite active.

, The final trimester can be an exciting yet demanding time as the weight of the growing baby increases along with your own weight.


It is generally assumed that the weight gain comes from the baby but the fetus is actually only responsible for about 7 1/2 pounds. The added weight comes from the placenta, uterus, amniotic fluid, breasts, blood, fat and tissue fluid, all totaling about 29 pounds of extra weight.

, The baby usually gets into the birth position at around 33 to 36 weeks and at this stage the baby should be around 14 inches (35.6 cm) long and weigh about 6 3/4 lbs.


The baby is clinically mature and considered full term and is ready to be born at any time now.
Week 40 of the pregnancy is the anticipated due date but only about 5% of babies are born on exactly the estimated date of delivery.

Wedge the pillow under your belly.,
Place the pillow between your legs and arms.,
Wrap it around your back.,
Support your head and neck.",How to Use a Pregnancy Pillow2," While lying on your side, place a U-shaped, full length, or wedge-shaped pillow underneath your belly. This will help support your belly, as well as your back muscles while you sleep., Wrap your legs and arms around a U-shaped or full length pillow. The center of the pillow should be supporting your belly. This position is akin to hugging or cuddling the pillow.Placing the pillow between your legs and arms will help relieve tension in your knee and ankle joints.

, Wrap a C, U, or J-shaped pillow along your back and between your legs. This position will give your lower and upper back, as well as your pelvis, support while you sleep. If you are uncomfortable sleeping on your back, these pillows will prevent you from rolling on your back while you sleep as well.You can also place a wedge-shaped pillow behind your back to support your lower back.

, Place a wedge-shaped pillow underneath your regular pillow to support your head and neck. This position will help relieve symptoms such as acid reflux and heartburn.If you are using a C, U, or J-shaped pillow, keep your spine aligned by placing your head and neck on the pillow as if you are using a regular pillow.

Choose a pillow with hollow fiber filling or polystyrene foam.,
Try a lightweight pillow.,
Go for a supportive pillow.,
Try a body conforming pillow.,
Choose a pillow with a removable cover.,
Take note of the size.,
Try a firm pillow.",How to Use a Pregnancy Pillow3," Both of these fillings are hypoallergenic, as well as water- and smell-resistant. These fillings are also washer-friendly, and they keep their form.Just remember, whatever pillow you choose, make sure it can support your weight and will not lose its shape throughout your pregnancy.

, Pregnancy pillows filled with styrofoam balls are very lightweight. Additionally, the balls allow the pillow to conform to your body easily. One drawback is the noise the filling makes as you move around. The noise is similar to the one a beanbag makes when you lay on it.This filling is typically found in cheaper pregnancy pillows.

, Pillows made with microbead filling are more supportive than the ones with Styrofoam ball filling. They are also very lightweight and do not make noise as you move around., Pillows filled with memory foam conform to your body and hold their shape very well. However, memory foam is not very breathable. Consequently, these pillows can become very hot as you sleep throughout the night., Pillows with removable covers are great because they make keeping your pillow clean very easy. All you need to do is remove the cover and wash it per the instructions on the tag. Look for pillows with zip or slip on covers.If the pillow you like does not have a removable cover, then make sure it is machine washable and can fit inside your washing machine.

, If you are taller than the average woman, look into getting a pillow that is 8 to 11 feet (250 to 350 cm) long. If you are average height, then get a pillow that is 5 to 6 feet (160 to 170 cm) long. The size of the pillow you want will also depend on the size of your bed and your personal preference.For example, if you have a small or mid-sized bed, make sure to get a pillow that is not too big for your bed.
The length of the pillow can also be affected by style; for example, U-shaped pillows tend to be longer than the other types of pillows.

, Although it may be tempting to get a soft pillow, it is recommended that you get a pillow that is at least slightly firm. A firmer pillow will provide more support and keep its shape longer. It may be uncomfortable at first, but over time you will get used to it."

Talk with your healthcare provider.,
Consider genetic counseling.",How to Understand the Stages of Prenatal Testing," One of the main purposes of the first doctor’s visit is to confirm that you are actually pregnant. This is done through urine pregnancy test taken in the office. If there is a concern for miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, then you may need to have a blood test.


Don’t take this personally. The doctor is not doing the test because they don’t believe you. They simply want to make sure that you didn’t get a false positive (a positive test when you actually aren’t pregnant) or that you haven’t miscarried early on in the pregnancy, as this is relatively common. Many women have miscarriages without even realizing they were pregnant.;
, During a transvaginal ultrasound, the doctor will insert a probe into your vagina. The purpose of this testing is to: confirm the pregnancy, determine whether or not multiple embryos are present, find the baby’s heartbeat, determine the cause of any bleeding (if you are experiencing it), and to detect an ectopic pregnancy, which occurs when the fertilized egg has attached itself somewhere outside the uterus.This test should not be painful, though if you are stressed or tense during the exam, you might experience some discomfort. You might also experience some light spotting (bleeding) after the exam. This is nothing to worry about as it is usually caused by a few broken cervical blood vessels. The color of the spotting (if it occurs) is usually light brown or pinkish. If the blood is bright red and you are also experiencing cramping in the lower abdomen you should contact your doctor right away.

, When you find out you’re pregnant, you will need to schedule a visit with a doctor or certified nurse-midwife a thorough examination. During this exam you will have your height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse measured. Your doctor will ask many questions about family history of both you and your partner, as well as general questions about lifestyle (diet, medication use, activity level, etc.).You will likely also have a gynaecological exam which includes a breast exam, a pap smear, and blood test to determine blood type, complete blood count, and for specific STIs.
At this point, your doctor may also suggest additional tests to check for health problems based on your risk factors, such as anemia or an inherited diseases you may not be aware of.

, You will need to have your blood drawn so that your doctor can determine your blood type. If the father of the baby has a positive blood type while you have a negative one it is possible that your baby will have an Rh positive blood type. While this usually doesn’t affect a first pregnancy, it can lead to complications in later pregnancies because the mother’s blood may create antibodies that will attack the growing fetus if they have a blood type that is Rh positive (this is called Rh disease).For example, if you have O- type blood and the baby’s father has A+ type blood, your baby may have a positive blood type as well. If this is the case, your doctor will give you two injections: one around 28 weeks of pregnancy and another within 72 hours of giving birth. This injection is called Rh immune-globulin and acts as a vaccine that will prevent your body from making antibodies against your new baby or any future babies you might conceive.
If you don’t know the father’s blood type and cannot find out for whatever reason, don’t worry. Your doctor may take steps to prevent any complications as a precautionary measure.

, A first trimester screening is a comprehensive check that usually involves a test of the mother’s blood and an ultrasound. The purpose of this test is to screen for potential chromosomal disabilities such as Down syndrome (also called trisomy 21) as well as trisomy 13, 18, spina bifida, and neural tube defects.This test will usually be done between 11 and 14 weeks. Your doctor will use information about you, such as your age and the results of the blood test to determine the likelihood that your baby will suffer from chromosomal abnormalities.
The test measures a protein in your blood known as AFP that is only present during pregnancy. Abnormal levels of this protein can indicate physical defects, chromosomal defects, or tubal defects, but it can also indicate a miscalculated due date or that the mother is pregnant with multiple babies.
If the results come back abnormal, your doctor may investigate further by recommending an ultrasound to see whether or not there are any physical defects, or they may recommend that you have an amniocentesis performed.
It is important to be aware, though, that this testing is optional. While this test does successfully detect 85% of abnormalities, it also has a 5% false positive rate. This means that in 5% of cases, the test will detect abnormalities that aren’t present.Remember that genetic testing is only a screening tool, not a diagnostic tool. If the results are abnormal it does not necessarily imply that something is wrong with the baby. It may also indicate that you are pregnant with twins or that your doctor has miscalculated the due date, for example.

, Your doctor will also have you pee in a cup so that they can test your urine for high protein levels, which may indicate kidney problems. Urine tests can also be used to check for preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening condition, which is usually characterized by high-blood pressure and high protein levels in the urine.Urine tests are yet another way to check for gestational diabetes.
A urine test may also be used to make sure that there are no bacteria in the body that could cause harm to you or the fetus.
Note that you will likely have your urine tested at every visit for the duration of the pregnancy.

, Zika is a virus that is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito.Recently, there have been outbreaks of the Zika virus in certain parts of the world. A link between exposure to the virus and several birth-related complications, especially microcephaly, has been identified. Microcephaly is a birth defect which results in an abnormally small head, and can result in many different mental deficiencies.If you have recently travelled to any country in the Caribbean, Central America, the Pacific Islands, or South America you should inform your doctor whether or not you think you were exposed to the virus.There is a screening test for the virus that you may be able to get as part of your early prenatal screening.

, Based on your body mass index (BMI) or family history, your doctor may wish to perform a test to check for gestational diabetes during the first trimester of pregnancy; however, if your BMI is normal and you don’t have any family history of diabetes, then this test will normally be performed in the second trimester, usually between weeks 24 and 28.The test involves drinking a glucose solution and then testing your blood sugar levels about an hour later. If you have higher than normal blood sugar, this does not necessarily indicate that you have gestational diabetes. However, your doctor will likely do follow-up testing to determine whether or not you do.
Gestational diabetes often disappears after you give birth, but you will need to be aware that you are at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes if you developed gestational diabetes, so it is important to monitor your blood sugar and eat a healthy diet., For many soon-to-be parents this is the best part of prenatal testing. A fetal ultrasound allows the sonographer to have a look at the growing baby’s anatomy. For the parents, it gives them a chance to actually see their baby before they are born. If you want them to, the doctor may also be able to tell you the sex of the baby.During this exam, the sonographer will be measuring and examining several things. Things they will be looking at include: the shape and size of your baby’s head, signs of a cleft palate, spine and skin deformities, the heart to make sure it is not developing abnormally, the abdominal wall (which is a common place for defects to occur), the kidneys to make sure there are two of them, as well as fingers and toes (though they won’t be able to count them). They will also be looking at your uterus and the location of the placenta to make sure it is not covering your cervix., A blood test may be performed as a follow up to testing from the first trimester, checking your levels of AFP. Testing for genetic disorders can usually be confirmed if testing is done during both the first and second trimester., If you have an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, you will likely be offered an amniocentesis. This involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid using a needle inserted into the abdomen. The fluid is then tested to diagnose genetic or chromosomal abnormalities.It may sound scary and some patients do report some cramping during the procedure, but it is a relatively painless procedure. If you do have an amniocentesis performed, you will need to rest for the next 24 hours.

, Fortunately, the number of tests performed usually drops in the third and final trimester as long as both mother and baby are deemed to be healthy, and there are no other complications. Urine testing, however, will continue to monitor the protein levels and to detect any unusual bacteria., Testing for GBS, a bacteria that is normally present in the intestines, is standard between 35 to 37 weeks. If GBS infects your baby, it can cause serious illness. The test involves taking swabs from the anal and genital regions to test for traces of the bacteria.If you test positive for the bacterium, you will likely be given antibiotics during labor to protect your baby.

, If you don’t feel your baby moving, are past your due date, carrying more than one baby, or have chronic health conditions, your doctor may ask you to measure the amount of time it takes your baby to move ten times while lying on your side.The best time to do this test is directly after eating as this is when babies tend to be most active. If the baby does not kick at least 10 times in two hours or if the number of moves seems to be decreasing, your doctor may order additional testing.

, If you have risk factors such as chronic health conditions or are carrying multiples, this test may be conducted more than once beginning at 32 weeks (possibly earlier). A strap will be placed around your abdomen to monitor the baby’s heartbeat. The test usually takes anywhere from 20 – 40 minutes.


A baby whose heart rate doesn’t rise when he moves may simply be sleeping. Your doctor will try to wake the baby using a buzzer placed on the belly. If the problem persists, further testing will be done.

, If your baby is overdue or if you’ve had many complications throughout your pregnancy, your healthcare provider may want to complete a biophysical profile. The test involves an ultrasound combined with the nonstress test, and helps the doctor to determine whether your baby may benefit from being delivered as soon as possible.For example, if your level of amniotic fluid is low, your doctor may wish to deliver the baby as soon as possible.

, There are many different prenatal screening tests that you can have done. Some are routine and some are not. Regardless of whether or not they are routine it is important to remember that as the parent of your unborn child, you have the right to refuse any test that you are uncomfortable with.This is not to suggest that you should refuse testing. The point here is to make clear that you are able to make these decisions without feeling forced.

, If you feel unsure about whether or not you want to submit to a particular prenatal test, feel free to voice your concerns with your healthcare provider. Ask them to explain the benefits and risks of the test you are concerned about, and ask them what the consequence of not having the test done might be.


Remember that different healthcare providers might have different ideas about what is a good and not good reason to have a test. If you trust your doctor, there is no reason to doubt them, but do keep in mind that they are human, and they cannot predict the outcome of any test with 100% accuracy.

, Genetic counseling should preferably take place before conception, if indicated by family history. The purpose of genetic counseling is to determine the probability of your baby having a congenital defect, the risks to your baby, the treatments available, the prenatal tests available and the possible courses of action to help with your decision-making.You should not be told what to do. All tests are voluntary and the counselor may suggest different options, but the decision will be yours.
Understanding how diseases can be inherited and the implications of dominant, recessive and x-linked genes provide helpful background information.

Smoking and drinking, apart from the health of your fallopian tubes, is not good for your body, organs, skin, hair, teeth, or nails. Quitting these habits will improve your life quality overall.;
, Meditation helps in reducing your stress levels which in turn promotes healing and overall good body health. Ideally, it would be most beneficial to begin your day with 10-15 minutes of meditation or mental relaxation techniques with breathing exercises.


Even just a few minutes of finding your zen ensures a positive start to the day and makes you more capable to handle the stress throughout the day. Less stress means lesser worsening of the inflammation that’s blocking the tubes.

, Yoga is known to channelize the energies of your body in a harmonious way and bring about greater healing potential. The 2 asanas that would help promote fertility in women are Setu bandhasana and Viparita Karani, two poses that utilize the gluteal and pelvic muscles.


To do this first pose (the ""supported bridge pose""), lie on your back with the knees folded and use your muscles to lift your pelvis off the floor. Inhale as you lift the pelvis off the floor and bring it down as you exhale after a pause of 2 seconds.
Viparita Karani or the ""legs on wall pose"" is another asana from the traditional Indian system of Yoga that helps improve blockages of the fallopian tubes. It involves lying on the back in contact with a wall on your side, while raising your leg of that same side straight up against the wall at a 90° angle. After a small pause of 2 seconds, bring it back down slowly.

, Massaging the abdomen, a technique used by natural healers, could help unblock your tubes and improve their general health and functioning. Massage improves the blood circulation in and around the tubes, resulting in break-up of scar tissues and adhesions and decrease in inflammation.You can perform this therapy on your own:


Lie down on an exercise mat with your face upwards and a pillow below your lower back.
Relax and apply almond, olive, or lavender oil on your hands and massage over your pubic bone, as the uterus lies below this bone.
Massage gently lower and lower and pull your abdominal wall towards the navel. Holding this position, count to 10 and release your hands. Repeat this maneuver 10 to 20 times.

Do not do this if you are menstruating or pregnant. Also if possible, visit a massage therapist specializing in abdominal massage for better results.



, Try to avoid things like animal meat as they contain hormones which can affect a woman’s hormones like estrogen. Replace them with foods that are high in anti-oxidants to help promote healing.


Foods that are high in anti-oxidants are fresh fruits, vegetables (all kinds), vegetable oils like sunflower oil, safflower oil, coconut oil, mustard seed oil (olive oil being the richest).
Tea, chocolate, soy, coffee, oregano and cinnamon are high on flavonoids (a type of antioxidant).
Carotenoids are plant enzymes that have anti-oxidant activity and can cut down the free-radical build up in the body. Carotenoids can be stocked up by eating eggs, red-yellow fruits and vegetables like carrots, mangoes, bell peppers, papayas, citrus fruits, spinach, zucchini, etc.

, Vitamin C is required for the absorption of iron. In addition, it boosts immunity and fights infections. If your fallopian tube blockages are due to infections or inflammation, vitamin C may help clear them. Start by taking 1000mg vitamin C supplements 5-6 times a day. Vitamin C especially helps clear fallopian blocks due to mycobacterium tuberculosis.


However, if you experience diarrhea or any other complaints because of this supplement, reduce your dosage or stop completely. And pay a visit to your doctor!

, Certain herbs can help to kill any bacteria like yeast that may cause infection or prevent fertility. Prominent amongst these herbs are Dong Quai, chamomile, garlic, oleander, turmeric, red peony root, frankincense and calendula. Any qualified Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) expert can decide your dosage thorough examination.


Research conducted on the red peony root has shown to be rich in anti-oxidants.As we have seen above, this is probably the reason why it is prescribed in TCM to cure blocked fallopian tubes.
There are various combinations of such drugs available as infusions or supplements. One should not consume any of them without consulting a doctor or a skilled expert in the field and not fall far ""miraculous"" unverified claims.

, Various herbal tampons are available for the treatment of blocked fallopian tubes. These are tampons soaked in herbs, which help regulate the reproductive organs. However, use of this method should always be with extreme caution, as the tampons are not always sterile, and could lead to infections. In addition, these herbs, when taken orally, produce the same medicinal effects.


Goldenseal root works as an anti-microbial agent, and reduces inflammation and infections, and subsequently prevents scarring and adhesions.
Ginger root improves circulation, thus reducing inflammation and blocks. Hawthorn and Uva Ursi help reduce congestion and excess body fluids, thus clearing fallopian blocks due to fluid or blood collection.
Dong Quai, a Chinese, herb helps release spasms in the fallopian tubes.

, Application of castor oil is believed to help with blocked fallopian tubes by increasing blood and lymphatic circulation around the fallopian tubes. The increased blood supply helps with better functioning and removal of blocks from your tubes, while the lymphatics help remove old cells, scar tissue, and diseased cells.


You could apply castor oil directly on the lower abdomen or you may even use castor oil soaked packs and tissues that are easily available online and in herbal stores. You need to do this daily for at least 1-2 months for good results.

, An activated charcoal poultice when applied over the lower abdomen directly above your uterus and fallopian tubes helps treat infections and reduce inflammation. You can even prepare these poultices at home. Here's how:


Place a few paper towels on a tabletop.
Place a mixture of activated charcoal and flaxseeds onto the towels and cover it with more paper towels.
Place this poultice on the affected area and cover it with a plastic wrap. Use these poultices overnight for better results.

, This therapy uses natural enzymes produced by your body to dissolve scar tissues and prevent fibrosis. Enzymes also reduce inflammation and regulate blood flow to the reproductive organs.Serrapeptase is a widely-used enzyme for this purpose.


Serrapeptase in silkworms helps dissolve their cocoons due to its tissue break down properties. Supplements and other multi-enzyme preparations such as Wobenzym N and Advil are available over the counter. However, always speak to your doctor before taking these enzymes in case you have some underlying medical condition.

, This holistic science cures effectively with minimum or no side effects. Many remedies in the homeopathy pharmacopeia are helpful in the treatment of blocked tubes and infertility. Some of the remedies you may use are as follows:



Pulsatilla nigricans: It is indicated for fallopian blockages with menstrual irregularities and mood swings. Pulsatilla 30 taken twice a day for 2-3 months could help regulate your menstrual cycle and remove fallopian blocks.

Sepia: It is a homeopathic remedy indicated for menstrual irregularities, painful menses, pain in the vagina with a bearing down feeling, and repeated miscarriages due to fallopian blockages. Sepia 30 thrice a day for 2-3 months should help relieve your symptoms.

Thyroidinum: If you have thyroid disorders along with fallopian blocks, or lethargy with sluggishness and tendency to gain weight, thyroidinum 30 twice a day could help you considerably.

Natrum Muriaticum: It helps women who have recurrent headaches, especially after exposure to sunlight, and a craving for salty and sour food items. Fallopian tube blocks with delayed menses, bloating of abdomen with gas, and headaches are an indication for natrum muriaticum. Take 200 twice a day for 2- 3 months.

If you go off of your medications and start to experience mental health problems, it’s not safe for you or your developing baby. If you decide to stay on medication or reduce your dose, recognize that this is the right decision for you and what is best for your health., All mood stabilizers are associated with a risk of malformation and perinatal complications.However, it is important to recognize that some are associated with more risks than others. If you have gone off medications before and experienced difficulty, you may choose to stay on medication while pregnant. Weigh the risk of remaining on medications with the potential risk of the medication onto your developing baby.


Keep in mind that you don’t have to make decisions about medication on your own. You can make these decisions with the help of your obstetrician and psychiatrist.
If you feel healthy and good during your pregnancy, your developing baby will feel healthy and good. Having mental health problems can negatively affect your developing baby.

, Although some medication is safe during pregnancy, it may become more concerning if you choose to breastfeed. Consider this decision early and how you will handle it. For example, if you choose to stay on medications, you may need to formula feed your baby in order to not expose it to the medications.Talk to your provider about the risks and benefits of remaining on medication and how it can affect your baby through breast milk.

, If family planning is in your future, consider making a switch from mood stabilizers to an antipsychotic medication. Talk to your physician about making the switch, as antipsychotics can be a good option for women having bipolar disorder during pregnancy.Talk to your prescriber whether this is a good option for you.


There are far fewer risks associated with antipsychotics during pregnancy. To date, no studies have found links to adverse effects or increased birth defects in babies born while the mother takes antipsychotics."

Consider a vaginal breech birth.",How to Turn a Breech Baby," The breech tilt is the most commonly used exercise for turning breech babies. It helps the baby to tuck his or her chin (known as flexion), which is the first step in flipping over.


To perform the breech tilt, you need to elevate your hips between 9 and 12 inches above your head. There are several ways of doing this. The easiest way is simply to lie on the ground and prop your hips up with pillows.
Alternatively, you could get a broad plank of wood (or even an ironing board) which you'll need to prop up against a bed or a couch. Lie on the board so your head is at the base (supported by a pillow) and your feet are in the air.Do this three times a day for ten to fifteen minutes each time, on an empty stomach, and during times when the baby is active. Try to relax and breathe deeply as you perform the exercise, and avoid tensing the abdominal muscles. For added benefit, you can combine the breech tilt with the application of heat and ice, or sound.;
, This exercise uses gravity to encourage the baby to somersault into the correct birthing position.


Get down on your knees on the floor or bed and rest your forearms on the ground. Stick your butt into the air and tuck your chin. This allows the lower part of your uterus to expand, making room for the baby's head.Hold this position for 5 to 15 minutes, twice a day. Try to do it on an empty stomach, otherwise you might feel slightly ill afterwards.
If you can feel the baby's position, it may be possible to help the turning process along. While leaning on one elbow, use the opposite hand to exert gentle upward pressure on the baby’s rear end, which is located just above your pubic bone.

, The forward-leaning inversion is similar to the knee-to-chest exercise, but a little more extreme.


Start in the knee-to-chest position on your bed or at the top of a staircase. Carefully, place your palms on the floor (if you're on the bed) or two or three steps down (if you're using a staircase). Remember to tuck your chin, as this helps to relax your pelvic muscles.
Be very careful when performing this exercise, as you don't want your hands to slip. Have your partner help you into position and use their hands to support your shoulders throughout the exercise.
Hold this position for up to thirty seconds. Keep in mind that it's better to repeat the exercise frequently (3 to 4 times per day) than to hold the position for a longer period of time., Swimming and doing crouches and flips in the pool can help a baby turn into the vertex position on his or her own. Try the following pool exercises:


Crouch on the bottom of the pool in deep water, and then push off and reach your hands up as you break the surface of the water.
Just swimming around the pool can encourage the baby to move (and feels really good during the final weeks of pregnancy). The front crawl and the breast stroke are thought to be particularly effective for this.
Do front and back flips in deep water. This will relax your muscles and make it easier for the baby to roll over on his or her own. If you have good balance, you can also try doing an underwater handstand and holding it for as long as you can hold your breath.
Dive in. Dive into the pool while gently holding the baby’s head out of the pelvis. The weightlessness and rushing water is thought to help the baby roll over on his or own.

, Aside from doing specific exercises to encourage your baby to turn, it's important to pay attention to your posture in your day-to-day life, as this can affect the baby's movement.


More specifically, good posture will help ensure the maximum amount of room available in the uterus so the baby can turn into the correct position on his or her own. For perfect posture, use the following guidelines:
Stand straight with your chin level to the ground.
Allow your shoulders to drop naturally. If you are standing up straight with your chin in the proper position, your shoulders will drop and align naturally. Avoid throwing them back.
Pull in your abdomen. Do not stand with your belly pouched out.
Pull in your butt. Your center of gravity should be over your hips.
Position your feet properly. Put your feet shoulder width apart and spread your weight evenly over your feet.

, Something cold applied to the top of the uterus and/or something warm to the bottom of the uterus may encourage your baby to move away from the cold sensation and towards the warm one, flipping into the correct position.


To do this, place an ice pack or a packet of frozen veggies on top of your belly, near the baby's head. Hopefully, the baby will shy away from the coldness and turn in order to find a warmer, more comfortable position.
Using the ice pack in a bathtub, with the lower half of your belly submerged in hot water, is a good way to use this technique, as the baby will gravitate towards the warmth. Alternatively, you can place a warm pack or hot water bottle on the lower half of you belly.
This hot and cold technique is completely safe, so it can be done for as long and as often as you like. Many women choose to use hot and cold packs on their bellies while performing the breech tilt.

, There are a couple of different methods of sound use, both relying on the baby turning towards the sound and thus into the proper position.One popular option is to play music for the baby by positioning headphones on the lower part of your belly. You can download music made especially for unborn and newborn babies online -- whether it's soft classical music or lullaby versions of your favorite lullaby tunes.
Alternatively, you could have your partner place their mouth on your lower abdomen and talk to the baby, encouraging him or her to move towards the sound of his voice. This is also a good way for your partner to bond with the baby.

, Webster In-Utero Constraint technique -- or simply Webster's technique -- was developed to restore proper pelvic balance and function, and is thought to help encourage the baby to roll into the proper position on his or her own.


Webster's technique involves two things -- firstly, it ensures that the sacrum and pelvic bones are balanced and in proper alignment. If these bones remained misaligned, it would impede the baby's movement into the vertex position.
Secondly, this technique helps to reduce stress to the round ligaments that support the uterus by loosening and relaxing them. Once these ligaments are loosened, the baby has more space to move around, allowing him or her to get into the correct position before birth.
Bear in mind that Webster's technique is a process, so you will need to attend appointments at least three times a week during the final weeks of pregnancy. Make sure you are receiving treatment from a licensed chiropractor who has experiencing in treating women pregnant with breech babies., Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese technique which uses burning herbs to stimulate acupressure points.


To turn a breech baby, an herb known as mugwort is burned beside the pressure point BL 67, located beside the outer corner of the fifth toenail (baby toe).
This technique is thought to increase the baby’s activity level, thereby encouraging him or her to flip into the vertex position by themselves. Moxibustion is usually performed by an acupuncturist (sometimes in addition to traditional acupuncture) or a licensed practitioner of Chinese medicine. However, moxibustion sticks can also be purchased for those who wish to try this method at home.

, Some women have successfully turned a breech baby with the aid of a licensed hypnotherapist.


Hypnotherapy usually takes a two-pronged approach to turning the baby. Firstly, the mother will be hypnotized into a state of deep relaxation. This helps her pelvic muscles to relax and her lower uterus to expand, encouraging the baby to turn.
Secondly, the mother will be encouraged to use visualization techniques to imagine the baby turning the right way around.
Ask your healthcare provider for the name and number of a reputable hypnotherapist in your area.

, Once you pass the 37 week mark, it is unlikely that your breech baby will change position on its own.


Therefore, you should consider scheduling an appointment with your doctor so that he or she may attempt to turn the baby using external cephalic version (“ECV”). This is a non-surgical procedure, used by a doctor, in a hospital.
During the procedure, the doctor uses medication to relax the uterus so that he or she can push the baby, externally, into the vertex position. This is done by applying downward pressure to the lower abdomen (which some women find very uncomfortable).
Throughout the procedure, the doctor will use an ultrasound to monitor the position of the baby and placenta, along with the amount of amniotic fluid. The baby's heart rate will also be monitored throughout the procedure -- if it drops too low, an immediate emergency delivery may be necessary.The ECV procedure is successful in approximately 58% of breech pregnancies. It has a higher rate of success in subsequent (rather than first-time) pregnancies. However, in some cases, ECV is not possible due to complications -- such as bleeding or lower-than-normal levels of amniotic fluid. It is also impossible to perform when the mother is carrying twins., In some cases, a c-section will be necessary whether your baby is breech or not -- like if you have a placenta previa, are carrying triplets, or have previously had a c-section.


However, if your baby is breech but all other factors are normal, you will need to decide if you want to deliver your baby vaginally or undergo a c-section. A large majority of breech babies are delivered by c-section, as it is believed that this option may be somewhat less risky.
Planned c-sections are normally scheduled no earlier than the 39th week of pregnancy. An ultrasound will be performed just before the surgery to ensure that the baby hasn't changed position before the last check-up.
However, if you go into labor before the scheduled c-section and it progresses too quickly, you may need to deliver the baby vaginally irrespective of your plans.

, Delivering breech babies through vaginal birth is no longer considered to be as dangerous as it once was.


In fact, in 2006 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) stated that delivering breech babies vaginally is safe and reasonable in certain patients under specific conditions.
For example, vaginal breech birth may be a valid option if the mother's pelvis is large enough; the baby is carried to full term and the labor starts and progresses normally; ultrasounds of the baby indicate that he or she is a healthy weight with no abnormalities (other than its breech position); the primary caregiver is experienced in the vaginal delivery of breech babies.If you think you may meet these criteria and are interested in having a traditional birth rather than a c-section, speak to your doctor to explore your options and decide whether a vaginal birth is safe for both you and your baby.

Accept the positive side of morning sickness.,
Understand the causes and conditions of morning sickness.,
Adopt coping strategies.",How to Understand Morning Sickness,"


If you’re in the throes of being sick, hearing from your doctor that the sickness you’re experiencing is a positive thing might not be very comforting. But studies have shown that morning sickness often bodes towards a healthy pregnancy, with lower rates of miscarriages and stillbirths, compared to pregnancies with no nausea or vomiting.
That doesn’t mean, however, that those women who experience no nausea in the early months of pregnancy should panic about being more likely to miscarry. A large percentage of them will go on to have perfectly normal pregnancies and births.;
, Despite many studies on this subject, scientists have found themselves unable to agree on one specific factor that causes morning sickness. They have, however, isolated several possible causes:


Hormonal changes may be the cause. Levels of estrogen and progesterone increase rapidly in pregnancy, so some experts have linked this rise to the incidence of morning sickness. Progesterone, in particular, can relax the muscles of the stomach and intestine, resulting in excess stomach acids and reflux. The hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is also a prime suspect, because hCG levels tend to peak around the same time as the nausea, although no one has been able to prove the link between the two. However, women pregnant with twins and multiples tend to have higher levels of hCG, and also experience more severe morning sickness.
Fluctuating blood sugar levels may cause it. The placenta’s job is to drain the mother’s body of whatever energy and nutrients are required for the fetus to grow and thrive. This can sometimes result in a state of mild hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) which some experts have linked to feelings of nausea.
Enhanced sensitivity to smell could also cause morning sickness. It is commonly acknowledged that pregnant women develop an enhanced sense of smell and a sensitivity to odors, even those emanating from far away. It is thought that these smells can over-stimulate the normal nausea triggers in the body, and even set off the gag reflex.
Instinctive protective reflexes may also cause the condition. That fact that morning sickness does not affect every healthy pregnancy has led scientists to debate hotly over whether it is a factor in ensuring a normal, healthy baby or if it could just be an unwelcome side effect of the natural processes taking place within the mother’s body. If that was the case, it should be apparent in all successful pregnancies. Also, morning sickness does not seem to occur in other mammals, even though the reproductive system is inherently similar.
Scientists who analyzed the triggers for nausea found that it is often felt in response to the sight, smell or taste of meat or strong-tasting vegetables – foods that historically were likely to contain food-borne microbes or chemicals that could induce birth defects. Substances like alcohol and cigarette smoke are also common culprits – even evoking negative responses from regular smokers or drinkers.
Morning sickness may actually be a kind of evolutionary protective mechanism, designed to keep mothers away from things that may be dangerous to their developing babies. If a woman with morning sickness does not feel like eating foods like poultry, meat or eggs (food which may potentially carry contamination) and instead favors low-risk foods like rice, bread and crackers, she unconsciously improves the chances of survival for her unborn child.
Women experiencing morning sickness usually report a peak in symptoms between week six and week eighteen of pregnancy, the precise period when embryonic organ development is most susceptible to chemical disruption.

, Even if you know your morning sickness is a sign that your baby is developing normally and your pregnancy is a healthy one, it can still be hard to deal with. Here are some quick tips to help you combat the symptoms:


Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day so your stomach is never empty.
Avoid foods that trigger nausea and stick to those you can eat. It’s okay if your diet is temporarily a little unbalanced – getting some nutrition is better than none.
Try to stay away from heavy, rich, spicy and deep-fried foods, which can irritate your stomach.
Carry simple snacks like crackers or cereal bars with you at all times to avoid dips in blood sugar levels.
Keep a small snack next to the bed so if you wake in the night, you have something to nibble on – this may help alleviate the first wave of nausea that hits in the morning.
Ensure you stay hydrated by sipping on water or juice between meals. If you’ve been vomiting a lot, try a sports drink that will replace the sugars and salts you have lost.
Try to rest as much as possible, as tiredness can exacerbate the feeling of sickness.
Try ginger ale or ginger tea – ginger is said to settle the stomach and help ease nausea. Keeping a couple of ginger biscuits by the bed to eat as soon as you wake up (before you get up) can also help. Or ask your healthcare provider to recommend a ginger supplement.
Consider trying acupressure, which involves wearing bands on your forearms to apply pressure to specific points, said to relieve symptoms of morning sickness.

Monitor the developing baby’s health.",How to Use Mood Stabilizers During Pregnancy2," Ideally, prenatal planning should begin long before becoming pregnant to minimize pregnancy complications and to allow for any medication changes.However, it is generally not recommended to make any medication changes after becoming pregnant. If you are planning your pregnancy, talk to your prescriber as soon as you make the decision to start a family. If you did not plan to become pregnant, talk to your psychiatrist as soon as you think you may be pregnant. The earlier you talk about your options, the more in control you can feel of your medications during pregnancy., Your psychiatrist will closely monitor you throughout your pregnancy. They will consider lots of factors in your treatment throughout your pregnancy, such as your current mental state, psychiatric history, history of relapses off medication, and response to medication.All of these are important factors when considering medication during pregnancy.


Work with someone who is familiar with managing medications for pregnant and breastfeeding women., Talk to your prescriber about the potential risks and effects you and your developing baby may experience while on medication. Before you make a final decision, spend some time researching the potential effects on your own. This will help you make an informed decision and know what risks should be monitored at your obstetrician appointments.It can be easy to feel fearful after reading potential risks. Remind yourself of the costs and benefits of remaining on medication and remember that there’s no way to predict your own risks.
You might also try to find out how many birth defects have been reported in women using the medication, rather than reading about all of the possible birth defects. Your obstetrician may be able to help you find this information.

, Connect your psychiatrist and obstetrician so that they can monitor you and your developing baby’s health together.If you choose to continue your medications during pregnancy, you may need special prenatal tests to monitor your baby’s health and development. For example, to rule out heart problems, a fetal echocardiogram and level 2 sonogram can be performed.Ask your provider what you can do to keep your developing baby healthy during pregnancy. Get any tests that help you determine the health of your developing baby.

Consider taking lithium if you need a mood stabilizer.,
Consider anticonvulsant medication.,
Avoid taking valproate if possible.,
Consider other psychiatric medications.",How to Use Mood Stabilizers During Pregnancy4," Keep in mind that mood stabilizers may not be as safe during pregnancy as other types of medications, such as antipsychotics.However, lithium is considered to be a lower risk than other medications during pregnancy and appears safe during the second and third trimesters.Still, it is not without risk, as there is a slight risk for rare defects during the first trimester. This includes Ebstein’s anomaly, which affects the heart.It’s important to monitor lithium levels closely and perhaps decrease them during pregnancy, as they can fluctuate with changing hormones and become too high.Once your baby is born, breast feeding is not recommended when taking lithium.

, Anticonvulsant medication used to treat bipolar disorder includes carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproate. Anticonvulsants include the risk of fetal anticonvulsant syndrome, which is associated with physical abnormalities, delayed development, and an increased need of special support in school.Considerations when taking carbamazepine medications include a higher risk of major congenital malformation during the first trimester. It is not recommended to take carbamazepine during the first trimester.Risks associated with lamotrigine include physical malformations such as cleft palate.However, it appears more favorable than other medications and appears better during lactation. , Valproate has the highest risk out of all mood stabilizers. Using valproate during the first trimester is associated with major malformations, developmental delay, and a higher risk of developing autism spectrum disorder.Other risks include craniofacial abnormalities.Talk to your provider about lowering your dose or switching to a safer medication.

, You might take antidepressants or antianxiety medications in addition to medication for manic episodes. Talk to your prescriber about what medications may be safe during pregnancy.


For antidepressants, any SSRI, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), appear to be the safest choice during pregnancy.
Antianxiety medications have been fiercely debated and may impact development during the first trimester."

Get a screening test for a panel of STIs.,
Follow the instructions of a health care professional for your medication or treatment regimen.,
Be sure to follow other prenatal health advice.,
Protect yourself with safe sex practices.",How to Treat Sexually Transmitted Diseases During Pregnancy," Most prenatal care providers automatically screen their patients for certain sexually transmitted diseases, but if you are unsure or if you suspect that you have a condition, ask your health care provider to test you specifically for a variety of STIs.


The type of infection you have will determine your course of treatment. If you are diagnosed with a viral infection that cannot be cured, treatment will be more difficult than for a bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics. Do not attempt to treat a sexually transmitted infection independently. Only take a medicine or treatment prescribed by a health professional.
Bacterial infections that can typically be treated with an antibiotic approved by an obstetrician or prenatal care specialist include gonorrhea, Chlamydia, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and syphilis. Certain infections require additional care to ensure that the infection does not pass to the baby at birth (for instance, they will put antibiotic drops into your baby’s eyes after birth if you have gonorrhea).
Viral infections that require more advanced treatment to prevent transmission to the baby include Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), Hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, and herpes. In some cases, antiviral medication can be administered during pregnancy to reduce maternal symptoms. Wart medication may be approved to treat HPV during pregnancy in some cases but must be approved by an obstetrician or prenatal care specialist. In many cases, viral conditions can pass to the baby during childbirth unless treatment began during pregnancy (as with HIV) or is administered immediately following birth (as with Hepatitis C and herpes).;

If left untreated, many sexually transmitted infections can cause health problems for you or the baby, including premature delivery, eye infections, intellectual disability, or and even death.
If you receive antibiotics for the treatment of your condition, follow the medication instructions exactly and do not skip doses or stop taking the treatment until the entire regimen is complete. Be sure to ask your health care provider about any possible side effects of the medication or any possible risks of treatment for you and your baby.
If you believe your condition has not improved or disappeared with treatment, consult a health professional again to determine whether further treatment is necessary.

, Your overall health status will determine how seriously your condition affects you and how well you tolerate treatment for a sexually transmitted infection. By following a well-balanced and nutritious diet, getting regular physical activity, maintaining a social support network, practicing stress relief strategies, and attending regular prenatal care visits, your chances of battling the infection with positive outcomes increase dramatically.

, Most women contract sexually transmitted diseases through unprotected sex.


To protect yourself and your child for the remainder of your pregnancy from other sexually transmitted infections, be sure to use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom.
If you have an infection, be sure to also inform any sexual partners of your condition.
It is important to keep using protection even after you have been treated for your infection so that you, your baby, and your partner are protected from future possible sexually transmitted diseases.

If you're brave enough to venture a look, you'll see that they look like a bunch of grapes or small marbles protruding from the anus. Hemorrhoids usually form during the first trimester of pregnancy or after child birth. Symptoms include:


Anal itching.
Anal pain, especially while sitting.
Bright red blood on the stool.
Pain during bowel movements, hard painful lumps in the anus.;
, Hemorrhoids are caused by increased blood pressure in the veins in the lower half of your body. Too much pressure in these veins can lead to swollen or dilated blood vessels, which manifest as hemorrhoids. Pregnant women are more susceptible to hemorrhoids for a variety of reasons:


As you progress through your pregnancy, your growing uterus puts more and more pressure on the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava (a large vein which receives blood from the lower body). This slows blood flow from these veins, leading to increased pressure, and therefore hemorrhoids.
Pregnant women are also more like to experience constipation. When you strain to pass a hard bowel movement, you put excess pressure on your rectal area. This can lead to the formation of hemorrhoids or exacerbate existing ones.
Pregnant women also have a higher level of a hormone known as progesterone in their systems. This hormone causes the walls of you veins to relax, making them more likely to swell and develop hemorrhoids as a result. Progesterone also has an impact on your digestive system, making constipation more likely.

, If you're still unsure about whether you have hemorrhoids, or you have any concerns about how they'll affect your pregnancy, it's a good idea to see your doctor. A doctor can diagnose hemorrhoids by a simple rectal exam.


However, other tests may be performed to rule out other diagnoses. These may include a stool-guiac-test (which indicates the presence of fresh blood in the stool), or either a sigmoidoscopy or an anoscopy - both of which use a scope to check for the presence of obstructions or malignancies which can mimic the signs of hemorrhoids.

, There are many over-the-counter creams available for hemorrhoids. These creams help to ease the pain and itchiness associated with hemorrhoids, but don't cure the underlying problem.


Use hemorrhoid creams according to the instructions on the packaging, and never use for more than a week as they can make inflammation worse.
Ask your healthcare provider for a recommendation on the best hemorrhoid cream for you. Two of the most common hemorrhoid creams are corticosteroids, which will help reduce inflammation and pain, and hemorrhoid creams containing lidocaine, an anesthetic which will help to numb the pain.

, A sitz bath is a small plastic basin which you can fill with water and attach to the seat of your toilet.


This allows you to submerge your anal region in warm water, which can help soothe any pain or discomfort caused by the hemorrhoids. Try sitting for 10-15 minutes, once or twice a day.
You can achieve the same results simply by sitting in a bathtub filled with hot water, but many pregnant women prefer the ease and convenience of the sitz bath.

, If you want relief from constipation, you should ask your doctor about getting a prescription for stool softeners.


Since hemorrhoids come from increased pressure on the veins near the anus, a softer stool can help decrease the pressure on these veins, thus causing less pain.
Stool softeners come in tablet, capsule, liquid and syrup form and are usually taken at night.

, Scratching can aggravate the hemorrhoids, making the swelling worse, or even causing them to bleed. To reduce itchiness:


Wear cotton garments. These are less likely to irritate the hemorrhoids and also allow your skin to breathe, which can speed up healing.
Do not use scented tissues. Avoided using perfumed or colored toilet paper, as these contain ore chemicals and can irritate the hemorrhoids. Plain white, two-ply toilet paper is best.
Keep the area clean. Wiping carefully after a bowel movement can help to reduce issues - just be gently, as wiping too hard can cause irritation. Some women find that dampening the toilet paper with a little warm water helps. You can also buy medicated wipes (containing witch hazel) designed specifically for use on hemorrhoids.

, An ice pack or cold compress applied directly to the hemorrhoids can help to soothe discomfort and reduce swelling. Apply a new, clean ice pack several times a day, as needed.

, Consult a doctor when your hemorrhoids don't improve with home treatment. Dizziness and continuous bleeding is a sign of blood loss. Call for help immediately.

, Constipation is the number one culprit behind hemorrhoids. Therefore by avoiding constipation you can significantly reduce the chance of hemorrhoids developing. To avoid constipation:


Drink plenty of fluids. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day, but herbal teas, juices and smoothies will also be beneficial
Eat a high fiber diet of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. According to http:\\MedicineNet, the top five foods for reducing constipation are prunes, beans, kiwi, rye bread and pears,
Meanwhile, foods to avoid or cut back on include chocolate, dairy, bananas, red meat and caffeine.

, Straining on the toilet can lead to the development of hemorrhoids, so try to avoid it when possible.


If you can't pass a bowel movement easily, leave the toilet and try again later instead.
On the other hand, if you really need to go you shouldn't wait to relieve your bowels, as holding it in can also cause strain.

, Sitting and standing both put pressure on your lower veins, so try to avoid doing either for long periods of time.


If you work sitting down, make sure to take regular breaks where you stand up and walk around. The opposite goes if you work standing up.
While watching TV, reading or sleeping, you should lie on your left side, as this helps to increase blood flow in the lower half of your body.

, Kegel exercises (which are designed to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles) also help to increase blood flow to the rectal area and strengthen the muscles around the anus, making hemorrhoids much less likely.

Watch for signs that you have a UTI during pregnancy.,
Consult with your doctor before taking any medication.,
Take the appropriate antibiotics.,
Get reevaluated 1-2 weeks after you finish your medicine.,
Take nightly medicine for UTIs that won’t go away.",How to Treat Urinary Tract Infections During Pregnancy1," Recognize signs and symptoms of a UTI so that you can catch it early. The most common signs of a UTI are urinating even more than usual, urgent urination, pain, stinging, or burning when you pee, cloudy or bad-smelling urine, blood in your urine, fever, and backache or pelvic pain.See your doctor at the first sign of a UTI for treatment.

Recognize that some symptoms of a UTI can seem common to a regular pregnancy, like urinating frequently and having a backache. Pay attention to the changes your body is going through during pregnancy, so you can differentiate symptoms of illness from regular conditions of pregnancy.
Sometimes you might not have any symptoms from a UTI, so be sure to see your doctor regularly during pregnancy so you can be screened.
Consider keeping a diary of how you’re feeling during your pregnancy. Take note of how many time a day you have to urinate, where you have pain, and other physical changes.;
, Only some medications are safe to take during pregnancy – others can cause harm to your baby or affect your pregnancy. Ask your doctor before taking any medication, even over-the-counter medicine, while pregnant. Don’t try to treat your UTI by yourself – you need medical treatment and a prescribed antibiotic.

No medication is proven 100% safe during pregnancy, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has categorized medicines based on their relative safety. Your OB/GYN will know exactly which medications are safe for you to take.

, It’s not uncommon to have to take antibiotics during pregnancy. Simply consult with your doctor to choose the right one. Which antibiotic to take depends on how late you are in your pregnancy and other factors.The safest antibiotics to take during pregnancy are amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, cephalexin, sulfisoxazole, or nitrofurantoin. Fosfomycin is a newer antibiotic that you only have to take for 1 day.Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and tetracyclines (doxycycline and minocycline) are commonly used to treat UTIs, but should NOT be used during pregnancy.
Take your antibiotics exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Usually this will be for 7, 10, or 14 days.Even if you feel better, you must complete the treatment.
Do not take any leftover antibiotics you may have from a previous UTI or from someone else.

, It’s important to make sure your course of antibiotics was effective. Visit your doctor for a follow-up 1-2 weeks after you finish taking your antibiotics. You will provide a urine sample to test that your infection is sufficiently treated., If your follow-up visit shows that you still have a UTI, your doctor will have you take a different antibiotic for 10-14 days followed by nightly suppressor therapy (a low dose antibiotic) until 6 weeks after you have your baby. Take your medicine as prescribed, and continue to see your OB/GYN regularly during your pregnancy."

See your doctor for a prenatal check-up and ask him if it is safe for you to travel.,
Check with your doctor specifically about low air pressure and increased exposure to radiation if you fly frequently.,
Check with the airline or cruise company to make sure you will be able to travel.,
Take a copy of pertinent health information and your insurance card in case of emergency while traveling.

,
Pack or wear comfortable clothing and shoes while traveling.

,
Pay attention to your general nutrition while traveling.,
Wear your seat belt to maintain safety for both you and your baby while traveling by car or airplane.",How to Travel During Pregnancy1," Disclose all of your travel plans and have him fill out a medical certificate that indicates it is safe for you to travel.;
, For a pregnant woman who travels only occasionally, air pressure and radiation should not be worrisome.


Low cabin pressure has little effect on a pregnant woman or her fetus as the body is able to adapt to the deficiency naturally.
A fetus exposed to radiation has an increased risk of some cancers. At airport security, minimize the risk by asking that you be searched by hand or a wand instead of a security machine.

,


Many airlines restrict or strongly discourage pregnant women from traveling after 36 weeks. Some international airlines may have an earlier cut-off date. The majority of airlines also will require a medical certificate deeming it OK to fly in the last trimester.

,,,


Regular meals and snacks can fight travel-related fatigue. Extra water consumption can help you stay hydrated inside a very dry airplane cabin.

, The chances of survival in a crash dramatically increase through the use of a seat belt.


Buckle the seat belt low on your hips, positioning it below your baby bump. The shoulder belt should be positioned between your breasts.

Consult an OB/GYN, a physician or healthcare provider for individual recommendations about airline travel during pregnancy.Many healthcare professionals allow pregnant women to fly for the majority of their pregnancy, provided there are no known complications with the pregnancy, such as a ruptured placenta, gestational diabetes, or hypertension.Women who have previously experienced a miscarriage, premature delivery, fetal loss, stillbirth, or any of a number of other health risks may not receive approval from an obstetrician or midwife for travel by plane for any occasion during pregnancy, for fear that the current pregnancy is also high-risk.Certain conditions during pregnancy may be aggravated by plane travel, and flying has an unknown effect on many other conditions, making many medical experts cautious of endorsing travel by plane for women experiencing high-risk pregnancies.,
Inform the airline about your pregnancy.,
Ask the airline about their restrictions.,
Be honest with the airline and your doctor.",How to Travel by Plane when Pregnant1,";
, Certain airlines will do what they can to assist pregnant women who need or want to fly, but can only provide assistance if they know about your particular circumstances. So be sure to ask what an airline will do for you before booking your ticket.Ensure the airline will support you. Shop around, if necessary, to find an airline that supports and assists pregnant women during travel by plane. Just as some airlines are more permissive than others, certain companies are also more responsive to the needs of pregnant passengers.Provided the airline has received notification of the pregnancy, some immediately offer choice seating, wheelchair escorts and other conveniences not routinely offered to most passengers.
Flying during pregnancy can be a much more pleasant experience when your chosen airline treats pregnant passengers with care and respect, so choose wisely.

, Inquire whether the airline in question has restrictions on how far along in pregnancy a woman is still allowed to travel and whether a physician’s release is required under any circumstances.


The closer a woman is to the expected delivery date, the less likely an airline will allow travel without the written consent of a physician or midwife (dated within a few days of the travel date). This is not only to limit their own liability but also to insure the safety and comfort of the woman and the other passengers.Most airlines do not allow travel after 36 weeks gestation.Trans-national and trans-oceanic flights may make traveling when pregnant more difficult, as some airlines require a note from a physician or midwife any time after the 28th week of pregnancy indicating that there are no complications with the pregnancy., Make sure you provide accurate and comprehensive information about your pregnancy to your doctor and your airline before attempting to travel while pregnant.Tell your doctor about any problems you have had during your pregnancy, such as excessive nausea, pain in the stomach or abdomen, or other physical problems you have experienced. This is the only way your doctor can accurately assess whether or not you are fit to fly.Be exact when providing the airline with a timeline for your pregnancy. Estimating how far along you are or deliberately misleading the airline so that they will allow you to fly could have potentially damaging effects on your health and the health of your unborn baby."

Request additional courtesies of the airline staff.,
Avoid heavy lifting.,
Stay hydrated.,
Plan for comfort.,
Perform small exercises during the flight.,
Wear supportive hosiery.",How to Travel by Plane when Pregnant2," Do not hesitate to let the airline staff know about your pregnancy. This may especially help when selecting a seat on the flight.


Inform the airline staff of the pregnancy and request the desired seat if the option is available. For instance, an aisle seat near the restroom may provide convenience for frequent trips to the toilet, while a seat at the bulkhead of the plane would offer extra legroom and personal space.Women who have difficulty standing for long periods or walking considerable distances through the airport may also request wheelchair delivery and pick-up or escort on an airport indoor vehicle to drop them off and pick them up at the gate.
Blankets and pillows are usually available upon request as well.

, Do not hesitate to request assistance loading or unloading a bag into the overhead carriers, as you should avoid strenuous activity while pregnant., During the flight, many flight attendants will gladly serve additional beverages (particularly water or tea) or snacks to customers who request it.On long flights, stewards and stewardesses may also provide certain luxuries to pregnant customers otherwise only reserved for first class patrons, such as hot towels, lotions, eye masks, and more.

, During a flight of any length, make sure you pack the essentials. A neck pillow, empty water bottle, heat pack, and healthy snacks may make a trying travel experience more pleasant.It is important to drink plenty of water during and after the flight; air travel can dehydrate, so fill up after security or request water once seated.
For women traveling early in pregnancy, crackers and other snacks that may help quell nausea are vital.

, It is important to keep blood flowing and reduce swelling or discomfort during a flight. One of the biggest risks of flying while pregnant is deep vein thrombosis. Moving around and stretching your calves can help minimize this risk. Flex your knees and roll your ankles and wrists in small circles. Occasionally, do leg lifts, back stretches, and short walks up and down the aisle. These small exercises can help reduce stiffness and minimize cramps or swelling when there is no turbulence, just take care to maintain balance by holding onto the seatbacks or the overhead bins., Support hosiery can aid leg circulation during long periods of standing in line or sitting on the plane and help lower the risk of DVT."

Find resources on PTSD to prepare yourself.,
See a therapist.,
Become familiar with the possible risks.,
Pause your current therapeutic work on traumatic memories.,
Keep your whole medical team updated.,
Ask your doctor if it’s safe for you to take medication.",How to Treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder During Pregnancy1," The better you understand PTSD, the more effectively you’ll be able to cope with it. Familiarize yourself with the reasons PTSD occurs, what kinds of symptoms it causes, and what types of therapy are used to treat it.Start by searching the internet and your local library for information about PTSD. You can also ask your doctor or therapist to help you find resources for learning about the condition.
PTSD can be caused by any kind of trauma, including rape, childhood sexual abuse, or the loss of a pregnancy. Some women develop PTSD without realizing it after experiencing one of these events.
If you think you have PTSD but you haven’t been diagnosed, see your doctor.;
, PTSD is most often treated with psychotherapy. Ask your doctor to refer you to a therapist who works with trauma survivors. If you are already in therapy, continue to attend your sessions as usual.Your therapist will probably use different types of cognitive behavioral therapy, such as exposure therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), to reprogram your thoughts and help you move past your trauma.

, Some studies have found that pregnancy is riskier if you have PTSD. Women with PTSD are more likely to give birth prematurely, and their babies may be smaller than those of women without PTSD. Talk to your doctor about how to minimize these risks.Pregnancy is known for heightening emotions, but it won’t necessarily make your PTSD worse. According to one study, as many as three out of four women with PTSD find that pregnancy actually reduces their symptoms., Don’t try to tackle all your fears while your hormones and emotions are in flux. This can heighten your stress and possibly complicate your pregnancy. Instead focus on learning good coping strategies for your current symptoms, so you can feel safer and more peaceful throughout your pregnancy.Good coping strategies are relaxation exercises like deep breathing, meditation, and grounding.
If you feel overwhelmed, let your therapist know that you need to slow down.

, Communicate frequently with your therapist, obstetrician, psychiatrist, and any other specialists you see on a regular basis. Make sure they are all informed about your pregnancy, your PTSD, and any medications you are taking., Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are sometimes used to treat PTSD, but they’ve been linked to birth defects, so they are usually not recommended for pregnant women. If you’re currently taking any medications to treat your PTSD symptoms, talk to your doctor about whether you should stop or switch to a different kind.Your doctor may advise you to keep taking a medication if they think the side effects are less risky than untreated PTSD.

Avoid sitting on hard surfaces.,
Exercise.,
Have good bowel habits.,
Eat more fiber.,
Lie on your left side most of the time.,
Keep your anal area clean.",How to Treat Pregnancy Hemorrhoids at Home," A simple procedure as a warm bath for your hips and buttocks can be very effective against the discomfort associated with the illness. The simple remedy eases symptoms like irritation, itching, and sphincter muscle spasms.


Fill your bathtub with 12–13 inches (30.5–33.0 cm) of warm water and simply sit there for about 20 minutes. Follow the procedure after each bowel movement, and 2 or 3 times in addition to that. After the bath is over, simply pad the anal area dry with a soft towel.;
, Ice packs placed on the anal area for a couple of minutes will help soothe the pain and irritation, by reducing the blood flow. Apply ice packs to your anus 3-4 times a day. Application of cold will constrict the blood vessels and reduce the swelling. The dilated veins will also shrink facilitating return into the anus.


Do not rub the ice packs against your anus. Instead, hold it steady for about 5 minutes. Rubbing may cause injury and ulceration.

, Witch hazel is an astringent, meaning it will reduce inflammation and itching. Soak some baby wipes in witch hazel and wipe the affected area. Use the same motion as when using toilet paper. The remedy should be used after every bowel movement, until the symptoms disappear.You may also leave the pad on the area for 10 minutes or so and allow it to soak in. Then be sure to discard of the wipe.

, If the hemorrhoidal mass does not return into the anus spontaneously you can gently push it back with fingers. Apply some lubricant such as lignocaine jelly on your index finger and gently push the mass from its side., He or she will provide you with one of two options:



Hydrocortisone suppositories. Hydrocortisone is a steroid hormone, which helps you get rid of the anus or rectum swelling and itching associated with Piles. Use the medication following the doctor’s directions. Usually, hydrocortisone suppositories are administered 2 or 3 times per day, for 7 to 10 days.

Local anesthetics. Drugs like Pramoxine will relieve pain and itching. Apply the medication directly on the area after each bowel movement up to 4 times per day. The medication should not be used inside the rectum. Use the treatment for about 7 days.

, Continuous stress on the damaged area will only make the symptoms worse. Sit on a rubber cushion or a pillow, for more comfort. This will prevent the formation of new hemorrhoids and help reduce the size of the existing ones.


Avoid standing or sitting for prolonged periods. Prolonged standing or sitting will pull down the blood to lower parts of the body and increase venous pressure. Change your position regularly to avoid this.

, When talking about exercise helping you with your hemorrhoid problems, don’t think big. A simple 20-30 minute jog will stimulate a bowel movement, thus reducing additional pressure on the affected area.


However, avoid weightlifting or other strenuous exercises because they can aggravate the problem by increasing abdominal pressure.

, When you feel the need to defecate, do not wait, just go to the bathroom as soon as possible. Postponing a bowel movement can cause he fecal matter to back up inside the rectum, creating even more pressure to the affected area, increasing discomfort and inflammation.Avoid constipation. Each time you strain, the anal veins dilate a bit. If you can avoid constipation the veins will get adequate time to shrink and go back to a normal state. Drink plenty of water (2-3 liters daily). It will keep you hydrated and prevent constipation.

, A diet rich in fiber will soften your stool, making it easy to pass, thus reducing inflammation and preventing constipation. Fiber will also reduce bleeding and the size of the hemorrhoids. You need to introduce fiber in your diet at a slow rate, starting gradually, and increasing the amount up to 25-30 grams per day.Fiber is found in vegetables like beans, broccoli, oat bran and wheat, as well as fresh fruit.
You can also introduce food supplements to your diet, such as Citrucel or Metamucil. Use these supplements by mixing one or two tablespoons in a glass of water and drink it up to three times per day.

, The main vein (inferior vena cava) draining blood from lower parts of the body lies on the right side of the abdomen. Your uterus will compress it if you lie on your right side. Veins will be congested with blood aggravating the situation.

, It is important to prevent any kind of infection. An infected hemorrhoid easily gets thrombosed and leads to bleeding and unbearable pain. It is best to use pre-moistened wipes to clean the anal area after using the toilet.


Dry toilet papers are rough and rubbing with them may cause ulceration or bleeding.Do not use colored or perfumed wipes. Chemicals used in them are frequently irritant substances that may lead to itching and discomfort.

Monitor asthma monthly.,
Identify and avoid asthma triggers.,
Learn all you can about your condition.",How to Treat Asthma During Pregnancy1," Aside from pharmacological treatments, there are three major principles to maternal asthma control. These are regular, objective monitoring, identifying and avoiding asthma triggers, and patient education. Visit your doctor or specialist once per month for a routine monitoring.Each evaluation should include an explanation of recent symptoms, including symptom frequency, nocturnal asthma, interference with activities, exacerbations, and/or medication use.
Additionally, evaluations should assess lung auscultation and pulmonary function.
Your doctor may also perform an ultrasound to monitor fetal activity and growth.;
, If you have never been tested, a prick skin test or in vitro test (RAST or ELISA) may be performed to determine your sensitivity to certain allergens. If you smoke, you should quit right away. Also, avoid any place with tobacco smoke or other irritants.If you are already using immunotherapy to control allergies, it is safe to continue doing so during pregnancy.
However, it is not recommended to begin an immunotherapy regimen while pregnant.

, Patient education is the third strand of effective maternal asthma control. Studies show that patients with access to education about their condition(s) better understand the risks and treatments. Work to understand all that you can, every step of the way. If something doesn’t make sense to you, speak to your doctor (or doctors) and ask questions until you feel secure.For example, you might ask, “What is this exam testing for?”
You might ask, “How does this medication work?”
You might ask, “How can I avoid allergens in my home?”

Find out where to park and enter the hospital for delivery.,
See the triage room.,
Tour a birthing room.,
Look at the postpartum rooms.,
Prepare questions in advance.,
Assess the staff.,
Compare facilities.,
Talk about the facilities with your partner.",How to Tour a Hospital or Birthing Center During Pregnancy," It is recommended that you tour a hospital when you are between 32 and 36 weeks pregnant. This will help you familiarize yourself with the hospital environment a few weeks before delivery. Everything will be fresh in your mind.If you are traveling to the hospital from out of town or have not yet decided where you will give birth, you may want to consider visiting the facilities earlier in the pregnancy.;
, Call the hospital or check the hospital website to find out when hospital or birthing center tours are offered. Some hospitals only offer limited tour times. As a result, these can book up fast, so it is a good idea to plan this well in advance.Once you have found a time that works for you, register and reserve a spot on an upcoming tour.
Typically these tours are provided free of charge and they can take anywhere from thirty minutes to one hour.
You can also ask to see if the hospital will schedule a private tour., Some hospitals will provide virtual tours of the maternity ward, delivery rooms, and postpartum rooms. This is an excellent option if you live far away from the hospital or you are still deciding where you want to give birth.Virtual tours often consist of videos that show you where you should go on the day of delivery and explain what to expect.
If possible, you should try and schedule an in-person tour.

, One of the benefits of taking a tour is that you will get an opportunity to plan your route to the hospital or birthing center. On the day of delivery you may be stressed. The more prepared you are the less stressed you will be. Map out a route to the hospital and use your tour date as a practice run.Use the GPS function on your phone or vehicle to direct you to the hospital.
Program this address into your GPS so that you can easily access the directions on the day of the delivery.

, A hospital tour should provide you with a number of details regarding the delivery. This includes where to park and how to enter the hospital. For example, your baby may decide to come in the middle of the night and there may not be as many hospital staff available to help.Ask the tour facilitator ""where is the best place to park and what hospital entrance should we use?""

, During the tour, you should expect to see all of the rooms that you will be using during your stay. Typically, when you first arrive at the hospital you will be assessed and evaluated in a triage room before being admitted to the delivery rooms.A nurse will monitor your labour signs and notify the doctor when delivery is imminent.

, This is the area where you will give birth. You may want to ask how many people are allowed in the birthing room with you and if pictures and videos are allowed during the delivery process.

For example you could ask ""Can we film the birth of our child?"" or ""Can my mom and partner accompany me during delivery?""
In some instances, you may not be able to enter the birthing room during a tour if it is already occupied.

, Next, you will be toured through the postpartum rooms. This is where you and the baby will stay after delivery. If the hospital offers private and semi-private rooms, you should ask to see both rooms. For example, you could say: ""Do you offer private postpartum rooms?"" and ""Would we be able to tour them as well?""Some insurance companies will cover private rooms. Check to see if you are eligible to stay in a private room.

, You may find that you are overwhelmed on the day of the tour. You will be learning lots of information about your deliver and as a result you may forget to ask a few important questions. Write a list of questions in advance. This way you can quickly refer to the list to make sure everything you need to know has been answered. Consider asking the following questions:What birthing aids are available?
What pain management is available?
Can a family member stay overnight with me?
Will the baby stay in my room?
Will breastfeeding classes and resources be offered?
What are the visiting hours?

, A hospital or delivery room tour will give you an opportunity to meet some of the staff prior to your delivery. Assess whether or not the staff are friendly and welcoming. You want to feel comfortable, cared for, and supported throughout your stay.For example, notice how the doctors and nurses interact with you while on the tour. Do they seem enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and friendly?

, If you visited a number of different hospitals and birthing centers, you should make notes on each one. Then, assess the pros and cons and make a decision that fits the needs of your family.For example, would your family prioritize location over length of visiting hours? In that case you may choose the closest hospital, even though they have limited visiting hours.
Alternatively, you may really want a private room and choose a hospital solely based on the facilities.

, Once you have toured the hospital or birthing center, you should talk with your partner about the facilities. Discuss the aspects you liked and didn't like. For example, you may have liked the postpartum rooms and visiting hours at one hospital, but the staff at another hospital. Decide together which facility best meets your needs."

Know that if you are 35 years old or older, your chance of developing this condition increases.,
Be aware that having a multiple pregnancy can affect your chances of developing diastasis recti.,
Understand that if your baby weighs more than other babies, it could lead to this condition.,
Know that having repeated pregnancies can result in this condition.,
Understand that while you cannot necessarily prevent this condition entirely, you can lower your chances of developing it.,
Avoid activities where you apply pressure to your abdomen.,
Try to maintain a normal posture.,
Try to avoid conceiving right after you give birth.",How to Test for Diastasis Recti During Pregnancy1," As you get older, your muscles and tissues get weaker. Because of this, if you are pregnant and older than 35 years old, there is a chance you will develop this condition., If you are having twins or triplets, or more, your uterus will be larger. This will cause more pressure to be placed on your abdomen, which can stretch the rectus abdominis out, leading to the separation of the two sides., In addition, previous pregnancies in which the baby had a higher weight than normal could have caused a larger amount of pressure to be placed on your abdomen, which could lead to this condition if you get pregnant again.

, After your first pregnancy, your muscles will be a bit weaker from having the pressure of your uterus placed on them.This can lead to an increased possibility that your abdomen will separate when you get pregnant again.

, If you follow the rules listed in the following steps, your chances of developing this condition should decrease.

, For example, you must not lift any heavy objects or jump—these activities can lead to an increased parietal pressure and, therefore, can stretch your abdominal muscles and lead to their separation.


If you are more than 12 weeks pregnant, following this rule is an absolute must.

, There is a pathological posture called swayback that predisposes pregnant women to diastasis. Maintaining this posture (the pelvis is leaned more forward than usual and the vertebral canal more backwards)will lead to weaker lower abdominal muscles, thus increasing the chance of diastasis.


Instead, stand up as straight as you can.

, By waiting, you can let the body recover from the previous pregnancy, giving the abdominal muscles time to recover.

Discuss pharmacologic therapy with your health care provider.,
Follow a “step-wise approach.” A “step-wise approach” to pharmacologic therapy means that the dose, frequency, and number of medications a patient is given will increase as necessary and decrease when possible.,
Maintain asthma control carefully.",How to Treat Asthma During Pregnancy2," It is considered safer for pregnant asthmatic women to be treated with asthma medications than to experience asthma symptoms without treatment. The specific type and strength of medication will vary from person to person, and must be determined with your healthcare provider(s).Medications are divided into two categories:


Long-term-control medications – These daily medications suppress and control inflammation
Quick relief medications – These “as needed” medications treat acute symptoms and exacerbations.
Often asthma patients are prescribed both types.

, This approach requires ongoing monitoring and communication with your doctor., When you have achieved asthma control, and sustained this for several months, your doctor may encourage you to step down to less intensive therapy. In pregnant patients, this step down should be taken slower and with extra caution. In some cases, your doctor may choose to postpone this step until after your baby is born."

Learn about the goals of “asthma control.” The goal of asthma treatment is to control a patient’s asthma for maternal health and normal fetal maturation.,
Integrate asthma care and obstetrics care.,
Consult a specialist.,
Work with your doctor to create a plan.",How to Treat Asthma During Pregnancy3," Effective asthma control can significantly lower the risks associated with maternal asthma.Effective asthma control means:


Minimal (to no) asthma symptoms during the day and night
Minimal (to no) exacerbations
No missed school or work
No limitations to activity
Maintenance of near-normal pulmonary function
Minimal use of short-acting inhaler
Minimal (or no) adverse effects from medication

, In order for you to achieve asthma control, it is essential for your obstetrician to be involved, and for all of your doctors to be in communication with one another. This allows for a comprehensive treatment plan.Your obstetrician should track your asthma symptoms at every check-up. They should monitor:


Day and nighttime symptoms
Peak flow measures and/or spirometry readings
Medication usage

, If allergy or irritants play a role in the your asthma, if there are other complications, or if the your asthma is especially severe, it may be best to consult with an asthma specialist. Just as before, it is very important for all of your health care providers to be in communication with one another and to work as a team., In order to keep your asthma under control, you must work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan. Together, you can determine the signals for being in “the green zone” (doing well), “the yellow zone” (caution), and “the red zone” (get help now!), as well as what measures to take if you need relief in each zone.You can print out a sample action plan at http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/asthma/asthma-action-plan.pdf and bring this with you when you visit your doctor.
When you are pregnant, it is very important to make tracking fetal activity a part of your plan. If you feel decreased activity or movement, contact your doctor.
It is a great idea to post this action plan in your home and/or provide a copy to anyone who may be around when you experience an asthma attack.

Deliver the news by literally putting a bun in the oven.,
Give him your pregnancy test as a gift.,
Surprise him with Daddy gear.,
Deliver the news by parking in a maternity parking spot.",How to Tell Your Husband That You Are Pregnant1," When your husband steps out of the house, place a hamburger, hot dog, or just an ordinary bun in the oven. Whatever you use, make sure anyone can see that it's a bun.


When your husband gets home, tell him that the oven is making a funny noise or that you can't get it to work.
He'll open the oven and will be initially confused by the bun there.
Stand near him and wait for him to understand that you have a bun in the oven too!;
, Wrap up the gift and put a big bow on it. Even if there's no occasion for it, sit your husband down, and make sure you have all of his attention.


Say, ""There's something I've been meaning to give you. Actually, it's already yours.""
When he sees the pregnancy test, he'll know what it means!

, Giving your husband anything with ""Daddy"" on it will get the point across loud and clear. It can be a lot of fun to give him a small gift that lets him know he will be a father, even if it takes a minute to figure out what you mean. Here are some things you can do:


If he's cooking or grilling, you can buy a ""Daddy"" apron and tie it around him. See how long it takes for him to look down and see what it says.
Get a ""#1 Dad"" mug and serve his morning coffee in it. See how long it takes for him to notice the writing.
Just get him a T-shirt that says ""Proud Daddy."" If you really want to be playful, you can ask him to fold your laundry or hang out while you fold your laundry and wait for him to notice the new shirt at the top of the pile.
You can also give him a baby shirt or jumper that says ""I love my Daddy."" He may be confused for a second but will know exactly what it means.
If you normally hang up your laundry to dry, hang up some baby clothes in a prominent place and wait for him to ask what's going on.
Buy a pair of baby shoes and give him the box. Tell him that you got him the most perfect shoes and wait for him to open it.
You can also buy a pair of baby shoes and place them near your normal shoes and wait for him to notice them.

, This will only work if there are grocery or convenience stores in your neighborhood that have spots especially designed for expecting mothers. Once you've found the spot, it's time to get to work.


Ask your husband to take a quick trip to the grocery store with you.
Make sure you grab the keys and get in the driver's seat. If you almost always let him drive and he questions what you're doing, just say, ""I just feel like driving.""
Drive to the location and ease into the parking spot.
Get out of the car like what you're doing is perfectly natural (after all, it is!).
Wait for him to stop you and say, ""Honey, you can't park there.""
Give him a big grin and say, ""Oh, yes I can!""

Discuss the procedure with your doctor.,
Address the use of anesthesia with your doctor.,
Do additional treatments after surgery.,
Conduct your own research on BCS.",How to Treat Breast Cancer During Pregnancy1," Once you are diagnosed with breast cancer while pregnant, treatment will depend on the size of the tumor, where it is located, the stage of the cancer, and how far along your pregnancy is. Your doctor may recommend breast-conserving surgery (BCS) if your cancer is in the early stages or if it is at risk of spreading to other parts of your body. Surgery is often the first choice for breast cancer treatment during pregnancy as it is the safest option for your health and that of your unborn baby.For example, you may ask your doctor, ""Would BCS be right for me and my stage of cancer?"" ""What will be involved in the procedure?"" ""What are the risks, if any, of the procedure?""
Your doctor will tell you where the surgery will be done on your breast or breasts, depending on where the tumor is located. Often, the surgery is done in the breast and near your lymph nodes to remove any cancerous cells.
Your doctor may also suggest removing your entire breast, known as a mastectomy, if the cancer is at risk of spreading to other parts of your body. This may a good option as you will not need to undergo radiation therapy after a mastectomy.;
, If you decide to do BCS, you will need to be put under with anesthesia, which are drugs that will make you sleep during the surgery. Using anesthesia can be risky for your unborn baby, so you and your doctor should talk about this aspect of the surgery beforehand. Meet with your obstetrician, a surgeon, and an anesthesiologist to determine the best time to do the surgery so the fetus is not at risk.For example, you may say to your doctor, ""What risks does anesthesia pose to me and my unborn baby?"" ""Is it safe for me to go under anesthesia during the procedure?""
Often, having the surgery earlier in your pregnancy is safer than doing it later on in your pregnancy.
Your obstetrician may also be on call or present during the surgery in the event there are issues with the baby.

, Once the BCS is done, you will need to follow a recovery plan to ensure you heal properly after the surgery. Depending on the stage of your breast cancer, you may also need more treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation, or hormone therapy. This type of treatment is called adjuvant treatment. Doing adjuvant treatment after surgery will help to lower the risk of the cancer returning.In some cases, you can delay adjuvant treatment until after you have your baby. Speak to your doctor about this option.

, Do your own research to determine if breast-conserving surgery is right for your stage of breast cancer. Speak to several different doctors and specialists so you are well informed. Read information online from trusted medical sources so you are well aware of the risks of the procedure and are sure it is right for you and your baby.


Set up consultations with several different doctors and cancer specialists to discuss BCS as well as any other treatment options you may have. Getting several medical opinions could help you determine if BCS is safe and right for you.

Take a look at your abdomen.,
Set up an appointment with your doctor.,
Know that your doctor will double check that you are not experiencing another condition.,
Understand that diastasis recti can lead to other conditions.",How to Test for Diastasis Recti During Pregnancy2," If you have a vertical prominent piece of tissue (like a crest or a ridge) which begins just below your sternum (which is the breastbone) and continues, in most cases, until the umbilicus, this might be the first sign of this condition.


If this ridge is more visible when you are stretching your abdominal muscles than it is very probable that you have diastasis recti.
When your abdomen is relaxed, and your muscles are not contracted, you may not see any signs of this condition.

, If you see the previously mentioned ridge, it is important to go see your doctor so that he or she can confirm the diagnosis.

, Your doctor will check to make sure that you are not actually experiencing umbilical hernias or epigastric hernias, which can cause a similar formation to occur.


The difference, however, is that these two conditions will form a round structure or structures in the abdomen, while diastasis recti creates a straighter line.
These hernias also often create pain, while diastasis recti symptoms generally do not include pain.

, Another reason that your doctor may check for hernias is because diastasis recti can actually lead to the development of umbilical or epigastric hernias."

Understand that this is a self-limiting condition.,
Set up an appointment with a physical therapist.,
Practice kegel exercises.,
Talk to your doctor about surgical realignment.",How to Test for Diastasis Recti During Pregnancy3," This condition does not endanger your life, and will resolve itself on its own in most situations. However, it may take up to a year to resolve completely, so there are some exercises you can do to help speed up the recovery process.

, Usually, the treatment for this condition when it occurs in adults is physiotherapy. It is important to see a professional because exercises that are done incorrectly could actually lead to a worsening of the condition.


One of the suggested exercises is listed below.

, These exercises help strengthen pelvic floor muscles and deep abdominal muscles, which can help to resolve this condition. You can start these exercises during pregnancy and continue them after the birth, unless stated otherwise by your physician. These exercises are basically contractions and relaxations of your pelvic muscles.


First of all, you need to identify the right muscles; in order to do this you need to stop urination in midstream. The muscles that you use to do this are the muscles you must relax and contract during these exercises. After this task is complete, you need to completely empty your bladder and stay on your back, relaxed. Try to contract and relax these muscles, holding each contraction and relaxation for give seconds. Repeat this process five times a day.
Once you feel comfortable with this duration of time, you can relax and contract for 10 seconds each; do these exercises three times a day.

, Some doctors believe that surgical realignment is the best way to speed up the recovery process. Others believe that surgery should only be done as a last resort if the condition does not clear up by itself over the course of a year or two, or when the diastasis recti is extremely severe.


The operation that would be performed, should you choose to have it done, is called abdominoplasty (this is also called a tummy tuck). During the surgery, your muscles will be realigned and your skin will be elevated from the pubic region to your breast bone."

See your doctor while you're pregnant.,
Get the first trimester combined test.,

Consider the cell-free fetal DNA analysis.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Get an amniocentesis done.,
Consider chorionic villus sampling (CVS).,
Be very cautious with cordocentesis.,
Diagnose your newborn.",How to Test for Down Syndrome," Your doctor or pediatrician can tell you if your child has Down syndrome once they are born, but if you want to know beforehand, ask about the various types of screening tests. Prenatal screening tests can show if there is an increased likelihood your unborn baby has Down syndrome, but they are not a perfect estimate.If a prenatal screening test shows an increased likelihood your baby has Down syndrome, then your doctor will recommend a diagnostic test to be more certain.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all women (regardless of age) get screening tests for Down syndrome.
There are different screening tests related to how far along you are in your pregnancy and include: the first trimester combined test, the integrated screening test and the cell-free fetal DNA analysis.;
, The first trimester combined test is done within the first 3 months of pregnancy and involves two steps: a blood test and an ultrasound exam.The blood test measures levels of PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A) and HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) hormone being produced in your body. (HCG). In addition, a painless ultrasound exam is used on your abdomen to measure an area on the back of the fetus's neck called the nuchal translucency.


Abnormal levels of PAPP-A and HCG typically indicate something unusual with your baby, but not necessarily Down syndrome.
The nuchal translucency screening test measures the amount of fluid that's collected there. Abnormally high amounts of fluid usually indicates a genetic disability, but not just Down syndrome.
Your doctor will consider your age (older equals higher risk), the results of the blood test, and the ultrasound images to decide if it's likely your fetus has Down syndrome.
Just keep in mind that these types of tests are not done in every instance of pregnancy. However, if you are over 35, then you are at higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome and your doctor may recommend testing.

, The integrated screening test is done during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (within the first 6 months) and consists of 2 parts: a combined blood / ultrasound screening done in the first trimester looking at PAPP-A levels and nuchal translucency (as described above) and a more thorough blood test looking at pregnancy-related hormones and other substances.The second trimester blood test, called the ""quad screen"", measures levels of HCG, alpha fetoprotein, estriol and inhibin A in your body. Abnormal levels indicate a developmental or genetic problem in your baby.
This test is essentially a follow-up to the first trimester combined test, as it adds a second trimester comparison blood test.
If you're carrying a baby with Down syndrome, you'll have higher levels of HCG and inhibin A, but lower levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and estriol.
The integrated screening test is as reliable as the first trimester combined test in estimating the likelihood of Down syndrome, but it has fewer false-positives — less women are told incorrectly they're carrying a Down syndrome child.

, The cell-free fetal DNA test checks for your baby's (fetal) DNA material that's circulating in your blood.A blood sample is taken and the genetic material is analyzed for abnormalities. This test is usually recommended if you're at high risk for Down syndrome (older than 40 years) and/or have an abnormal result in another type of screening test.


For this screening test, your blood can be analyzed during pregnancy after about 10 weeks.
The cell-free fetal DNA analysis is much more specific than other screening tests for Down syndrome. A positive result means there's a 98.6% chance that your baby has Down syndrome, whereas a ""negative"" result means there's a 99.8% chance your baby doesn't.If this DNA screening test is positive, then your doctor will recommend a more invasive diagnostic test to confirm Down syndrome (see below).

, If your doctor recommends a diagnostic test, it means they think you're at high risk for Down syndrome based on the results of screening test(s) combined with your age. However, although a prenatal diagnostic test can determine the presence of Down syndrome with certainty, they carry a higher risk to your health and that of your baby's because they are more invasive.As such, consult with your doctor about the pros and cons of such testing.


Invasive testing means that a needle or similar implement must be inserted into your abdomen and uterus to take a sample of fluid or tissue in order to analyze it.
Diagnostic tests that can positively identify Down syndrome in pregnant women include: amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and cordocentesis. However, keep in mind that these procedures do not come without risks. There is a risk of bleeding, infection, and harm to the fetus.

, An amniocentesis involves collecting a sample of amniotic fluid that surrounds your growing baby. A long needle is inserted into your uterus (through your lower abdomen) in order to withdraw fluid that contains some cells from your baby.The chromosomes of the cells are then analyzed, looking for trisomy 21 or other genetic disabilities.


An amniocentesis is usually performed during the second trimester, between weeks 14 to 22 of pregnancy.The main risk of amniocentesis is a miscarriage and death of the baby, which increases if it's done before 15 weeks.
The risk of a spontaneous termination (miscarriage) from amniocentesis is estimated at 1%.Amniocentesis can also distinguish between the slightly different forms of Down syndrome: regular trisomy 21, translocation Down syndrome and mosaic Down syndrome.

, In a CVS procedure, cells are taken from a part of the placenta (which surrounds your baby within your uterus) called the chorionic villus and used to analyze the chromosomes for an abnormal number.This test also requires inserting a large needle into your abdomen / uterus. CVS is usually performed in the first trimester, between 9 to 11 weeks of pregnancy, although after the 10th week is considered less risky. This test be done sooner than amniocentesis, which is important if you plan to abort the baby if it has Down syndrome.


A CVS carries a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than a second trimester amniocentesis — perhaps slightly more than a 1% chance of miscarriage.
A CVS can also distinguish between the slightly different genetic forms of Down syndrome.

, With cordocentesis, also called percutaneous umbilical blood sampling or PUBS, fetal blood is taken from a vein in the umbilical cord through the uterus with a long needle and examined for genetic mutations (extra chromosomes).This diagnostic test is performed later in the second trimester, between 18 to 22 weeks of gestation.


A cordocentesis is the most accurate diagnostic method for Down syndrome and can confirm the results from an amniocentesis or CVS procedure.PUBS carries a much greater risk of miscarriage than amniocentesis or CVS, so your doctor should only recommend it if results from other diagnostic tests are unclear.

, If you didn't get any prenatal screening or diagnostic tests done prior to giving birth, then the initial diagnosis of Down syndrome is typically based on your baby's appearance.However, some babies may have the general appearance of Down syndrome, but not have the condition, so your doctor can order a test called chromosomal karyotyping.


A chromosomal karyotype requires a sample of your baby's blood to analyze for an extra 21st chromosome, which can be present in all or some cells.
A significant reason for early screening and diagnostic tests is to give parents options before birthing, including terminating the pregnancy.
If you believe you will be unable to care for your newborn with Down syndrome, ask your doctor about adoption options.

Deliver the news in a memorable place.,
Write him a love poem that tells him you're pregnant.,
Tell him in a romantic restaurant.",How to Tell Your Husband That You Are Pregnant2," Find a place that is meaningful to both of you. Tell him to accompany you there in the evening, and say that you should both dress up, even if the place isn't particularly fancy. Here's what you should do once you get there:


Hold his hands and look into his eyes.
Tell him why you love the special place you brought him to, whether it's where you had your first date, where you fell in love, or where you shared your first kiss. Tell him that you can't wait to share so many more memories with him.
Say, ""We're pregnant.""

, If you're the romantic type and are known for writing loving letters and poems, then writing a poem that tells your husband you're pregnant won't be a stretch. Here's how you can deliver the poem:


Have a romantic evening in or even go out to your favorite dimly-lit restaurant. Then share your message with him.
Give him the poem and say, ""There's something I want you to read.""
Wait for his eyes to fill with tears as he reacts.

, Find the most romantic restaurant in town, and give him the news there. After you've had some time to relax and have a great conversation, you can deliver the big news. Here's how you can do it:


Talk to the restaurant in advance to ask to have a slice of cake with ""congratulations"" written on it. When he asks you why he's being congratulated, you can look confused and wait for him to figure it out.
Give him a romantic card that tells him how you feel. Have him flip it over to the back, where you've written the big news.

Plan what you'll say.,
Anticipate his reaction.,
Pick a date and time to have the talk.,
Tell him the news.,
Take the time to listen.,
Discuss what you'll do next.",How to Tell Your Husband That You Are Pregnant3," If you're not sure how your husband will feel about your pregnancy and it's completely unexpected, then you shouldn't plan any fun or clever surprises to let him in on the secret. Instead, you should approach the situation as honestly as you can, and make sure that the communication goes as smoothly as possible.


Practice maintaining a steady and even tone when you deliver the news. Make eye contact and hold his hand when you tell him.
Plan on telling him your feelings. You may have mixed feelings about the pregnancy too. Whatever you feel, this is something you will be able to work out together.

, You should know your own husband well enough to anticipate how he would react to the news of your pregnancy. If you're married, you must have talked about having children at some point, so you should remember anything he has said about the topic to gauge his reaction. Has he said that he'd love to have kids one day, or has he made it clear that he has no interest in having children? Knowing his perspective on children will help you see how he'll react.


Think of other times when you've told him unexpected or overwhelming news. Though it's unlikely that you ever told him anything as important as the fact that you're pregnant, remembering his reaction can give you some insight. Did he take the news calmly, was he emotional, or was he very upset?
If he has a history of violent behavior and you think the news may make him react violently, then don't tell him alone. Make sure you're with a friend or family member when you give him the news.

, Though you should have the conversation as soon as possible, picking an ideal date and time to have the talk can help the conversation go more smoothly. Pick a time that works well for both of you, and when you know he won't have anything stressful to do afterwards so he can let the news sink in. Here are some good ways to pick the time to have the talk:


Find a time that is relatively stress-free for both of you, when you can give each other your undivided attention.
Don't be too dramatic when you ask him about a good time to have the talk. Just say there's something you've wanted to talk to him about. If you're too dramatic, he may want to have the talk right then and there and you may not be prepared for it.
Don't tell him right after he gets home from work. Wait until he has some time to relax after dinner.

, Once you have your husband's undivided attention, there is no use delaying it. You have to open up. You can make him feel more comfortable with a reassuring pat or by holding his hand, but don't take too long to cut to the chase.


Say, ""I just found out some big news. I'm pregnant.""
Wait for the news to sink in. If he's emotional and leans toward you, give him a hug. If he's sitting in stony silence, be patient and don't overwhelm him.
If he wants to communicate but he's at a loss for words, tell him more about your feelings toward the pregnancy.
If he's receptive, ask him to share his feelings.

, Once he gets his bearings, he will have a lot to say. You have said your part and now it's time for you to listen. Don't interrupt him or get angry with him. After all, he has just received some life-changing news.


Try to remain calm even if he is heated or emotional. Remember that you have had more time to digest the news than he did.

, Once you've both shared your feelings, you should talk about what you will do about your pregnancy. You might need a breather before you jump right into a heated discussion about what to do with the baby, but don't delay the conversation for too long.


Before you make a decision, make sure that you are both completely sure.
You have done your best to communicate with your husband, and now you can work on finding a way to make your pregnancy work.

Lean on family and friends for support.",How to Treat Breast Cancer During Pregnancy2," Chemotherapy is often recommended for pregnant women who are in their second or third trimester. It is also good option if you have more advanced stages of cancer while pregnant. Chemotherapy can be given via intravenous and will be a mixture of several cancer fighting drugs.Your doctor may also recommend chemotherapy if your have had breast-conserving surgery and they want to be sure your cancer does not return. You can get chemo in your third trimester or after you have given birth without putting your baby at risk.

, When you tell your boyfriend about your pregnancy, you can take the opportunity to discuss the state of your relationship. Have an open and honest conversation about your goals and plans. Try to figure out how you fit in one another's lives.This is a great time to decide if you are ready to make a long-term commitment. If you decide to have the baby, you should talk about how involved each of you will be in raising the child.
Maybe you have realized that this relationship is not what you want. Let your boyfriend know that you would still like to have his emotional support.
Take some time to think about logistics. Who will pay for medical procedures? Will your boyfriend go with you to doctor's appointments? These are all important things to consider.

, It is a good idea to visit a doctor. First, she can officially confirm your pregnancy. She can also give you objective information about each of your options.Ask your boyfriend to go with you to the appointment. If you want him to be involved in the decision making process, allow him to participate in the conversation.
Prepare for your appointment. Make a list of questions to take with you.
Your questions can include things such as ""Do I need to take prenatal vitamins?"" and ""How long do I have before I need to make a final decision?""
Talk to your boyfriend after the appointment. Take some time to discuss how you each feel about the information you learned.

Be prepared for your second labor to be potentially faster than your first.,
Get into a position that will reduce your chances of getting an episiotomy.",How to Tell if You Are in Labor with a Second Pregnancy," Usually, most women recognize that labor is starting when they feel that their “water broke”. This is when the amniotic membranes rupture spontaneously. This event triggers the start of uterine contractions.;
, Keep track of the frequency of your contractions. Initially, you may experience them every 10 to 15 minutes, but over time this will reduce to ever 2 to 3 minutes.


Uterine contractions have been described as “cramping” , “ tightness in the abdomen” , “discomfort”, and a varying degree of pain, from mild to extreme.
Uterine contractions in labor are measured by CTG (cardiotocography), with a device placed over the abdomen. This measures both uterine contractions and the fetal heart rate.

, An important distinction must be made between true contractions, and so-called “false”, or Braxton-Hicks contractions, which occur only a few times during the day, without any increase in intensity or frequency. They usually appear within the first 26 weeks of pregnancy, but they can also appear later on.


It is common for women to experience ""false"" contractions in the advanced pregnancy period, however these contractions can suddenly turn into labor contractions during the second pregnancy.Therefore, when you are becoming a mom for the second time, do not take your Braxton-Hicks contractions lightly. It could be a sign of the actual labor.

, When you see that you have lost the mucus plug, you can expect that you’ll be in labor within a short span of time, usually within a few hours or a day or two.


There will be small blood stains when you lose the mucus plug. During a second pregnancy, women tend to lose their mucus plug much earlier compared to the first pregnancy. The reason for this is that after the first pregnancy the muscles comprising the cervix are naturally looser than before and with all the rapid and frequent contractions, the cervix starts eroding at a faster rate than it did previously.

, You might see that your belly has drooped downwards and you can now breathe with ease. This is because the baby is descending into the pelvis, preparing for delivery.


Also, you might feel the urgency to use the bathroom every 10-15 minutes. This is a clear indication that your baby is moving into the correct position to find her way out into the world.

, It has been reported that many women feel as if their baby has become “lighter”. This is due to the fact that the head of the fetus has descended into the pelvis, to prepare for its delivery.


In addition to this subjective feeling, urination may become much more frequent, due to the increased pressure on the bladder by the fetus.

, The cervix undergoes structural and functional changes when the above-mentioned events occur. When labor starts, the cervix gradually dilates to allow for the expulsion of the fetus.


In the beginning, the cervix is usually only dilated by a few centimeters. When it reaches 10 centimeters (3.9 in), this usually means that you are ready to give birth.

, The occurrence of cervical dilatation without uterine contractions may suggest cervical insufficiency.This is when cervical shortening, funneling, and/or cervical dilatation occurs during the second trimester of pregnancy. This conditions needs to be promptly evaluated by a medical professional, as it could negatively affect the normal development of the fetus and even lead to miscarriage.


Cervical insufficiency is one of the most common causes of miscarriage and preterm birth during the second trimester. Hence, diagnosing cervical insufficiency early is very important. It can be diagnosed during routine check-ups by the physician who is monitoring the pregnancy, upon inspection and physical examination.
Patients with cervical insufficiency complain of mild cramping in the lower abdomen or vagina, and together with patient history can point to this diagnosis.
Risk factors for developing cervical insufficiency include infection, history of cervical surgery and trauma and cervical injury during previous births.

, If you wish to find out for certain whether you are in true labor or not, there are some advanced diagnostic procedures that you can opt for such as FFN or Fetal Fibro Nectin Test.


This test won’t be able to tell you if you are currently in labor, but it will definitely confirm if you are not. This test is useful because when you are in your initial stages of preterm labor, telling labor can be very difficult using symptoms or pelvic examinations alone.
A negative FFN Report will relax you and reassure you that you won’t deliver your baby for at least another week or two.

, The nurse or midwife will be able to feel how much you have dilated by examining your cervix. In most cases, when your midwife finds that your cervix has dilated to between 1 to 3 centimeters (0.4 to 1.2 in), she will inform you that you are in the first stage of labor.


When she feels that your cervix has opened up to an extent ranging between 4 to 7 centimeters (1.6 to 2.8 in), she will probably tell you that you have entered your active or second labor stage.
When she feels that your cervix dilation is ranging to between 8 to 10 centimeters (3.1 to 3.9 in), she will definitely tell you that it’s time for the baby to come out!

, Your midwife also has experience in understanding whether your baby is pointing downwards and whether its head is engaged in the pelvis.


The midwife may get down on her knees and feel your lower belly, above your bladder or insert her fingers around your groins to feel the baby’s head and assess what percentage has been engaged.
These examinations will help to confirm the fact that you are in labor and even tell you what stage of labor you're at.

, You’ll notice certain differences between your first pregnancy and your second pregnancy which might raise many queries in your mind.


At the time of your first pregnancy, your baby’s head becomes engaged in your pelvis more quickly when compared to your second pregnancy.
In the case of second pregnancies, the head might not become engaged until your labor starts.

, Second labors tend to proceed more quickly and last for a shorter amount of time when compared to the first.


This is because the cervix muscles are thicker and take more time to dilate when you are in your first labor, but in the subsequent delivery the cervix dilates faster. In a second labor, the vaginal muscles and the muscles of the pelvic floor are already stretched by the previous birth and have become laxer.
This helps to make your second baby arrive more quickly and to make the advanced labor stages less difficult for you.

, If you have had an episiotomy or tear during your first delivery and are still traumatized by the experience, the best tip to escape it during your second baby is to get into an upright posture and push while you are in the labor’s second stage.


When you take an upright posture, you are actually using Newton’s simple scientific theory of gravity, the force which pulls your baby out into this world without any cuts or tears on your body!
However, this is not a fool-proof way of avoiding episiotomy. Some women still needs an episiotomy despite taking these measures.

Listen when she discusses her eating habits.,
Look for signs of nausea.,
Pay attention to complaints about pain or discomfort.,
Keep an eye on her behavior.,
Take note when she discusses her sleep patterns.,
Ask about her plans for the future.",How to Tell if Someone is Pregnant1," Early on in a pregnancy, many women begin wearing baggy clothes or clothing that looks like it could hide a ""bump."" As their belly grows, many women also need to buy maternity pants or clothing in a larger size. If you notice that she is wearing unusual clothing for her normal style or she is shopping for outfits in larger sizes, it could be because she is expecting., Many pregnant women experience changes in appetite as well as changes in the types of foods they want to eat. Because of this, paying attention to her complaints or comments about food can help determine if she's pregnant:Cravings: Not all pregnant women experience this, but some women find that they want to eat strange combinations of food (like pickles and ice cream) or that they only want to eat one type of food (like citrus foods or Chinese food). Pay attention when she talks about what she feels like eating!
Food aversions: Many pregnant women experience the sudden onset of food issues with a particular type of food they never had a problem with before. If you know she loves sushi and suddenly even the thought of fish turns her stomach, she might be pregnant.
Hydration: Staying hydrated is essential to delivering vital nutrients to a fetus, so many pregnant women are careful to ensure they drink enough water. A pregnant woman may show a sudden preoccupation with making sure she is hydrated and/or start carrying around a water bottle.

, Along with changing eating habits, many pregnant women experience nausea called “morning sickness” in the early months of pregnancy. This could be the cause of some alterations in her diet, like if she’s eating just crackers, but it can also happen unrelated to eating. Many women feel sick throughout the day and not just in the morning as the name suggests, so be sure to pay attention to any signs of nausea or vomiting. To help you distinguish this symptom from regular indigestion or the flu, morning sickness will be intense and last longer than the typical flu period of only a few days., Pregnancy causes all sorts of changes, and this leads to soreness and aching throughout the body. If you hear her suddenly talking about lower back pain and headaches or dizziness, it could be associated with pregnancy.When she comments on any pain or soreness, try following up by asking how they hurt themselves or if they are active in any sports and see what they say. For example:


“Oh no! How long has your back been hurting?”
“I heard you say earlier that you’ve been feeling lightheaded lately, have you been getting dizzy like that for a while?”

, In addition to physical changes, many pregnant women also exhibit changes in behavior or routine. Try observing the person you think may be pregnant and see if you notice any of the following behaviors:


Using the bathroom more frequently than usual can indicate pregnancy. This is because changes in hormones and the pressure of the growing fetus on other organs can cause constipation, increased urination, and vomiting.Mood swings are common in pregnant women because fluctuating levels of hormones can cause fatigue and spikes in a variety of emotions (like being really happy one moment and then crying uncontrollably for seemingly no reason)., Being exhausted is an extremely common complaint in pregnant women, especially in the first trimester. If you observe any of the following, it could be because she is pregnant:She is noticeably too tired to keep up with everyday activities.
She talks a lot about being exhausted or feeling “completely wiped out.”
You find her napping often or at odd times (like when she is on the job or at school).

, A subtle way of determining whether or not a woman is pregnant is to ask her about any upcoming plans. Because a typical pregnancy lasts nine months, asking about plans that would fall around that time period can help you figure out if she is pregnant now. If she is pregnant, she will be too far along in the third trimester to travel, so try asking if she’d be interested in a trip in a couple of months. You could also ask her if she has any plans for the summer, and see if she lets it slip that she will be decorating a nursery!

Changes in the appearance of discharge occur because your vagina is responsible for a number of different functions. This includes cleaning itself, staying moist, and fighting off potential infections., Clear, sticky discharge is common and completely normal. It indicates that you’re currently in the ovulation stage of your menstrual cycle. This means that you have a higher chance of getting pregnant during this period., Check for this just before and after your period. Thick, creamy, and white-colored discharge is also completely normal. When it dries on the lining of your underwear, it can appear slightly yellowish in color., Normal monthly hormonal fluctuations during your menstrual cycle can trigger clear and watery discharge. You might experience a large amount after exercising. Don’t worry if you see this in your underwear., This is a result of your uterus shedding old blood and tissue. Although the color may look worrying, it should return to a normal white or clear color after a few days., Normal vaginal discharge should have little to no smell. However, you shouldn’t worry if you have a slight odor, especially after you’ve been sweating. If you haven’t been having periods long, get used to your normal odor before you hit the panic button., Check the diameter of the stain on your underwear. If it’s about the width of a quarter, 2-pence, or 2 € coin, it’s normal. The actual amount will vary depending on the stage of your menstrual cycle and the level of hormones your body is releasing. Expect this to happen everyday.Don’t panic if you notice more discharge during or after sexual arousal. This is your body’s way of preparing itself for penetration. It’s perfectly normal., That’s right. Women can ejaculate, too! When stimulated properly, your vagina can release a small amount of milky white discharge during orgasm. This is perfectly normal and usually indicates a very pleasurable experience.

Your vagina or urethra might also “squirt” a clear, watery fluid during orgasm. This is also perfectly normal, and all women can experience it. This kind of discharge is chemically similar to urine, but it’s not the same thing., The color, texture, and amount of your discharge will change over the course of your life. Any fluctuation in your hormone levels can trigger these changes. This includes puberty, pregnancy, childbirth, your sexual peak, menopause, and fluctuations caused by hormonal contraception., Look for foul odor, odd color, unusual thickness, or sudden changes in the quantity of your discharge. These are signs that you could have an infection. However, only a qualified doctor or nurse practitioner can give you a proper diagnosis and treatment plan., Cloudy, yellow discharge looks like nasal mucous from a cold. It may indicate that you have gonorrhea, especially if you experience burning during urination.If you’re not sexually active, it could be bacterial vaginosis (BV), especially if it’s accompanied by itching, burning, or a foul odor., If you’re not currently menstruating or taking hormonal contraception, bloody or brown discharge is usually abnormal. If you have brown discharge accompanied by pelvic pain, you could have endometriosis or a damaged reproductive organ. A number of other issues like menopause and (in rare cases) cervical cancer can also cause brown discharge.Brown spotting may also be an early sign of pregnancy due to the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. If you’ve had unprotected sex recently and think you might be pregnant, buy a home pregnancy test or see a doctor.
If you experience pain with brown discharge, you might have an ectopic pregnancy, in which a fertilized egg grows in the fallopian tube. This is a potentially deadly situation that must be treated as soon as possible., This is a symptom of a sexually transmitted infection called trichomoniasis. It’s usually accompanied by a foul smell and pain during urination.Symptoms are most prevalent after your period., Thick, cheese-like discharge indicates a vaginal yeast infection. It usually comes with vaginal itching, swelling, and pain during sexual intercourse. You can develop a yeast infection whether you’re sexually active or abstinent., Grey discharge may indicate BV. The other main symptom is a fishy odor, especially after sex or during your period. Although BV can be sexually transmitted, any disruption in the normal bacteria of your vagina can trigger it., Do this especially if you’re unsure whether your vaginal discharge is normal or abnormal. Discomfort with abnormal discharge may indicate a vaginal infection. Call your doctor if you experience:


Pain or burning while urinating
Vaginal itching or swelling
Sores or rashes in your vaginal area
Pain during sexual intercourse
Pelvic pain not related to your period or premenstrual syndrome (PMS), Request a pelvic exam. This is especially important if the discharge is accompanied by other symptoms, which may indicate a serious infection that requires medical treatment.


The doctor will ask you a series of questions related to your symptoms. They’ll then conduct a pelvic exam, where they’ll examine your vagina and check for swelling, redness, irritation and the nature of the discharge. The doctor may also collect a sample of the discharge for testing., Follow the daily dosage. Set a reminder on your phone if you need to take your medication throughout the day. If your doctor tells you to take your meds for two weeks, take them for two weeks. Don’t think you’re cured if your discharge returns to normal or the odor goes away before the two weeks is up., Wash daily with unscented soap and water. To be extra safe, wash your perineum (the skin between your vagina and anus), as well. This will prevent harmful bacteria from traveling to your vagina. Avoid using any scented soaps or bubble baths. These can disrupt the delicate pH balance of the vagina., Your body has its own system for staying clean. This includes naturally occurring, healthy bacteria. Douching can kill these bacteria. It can also throw off your normal vaginal pH. Douching can increase the pH and cause harmful bacteria to grow., These products are sold as sprays and powders. They can cause BV by disrupting the natural balance between “good” and “bad” bacteria.This imbalance can also cause yeast infections.You should also avoid scented tampons and sanitary napkins. Choose unscented, chemical-free menstrual supplies.

, Do this after urinating and especially after defecating. Your vagina is coated with delicate mucous membranes. Bacteria from your anus can easily cause an infection if it’s introduced into your vagina., Cotton is a natural material that allows air to circulate. It also prevents moisture build-up, which is a major trigger for yeast infections. Avoid thongs and synthetic materials with cotton crotches. Don’t wear your underwear to bed., They prevent airflow and cause moisture to accumulate. Choose clothing that gives you some room between the fabric and your vulva., Bathing suits are often tight and made of synthetic materials. Throw in the added moisture from the water you were swimming in, and you have the perfect recipe for an infection. When you know you’re finished swimming for the day, ditch the bathing suit immediately and hit the shower., Use only latex condoms. They form an effective barrier against infections. Avoid lambskin condoms, which are porous enough to let some harmful microorganisms through. Hormonal contraception, diaphragms, and foam prevent pregnancy, but they don’t prevent diseases."

Keep track of the date of your last menstrual cycle.,
Look for symptoms similar to PMS, which mirror those of early pregnancy.",How to Tell How Pregnant You Are1," The first day of the last menstrual cycle is actually considered the first day of pregnancy.


Marking this date on your calendar will also help you determine the date of conception.
Fertilization is most likely to occur about 2 weeks after your last menstrual cycle. You are unlikely to experience symptoms until about 2 to 3 weeks after week 1.;
,


The first symptom you may notice in week 3 or 4 is a heavy vaginal discharge. This is usually noted right after conception, and even before a pregnancy test will issue a positive result. It may be whiter and milkier than usual.
At the end of week 4, you may notice cramping and spotting. If this is normally part of your cycle, it may go unnoticed. Spotting is actually called “implantation bleeding.”
Pay attention to sore breasts. They can grow quickly and become painful to the touch. Oversensitive nipples or darkened areolas are also often a feature of pregnancy at the end of the first month.

Keep a movement journal.,
Feel your belly to locate the hard lumps.,
Pinpoint where you feel kicking.",How to Tell the Position of a Baby in the Uterus1," It might be fun to be able to look back at all the different positions your baby was in during your pregnancy. Keep a diary, journal, or notebook to document this. Write down the date, how far along in your pregnancy you are, and what position your baby is in any time you get the chance.
, Though it’s not an exact science, you may be able to locate your baby’s head or bottom just by feeling your stomach. Press gently, and try to relax while you do it – press down while you exhale. A hard, round bump like a small bowling ball is probably the baby’s head; a round but somewhat softer bump may be their bottom. Use some of these standard guidelines to estimate your baby’s position:Do you have a lump on the right or left side of your belly? Press it gently – if the whole baby moves, they might be in a head-down (cephalic) position.
Feeling a hard, rounded lump beneath your ribs might be the baby’s head, meaning they’re in breech (head up) position.
If the two round, hard areas (the head and bottom) are at the sides of your belly, your baby may be lying horizontally. Babies usually move themselves out of this position by 8 months., Babies kick, and it can be one of the easiest ways to visualize how they’re oriented in your uterus. If you feel kicking above your belly button, the baby is probably in a head down position. If the kicking is below your belly button, the baby is probably head up. Just visualize where the baby's feet and legs might be based on where you feel kicking.If you feel kicking around the front middle of your belly, the baby may be in a posterior position – head down with their back to your back. Your stomach may also look more flattened than rounded in this position.

Look at the shape of her abdomen.,
Take note of her breasts.,
Look at her feet and ankles.,
Notice how she is moving around.,
Listen for any shortness of breath.",How to Tell if Someone is Pregnant2," A woman’s body changes a lot during pregnancy, particularly in her abdomen. As the baby grows, the abdomen needs to expand to accommodate. This can sometimes be difficult to differentiate from belly fat in the same area, but a pregnancy has some subtle distinguishing characteristics. Weight gain in the belly area that looks like a well-defined bump, but little to no weight gain in other areas of the body is most likely caused by pregnancy. If you happen to accidentally bump into her, keep in mind that a pregnant belly is also much firmer than belly fat., Enlarged, growing breasts are a common physical change because breast tissue is very sensitive to hormonal changes. If you don’t know this person, this might not be helpful since you don’t have a pre-pregnancy breast size to compare her current size to; however, some pregnant women in the later stages of pregnancy have disproportionately large breasts to the rest of their body because they swell with milk production., Swollen ankles are also very common in pregnant women, especially around the fifth month. This is because the body retains more water and produces more blood and body fluid when a person is pregnant.She may also be wearing extra comfortable, supportive shoes or flip-flops to help with the pain associated with walking and standing with swollen feet and ankles.

, As her body begins to change and grow, many pregnant women also begin experiencing changes to their mobility. Keep an eye out for these common signs:


A waddling walk and other changes in gait are common as the growing belly and swelling feet cause the woman’s balance to be thrown off a bit.
Many pregnant women tend to hold their belly or keep a hand on their bump as they move around. This is both for balance and because of the bond that is growing between the mother and child., In addition to changes in mobility, many pregnant women also experience shortness of breath in their second and third trimesters. This is caused by the growing fetus needing more and more oxygen and also by the expanding uterus putting more pressure on the lungs and diaphragm.Feeling winded with minimal exertion is very common, and in combination with other signs of pregnancy can be conclusive.

Doctors recommend that you avoid foods with strong odors and eat many small meals during the day to stay healthy and.
Many women find that bland, starchy foods such as saltine crackers are good for combatting morning sickness. You may find it helpful to keep some near your bed and in your purse.

, Although you may start to experience fatigue as early as the first month, it will increase in the second month. You should be able to tell you are pregnant and not simply tired.

Ask your healthcare provider to show you how to feel the baby.,
Listen for the baby’s heartbeat.,
Get an ultrasound.",How to Tell the Position of a Baby in the Uterus2," Trained professionals can often tell what position the baby is in just by feeling your stomach. The next time they do this, ask them to guide you through it. They can offer tips and advice on what to feel for at home!Ask to feel along with them as they do it so you can get familiar with how different parts of your baby feel from outside your uterus.

, Though it won’t tell you everything about the baby’s position, finding the baby’s heart can give you some indication of how they are lying. If you happen to have a fetoscope or stethoscope at home, use it to listen on your belly. If not, ask your partner or a loved one to put their ear to your stomach in a quiet room. You can usually hear the heartbeat this way in the last two months of pregnancy – though exactly locating the heart might be difficult.Move around to different spots to see where the heartbeat is loudest and clearest.

If the heartbeat is loudest below mom’s belly button, the baby is probably head down; above the belly button, head up.
Try listening through a toilet paper roll to amplify the sounds!

, Ultrasound scans are the only way to tell for sure what position your baby is in. Ultrasounds use sound waves to make a picture of your baby in the womb. Schedule regular ultrasounds with your OB/GYN or Midwife to check up on your baby, or simply to determine how they are lying in your uterus.Schedule an ultrasound in your first trimester and again in your second trimester, or more frequently if your baby's health needs to be monitored. Ask your healthcare provider for details about when to get an ultrasound.Newer ultrasound technology can make amazingly clear images of the baby, though not all offices have these.

Go home and gather some non-toxic paint or markers and a doll with moveable limbs., Lie down on your back where you'll be comfortable, and lift your shirt. Use firm pressure and feel around your pelvic area for a hard, round shape. Use your art materials to draw a circle for your baby’s head., Draw a heart over the area of your baby’s heartbeat – your healthcare provider probably just showed you where this is at your appointment. If not, use a stethoscope or fetoscope if you have one, or ask a loved one to put their ear to your belly and tell you where the heartbeat is the loudest., Gently feel around for your baby’s bottom, which will be hard and round, but softer than the head. Mark this on your belly., A long, flat area may be the baby’s back; knobbly points could be knees or elbows. Think about where you’ve been feeling kicking.

Wait until you are around 7 or 8 months pregnant, or between 31 and 36 weeks, to schedule your photo shoot.If you are pregnant with twins, consider having your photos taken between 27 and 31 weeks.;
, Schedule your maternity photos on a day when your partner or other children can join you. Including your family in your maternity photos is a special way to capture your growing family.Ask your partner what day would work best for their schedule. If you have other children, schedule the photo shoot on a day they do not have school, or see if you can sign them out of class for an afternoon.

, Ask friends and family for recommendations for photographers in your area, or search online to see what photography businesses are in your area. Look through various portfolios to find a style that you like. Be sure to book ahead of time—a sought-after photographer may book up months in advance.

, If you have a particular pose or setting in mind that you would like to include in your maternity photo collection, chat with the photographer ahead of time. Share your ideas and see if it is something they can accommodate. Be sure that your photographer knows your wishes in advance so they can plan ahead.


Talk to your photographer about what locations interest you. “I was hoping to take some photos at my family’s farm. It’s about 40 minutes outside of the city. Would you be willing to travel to that location?” Be sure that the photographer is able to travel to the location you have in mind.
Your photographer may have some unique locations and places in mind for your photo shoot. Chat with them to see if those locations interest you. “I would like to take some photos by the water. Do you know of a nice lake or stream nearby that might serve as a good location?” Your photographer may have a list of their favorite spots for you to choose from.

, After you have scheduled your photo shoot, think about what types of props you would like to use in your photographs. Consider the season and if any special events or holidays are taking place during that time. Try to incorporate these props into your photos.


Posing with an orange pumpkin in the fall, for example, is an adorable way to mirror your growing belly.If you snap some photos while walking along a beach, consider posing with a beach ball or children’s beach toys next to you in the sand.
Use items that represent your passions in your photo shoot. If you are a sports fan, consider posing with your team’s banner. If you are a dancer, consider posing with baby ballet or tap shoes.

, If you would like to capture a photo of your bare belly, be sure to dress in comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothing or clothing with elastic bands since these can make marks on your belly.Consider wearing a loose-fitting dress with an empire waist or one cinches just below the bust. The fabric of the dress will drape comfortably over your baby bump, and you won’t be constricted by tight, elastic bands.
To show off your bump, consider wearing a form-fitting cotton dress that hugs your curves.

, When selecting your outfit for your maternity shoot, consider wearing solid colors that will highlight the shape of your belly. Large patterns can distract or conceal your baby bump.If you wish to wear a pattern with swirls, stripes, or florals, make sure you are happy with how the pattern accentuates your belly.


Give yourself enough time to consider what outfits you would like to wear. Try on the outfits a week or several days before the photo shoot. Make sure that you are comfortable and that you like each piece. If not, you will still have plenty of time to shop for an outfit that you love!

, If you are including your partner and other children in your photo shoot, help coordinate their outfits in advance so that everything will work well with your outfits. Talk to your family about what they would be comfortable wearing and include their ideas and visions into the overall look. Consider having everyone wear a certain style of clothing, or have them dress in varying shades of a particular color.


If you have other children, consider having them dress like you. Dress them up in an outfit that is similar to yours, or dress them in a color that complements your outfit.
Have your other children wear a shirt that says “big brother” or “big sister.” Your little one will be excited that they have a shirt that is specifically for them.

, Moisturizing your skin just before a photo shoot can create a glare when the flash goes off. Be sure to apply moisturizer If you are going to have a close-up photograph of your bare baby bump, be sure to apply lotion early in the day or one hour before the photo shoot at the latest.This will give the lotion enough time to properly sink into your skin.


Opt for a super-moisturizing shea butter, coco butter, or glycerin-based lotion or cream to hydrate your skin.

, If your hands and feet will be featured in the photos, consider having a manicure or a pedicure beforehand.Not only will your nails look great, but you will feel relaxed, pampered, and polished.

, Consider capturing a photo that focuses solely on your belly. Take a close-up shot as you are lying on your side, or sit with your legs crossed with the camera directly in front of your belly.


Capture a unique photo of your belly by asking the photographer to take a photo looking from the bottom of your belly up toward your head.This distinctive angle offers a different perspective of the baby bump that is not often seen.
Sit directly in front of the camera with your legs crossed, and wrap your arms around your baby bump. Rest one forearm beneath your belly and the other on top. Your arms will frame your bump and create a loving, nurturing image.

, Including your partner in your maternity photo shoot is a meaningful and poignant way to showcase the parents-to-be. Have your partner pose behind you with their hands gently wrapped around your belly. Stand sideways and look toward the camera, or look back into your partner’s eyes to create an intimate, loving moment., If you have other children, include them in your photos.Ask a soon-to-be big brother or sister to hug or kiss your belly, or have them touch your stomach as if they were waiting to feel their sibling kick. Your older child will love that they have been included.

, If you are an avid yogi and feel comfortable striking a downward dog while pregnant, try to include some yoga poses in your photo shoot.Posing in a fierce warrior pose will showcase your strength and will perfectly silhouette your baby bump. Facing the camera while sitting down in a lotus pose will highlight your belly and create a tranquil and mindful scene.

, Bring along your ultrasound to your photoshoot and ask the photographer if you can incorporate it into some shots. Hold the ultrasound next to your belly, or place it in the foreground of the photo with you and your partner standing in the background.

Ask a doctor before taking any medication.,
Mention your pregnancy every time you see a doctor.,
Look up a drug's pregnancy category.,
Follow instructions closely.,
Avoid almost all medication during the first trimester.,
Be careful with herbal supplements.,
Treat medication in different forms as a new drug.",How to Take Medication While Pregnant1," Online information should not replace a conversation with your doctor. The wrong medication or the wrong dose could injure or kill the fetus, and some medications do not mix well with one another. Your doctor can give you individual advice based on your medical history, body type, and other factors.


This includes over-the-counter medications. Even a vitamin supplement should be cleared with a doctor.
Even a doctor can't memorize every drug interaction, but they should have access to special databases to look them up. If you have any doubts, ask your doctor to confirm the advice.;
, Even if you're visiting for an unrelated reason, tell your doctor about the pregnancy. It is important that your doctor knows about the pregnancy, so that he can avoid prescribing drugs that could potentially cause harm.


Even if the signs of pregnancy are obvious, don't assume that your doctor will notice. There's no need to risk serious consequences when you can avoid them by saying ""I'm pregnant.""

, The pregnancy category system rates the potential of a drug to cause birth defects if used during pregnancy. If your doctor has prescribed medication, but you are still worried about its safety, look up its pregnancy category. If you discover any concerns, bring them up with your doctor, or find a second medical opinion. Make sure your doctor knows whether or not you are taking the medication; do not change your mind without telling her, and do not mix medications without first researching their interaction. In the US, the FDA's pregnancy category works as follows:


Category A: Well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus.
Category B: Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women.
Category C: Animal reproduction studies have shown harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women. You and your doctor must weigh the risks and benefits of taking this medication during your pregnancy.
Category D: Evidence shows risk of human fetal harm. You and your doctor must weigh the risks and benefits of taking this medication during your pregnancy.
Category X: Evidence shows significant risk, which almost always outweighs the potential benefits. Avoid taking this medication while pregnant.
Category N: Not yet classified. May or may not be hazardous to a fetus., Each drug should come with an instruction booklet explaining dosage, side-effects, and things to avoid. Drugs can interact positively or negatively with other drugs, herbal supplements, vitamins, or even certain foods. You need to be aware of any relevant interactions and any potential side-effects.


Look for the section on pregnancy and lactation for information on possible risks. If there is no pregnancy section, ask your doctor or search the Internet for the medication's effects on pregnancy.
You may need to take the medication with water, with food, or on an empty stomach. Make every effort to follow this advice, as it may impact how the drug effects you.

, Unless recommended by a physician, most medications are best avoided in pregnancy. This is especially true in the first trimester. The foundations of the baby's organ systems are being laid down in the first trimester, and almost any medication can have a lasting effect on its development.

, Just because something is natural does not mean it is harmless. Herbal supplements often involve high doses and may not have received thorough testing. Ask a doctor for advice. If there is no information available related to pregnancy interactions, avoid the supplement or take it in very low doses.


This applies to medicinal herbal teas or homemade herb treatments as well.
Herbal supplements often have poor labeling standards. One ""dose"" may have an unpredictable strength.

, Even if your doctor has recommended a pill, the same drug in a different form may not be safe. For example, liquid medications often contain alcohol, which can damage the fetus.


Anything that needs to soak into the skin, i.e. medical creams, should be avoided.

Help her sleep.,
Cook for her.,
Find morning sickness remedies.,
Help her shop for gear.,
Be flexible about love making.",How to Take Care of Your Wife or Girlfriend During Pregnancy1," Depending on your wife or girlfriend’s health and age, she may be going to the doctor or midwife a lot. Going with her to as many appointments as you can is important. She may need help walking up the stairs, undressing for the appointment, and so on. Your presence at the appointments also demonstrates your role as a new parent, and shows support.


For a healthy pregnancy, she will go once a month until the third trimester, and if she is a high-risk pregnancy, she may go twice as often.;
, As your wife or girlfriend progresses in her pregnancy, it will become more and more difficult to find a position on the bed in which she can fall asleep. Make her nighttime sleeping arrangements as comfortable as you can so that she has energy during the day with less cause to become irritable and moody from lack of sleep.


Buy her things for sleeping like a full body pillow and relaxing herbal tea, or try cuddling and massage.

, Your wife or girlfriend's diet doesn’t necessarily have to change dramatically, but she does need to eat healthy, protein-rich meals and consume a variety of nutrient-rich vegetables and minerals. Learning what she can eat and adapting it so that it tastes good will make any pregnant woman feel cared for.Prepare her salads with leafy greens, and meals with plenty of dairy, citrus, fatty fish, poultry, and dried beans.Preparing healthy snacks is especially helpful since most pregnant women have to eat every few hours to prevent nausea.

, Morning sickness varies in intensity from mother to mother, and from pregnancy to pregnancy. The mother of your child may have morning sickness nonstop for the entire pregnancy, needing to vomit after each meal, or not at all. If she does have it, do things to ease her suffering.


You can supply her with at-home remedies like ginger ale, ginger tea, folic acid and vitamin B6 supplements, and saltine crackers.Those who are pregnant should consult with their health-care provider before taking any herbs or dietary supplements. It's possible ginger can interact with certain medications or illnesses.Be aware that smells can become nausea triggers, especially in the first trimester. Avoid strong-smelling foods like eggs and fish.

, When a new mom picks up baby gear at the store, it is often big ticket items like cribs, car seats, and changing tables. Go with her to pick up these items so that she is not carrying heavy objects on her own.


Your presence also shows that you support her.

, It is perfectly safe to have sex during pregnancy, but that doesn’t mean that your wife or girlfriend will be into it. Don’t pressure her to have sex when she doesn’t feel up to it. She will most likely have decreased desires for it during the first and last trimesters, and an increased desire for it in the second trimester.Sex during pregnancy is only unsafe if the pregnancy has complications, like premature labor and unexplained vaginal bleeding. Also avoid sex if her water has broken."

Take drugs exactly as prescribed. Skipping or adding a dose could cause harm.

, Ask your doctor for a recommended dosage, typically about 5 mg a day. This can have a beneficial effect on the development of the baby's nervous system, and prevent ""neural-tube"" defects.

, Your doctor may advise you to take iron and calcium tablets. If you were taking iron supplements before, you may not need as high of a dose, as you will be losing less iron to menstruation. If your doctor recommends iron and calcium supplements, take them according to the following restrictions:


If you suffer from heartburn, vomiting, or stomach upsets (all of which are common in pregnancy), never take iron on empty stomach. Taking iron on empty stomach increases its absorption, but can cause severe stomach upsets.
Try not to take Iron and calcium tablets together. Both are positively-charged molecules, and they tend to compete with each other for absorption.
Avoid taking iron tablets after drinking tea or coffee, or eating green leafy vegetables. These foods contain tannates and phytates respectively, which decrease iron absorption in the gut.
Iron tablets can cause dark stools and constipation in some. Up your intake of fiber (salads, fruits, bran, etc.) and stay well hydrated to minimize this effect.

Be patient with her mood swings.,
Have compassion for her discomforts.,
Give her compliments.,
Allow her to vent.,
Change your habits.",How to Take Care of Your Wife or Girlfriend During Pregnancy2," If you weren’t planning on getting pregnant, the announcement can be quite a shock. Don’t let this shock prevent you from showing excitement. If you show that you are displeased, your wife or girlfriend may feel isolated and alone as well as insecure.


For example, even if you feel overwhelmed, avoid making a face that shows disgust or irritation.
You can say things like, “I am overwhelmed, and a little scared, but I also want you to know that I love you and I am with you every step of the way.""

, Pregnancy means that your wife or girlfriend is experiencing an influx of hormones that, if she has never been pregnant before, can be overwhelming to her. These hormones often cause mood swings. Be aware of them and try to minimize your reaction to any irritability or tears that seem out of character.


These increased hormones include estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, prolactin, and endorphins., Pregnancy is a time of great physical changes, also triggered by hormones such as increased estrogen and progesterone.These changes can be very uncomfortable, even painful sometimes, so when she complains about them, show that you care by not dismissing what she says.


She may complain of back aches, pelvic pain, sciatic nerve pain, and many more aches and pains.
Do what you can to ease these symptoms, such as offer back rubs and finding extra pillows.

, When a woman is pregnant, she gains weight, and sometimes not just around her abdomen. No matter how your wife or girlfriend’s physical changes manifest, she will feel much larger—and perhaps not as pretty—as she used to. Telling her that she is beautiful and that you love her can mean the world to her.

, Be available to let your wife talk about what she is going through. This can not only create a safe place for her emotions after the baby is born, but it helps her feel close to you and confident that you are there for her and her child. Knowing that you are available to talk about her experience being pregnant can bring you closer together as a couple and help you both feel confident about becoming parents.

, During pregnancy, women have to give up things that they used to enjoy, such as alcohol and caffeine. Show your support by giving up these things along with her. Doing so not only shows her that you support her, but it helps you develop compassion for what she is experiencing, bringing you closer together.


For example, if you both love coffee, your wife may have to reduce her intake. If you do this with her, you may both suffer caffeine withdrawals together.
Pregnant women should not consume alcohol and must limit caffeine, as well as thoroughly cook all fish (which means no sushi)."

Some wait until they start showing.
Tell your boss before your coworkers. This helps avoid your boss finding out about the pregnancy through office gossip, which may result in a negative reaction.;
, Before you talk to them, think about what questions or concerns your coworkers may have. They may want to know how soon you plan on taking maternity leave and how much work you think you can continue doing. You may also be asked general questions about your health.Be prepared for any negative or discriminatory questions. Imagine yourself hearing these kinds of questions and responding to them. This can help you keep your professionalism if someone reacts negatively instead of having it catch you off-guard.

, If there are other women in your office who have had to tell your colleagues and boss that they were pregnant, talk to one that you trust about their experience. Make sure to communicate that you are telling her in confidence.You may say to your coworker, “I know you had to tell our colleagues that you were pregnant in the past. I was wondering if you could give me some suggestions about the best way to tell them.”
Only talk to someone you trust. You don't want someone telling the office that you are pregnant before you are ready to tell them.

, Before you tell your coworkers, tell your boss that you are pregnant. This should be someone you report to directly. This helps keep your job legally protected.

If you are nervous, remember that being proactive about telling your boss is a professional and respectful way of handling it.This will also help you not to back out from telling your boss about your pregnancy if you get nervous.

, You may help your boss soften to the idea of your being pregnant if you give them some suggestions about your work.

Present a list of projects or assignments that will need to be completed during your absence.Give your boss a list of people you need to contact to tell that you are pregnant and won’t be in the office.
You can also tell your boss whether or not you will be able to check emails or take any time during your leave for work-related tasks.

, After you tell your boss about your pregnancy, you should set up a meeting with human resources. This meeting can help you figure out the information about your maternity leave. You can find out how much paid and unpaid time you have and any documents you need from the doctor, like a projected due date or confirmation that you are pregnant.You also should find out what regulations your company has if you have to go on bed rest. Also find out what paperwork you will need to provide if you have any complications.

, There may be certain people in your workplace that you should talk to privately instead of with other coworkers. This might include managers or supervisors, partners or team members, or HR contacts.Think about each person you need to tell. Figure out if someone will receive the news better if they are told one on one. This also may give you a chance to let that person know you are still dedicated to your job despite your pregnancy.

, Because you don’t know exactly how your pregnancy will pan out, you shouldn’t give any specific plans or make any promises. Instead, you can relay what you hope happens during your pregnancy or your general plans.For example, you may say, “Right now, the plan is to work until this point and stay on maternity leave for the full number of weeks. I hope nothing happens that prevents this from happening.”

, If your office is the type of place where they will accept your pregnancy, you may want to have fun with it by bringing in a treat for everyone. You can bring a food you crave, like cookies, cupcakes, bagels, or donuts. Place pink and blue decorations on top, like balloons, booties, safety pins, or pacifiers.You can have them guess what news you have, or have a big announcement during lunch or break before handing out treats.

, If your office environment is friendly and supportive, you may want to have a small get together during lunch or a break to announce your good news. You can bring a few decorations and some refreshments and share your good news.


This can be a fun way to celebrate with your coworkers.

, If you work in a non-supportive environment, maintain your professionalism after you tell your coworkers about your pregnancy. Avoid telling your coworkers too much information about your pregnancy or baby-related tasks. Remember, you are there to work, not to tell them about your pregnancy tasks.For example, try not to make every conversation about preparing for the baby. You should also be wary of letting people touch your belly, especially if you wouldn’t let them touch you normally.

You do not have to completely forego pretty nails, just be sure to pick nail polishes that do not have nasty chemicals like Formaldehyde in them, Accutane (isotretinoin), Retin-A (tretinoin), and tetracyclines can all be dangerous to your developing fetus, may cause serious birth defects, and should be avoided. Wrinkle cream may also contain Retinol, which can also be dangerous.If you have concerns about wrinkles or acne while pregnant, it is important you discuss this with your doctor and find a treatment that is safe for both you and your baby.
Botox should not be used to treat wrinkles while pregnant, either., Teeth-whitening products that contain peroxide may not be safe to use while pregnant. There is not enough research to support that it is safe to bleach or have your teeth whitened, so it's best to wait until after you have given birth and are finished breastfeeding. In fact, it is illegal in some countries for dentists to perform whitening procedures on pregnant women.Some whitening toothpastes, too, contain peroxide. The levels are so low they should not affect your pregnancy, but talk to your doctor first. Look for stain-reducing, rather than whitening, toothpaste., There is not clear evidence that tanning will harm your baby, but using a tanning bed is the leading cause of skin cancer and should always be avoided. Tanning may also potentially break down folic acid, which is important in building your baby's nervous system. Avoid spray tans, as you can inhale chemicals that could harm your baby.In addition, overheating by tanning or laying out in the sun can increase your risk for birth defects.Wear sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.
Talk to your doctor before using self-tanner. There is not enough evidence to show that self-tanning lotion is safe for use while you are pregnant, but it is thought the chemical that browns your skin (dihydroxyacetone) is not absorbed past the first layer of skin. Still, you should check with your doctor before using any self-tanning products, or just make peace with being a little pale while you're pregnant."

Ask for help if you need it.",How to Survive the First Week After Birth," Your baby will wake up every few hours to eat. The best way to get sleep is to sleep when your baby sleeps. This may include making up for your deficit by napping during the day. Getting enough rest will also help your body produce milk.You will likely feel physically exhausted from the exertion of the birth and emotionally exhausted from the excitement. This is normal and you will feel better as your body heals.
If you have older children that also need attention and supervision, consider asking family members or friends to babysit. This will enable you to sleep for a few hours during the day.;
, Your partner may be unsure what to do or may feel left out if you don’t have a family room where they can stay overnight with you and the baby in the hospital.Give your partner plenty of time to cuddle with the baby. Talk with your partner about how you both feel after the birth, since your lives are going through a big transition.
If you are still in bed recovering, let you partner bring the baby to you so you don’t have to get up to nurse. Your partner can also change the baby’s diaper, bathe the baby, and dress the baby.
Ask your partner to supervise any older children you might have as well. If your older child is big enough, your partner can explain how to hold the baby and supervise the initial bonding period between the siblings.

, Many women feel sad, exhausted, or cry around three to five days after the birth. This can happen because of the hormonal changes your body is going through. You are particularly vulnerable to the baby blues if you are very tired, the birth was difficult, or your your recovery is preventing you from taking care of your baby the way you want to. The baby blues are normal and pass after one to two weeks. Symptoms include:Being extremely emotional
Reacting irrationally
Crying without an apparent cause
Feeling irritable
Feeling anxious or stressed
Feeling depressed
Loss of appetite
Finding it difficult to make choices

, Postpartum depression is different from the baby blues because it is more severe and doesn’t pass after a week or two. It usually starts two weeks to two months after the baby’s birth, but it can also start sooner or even a year after birth. One in 10 women and four in 10 teenage mothers can experience postpartum depression. If you think you may have postpartum depression or if a friend or family member thinks you may have it, talk to someone you trust and contact your doctor. Symptoms include:Loss of interest in the baby
Crying
Lack of pleasure
Lack of concentration
Feeling that you can’t cope
Memory loss
Anxiety or panic attacks
Exhaustion
Insomnia
Achiness
Lack of hunger
Post traumatic stress disorder may also occur after a painful or difficult delivery

, Not all women experience love at first sight when they see their babies. Give yourself time to bond and it will come.This doesn’t make you a bad mother or an incapable mother. The love will come as you bond over time.
You can still provide your baby with everything they require as you bond.
Include any older children you have in your bonding. An older child can sit with you as you hold the baby or cuddle with you both as you nurse. Explain to the older child that they will now be a big brother or big sister and that the younger sibling will look up to them. Then, when the baby is bigger, they can play together.

, This will enable you to get support from women who are going through the same process that you are. You will be able to:


Trade tips on breastfeeding and solving the day to day puzzles that are part of your new phase of life.
Make new friends.
Get support which will help buffer you against postpartum depression

, The first week after birth is a time when you will naturally feel overwhelmed. Even a small amount of help from friends and family can go a long way to making things feel more manageable and giving you time to also take care of yourself. This help could include:


Friends bringing you meals so that you don't have to cook. Or alternatively, you may have relatives that can come and stay with you for a few days and cook. They can also freeze food so that you won't have to cook for a few days after they go home.
A family member holding the baby while you shower. Family members can also diaper the baby, burp the baby, and dress the baby. They can also help supervise older children while you nurse and take care of yourself.

, Your body is simultaneously healing and adjusting to not having the baby inside anymore. You will notice that:Your abdomen will feel loose and baggy because the muscles and skin have stretched out. It will slowly return to normal.
Breastfeeding helps your uterus to contract. If you feel cramps that feel similar to when you have your period, this may be why. If it is very uncomfortable, tell your doctor.

, In the first few days it will be heavy. Over time it will be browner and then lighter. At the end the discharge may be yellow or white. This may last for six weeks.Call your doctor if you have a fever and pass large clumps of blood or if it smells bad.You should also call the doctor if you bleed through more than one large pad in an hour for more than two consecutive hours.
Try witch hazel. The hospital may also give you witch hazel pads that you can put between a sanitary pad and the wound. This will help promote healing.You can also purchase postpartum bath teas. These are mixtures of healing herbs that you can put in your bath.
Don’t use tampons because the tissues are healing.Tampons also raise your risk of an infection.

, If you had tearing or were cut to help the baby out (episiotomy), the doctors may have sewn you up with stitches. Most hospitals will give you a ""peri-bottle"" which you can fill with warm water and use to rinse your perineum after you urinate. This will help keep the area clean.If it is uncomfortable, sit carefully and lie on your side instead of your back. You can also purchase a padded ring on which you can sit. This relieves the pressure around your vagina.If you are breastfeeding, talk to your doctor before you take any painkillers, even over-the-counter painkillers. Your doctor will be able to tell you what medications will or won’t be safe for your baby while you nurse.
If the stitches hurt during bowel movements, you can hold a clean pad over them to support them. Try not to push too hard when you are having bowel movements. Eat fresh produce, salads, and whole-grain breads to increase your fiber intake. This will help your stool stay soft. Drink extra water as well. If this isn’t enough, your doctor may recommend stool softeners.The stitches usually dissolve on their own and generally don’t have to be removed. Contact your doctor if the pain gets worse or if the cut or tear gets inflamed or seeps pus., After birth women often find that they may leak some urine if they laugh or cough. It may be tempting to drink less water so that you don’t have to pee as often, but don’t do that. If you dehydrate yourself it will also reduce your milk production. Drink at least eight cups of water per day.Doing pelvic floor or Kegel exercises will help you get the muscles back into shape. Once you have healed you can start. Tighten the muscles that you use when you are stopping the flow of urine midstream and then release them quickly. Repeat this several times. As you get stronger you will be able to do more repetitions. You can also do repetitions where you squeeze and hold for 10 seconds.Contact your doctor right away if you have signs of a urinary tract infection such as the feeling that you always have to pee;a painful, burning feeling when you do pee; or frequently passing only a little bit of urine., Hemorrhoids are stretched veins around your anus.They can be painful, but usually heal after a few days.Your doctor may be able to give you an ointment that you can put on which will ease the discomfort.
Increase your fiber intake by eating whole-grains, fresh vegetables, fruits, and salads. Drink extra water. This will help to keep your stool soft and reduce the discomfort when you have bowel movements.

, You will probably need to stay a few extra days in the hospital, possibly up to three days. If you have help at home, you may be able to go home after 24 hours. During the first week you should:Rest as much as you can. This can be either bed rest or sleeping.
Walk around a little bit each day to lower your risk of getting a blood clot. It doesn’t have to be far or strenuous, just enough to make sure your blood is circulating properly. This will also help relax your muscles. Ask your doctor or midwife how much walking they recommend for you.
Try not to go up and down stairs more than necessary because this strains your stomach muscles. Wait until your doctor tells you that you are ready before driving, exercising, lifting heavy objects, or having sex.
Follow your doctors instructions for cleaning the wound and changing any dressings.

, At first your baby will want to drink frequently, possibly even once per hour. The first milk your body makes will be colostrum.It is often slightly yellow and it is very concentrated. Your baby will probably only drink about a teaspoon at each meal. You will notice that your baby is hungry when they:Move their head around looking for the breast
Make sucking motions. Many babies suck their fingers.
Cry or fuss.

, Using the correct feeding position will help your baby drink easily. You can do this by:Holding your baby close so that their nose is at your nipple.
Softly rubbing their upper lip to encourage them to open their mouth wide and keep their tongue down.
Bring them to your breast as they tip their head back. Your nipple should go into their mouth towards the roof of their mouth and they should have a large mouthful of nipple.

, This will help you to figure out what works best for you and your baby. Different positions to try include:Cross-cradle hold. Hold the baby with the arm that is opposite from the breast they are feeding from. Support their head with your hand. Use your free hand to support your breast. Bring the baby to you, instead of leaning towards the baby.
Cradle hold. Cradle the baby in the arm that is on the same side as the breast you are giving the baby.
Football hold. This position is good for women who just had a C-section because the baby doesn’t rest on your belly. Hold the baby like a football at your side on the same side as the breast that you are offering. The baby’s feet will be towards your back.
Side-lying hold. Lie on the bed with your baby next to you. You should be tummy to tummy with your baby. This position can be good for night feedings — just be sure to return the baby to their own bed when you both go back to sleep.

, After about two to four days, your breasts will become warmer and enlarged with milk. As your baby drinks your milk supply, your body will make more. You should breastfeed as often and as long as the baby wants. This is called baby-led feeding.You should breastfeed both during the day and at night.
While breast milk is healthiest for the baby, not all women can or want to breastfeed. It is also possible for you to give your baby the nutrients they need through formula.
You will know that your baby is getting enough milk when they are satisfied after their meals, gains weight, urinates at least six times per day and passes yellow stool twice per day., It can take a little while for you and your baby to figure out what techniques work best for you both. If you are having difficulties, there are many resources that you can reach out to. This can include:


Asking an experienced female relative or friend
Requesting assistance from a lactation consultant at the hospital. Many hospitals offer free lactation advice, even after you are discharged. This may even include having someone come to your house and help you or a hospital-supported breast feeding group.
Talking to your midwife
Hiring a private lactation consultant
Going to La Leche League meetings. The La Leche League is a global organization that is dedicated to helping mothers breastfeed. They offer support in many different languages.You can check online to see if there are meetings in your area. If not, you may be able to get help through online forums or over the telephone.

Select a safe variety of fish oil supplement.,
Find a reputable manufacturer of fish oil supplements.,
Don’t get confused with other oil supplements.,
Consult your doctor for the appropriate dosage.",How to Take Fish Oil During Pregnancy1," You might think that one fish oil supplement is like any other, but you’d be wrong. In fact, you can find two kinds of fish oil supplements: those derived from the fish’s body, and those from the fish’s liver. The former—often called omega-3 supplements—is thought to be safe to consume during pregnancy, while the latter—due to the presence of retinol—is not.The oil's source will be listed on the label, so just read the label and contents to make sure it's not liver oil.


That being said, you should always consult your OB/GYN before taking any supplement, especially if you are breastfeeding.;
, Due to a recent surge in the popularity of fish oil supplements and products, there are many products on the market made by sub-standard manufacturers. In order to select a reputable, high-quality product, look for a manufacturer that can provide documentation of approval by third-party quality evaluators, such as the Norwegian Medicinal Standard, the European Pharmacopoeia Standard, and the USP.In addition, your doctor or pharmacist may recommend a particular brand.


You can also test the product’s quality for yourself by sniffing and tasting it. Studies have shown that good-quality fish oil supplements should not smell or taste fishy in any way, so toss those tablets if you get a bad whiff.
Note that supplements in the United States are not regulated by the FDA. This means that supplements, especially those that have not been inspected by a third party, have not been verified for content, labeling, or dosage, and could potentially contain harmful ingredients.

, Some people think that flaxseed oil contains the same long-chain omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil, but this is not true. It holds the shorter-chain omega-3 acid ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), but not EPA or DHA. The body can convert ALA into EPA and DHA, but this conversion is inefficient and spotty at best.Additionally, studies have shown that olive oil and other vegetable oil supplements do not supply the same health benefits as those made of fish oil., The World Health Organization recommends that a healthy adult consume 300 – 500 milligrams of EPA and DHA every day, but you should be careful about measuring your supplement intake. Due to conflicting evidence regarding the benefits and potential harmfulness of fish oil supplements, ask your doctor about the advisability and dosage guidelines of taking fish oil."

Have someone available to help you get in and out of the tub.,
Make sure the water is no warmer than 98 °F (36.7 °C).,
Use a bath mat and a towel to avoid slipping hazards.,
Add epsom salts and apple cider vinegar to the water.,
Limit bubble baths to twice a month.,
Soak for no more than one hour.,
Allow someone to help you get out of the tub.",How to Take a Bath When Pregnant," To avoid slipping and falling as you get in the full tub, ask your partner, a family member, or a friend to assist you as you lower into the tub. You should also ask for help getting out of the tub so you don’t accidentally fall or trip.;
, A bath that is too hot can lead to possible health issues and complications, so keep the bathwater warm but not scalding hot.Check the water with a thermometer to confirm the temperature is no higher than 98 degrees Fahrenheit.
If you have to ""ease in"" to the bath, it's too hot. Let it cool off or add some cold water.

, Prepare for your bath by laying down a bath mat by the tub and keeping fresh towels close by. This will cut down on slipping or tripping hazards as you get in and out of the tub.


Look for a plastic mat with grips that will stick to the bathroom floor.
Use adhesive plastic grips at the bottom of the tub to help you retain traction while bathing.

, To create a calming soak, you can add a few tablespoons of epsom salts and a ¼ cup apple cider vinegar to the water. According to health specialists, these natural substances will not harm your baby or affect your pregnancy., Regardless of being pregnant, taking too many bubble baths a month can lead to vaginal irritation and infections. Limit your use of bubble bath when taking a bath while pregnant, and avoid using bubble bath more than twice a month., Avoid staying in the bath for more than one hour to cut down on your risk of infection. Enjoy a one hour soak to ease swollen limbs and relax your pregnant body., Rather than risk tripping or falling, especially when wet, ask your partner or a family member for help before getting out of the tub.


Use a fresh towel to wipe off to avoid slipping on the bathroom floor.

Seek medical attention if you are bleeding excessively.,
Monitor your nausea and ability to eat.,
Know what activity your baby should be doing during your stage of pregnancy and seek medical help if the activity is abnormal.,
Recognize contractions that mean you are going into false labor.",How to Take Care of Yourself During a High Risk Pregnancy1," If you experience bleeding anytime during your pregnancy, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. Depending on the trimester you are in, bleeding could mean several different things: if you are in your first trimester, it could mean a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy (which is when an embryo implants itself somewhere other than your uterus). Look for:


Heavy bleeding (similar or more than a heavy day during your period).
Cramping.
Severe abdominal pain.;
, Nausea and Vomiting are normal during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester (this is known as morning sickness). However, if your nausea and vomiting get to the point where they are keeping you from eating or drinking, you should seek medical attention. A lack of nutrients and dehydration can endanger both you and your baby. Look for:


Severe nausea that leads to vomiting.
An inability to eat anything.
Becoming dehydrated because you can’t drink anything without becoming nauseous.

, If your baby’s movement suddenly decreases, it may be a sign that something is wrong. However, in order to know if movement has decreased, it’s important to know what sort of movement is normal. To find your baby’s regular movement:


First time mothers will normally feel their baby’s first kicks at around 25 weeks. Second time mothers should feel the kicks at around 18 weeks.
To find your baby’s regular activity, sit and count your baby’s kicks for two hours. This amount is called the baseline. Normal baselines are generally around 10 or more kicks for every two hours.If you are concerned about your baby’s health, count the kicks. If it is less than normal, seek medical help. You can also test this by drinking a very cold glass of water and then lying down on your side. If the baby does not kick for two hours, consider calling your doctor.

, Contractions can be difficult to keep track of. However, if you feel contractions during your first trimester, it may be a sign of preterm labor. In your third trimester, erratic contractions could be signs of a false labor.Contractions in false labor: Unpredictable contractions that don’t seem to follow a rhythm. They also do not increase in intensity and may even go away if you change your position or the activity you are doing.

Contractions in true labor: These will be regular and normally come in intervals of 10 minutes or less. They will get more intense and more frequent as time progresses.

Determine whether or not your school is held to Title IX.,

Ask to be made comfortable.,
Don't put up with harassment.,

Consider taking time off.",How to Survive School Being Pregnant," All public educational institutions are accountable to protect you as a pregnant student under title IX. Private schools that receive federal funding are also accountable. Any educational institution that receives federal funds, including those run in correctional or health care facilities, must abide by Title IX or forfeit funding.Any educational program that receives federal funds, including internships and School-to-Work programs, must abide by Title IX.
A school that is controlled by a religious organization is exempt from Title IX when the law’s requirements would conflict with the organization’s religious beliefs.This means if the religion has a strict belief against premarital sex, the student would not be protected by Title IX and could potentially be denied the opportunity to continue participating in classes or have excused absences due to pregnancy.;
, Every school that receives federal funds must designate a Title IX coordinator or counselor.This person will help you navigate the system as a pregnant student. Ask in the main office of your school, or look up the coordinator online. The information has to be readily available for your school to be in compliance with Title IX, so don't take no for an answer., Under Title IX, your school must allow you to continue participating in classes and extracurricular activities while pregnant. Continue to take your regularly scheduled classes, including advanced placement and honors classes. If you would like, you can continue to participate in school clubs, sports, and after-school programs.Hold your positions. If you have been elected to a position of student leadership, an honors society, or anything else, you may not be asked to step down because of your pregnancy.
Again, if you school is exempt to Title IX, you may not be guaranteed these rights.

, If your school is held to title IX they must excuse absences related to pregnancy or childbirth, provided your doctor says they are needed. Your school must allow you to return to the same place you were in when you left. They cannot demote you from positions you held, nor remove you from the classes you were in. You must be given the chance to make up the work you missed when absent, including homework, tests, and presentations. If you are graded on attendance or class participation, your teachers must give you alternative assignments of equal worth., Your school may give you the choice of transferring to an alternative school, or taking special instructional classes for pregnant students. This program must offer the same types of academic, extracurricular and enrichment opportunities as your school’s regular program. Under Title IX, this must be a choice: your school cannot pressure you to participate.If you are in middle or high school, your school might want to transfer you to an alternative school. You do not have to transfer. Visit the facilities of the alternative school. If you don't like it, stay in your regular school.Students who transfer when they don't want to are more likely to drop out.

, As a pregnant student, you should have the same rights as other students with temporary medical conditions. Some schools offer significant help to students with medical issues. If your school provides these students with homebound instruction, independent study, or at-home tutoring, you can ask for these options as well.


Unless your school requires one from all temporarily disabled/ill students, you should not be required to get a doctor's note to participate in class or extracurricular activities.You are not required to provide a doctor's note to excuse your hospitalization during childbirth, unless all students who are hospitalized are required to provide a note.

, Your school must provide for your comfort as a pregnant student. You can ask for adjustments such as a larger desk or access to elevators. Ask to be seated near the door, so that you can take frequent trips to the restroom. Go to the restroom as often as you need to: you cannot be penalized for pregnancy-related bodily demands., Your school is required to protect you from bullying and discrimination. Report any student, teacher, or other member of your school's community who makes a sexual comment about you, calls you a ""slut,"" spreads rumors about you, makes sexual gestures, or does anything else that makes you uncomfortable. Tell people they can't touch you without permission, even when your belly is big.Report offenders to your Title IX coordinator, your counselor, or other staff.

, As a pregnant student, you are covered under the same policy that prohibits sex discrimination. Your school is required to have a policy against sex discrimination, and to distribute it. Your school is also required to have grievance procedures in place. If you experience sex discrimination, file a complaint with your school's Title IX coordinator using your school's internal grievance procedures.If your school has failed to appoint a Title IX coordinator, or if the coordinator has proven unhelpful, file a grievance with the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, within 180 days of when the discrimination took place.If your school has been egregiously discriminatory or unhelpful, consider filing in court.Contact the Office for Civil Rights if you have questions about your rights or if you would like to report a school district or university for violating Title IX., One of the most reliable ways to survive school while pregnant is to have on-campus health support. Visit the school nurse and ask what sorts of aid are available. Unless you study at a university with its own hospital, you are unlikely to have all your health needs taken care of on campus. Visit a regular doctor for other needs.If you are a teenager, you are at a higher risk for pregnancy complications such as anemia, premature birth, and high blood pressure.If your parents have health insurance that covers dependents, you may be covered by their plan until you are 26.Discuss the terms of your parents' health insurance policy to determine whether or not you are covered.
If getting on your parents' insurance plan is not an option (maybe you are not on good terms or you aren't covered), you will need to seek out your own insurance.
Giving birth qualifies you to apply for government insurance even after the deadline for Open Enrollment (or the period during which you can sign up for insurance) has passed.If you enroll up to 60 days after giving birth, your insurance will begin the day of the event. So, if you give birth on March 15, 2016 and enroll on May 14, 2016, you coverage applies from March 15 to the end of the year (December 31, 2016).If you are unable to work or afford the monthly payments for insurance, you may be eligible for Medicaid through your state. If you receive Medicaid, your infant will automatically be eligible for coverage as well. Each state has its own requirements for eligibility, so you will need to contact your local Medicaid office to find out if you qualify.Try searching here for an office near you.
While you wait for your government insurance, visit a free clinic such as Planned Parenthood. They may have resources your school doesn't have, such as classes for expecting parents.
Most towns have women's health centers or family services centers you can visit.

, Being pregnant and in school is a lot of work. You will need your friends to help you out in ways they never have. If your friends have not been pregnant or helped someone who is pregnant, they may not pick up quickly on your new needs. Communicate clearly about things you need.


You may need help with food, with errands, and with getting around. Create a schedule and ask your friends to sign up for shifts.
If you are in middle or high school, you also may need help socially, as some people won’t ""get it."" Ask your friends to stand up for you if they hear someone spreading rumors or calling you names.
Tell your best friends exactly what you're going through. If student pregnancy is unusual at your school, you will have to spell out your needs to your friends. Tell them what you are worried about, what you need, and that you appreciate their support.
If you don't have supportive friends, see if you can join a local meet up group for new parents. You'll meet people who have gone through what you are going through.

, Your mood may become more variable during pregnancy, which can affect your performance in school. Depression might happen during pregnancy, and is very common afterward. If you find yourself to be unusually sad, have thoughts of hurting yourself, or feelings of hopelessness, report this to your doctor like you would a physical pain. Ask your doctor for help finding a therapist or a social worker to get you through your depression.

, If you are facing familial rejection for your pregnancy, you will need to find a place to live in your area. Ask your counselor or social worker to help you find a group home for pregnant teens and teen parents that will not require you to move far from your school. If you are escaping an abusive relationship with your partner or family, you may need to stay in a secret location. Contact your social worker or local police and ask for help if you are being physically harmed or endangered., Especially if you are still a teenager, you will need to keep a healthy diet while pregnant. Eat whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat meat and dairy. There are government programs such as the WIC (Women, Infant, and Children) that can help you afford good food. Avoid soda and junk food, and eat healthy snacks like fruits and nuts in between classes to keep your energy up.


An empty stomach can lead to morning sickness and nausea. Carry a mild snack like wholegrain crackers to eat throughout the day.Try to drink fluids throughout the day, cutting back during mealtimes.Seek treatment if you have an eating disorder. You can seriously harm your child and yourself if you give birth without adequate nutrition.If you eat at home, teach your family about good nutrition. You and whoever cooks in your house should come up with meals together that will support your health.

, Drugs, alcohol, caffeine, junk food, and cigarettes are all harmful for your child and yourself. Drugs and alcohol are also bad for your schoolwork. The sooner you are able to quit, the better. Talk to your school nurse, your counselor, or a doctor to get help with addiction. Ask your friends and family for their support while you give up smoking, drinking, and eating unhealthy food., You may find you need to sleep longer hours, or take naps after school or in between classes. Ask your school if there is a place you can lie down if you find you need a nap during the day. Exercise will help you sleep better, reduce health risks for you and your baby, and ease your back pain. If you always exercise, you can probably continue a similar exercise regimen during your pregnancy.If you do not normally exercise, start by going on walks or exercising for 10 or 15 minutes at a time until you build up more stamina.
Avoid any exercise that has you lying on your back after your first trimester.
Avoid exercise that puts you at risk of falling.
Drink plenty of fluids while you exercise.
Check your local hospital, fitness center or gym for exercise classes for pregnant people, such as prenatal yoga., For a pregnant student, school becomes less of a social space and more of a job. You're taking care of your body full time, so taking care of schoolwork will need a special focus. You also might experience what is sometimes called ""baby brain,"" or a lack of focus and memory associated with pregnancy. Keep a calendar with all your assignments as well as your doctors appointments and other dates.


Get a tutor or talk to your teachers if you are struggling with understanding the material.

, Talk to your doctor about sex during pregnancy. If your doctor says you it is safe for you to have sex while you are pregnant, use a condom when you do. Sexually transmitted infections can be extremely harmful to newborn babies. Use a condom to avoid contracting an illness that could hurt you and could cause cause blindness, pneumonia, or meningitis in the baby., If you are in college, you have the option of taking a semester or a year off. Talk to your guidance counselor about the possibility of leaving and picking up where you were. You might want to stay in school while pregnant and then take a year off if you are keeping the child, or you might need to stay in school in order to collect your financial aid. If you do take time off, make sure you apply for extra scholarships for students who are parents when you are ready to return.


If you are in high school and you are struggling to take care of your pregnancy and your schoolwork, consider taking classes for your GED. Talk to your school counselor about this decision.

Know about the important omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil.,
Evaluate the potential benefits of fish oil supplements.,
Consider the evidence that fish oil supplements do little or nothing for babies.",How to Take Fish Oil During Pregnancy2," Despite the controversy around fish oil supplements, it’s undisputed that fish oil is rich in EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), and also that these fatty acids are essential to your body’s function. DHA supports the nervous system and thus is particularly crucial for the developing brains and eyes of babies in the womb.Though the role of EPA and DHA in cognitive development is undisputed, studies are inconclusive as to the ability of fish oil supplements to deliver these omega-3’s effectively to the pregnant woman and her fetus.
Research suggests that you need 200 mg of DHA every day to support the growth of your baby’s cognitive and visual systems., Some studies suggest that fish oil supplements can improve your baby’s development significantly. For example, one recent study shows that toddlers born to mothers who ingested fish oil supplements displayed better hand-eye coordination than other toddlers whose mothers did not do so.Another study in Denmark found that the babies of women taking fish oil in the last trimester of pregnancy had a lower incidence of asthma., Despite some studies supporting the advisability of ingesting fish oil capsules, the evidence is far from conclusive. For example, a study in Australia concluded that the children of women who took fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy performed no better on cognitive and language tasks than the children of women who did not.Even the above-mentioned Danish study warns against overly optimistic conclusions from their study. Despite their results, the researchers acknowledge that the fish oil consumption of the women in their study was well above the recommended dose, so they still cannot recommend that pregnant women follow suit."

Eat two portions of oily fish every week.,
Buy wild salmon rather than farmed salmon.,
Avoid mercury-rich predator fish, such as shark, swordfish, and king mackerel.,
Avoid preparations that may lead to food poisoning.",How to Take Fish Oil During Pregnancy3," Many governments recommend that people eat more oily fish every week for the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, and there’s evidence that consuming actual fish benefits pregnant women more than taking supplements does.Examples of oily fish include mackerel, salmon, trout, herring, anchovies, and sardines. Tinned/canned tuna, cod, and haddock are, in contrast, not oily fish.A serving size of oily fish consists of 3.5 ounces (100 g).

, Though farmed salmon does indeed contain omega-3 fatty acids, it’s overall less nutritious than wild salmon—for example, it contains only an eighth as much vitamin D, and only a third as much vitamin A. It’s also fattier, meaning that it collects and stores significantly more contaminants and toxins than its wild counterpart does.Many places, such as the E.U. and the U.S., require manufacturers to label farmed and wild fish, as well as to identify whether or not dye has been added. In other places though, like Canada, this explicit indication is not required by law., Mercury exposure can disrupt and destroy neurological and organ health, and it’s particularly harmful to young children and fetuses. Indeed, the U.S. government estimates that as many as 75,000 newborns each year are at higher risk of developing learning disabilities later in life due to mercury exposure in the womb. You can limit your exposure to mercury by cutting out your consumption of predatory fish, such as shark, king mackerel, and tuna.Even if you’re eating wild salmon, don’t eat more than two portions a week, as it can still contain pollutants harmful to you and your baby, such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

, Raw fish (such as sushi, sashimi, ceviche and carpaccio) and refrigerated smoked seafood should be avoided due to the risk of food poisoning or listeria poisoning. Make sure that all fish is refrigerated promptly after purchase and consumed within one to two days. Always cook seafood to an internal temperature of 145°F (62.8°C)."

Do not ‘eat for two’.,
Avoid dieting while pregnant.,
Eat at least 300 calories of carbohydrates.,
Increase your protein intake to 71 grams each day.,
Try to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables daily.,
Try to get 45 mg of iron a day.,
Take calcium supplements to get 1000 milligrams daily.,
Get 15 micrograms of vitamin D a day.,
Increase your intake of folic acid to 400 micrograms a day.,
Consume 2.6 micrograms of B12 a day.",How to Take Care of Yourself During a High Risk Pregnancy2," The concept that you need to eat for two when you become pregnant has actually be shown to be wrong in a lot of cases.When you ‘eat for two’, you can gain weight. Excessive weight during pregnancy can actually lead to other medical problems, which you want to avoid when you already have a high risk pregnancy. Instead, you only need to increase your caloric intake by 300 calories or so. The medical conditions associated with gaining weight while you’re pregnant include:


Gestational diabetes.
Pre eclampsia.
Eclampsia.

, Aside from overeating, eating less or dieting is another dangerous thing to do during pregnancy, and especially during high risk pregnancy. If you do not get a healthy amount of calories and nutrients each day, it can lead to a low birth weight, premature delivery, and learning disabilities. The following steps in this section discuss the different nutrients you need to try to consume each day.

, Carbohydrates provide the body with energy that you need to stay healthy and happy during your pregnancy. When considering what to eat for the day, try to make sure that at least 300 of your calories for the day come from carbohydrates. You can figure out how many calories each carbohydrate food has by reading the nutrition information, or running an internet search. Good carbs include:


Whole grains like whole wheat and multigrain bread, oatmeal, and brown rice.
Beans like black, garbanzo, and kidney beans.
Fruits like apples, apricots, and avocados.
Almonds, Brazil nuts, and cashews.

, Proteins help your body to repair worn out tissues and build up the immunity of both you and your baby. The daily recommended amount of protein for a pregnant woman is 71 grams, which you can get by eating foods like:


Tofu, lentils and black beans.
Chicken breast, salmon, and lean ground beef.
Cottage cheese, low-fat yogurt, and skim milk.

, Fruits and vegetables help to boost your immune system, as well as the immunity of your baby. Five portions of fruits and vegetables might be difficult to determine however, so here is a guide of what a serving or fruit or veggies actually means:


One serving of fruit is: 1 apple, ½ cup of berries or grapes, or one banana.
One serving of vegetables is: 1 orange bell pepper, ½ cup of cooked squash, or one cup of leafy greens.

, When you get pregnant, you will have to increase your iron intake because iron helps to form your baby’s blood. It also helps to transport nutrients from your body to your baby via your blood. You can take iron supplements, though you should talk to your doctor before doing this. You can also eat food that is rich in iron like:


Dark leafy greens like spinach or kale.
Dried fruit like raisins or prunes.
Iron-enriched cereals.
Soybeans, chickpeas, lentils, and beans.
Artichokes.

, Calcium helps your baby’s bones and teeth to become strong. It also helps your own bones remain strong, which will come in handy when you are delivering your baby. Talk to your doctor about taking calcium supplements, and eat foods that are rich in calcium like:


Skim and nonfat dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt.
Spinach, collard greens, and turnip greens.
Canned salmon and sardines.
Sesame seeds or dry roasted almonds.

, Vitamin D helps your body, and your baby’s body to absorb calcium, which in turn helps your baby’s bones and teeth to grow strong. At the same time, it will help your bones stay strong; strong bones are an important part of being able to deliver your baby. Your body makes vitamin D when you expose your skin to sunlight.You can get vitamin D by spending time in the sunlight or taking vitamin D supplements.
You can also eat vitamin D rich foods like: egg yolks, milk and dairy products fortified with vitamin D, and tuna canned in water.

, Folic acid helps in the formation of blood and development of the neural tube in your baby’s body. The daily requirement of folic acid for a pregnant mother is 400 micrograms, which you can get through supplements or by eating foods that contain folic acid. These foods include:


Lentils and kidney beans.
Asparagus, broccoli, and leafy greens like spinach and kale.
Citrus fruits.
Fortified breads and cereals.

, Vitamin B12 works together with folic acid to form red blood cells that help to form blood. When you have a high risk pregnancy, increased blood levels can help carry the nutrients from your system to your baby. Foods that are rich in B12 that you can eat include:


Fortified soy products like tofu.
Fortified cereals.
Low fat dairy products.
Smoked salmon and tuna.

Do kegel exercises to strengthen your vaginal muscles.,
Try bridge pose to make your abs stronger.,
Practice hamstring exercises.,
Walk for 20 to 30 minutes a day.,
Avoid daily activities that could cause you or your baby harm.,
Limit the amount of stress you feel by exercising and expressing your emotions.",How to Take Care of Yourself During a High Risk Pregnancy3," These exercises help to tighten and release your vaginal muscles and the pelvic floor. When these muscles are stronger, you are less likely to experience tears in your vagina when delivering your baby. This can be done by tightening your vaginal muscles for a few seconds and then releasing them.You can also practice this exercise while you urinate. Hold your vaginal muscles tight while you urinate and then release them; this will cause you to pass urine in spurts rather than a steady stream.

, This exercise helps to strengthen the abdominal muscles. Kneel on a flat surface with your knees on something soft like a yoga mat or blanket. Place your hands out in front of your. Slowly arch your back towards the ceiling and then slowly lower it back down.Do not tighten the abdominal muscles excessively while doing this exercise.

, Doing this exercise will help to strengthen and loosen up your hamstring muscles. Lie on your side on a soft, flat surface; a bed works well. Life one leg and bend it gently, taking care not to overstretch your abdominal muscles.


Hold this position for 10 seconds, then repeat the exercise using the other leg while lying, facing the opposite direction.

, While you can’t do very strenuous exercises while you are pregnant, you can walk to both keep your strength up and get some cardio. Make sure to rest if you start to feel tired by sitting on a bench or pausing your walk for a moment.

, Some activities can be dangerous to you and your baby’s health because the activities can lead to excess strain. In particular:


Take you time and use caution when going up and down the stairs.
Avoid lifting heavy objects.
Balance the amount of rest you get with the activities you do.
Consider reducing the amount of work you are doing each day to make sure you are getting enough rest.

, When you have a high risk pregnancy, you are more than likely stressed about your health and your baby’s health. However, stress can raise your blood pressure, which can lead to pre eclampsia. To reduce your stress;


Talk to your friends and family about your concerns, fears, thoughts, and emotions.
Ask your doctor any questions that you have about your condition.

Practice breathing exercises, yoga, and meditation.

Follow the BRAT (Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) diet.,
Eat plenty of soups and broths.,
Avoid spicy and high-fat foods, as these are harder to digest.,
Avoid dairy foods, except for yogurt containing live bacteria.,
Keep a food diary to identify which foods cause diarrhea.,
Drink plenty of fluids.",How to Stop Diarrhea During Early Pregnancy1," The BRAT diet is great for pregnant women who are suffering from diarrhoea as the foods it contains are low in fiber and easy to digest, but still highly nutritious. The BRAT diet is easy on the gastrointestinal tract and rarely causes diarrhea.Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to replace the potassium potassium that is lost during diarrhea / diarrhoea. Bananas also help to thicken the stool, which prevent diarrhoea.
Applesauce (made at home using only apples) contains pectin, which helps to thicken stool. It's also high in natural sugars, which provides energy.
Rice and toast are simple foods which are easily digested. They also work as binding agents to thicken the stool.;
, Clear soups and broths contain no solid particles so they require little to no digestion. This means that they are very unlikely to cause problems making them a great choice for expectant mothers during early pregnancy. Eating clear soups and broths can be combined with the BRAT diet to ensure that you are getting all of your required vitamins and nutrients.
When following this diet, try to eat five or six smaller meals a day, rather than three large ones, as this further decreases the chance of diarrhea and helps to keep your energy levels up.

, Spicy foods and food that contains high amounts of fat are much more likely to cause diarrhea, as they are difficult to digest and may irritate the gastrointestinal tract.Stay away from high fat meat products such as bacon and fatty red meat. Instead, opt for low-fat proteins such as turkey, skinless chicken breasts and white fish. You should also avoid cooking with too much oil or butter.
Stay away from spicy foods such as most Asian, Indian and Mexican cuisines. Avoid cooking with hot spices or peppers at home.

, Many women become lactose intolerant during pregnancy, which means that you may experience diarrhea after drinking milk or eating other dairy products.


The one exception to this is yogurt containing live bacteria such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium. The organisms in the yogurt help to kill harmful bacteria in the digestive system that cause diarrhea.
If you do eat dairy products, opt for the low-fat varieties, as these are less likely to irritate the digestive system.

, Some women are particularly sensitive to certain types of foods during pregnancy, even foods that they ate on a regular basis before getting pregnant.


As a result, it can be difficult to identify exactly which foods are causing the problem. Therefore, it may be a good idea to keep a food diary, where you make a note of all of the foods that you eat and the corresponding bowel movements.
This will help you to identify which foods are causing the diarrhea, so you can make an effort to avoid them in future.

, Diarrhea often leads to dehydration, as you are losing a lot of fluid through your bowel movements. As a result, it is important to drink lots of water to stay hydrated. Aim to drink a minimum of six 8 oz. glasses of water per day, and more if possible.


You can also stay hydrated by sucking on ice cubes or water-based popsicles, drinking plenty of herbal teas, and eating fruit and veg with a high water content, such as watermelon, cucumber, tomatoes, beets and grapes.

Avoid a diet heavy in fish.,
Use healthy cooking oils.,
Eat walnuts.",How to Take Omega 3 in Pregnancy1," Although fish are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, there is considerable risk of mercury accumulation in your body with regular consumption. Mercury can have a toxic affect on brain cells and may harm your baby, so limit fish intake during pregnancy.;
, Flaxseed oil, linseed oil, canola oil, and olive oil contain omega-3 fatty acids without the risk of mercury.

, Walnuts are a mercury-free source of healthy omega-3 fatty acids. A small handful of walnuts each day can help you get a risk-free dose of omega-3 fatty acids without any health risks.

Take supplements for sleep.",How to Sleep with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome While Pregnant," Sleeping on your side allows for good blood flow for both you and the baby, and helps to prevent unwanted problems from developing. Your left side is the preferred side, but either side is fine.Bend your knees and place a pillow between your legs.
As your pregnancy advances, you may find additional relief from placing a pillow behind your back.
Try using extra pillows to prop your head up if you are having trouble with indigestion or heartburn during the night.
Try placing a small pillow beneath your abdomen, in addition to the one between your knees, if you are having trouble with back pain.;
, Place your hands in a neutral position as you get comfortable to fall asleep. Relax your hands and be sure your wrists are not bent at all. If possible, rest your hand and wrist on a pillow slightly higher than your chest. Be sure this is a comfortable position for you.


By raising your wrist, you are helping to reduce the amount of fluid and swelling that is pressing on the nerve.
Some women find it helpful to place their hand on a small pillow, sliding it between the pillowcase and pillow. This helps them to maintain a neutral hand position throughout the night.

, As your pregnancy progresses, you will have extra weight and body changes that may cause unwanted symptoms to develop depending on your sleep positions. Plus, you may develop new problems that can be prevented by sleeping on your side.Possible complications caused by sleeping on your back include back pain, hemorrhoids, problems breathing, heartburn and indigestion, blood pressure changes, and a decrease in circulation to your own heart and to the baby.
Sleeping on your stomach causes prolonged pressure against your abdomen. This position can put pressure on major blood vessels and arteries interfering with the blood supply, plus this position will not be very comfortable as your pregnancy progresses.

, Do not place your hands under your cheek or neck area, or under any part of your body. This action adds pressure to your wrist area that is already compressed. It also increases the chances of your wrist becoming bent while you are sleeping. Avoid any sleeping positions that place pressure on your wrist or cause your wrist to bend in any direction.
As you change positions during the night, be sure you do not end up sleeping on one of your hands. Clearly you cannot lay on your side and elevate both wrists on pillows, all at the same time.
If you are having symptoms in both wrists, then consider placing a small but thick pillow on each side of you. As you turn to your other side, the extra pillow is within reach to rest your other wrist and hand in a neutral position.
Find a comfortable, but neutral position for the lower hand. It may be possible to slide the lower hand and wrist under the small pillow without adding any pressure and without bending your wrist.

, The cold from an ice pack, frozen gel pack, or even a bag of frozen vegetables can help reduce inflammation and reduce pain. Wrap the ice pack in a thin towel and apply it to your wrist for 10 to 15 minutes. The relief will be temporary, but it may give you enough relief so that you can fall asleep.

Never apply ice or a frozen item directly to your skin — always wrap it in something, such as a towel or a t-shirt. Otherwise you risk frostbite.

, Use a brace or splint when you sleep. This is a good way to prevent bending the palm area down toward the wrist as you sleep. Bending the wrist in either direction restricts blood flow and adds pressure to the nerve that is already pinched or compressed.Many women find they get the most symptom relief from wearing a wrist brace while sleeping.
Braces and splints can help to keep your wrists and hands in a neutral position so that you can avoid feeling pain during the night and avoid placing added pressure on the nerve.
You can buy splints and braces at your local drugstore.
You can also wrap your wrist. Click here to learn how to wrap a wrist that is plagued by carpal tunnel. Take care that any device or wrap you use is not too tight.

, While exercise is an important part of maintaining your health during your pregnancy, some exercises may worsen your symptoms of carpal tunnel.Exercises that involve tight gripping include holding tightly to the handles of a treadmill, stair climber, or elliptical machine.
Consider replacing those exercises with a recumbent bicycle or other activity that does not require tight gripping.
Adjust your muscle training workout to include exercises and the use of strength training equipment, such as manipulating weights, that do not put any pressure on your wrists.
Either avoid certain exercises or loosen your grip. Be sure you can perform the exercises safely if you choose to continue but without gripping tightly.

, Focus on exercising the tendons and ligaments in your hand, wrist, and arm, to add strength, reduce swelling in the area, and work towards improving your range of motion.Extend and stretch your wrist. Hold one arm out in front with your wrist bent, fingers pointing upward, and palm facing out. Use the fingers of your other hand to push back on your raised fingers, towards your chest, until you feel tension but not pain.

Hold this position for about 20 seconds, then repeat twice on each hand. Do this three times daily.


Flex your wrist. Hold one hand in front with palm facing your chest. Use the fingers of the other hand to push along the finger area of the raised hand. Push towards your chest allowing your wrist to bend. Stop when you feel tension, but not pain, and hold the position.

Hold the position for about 20 seconds and repeat the stretch twice with each hand. Do this three times daily.


Rotate your wrists. Keep your upper arms at your sides and bend your elbows so both hands are extended in front of you, with palms facing each other. Rotate your hands upward focusing on bending at the wrist and not the elbows or shoulders. Rotate upwards 15 times then downward 15 times. Repeat this exercise three times a day.

, Consider hand massages in addition to the stretching exercises. Work with a physical therapist to learn the best techniques for massage that will relieve the pressure on the nerve.In addition to hand massages, consider getting routine upper back and neck massages. This may help relieve tension in the area and help with your upper body posture.
Neck cramps and rolled shoulders may be contributing to the stress and pressure from your upper body muscles, down your arms, and to your wrists and hands.
Participate in prenatal yoga or stretching exercise programs designed to strengthen and balance joints in the arms, wrists, hands, and upper body joints like your shoulders.
Keep your hands warm to improve blood flow and reduce pain in the wrist area.

, Applying pressure at specific points may help to relieve some of the discomfort. If you are unable to apply enough pressure yourself, such as in cases where both hands are affected by carpal tunnel, then ask someone to help. Apply pressure at a point referred to as pericardium point 6.To locate this area, relax your arm and hand, and rest your wrist area with the palm facing upward. Measure three finger widths from the point where your wrist naturally bends, measuring up your arm towards your elbow or shoulder.
The point is located in a small dip in the skin, central to the flattened arm, and within the tendons, bones, and ligaments in the area. This might be an area where the clasp or buckle of a watch might normally rest.
Apply firm pressure to that spot. It may feel as if it is bruised.
Hold the pressure for ten seconds then repeat three times. Do the same thing to your other wrist. Repeat this procedure several times each day.

, While the scientific research in the field of reflexology is somewhat limited, studies find some forms of reflexology to be possibly helpful. Relief of pain is one area that was determined to be possibly effective. This technique may be helpful during the night when you experience carpal tunnel pain.To relieve the pain and discomfort from carpal tunnel symptoms, the reflex target point is on your foot. Use the foot that is on the same side of the body associated with the pain.
Locate the point by finding the base of your fourth toe. Imagine a straight line coming back towards your ankle from the toe. You may need to ask someone to help you.
The most tender spot is located about 2 cm, or 0.8 inches, from the base of the fourth toe along the straight line and back towards your ankle.
Press on the center of the most tender spot as firmly as possible with your thumb. Try to apply constant pressure until the tender feeling subsides.
Repeat the pressure applications four to five times. The point you are pressing on should begin to feel less tender. The pain in your wrist should be reduced by applying pressure to this point on your foot.

, If the symptoms are persistent, severe, and do not improve with other treatment steps, steroid injections into the wrist area may be helpful. This is considered only in extreme cases.Cortisone injections use technology to guide the medication administration directly into the carpal tunnel area.
The benefit of the injections often last for several months.
In extreme cases, a small surgical procedure may be performed. Exhaust all other treatment options before considering any surgical procedure during your pregnancy.

, During your pregnancy, it may become difficult for you to get the rest you need for reasons beyond your control. Your typical sleep habits and routines may need some attention during this time to help you fall asleep and stay asleep longer.Avoid eating snacks or heavy meals close to bedtime and cut back on the fluids you drink in the late afternoon and evening. Stay away from caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and throughout the entire day unless your doctor has approved some caffeine.
Limit your naps during the day. Keep nap times short and do not nap within four hours of bedtime.
Keep to a regular schedule. Go to bed at the same time every night, and get up at the same time each morning.

, Do what you can to make your bedroom and bed as comfortable as possible. Take steps to add pillows, curtains, or adjust the temperature, so you can fall asleep easier and stay asleep as long as possible.Make your bedroom as dark as possible. The darkness tells your brain it is time to sleep.
Turn down the temperature so the bedroom is cool.
If you are having nasal congestion or problems with sinuses during the night, consider adding a small room humidifier to your bedroom.
Don’t watch television, play video games, use your laptop, or any screened device, in your bedroom or just prior to bed. Keep your bedroom for sleep and sex only.
Stop tossing and turning. If you cannot sleep, then get up, go into another room, and relax until you feel sleepy.

, Always check with your doctor before you start anything new, including herbal tea products.Herbal teas that may be helpful include chamomile, catnip, and oatstraw.
Drink your tea warmed and about an hour before bedtime.
Add a small but healthy snack with your tea that is high in protein, such as a small serving of nuts or turkey.
Avoid or limit your caffeine intake. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends 2 cups of coffee a day (about 200 mg per day)., Be sure to ask your doctor about taking anything new, including over-the-counter sleep aids or supplements, before you start taking them.Ask your doctor about taking a low dose of magnesium. Magnesium is recognized as helping with muscle pain that can sometimes make it hard to fall asleep.
Melatonin is a supplement that works to promote sleep, but there is some controversy about using melatonin in pregnancy.
Be sure you talk to your doctor before you add melatonin, or change anything about the medicines, herbal products, or supplements you take.

Consider eating smaller, more frequent meals.,
Notice what triggers burping.,
Aim for balanced meals.,
Avoid foods that cause gas.,
Drink lots of water.,
Cut down on carbonated beverages.,
Try herbal tea.,
Eat slowly.,
Reduce the amount of air you swallow when drinking.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Quit smoking.,
Stay calm, and carry on.,
Practice mindful meditation.,
Sign up for a yoga or meditation class specifically designed for pregnant women.,
Exercise regularly.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Stop Burping During Pregnancy," Large meals can make you burp more and feel even more bloated. Instead of eating standard three meals a day as you normally would, consider eating six small, evenly-spaced meals.Aside from minimizing excessive burping, a switch to six small meals may also help you cope with morning sickness. Many women find that having a little bit of food in their stomachs at all times reduces their nausea.
Avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. Allow yourself time for digestion, even of a smaller meal.;
, Your body's hormones will change during pregnancy. Your reaction to foods will be different. A food journal is one way to learn more about your body's response to particular foods. If you notice that eating certain foods is followed by burping, see if avoiding these foods results in less burping.


Common triggers for burping during pregnancy are fruit juices, chocolate, or rich foods.Drinking a glass of milk may help relieve gas, particularly when accompanied by heartburn.

, Try to make each small meal include a lean protein, a complex or starchy carbohydrate, and a fruit and/or vegetable. In particular, lean proteins are a great way to add nutrients and cause very little gas.Small balanced meals will give you the vitamins, minerals, protein, antioxidants, fiber, and other nutrients that you need.
Eating too much at one time, or too quickly, will often cause burping. Eating slowing, chewing each bite well, will help prevent burping.

, There are some foods that are worse than others when it comes to gas. Some of these include: beans, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and bran. Try to avoid eating these items if you want to reduce the amount of burping you are doing.You should also stay away from sugar-free products, as they could contain maltitol and sorbitol, both of which have a tendency to cause gas.
Fatty, fried foods often trigger burping and heartburn. Choosing grilled, steamed or baked foods is a better choice.

, Water helps you digest your food more efficiently and therefore will help you reduce how much you burp. When you become pregnant, your muscles relax more than usual. Muscle relaxation causes your digestion process to slow down and causes gases to build up. Water will help flush your system and reduce the gases stuck in your digestive track.Aim to drink 64 ounces (or more) of liquid every day, mostly water. Drinking water actually helps to prevent water retention, which is another undesirable effect of pregnancy.
Caffeinated teas, coffee and other beverages should be limited to 200 mg per day. Usually this translates into a 12-ounce cup.
Water carries nutrients to your baby too, and will prevent dehydration. If you don't like the taste of water, try adding a wedge of lemon or lime, or a sprig of fresh mint.

, Sodas and other carbonated drinks contain compressed gases that encourage burping. Avoid them if you want to stop burping so often.Be aware that many sodas contain high caloric content as well as caffeine. If you choose to drink soda during pregnancy, drink it sparingly.
Diet sodas should be avoided altogether during pregnancy. Research has shown that consuming diet soda may cause preterm delivery., Peppermint is a carminative – an herb or preparation that prevents the formation of gas in the gastrointestinal tract or facilitates its expulsion. Drinking peppermint tea may help reduce burping.Chamomile tea also has a similar effect on the body.
There are many other carminatives, and some of them – including cinnamon, garlic, and ginger – are easy to incorporate into your diet. Talk to your doctor, though, before trying other herbal remedies, as they may not all be safe to take during pregnancy.

, When you eat too fast, you'll be swallowing air along with your food. This results in burping. Eating quickly may also be a sign of stress, which is connected to increased gas production.Avoid this issue by sitting up straight, eating slowly, and chewing your food thoroughly.
You should also avoid talking while you eat because you are unknowingly swallowing more air when you talk and chew.
If you think you may have had a meal that might make you burp a lot, go for a stroll after you eat. Walking will help to move the food through your digestive track and reduce the desire to burp.

, Avoid this problem by practicing good posture, sitting up straight when you drink. Drinking directly from a cup or glass will help prevent swallowing air.You should also avoid switching quickly from hot to cold beverages (and vice versa), as sudden changes in stomach temperature can make you swallow more air.
Bending over to drink from a water fountain results in swallowing air, leading to burping. Carry a water bottle, and fill it from a water fountain when needed.

, Drinking alcoholic beverages increase stomach acidity, leading you to swallow more air. It also increases the chances of certain birth defects. Medical practitioners recommend eliminating alcohol completely, especially during the initial stages of pregnancy.If you feel that eliminating alcohol from your diet will be difficult for you, ask for help. If you don't feel comfortable talking to your medical provider about this issue, there are many anonymous help lines that you can call.
Certain studies suggest that very light alcohol use in the latter stages of pregnancy will not result in harm. Light use means one to two alcohol units per week (one to two 5 ounce glasses of wine).More than six units per day can result in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a lifelong pervasive developmental disorder.

, Smoking causes you to swallow air, which leads to increased gas and burping. In addition, smoking cigarettes is the leading cause of adverse outcomes for babies.Cigarette smoke contains over 4000 chemicals. Many are toxic to you and your baby. As the baby's only source of oxygen is the air you consume, these chemicals have a huge impact on your baby's development.
Ask your medical provider for help quitting smoking.

, Tension and anxiety aren’t helpful to you or your baby, and they can increase gas and burping..


This is a chance to engage in low-key activities you enjoy. Watching movies with friends, reading a book, or getting a massage can be therapeutic as well as fun.
Deep sighs can also cause you to swallow more air than normal, which in turn leads to gas.

, Along with helping you relax, meditation will also help you to breath more calmly and effectively, thus eliminating any extra air you might be swallowing.Meditation has multiple benefits. It has been shown effective to minimize mood swings, to increase self-awareness, and decrease stress, which has a direct correlation to burping.
You can practice mindfulness meditation in almost any setting.

Understand how water helps connect the baby to you.",How to Stay Hydrated During Pregnancy," One way to make sure you drink enough is to measure out your water in the morning. You can use refillable water bottles, water jugs, or even a pitcher. Pour in the amount you need to drink (10 cups), and you have a visual reminder of what you need to drink that day., You don't need to just stick to water to help you stay hydrated. Milk, juice, and herbal tea also count. However, be aware that milk and juice will add extra calories to your diet. Also, it's not a good idea to drink some herbal teas while you're pregnant, so check with your doctor or nurse about which ones are safe.You can also drink veggie juices. Just make sure to stick to the low sodium varieties., Drinking flavored waters can help you drink more because they taste good. If you want to avoid artificial sweeteners, pick ones that just have flavoring and not any added sweetness. These beverages are available at most grocery stores., Another way to encourage yourself to drink more is to make your own flavored waters at home. Try dropping a few pieces of your favorite fruit (or even a veggie!) into a glass of water, such as a couple of slices of orange. You can also try a few slices of cucumber or some mint and some muddled blackberries. Having flavored water can encourage you to drink more.

, While you don't need to completely cut out caffeine while pregnant, you shouldn't drink more than 200 milligrams a day, which is about 2 cups of coffee.However, because caffeine is a diuretic, meaning it makes you urinate more, you may want to cut it out altogether, as it can increase dehydration.Always check with your doctor about things like drinking caffeine while pregnant. Only your doctor knows your personal health profile and how outside stimulants will affect you.

, Some water bottles have built-in tracking devices that tell you how much water you drink. Another option is a tracker that you can attach to any bottle. It measures how much you drink, as well as reminds you to drink if you haven't done so in a while. Most of these devices will interface with a smartphone, making keeping track easier., Your diet actually provides a portion of your water intake for the day. Leafy greens like spinach and lettuce, for instance, provide a good amount of water, as do other veggies like cucumbers or tomatoes. Eating more of these types of veggies can help you stay hydrated., Another option for upping your hydration level is to eat more watery fruits. Watermelon and cantaloupe are excellent choices, as are other melons. Fruits like strawberries and oranges also contain a good amount of water., Smoothies are a great way to both get your veggies and fruits in and increase your water intake.Try a green smoothie for the highest nutrient hit, with greens, fruit, and a liquid. You can also add in protein like yogurt.The ratio you should follow is one part greens, one part liquid (like milk or almond milk), and one and half parts fruit, such as one cup of spinach, one cup of milk, and 1 1/2 cups of mango and blueberries. Blend it together well with a little ice. You can also add things like flaxseeds or nut butters.

, Soups are also high in water content, particularly brothy soups like chicken noodle soup, miso soup, or French onion soup. You can also sip on some vegetable broth before dinner. Just make sure to keep an eye on the salt content, as prepackaged soups can contain a significant amount., When you're pregnant, you may be susceptible to vomiting due to morning sickness. You may also have trouble keeping anything down.

This condition is usually diagnosed by the fact that you vomit four or more times a day, are becoming dehydrated, lose weight, and/or are becoming lightheaded or dizzy.
You may be able to take nausea medications to help with this condition.
Also, try eating small, bland meals so that you are less likely to throw them up, such as oatmeal.
You can also try other alternative methods for treating nausea, such as using a pressure point band. Wearing a pressure point band on the wrist helps some people with nausea. Also, ask your doctor about vitamin B6 and the use of ginger to help with nausea.

, When you're dehydrated, you'll likely feel more tired and lightheaded. You're urine will be darker, and you may have more trouble defecating. You may get a headache, and you'll likely feel extra thirsty with a dry throat and mouth.If you're showing these symptoms, make an effort to re-hydrate yourself by drinking extra work.

, If you are showing more extreme signs of dehydration, you need to seek medical attention immediately, as they are more serious. Dehydration can harm both you and the baby if left unchecked.Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you haven't urinated for 8 hours. Another severe symptom is a quick or faint heartbeat. Blood in your stool and fainting are also bad signs.
You may need to have fluids given to you intravenously.

, With a larger body and a baby growing inside you, you need to make sure you are drinking more water than you normally do. The Institute of Medicine suggests that pregnant women should get at least 10 cups of water everyday., One reason you need more water is water helps you absorb nutrients and carry them to your baby through blood cells. Without enough water, your baby doesn't get the nutrients it needs.Water also helps with digestion and the removing of extra waste (that the fetus is producing) from your body., Water also plays an important role in creating the placenta, which is how your fetus draws nutrients from you. Therefore, it's important to get enough water for this process.Water also helps create the amniotic sac later, which is where your baby grows.

However, you can also have a session with someone who specializes in helping people to quit smoking. These sessions can help you create a strategic plan for quitting designed just for you., Managing stress can become more difficult when you try to quit because you probably used your smoking time as a way to take a break and give yourself a moment of quiet.In other words, you're going to need to find new ways to take time out from your day to relax.


One method is deep breathing. Take a moment to close your eyes. Draw in a deep breath through your nose to the count of 5 (in your head). Hold it for 5 to 10 counts, then slowly let it out through your mouth. Repeat until you feel yourself calm down.
Start a stress journal. Take some time each night to write down things that are stressing you. The action of writing it down can actually help you de-stress.
Exercise when possible. Exercise is a great way to deal with stress. While pregnant, you may decide you want to try some different exercises than you normally do, such as swimming or walking., You'll have symptoms of withdrawal for up to 3 weeks or so. These symptoms can include restlessness, depression, having trouble concentrating, and being abnormally irritable. Of course, pregnancy can lead to some of these symptoms, as well.Many of the suggestions in this section can help with withdrawal symptoms. For instance, deep breathing can help with restlessness and having trouble concentrating, while exercise can help with anxiety, depression, and restlessness.
Another way you can help yourself with these symptoms is to cut down on caffeine if you're feeling restless or having negative thoughts. Also, don't forget to tell yourself that these thoughts will not last. You just have to get through a week or two.
It can also help to lean on your friends. If you're feeling down, plan a fun get-together with a couple of friends., Nicotine replacements include patches, gums, and sprays, though you want to skip the tablets while pregnant. While nicotine may not be completely safe for your baby (not enough research has been done on just nicotine to determine how safe it is for pregnant women), it's safer than cigarettes since it only has one chemical (nicotine) rather than the wide range of chemicals in cigarettes. Plus, it makes it easier for many people to quit. Make sure to talk to doctor before starting on one of these regimens.The nicotine in these replacements can help with your withdrawal symptoms. For instance, you apply a patch to your skin once a day, and it provides a steady supply of nicotine to help reduce your cravings.
Generally, you taper off on these medications, as well. For instance, with the patches, you usually switch to a lower dose after 2 weeks., This drug is sometimes used as an antidepressant, but it can also help you quit smoking. Science hasn't quite figured out why it can help you quit smoking, but it can help for many people. Once again, you'll need to talk to your doctor about this drug, especially since it's a prescription medication.Unfortunately, this drug can have some side effects for many people. It can increase your chance of a seizure if you're already inclined to have them.

In addition, it affects your placenta, also making it more difficult for your baby to get nutrients and oxygen.In addition, smoking can cause the placenta to separate from your womb earlier than it should, which can make you bleed, a dangerous side effect.After every cigarette you smoke, your baby moves less for at least an hour, including practicing how to breathe.

, Smoking, even secondhand smoke, can cause issues for your child. For one, it can lead to a baby who's underweight. While that doesn't sound terrible, that can lead to further health problems with your baby., Smoking can cause your baby to be born too early, which in turn can cause a whole plethora of health problems, as your baby is not fully developed and ready to be out of the womb. In addition, it can cause you to miscarry completely., Smoking puts your baby at risk for birth defects. One common birth defect associated with smoking is cleft lip. It can also put your baby at a higher risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) after birth, which is a syndrome that causes your baby to die suddenly, though the exact cause of this syndrome isn't known., You may think that cutting back is enough to save your baby from harm. However, the truth is that even smoking a little every day can still harm your child, as the chemicals from the cigarettes are still being passed from you to him or her., You may think that if you're already partway through your pregnancy, quitting doesn't matter as much, as you've already exposed your baby to harm. However, the truth is that quitting even partway through your pregnancy can increase your baby's chances of being healthy, particularly if you quit before the first trimester is over."

Get on a sleep schedule.,
Avoid heavy meals before bed.,
Limit liquid intake close to bedtime.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Make sure you have a solid sleep environment.",How to Sleep While Pregnant2," A solid sleep schedule is good for anyone's sleep hygiene, and may help improve rest when you're pregnant. You will fall asleep and wake up easier if you get yourself on a sleep schedule. This means going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time each day, even weekends. When your body is on a regular sleep/wake cycle, you'll get tired at night and then energetic in the morning., Indigestion and nausea are common problems during pregnancy. You can exasperate these issues if you eat a heavy meal before bed. Try to stick to light snacks in the hours leading up to bedtime and don’t eat within two to three hours of going to bed.It may help to schedule your big meals around lunch and dinner. Eating a big breakfast and a heavy lunch can stave off feelings of hunger at night.
If you're feeling hungry or nauseous before bed, try having a few plain crackers. This can fill up your stomach and may prevent nighttime nausea.
It is important to avoid eating within two to three hours of going to sleep because this can increase your chances of developing heartburn.

, When you're pregnant, you will urinate more due to the baby pressing down on your bladder. It's a good idea to cut back on liquids in the hours leading up to bedtime. Fluid intake throughout the day is important, so do not neglect water during daytime hours. Simply cut back on fluids close to bedtime.Caffeinated beverages, like teas and coffees, are a particularly big culprit in keeping you awake at night. As you should limit your caffeine intake when pregnant, it may be a good idea to cut out caffeinated beverages altogether during your pregnancy.

, If you're having trouble sleeping, try relaxation exercises. They can get your mind off of the stress of your pregnancy, as well as any bothersome physical symptoms.You can try a breathing exercise. Breathe in and out in slow, steady breaths. Focus on the air going in and out of your lungs. If there is any tension in your body, release that tension as you breathe. If your mind starts to wander, bring it back to the breath.
Try guided imagery. Imagine a relaxing scenario, like a childhood home or an ideal vacation. Take a mental vacation to that place and try to let go of other thoughts. Imagine all aspects of your imagined getaway, including sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste.

, Where you're sleeping can have an impact on the quality of your sleep. If you're struggling to sleep while pregnant, evaluate your room and make any necessary changes.Try dimming the lights in your room before bed. This will alert your body that it's time to sleep.
Make sure your room environment is relaxing. A room should be calm and peaceful. If your room is cluttered, this can make sleep difficult.
Reduce any bothersome noise. If you live in a noisy neighborhood, use a fan or a noise machine to block out unwanted sounds. Keep your windows closed at night to reduce outside sound.
Remove any blue light sources from your bedroom as well, such as TVs, computer screens, tablets, digital alarm clocks, and cell phones.

Exercise.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Have bland snacks throughout the day.,
Take daytime naps on occasion.",How to Sleep While Pregnant3," Exercising every day can help to regulate sleep during pregnancy as well. Get some physical exercise in every day. Try to get your exercise in the morning or early afternoon because exercising too close to bedtime can make it hard to fall asleep. If you want to do something physical in the evening, do something relaxing like yoga. This may have a positive impact on your sleep.Try taking a 30 minute walk when you wake up in the morning or after eating lunch.
Exercise is safe for most pregnant women. However, talk to your doctor first if you have any health issues, or have had difficult pregnancies in the past. You want to make sure exercise is safe for you and your baby.

, As nausea and heartburn are a major culprit in sleepless nights when pregnant, work on regulating your diet. If you feed your body healthy foods rich in vitamins and nutrients, this may lessen symptoms of nausea associated with pregnancy.Avoid acidic and spicy foods, as these can make heartburn worse.
Eat a balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables. Strive for lean proteins and complex carbs like whole grain bread, rice, and pasta.

, Make sure to snack throughout the day, but go for bland foods like plain crackers. Such foods can help lessen nausea, which often keeps pregnant women awake during the night.Watch your calories, however. It's healthy to gain weight during pregnancy, but only up to a certain amount. Many types of crackers and bland snacks contain a lot of empty calories, so keep an eye on portion size to avoid overeating.

, Naps are usually not advised as they can make it difficult to sleep at night. However, if you're pregnant, naps can actually be helpful.

Watch what you eat.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Drink non-caffeinated beverages.",How to Sleep Well During Pregnancy1," When you are pregnant, you need to watch the foods that you eat carefully, especially any that you consume shortly before going to bed.

Exercise as much as you can.,
Unwind at night.,
Make sure that you keep up a regular daily routine.,
Use your bed only for bedtime activities.",How to Sleep Well During Pregnancy2," You should not neglect your exercise routine just because you are pregnant. Keeping a regular exercise routine can help to make you tired enough to fall asleep as soon as your head touches the pillow. It is important, however, not to exercise immediately before you go to bed. The adrenaline rush that comes with exercise can have the opposite effect of keeping you awake instead of tiring you out.


Women often experience leg cramps during their pregnancy. Exercise can be helpful in working out those leg muscles and keeping them from waking you up during the night.
Always listen to your doctor if he or she tells you to avoid strenuous exercise. If you are worried about what exercises are appropriate for you, talk to your doctor to get some suggestions., Instead of doing stressful or strenuous activities in the afternoon and at night, try to do more calming activities. This doesn't mean you can't do anything, it just means that you should take the two to three hours before bedtime to do something fun and relaxing. Don't stress about work or the future. This will only make you anxious and make it harder for you to go to sleep at night. Instead, read, meditate, or watch your favorite show.


You can also try yoga a few hours before you go to bed. This can help relax you as well as be counted as your daily exercise. Make sure you find a good prenatal routine that works for you.Ask your partner to give you a massage to ease your shoulders, neck, back, or feet.This may help you relax and begin to feel sleepy.
In the half hour to hour before bed, steer clear of too much mental stimulation and light. The light from electronics can decrease the production of melatonin, a hormone your body produces to help you sleep. Try reading or listening to music instead of playing on your phone or computer or watching TV.
In the few minutes right before bed, just take a minute and relax with no stimulation at all. Stop reading, turn off the music, and just let your body finish unwinding for a good night's sleep., If you try to force yourself to go to bed at the same time each night, it will help your body develop a regular sleep pattern routine. By doing so, your body will become tired at the same time every night, thus making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.It is also okay to add a nap to your regular sleep routine, but only short ones. Napping for a short time during the day, around 30 minutes, can actually help you sleep better at night by making sure that you are not overly tired. Sometimes it can be hard to get to sleep when you are exhausted. Just make sure you don't sleep too long and substitute restful nighttime sleep for daytime napping., Don't use your bed for work, paying bills, or any other activity that could make you associate your bed with stress or discomfort. Instead, only do those activities in your bed that belong there, such as sleep and sex. This way, your body will be conditioned to do associate your bed with restful, good things instead of stress.


It shouldn't be a problem if you read before bed while in your bed. Just make sure it's pleasure reading and not anything for work or class that might stress you out."

If you can't afford a new mattress, try a mattress pad. This could help your back and legs when you sleep without much added expense.
Make sure your sheets and comforter are also comfortable. You don't want to have a great mattress ruined with bad bed covers. Make sure you get a fabric you like and a comforter or blanket that matches your temperature needs at night., Pregnant women generate a lot of extra heat, so try to keep your room at a cooler temperature to accommodate this factor. Keep an extra blanket near you so that you can cover up if you get cooler during the night because of the cooler temperature.


It is better to be a little cold than too hot when it comes to sleeping. It is very hard to sleep comfortably when you are too hot.
This temperature may vary depending on your personal body temperature. Keep working at it to find the right temperature for you.68–69°F (20–20.6°C) seems to work for most people

, If you are used to sleeping on your back or stomach, you are going to have to adjust to a new sleeping position while you are pregnant, which can be very difficult at first. When you are pregnant, it is best to sleep on your left side, according to the American Pregnancy Association. This position helps increase blood and nutrient flow to the developing baby and it is comfortable for you.


It can also help to sleep with a cushion between your legs or with your legs propped up on a cushion or a couple of pillows. This can help to keep your blood circulating to you and the baby and help you sleep better.
Consider purchasing a body pillow designed especially for pregnant women., If you tend to have heartburn no matter what you do, try to sleep in an upright position by using pillows to prop yourself up — just make sure you still sleep on your side. Also, keeping some TUMS close by during the night can help get heartburn under control if and when it strikes.


You can also try keeping a light snack like crackers near your bed so that you can snack on them if you are prone to waking up and feeling nausea during the night.
Taking TUMS is safe while pregnant. However, ask your doctor before taking other antacids that include sodium bicarbonate, such as Alka-Seltzer and Zegerid."

Do strengthening exercises once your wrist is strong enough.",How to Reduce Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel During Pregnancy," Ice therapy is an excellent pain reliever and anti-inflammatory treatment, as it helps numb throbbing pain very quickly. Ice can also reduce inflammation by slowing the blood flow to the site of the injury.Use a cold pack, or wrap some ice cubes in a clean dish towel.You can also run your wrists under cold tap water for 10 minutes at a time.Do not apply ice packs for longer than 20 minutes at a time. Remove the ice for at least 10 minutes before reapplying it.Some people find that alternating cold and hot therapies can be effective for reducing carpel tunnel pain. To do this, alternate between an ice compress and a hot compress for one minute each, over the course of five to six minutes. If alternating between hot and cold therapies, you can repeat the treatment routine three to four times each day.;
, Many people find that wearing a wrist splint can help reduce the wrist's movement while CTS symptoms persist. This allows the wrist to remain relatively stable in order to heal.Splints can typically be purchased at most pharmacies without a prescription. Depending on the severity of your CTS, your doctor may recommend a specialized splint.Many people with CTS use wrist splints at night to prevent inadvertently painful movements, such as rolling over during sleep., Rest is important to recover from any injury, as it allows the body time to heal. This is particularly important when it comes to high-use body parts like the hands and wrists.Reduce or eliminate non-required activities. Avoid doing anything strenuous with the hands or wrists as much as possible while healing from CTS., During rest, it can be helpful to elevate the forearm and hand (or both, if experiencing CTS in both wrists). Elevating an injury can help reduce swelling and inflammation by slowing down blood flow.To elevate the arms, use a pillow or a clean, rolled-up towel., It’s best to sleep on your side or back when pregnant. Make sure hands are not clenched, but are in a neutral relaxed position. If sleeping on your side, you can use a pillow to rest your hand on, maintaining a neutral position. If you wake up in the middle of the night with numbness or tingling, try shaking out your hand until the pain goes away. Always make sure your wrists are not bent while sleeping, or that you are sleeping on your hands. A splint may help to keep the wrists straight.

, Carpel tunnel syndrome reduces mobility in the wrist, and can make it difficult to do even the most basic manual functions. One way to strengthen the wrist is by building up strength using repetition of gentle movements. Flexing the wrist up and down can help increase mobility and rebuild your range of motion.Keep your fingers straight and extend your arm straight out in front of you.Bend the wrist forwards and backwards, lifting the whole hand up and down in gentle, alternating motions.If you have trouble doing this exercise with your arm out in front of you, you can extend your arm across a table or armrest with the wrist hanging over the edge.Repeat this exercise 10 times each day., In addition to decreased wrist mobility, many people who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome find it difficult to move their fingers or form a fist. In addition to wrist exercises, it's equally important to rebuild strength and mobility in the fingers and hand.Form a fist with your hand, and squeeze your fist as hard as you can without causing pain.Hold the fist for five to 10 seconds before straightening the fingers back into an extended position.Repeat this exercise 10 times each day., A comprehensive carpal tunnel exercise regimen should work to strengthen all parts of the hand and wrist. Each of the individual fingers may experience a reduced range of motion, so it's important to focus on every individual digit of the hand.Touch your index finger to your thumb, forming an ""O"" shape (like the sign for ""okay"").Move down the hand, touching each individual finger to the thumb.Repeat this exercise 10 times, working your way up and down the row of fingers.

, Most pregnancy-induced cases of carpal tunnel syndrome tend to clear up on their own within a few weeks after the baby is born.However, some cases of pregnancy-related CTS can persist upwards of six months after the delivery.If CTS is treated early on, it is often easy to manage the symptoms until the pain clears up on its own. However, if CTS goes untreated, it may progress and cause extensive damage.In severe cases when CTS goes untreated, it may require surgery or therapy., Your doctor may advise you against taking pain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) while pregnant. After the baby has been born, however, your doctor may recommend that you take medication to help alleviate the pain.It's important to talk to your doctor about whether certain medications could affect your child through breast milk, if you plan on breastfeeding your child.Common pain medications include NSAIDs like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. For more serious pain, your doctor may recommend a prescription-strength pain medication., Depending on the severity of your carpal tunnel syndrome, your doctor may recommend corticosteroid injections. Corticosteroids, such as cortisone, can help relieve swelling and inflammation, which in turn can relieve the pressure on the nerves in your wrist.Orally-administered corticosteroids are not as effective as injections for treating CTS., Most cases of pregnancy-related CTS will not require surgery. However, if you're prone to carpal tunnel pain and your symptoms do not clear up after you've had your baby, your doctor may recommend surgery as an option. Surgery does carry risks, including the risk of nerve or vascular injuries that could permanently restrict your range of motion. Surgical options are generally safe, though, and may be effective for long-term pain relief.Endoscopic surgery is a CTS procedure in which a surgeon uses an endoscope (a long, thin telescoping instrument) to enter the carpal tunnel and sever the ligament causing pain and inflammation. Endoscopic surgery is generally considered less painful than open surgery.Open surgery involves a surgeon making a comparatively bigger incision in the palm of the hand. The surgeon then enters the wrist through the incision and severs the ligament to free the nerve. The procedure is similar to endoscopic surgery, but it is much more invasive, and consequently it may take longer to heal., Some people with long-term carpal tunnel pain may require physical and occupational therapy to regain a broad range of motion in the wrists and hands. Certain rehabilitative therapy techniques can help relieve pain and strengthen the muscles in the hands and wrists.In addition to physical and occupational therapy, some people find that high-intensity ultrasound therapy can help the wrists. This treatment involves raising the temperature in and around the wrists to reduce pain and promote blood flow in order to allow the injury to heal., Strengthening exercises can be performed once pain has considerably been reduced. Start with isometric exercises, such as the following: Keep your wrist in a neutral position with your palm down, and place your other hand on top of your wrist. Keep fist slightly closed and try extending your wrist back, while at the same time providing just enough resistance with your other hand to keep your wrist from moving. Hold position for 10 seconds and repeat five to 10 times.

You can perform this exercise three times per week.
You can now position your hand so that your palm is facing up, with your hand in a comfortable closed position. Place other hand on top of the closed hand and try flexing your wrist, while applying just enough resistance with the other hand so that your wrist is not moving. Hold this position for 10 seconds and repeat five times."

This exercise should relax your mind and help you to fall asleep.If you count all the way down to one and you are still awake, try a larger number, like 500 or even 1,000.;
, Writing in a journal is also a good way to relax your mind and start winding down for bedtime. Write about your day, your fears or worries, or anything else that you want to write about. Getting your thoughts down on paper may help you to let go of them and make it easier for you to fall asleep.Try getting yourself a special journal to write in before you go to bed each night.
You can also use your journal to make a list of things that are bothering you or to write down questions that you would like to ask someone.

Place your hands on your stomach (just below your rib cage) with your palms facing down. Keep your fingers close together.
Then, take a long, slow deep breath into your belly. As you do this, your stomach should expand and you should feel your hands rise.
After a few seconds, slowly exhale the breath and feel your stomach drop as you do so.
Repeat this exercise for 10 to 15 breaths., Progressive muscles relaxation is a relaxation exercise that helps to release tension in your body, from head to toe. If you are having trouble sleeping because you feel tense and nervous, then this may help you.


To do a progressive muscle relaxation exercise, start by tensing the muscles in your toes and keeping them tense for about five seconds. Then, release them and allow your toes to relax for about 30 seconds.Next, move to your calves and repeat the same tensing and releasing pattern. Keep tensing and releasing muscles until you reach the top of your head.

Stay hydrated.",How to Satisfy Hunger During Pregnancy," Underweight women will need to gain more pounds during pregnancy. Women with higher body mass indexes (BMI), will need to add fewer pounds. General guidelines suggest:


If you possessed a BMI of less than 18.5 before becoming pregnant, you should gain 13 to 18 kilograms (28 to 40 pounds).
If you had a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 pre-pregnancy, aim to add 11 to 16 kilograms (25 to 35 pounds).
If you had a BMI between 25 and 29.9, you should gain 7 to 11 kilograms (about 15 to 25 pounds).
If you had a BMI of more than 30, you should add 5 to 9 kilograms (about 11 to 20 pounds).If you are carrying twins, the general recommendation is 16 to 20 kilograms (35 to 45 pounds). If you are carrying triplets, you may need to gain between 23 and 27 kilograms (50 and 60 pounds). Speak with your doctor about healthy weight gain if you are having a multiple pregnancy.;
, You do not need to “eat for two.” Rather, if your pre-pregnancy BMI was in the normal range, you should eat 300 extra calories daily during your second trimester. In your third trimester, up this amount to 452 extra calories per day.In general:


Always eat breakfast.Eat small healthy snacks (yogurt, trail mix, fruit) between larger meals to ward off binge eating.Keep snacks handy at home, at work, and in your purse or car.

, While there might be days when you are craving dill pickles covered in dark chocolate, generally speaking, you should avoid binging on junk food. The extra calories should not come from junk food, but from nutrient-dense foods. Try to limit the amount of potato chips, sugary cookies, and sodas in your house. Everything you eat goes to your baby so keep that in mind.

, Although your hormones can cause mood swings, try to avoid using food as a comfort device. Rather if you are feeling blue, try taking a walk or hanging out with a good friend. Alternatively, reach for ""happy"" snacks like bananas, which contain amino acids that lead to the production of the mood-enhancing neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin.Other foods that may improve your mood include walnuts, dark chocolate, mushrooms, and green tea., If you eat too quickly, your body doesn’t realize you are full. If you eat more slowly and pause between each bite, digestive hormones have time to tell your brain that you are full.Enjoy your food and avoid eating while watching TV and not registering your food intake.


Cut or break your food into smaller pieces so that you have more pieces to eat.
Eating from a smaller plate can make you feel like you are eating more food.
Eating slowly also helps prevent heartburn.

, Listen to your body’s cues. If you are craving something sweet, you might be lacking certain vitamins found in fruit, for instance. Similarly, if you are craving something salty, perhaps your sodium levels are off balance. While you should not follow every craving, be sensitive to what your body is saying.

, You need carbohydrates to keep your energy levels up. Whole grain foods are healthy choices and approximately 50% of your grain intake should be from whole grains, whether pasta, rice, or breads. Consider purchasing breads and cereals with added vitamins, iron, fiber, minerals, and folic acid.An example of a day’s worth of grains could be breakfast cereal, a sandwich for lunch, and whole grain pasta for dinner., You need to eat sufficient amounts of fruits and vegetables so that you are well-nourished with plentiful vitamins, minerals, and fibers. Seek dark green vegetables like spinach as a source of fiber, folate, and Vitamin A.Citrus fruits provide you with Vitamin C. Aim for five portions of fruits and vegetables daily.Salads allow you to combine many food groups. Starting with leafy greens (romaine, spinach, kale, arugula, Swiss Chard), add accompanying vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, broccoli, peppers, cabbage, mushrooms, celery). Top off your salad with mandarins and some sliced chicken breast, chickpeas, or salmon for protein.
Healthy options include a fruit smoothie made with low-fat yogurt and fresh fruits. Vegetable pizzas or submarine sandwiches also are great choices.
Avocado is a great choice because it has needed healthy fats.You can create a trail mix filled with nuts, banana chips, raisins, or dates.Watch the amount of fruit juice you drink. Because of its high sugar content, it can lead to added pounds., For your baby’s development, make sure to include plenty of protein in your diet. Meat, fish, beans, eggs, and poultry are key sources of protein. Fish particularly boast fatty omega-3 acids — key to helping your baby’s brain grow. Aim for 5.5 – 7 oz. of protein per day.Start your day with protein and fiber. Scrambled eggs with vegetables or whole grain toast with peanut butter set the right tone for the day and help you feel full and satisfied.
Try omelets with fresh vegetables, salmon fillets, rice and black beans, or edamame.Avoid eating liver.Fish with high mercury levels can be dangerous. Avoid swordfish, tilefish, shark, and king mackerel.

, Calcium is a key mineral found in milk and is essential for bone and teeth development. Consider adding Greek yogurt to your daily diet which is a nutrient-dense food and great source of protein and calcium. Milk with cereal is also a great combination. 3 cups of dairy products (e.g. 1 cup milk, 1 cup yogurt, 1 cup shredded cheese) are recommended per day.Goat milk products are a fantastic lactose-free alternative.
You also can purchase juices with extra calcium if you have trouble with lactose., You do need to have fat as part of your prenatal diet. Try to stick to healthy fats and reduce your intake of saturated fat and hydrogenated fats. These fats are found in non-lean meat, butter, and processed foods like crackers or chips. Instead, focus on:


Monounsaturated fats found in nuts, olives, avocados, almond or peanut butter.
Polyunsaturated fats contained in sunflower, flaxseed, and soybean oils.

, Aim for 10 cups of liquids daily while you are pregnant. Although all fluids count towards this total, you should avoid alcohol during pregnancy.Try to keep your caffeine levels limited to one cup of coffee per day or two cups of tea.Keep a bottle of water with you at all times.
If you’re not a huge water fan, consider infusing your water with cucumber, lemon, or lime for added, nutritious flavor.
Water helps your digestive system to work well."

Stick to a consistent routine.,
Ensure that your child has a comfortable sleep environment.,
Keep distractions out of your child's bedroom.,
Don't let your child consume products that might keep them lively past bedtime.,
Avoid using bed as a source of punishment for time-outs.,
Get out and exercise.,
Change the whole family's sleep patterns.,
Be persistent.",How to Help Your Child Change a Poor Sleep Pattern," It is tempting to let children stay up later on the weekend but this is where children learn how enjoyable it is to stay up later and it gives them the desire to do so on other nights. When a routine exists that requires your child to be in bed early every night of the week, this provides a sense of consistency that children can easily adapt to. This means keeping a consistent bedtime and waking time.;
, The room should be at a good sleep temperature of around 16ºC (60ºF). If it is not possible to keep the room warm enough, add blankets and a child-safe hot water bottle to warm the bed. Avoid using electric blankets as these are not considered to be safe options for children. If the room is too warm, strip the bed down to a sheet only, leave a glass of water at the bedside table and open the window if possible. It is also important that the room is quiet. This means no noise from TV, talking or other hubbub.

, Remove anything that might distract a child such as computers, TV, video games etc. The family room is the place for these highly distracting devices. For teens, this will be more difficult, but you can institute a check at a certain hour to make sure they are not sneaking in extra time. The problem lies in the fact that using computers, playing video games or watching TV winds up our mind and it takes considerable time to unwind after using these devices. A good rule of thumb is to require reading, card playing, writing or drawing on paper etc. type activities to replace electronic activities one hour before bedtime. This becomes ""down-time"". To make it fair, this should apply to everyone in the family, regardless of age, to help all get a good night's sleep!

, Ban consumption of soft drinks, coffee, tea, chocolate etc. that contain caffeine several hours before bedtime. Make it a rule that come 6 p.m., all drinks must be caffeine free. This will be harder on teen children than on younger ones.

, Children will associate being sent to bed with bad experiences and this can hamper their desire to go to bed and sleep.

, A bike ride or a ball bounce after dinner can do wonders for improving sleep patterns. However, care must be taken not to encourage exercise too close to bedtime or hearts will be racing and sleep will be long in coming.

, If getting up early is an issue for everyone, perhaps it is time the whole family went to bed early. It can be a fun but instructive game for mom and dad to go to bed earlier than their child once in a while. Tell your child you are going to bed and that they had better hurry up and beat you. Turn out all the lights in the rest of the house except for where teeth are being cleaned and the bedrooms. The message soon becomes clear and everyone gets a good night's sleep! This can be a great way to kick start a new sleeping routine for the entire household and the kids feel involved as a part of the general shift, rather than being the sole focus.

, Your child will likely argue and whine. Be ready for that and have ears of steel. Repeat the mantra that ""your bedtime is now, the TV time is over"" or ""Goodnight, sleep tight"". Using a mantra every night can help your child settle down, as long as you use it to signal that there's no discussion to be had. As much as the wheedling gets to you, as a parent, it is your responsibility to stand up to your child's limit-testing and draw the boundaries clearly.

Just have a light snack.For example, try having a piece of toast or a small bowl of cereal with milk.Don’t drink anything that has caffeine in it after 3:00pm either or it may interfere with your ability to fall asleep., Doing things that require lots of energy or that get you excited may make it harder to fall asleep at night. Participate in active play activities earlier in the day and do more low key things later in the day.For example, ride a bike, play a video game, or play soccer in the early afternoon, and then read and listen to music in the evening.

If you do not have a heat pack and don’t want to purchase one, you can also try soaking in a hot bath with the same effect.

, If you are suffering from sciatica, you should wear shoes that have no heels, if possible. If you still want or need to wear heeled shoes, wear shoes with small, low heels.

Drinking a lot of water with each meal will keep your body hydrated, especially the spinal discs and spinal joints, thus relieving some of your pain. Make sure to get enough calcium. The diet recommended to pregnant women with sciatica includes:


1,200 mg of calcium a day. This can be accomplished by eating calcium-rich foods like cheese, yogurt, milk, and eggs.

(2) How much sleep do you want or need to get?This should help you figure out when you should go to bed. For example, if you need to wake up at 7 am and you want to get 8 hours of sleep, you should be asleep by 11 pm the night before. Thus, your bedtime might be 10:30 or 10:45 pm to give yourself a bit of a cushion.;
, Some daytime activities can interfere with your ability to relax and rest. For that reason you want to make sure that you stop drinking caffeine at least six hours before you intend to go to bed.You also want to make sure that you are done eating dinner two to three hours before your bedtime and that you complete any exercise at least two hours before you want to sleep., Electronics such as laptops, tablets, tvs, and phones have the ability to give off enough light to cue our brains to stay awake.Seeing light from these devices miscues our brain to think that the sun is up and we should be awake. In order to promote sleep, we need to ensure that natural light and artificial light are kept at a minimum.

, There are all sorts of time-sucks in existence, but most of them can be traced back to the use of electronics. It’s easy to lose track of time on the Internet, while watching television, or while playing video games. However, lacking a morning and/or evening routine is also considered a time-suck., You can’t always plan the entire day down to the minute, so the next best thing to do is to leave some extra unplanned time in your schedule to handle unexpected things that pop up.This will help you to stay on track with other tasks including going to bed on time.

, This routine will eventually become a habit that lets your body know that it is time for you to begin relaxing.For example, you might take a hot shower to relax you before you put on your pajamas and climb into your bed. Or perhaps you set aside one hour before bed for reading a book, which you do from the comfort of your bed.

, In much the same way that most people need an alarm to help wake them up, many people can benefit from using an alarm to remind them to go to sleep. It is easy to get busy with a task or activity and to lose track of the time. However, if you were to set an alarm to remind you that your bedtime is quickly approaching, it might be easier for you to remember to go to bed on time.For example, you might set the bedtime alarm for 10 pm if you want to be asleep at 11 pm.

, Clutter can be distracting and it can impede your ability to focus on tasks at hand, in this case, relaxing and falling asleep.When your bedroom is clean and cleared of distractions, it will become a place you enjoy spending time and you’ll find it easier to relax and sleep., Loud, glossy paint on your walls can become a distraction.Bright colors like a vibrant red, hot pink, or neon green are stimulating, whereas, softer colors, such a pale blues, eggshell, and muted lavender will have a calming effect. When painting your bedroom walls, you want to make sure that the paint you choose is of a calming or neutral color and a matte finish.

, You should not keep phones, computers, or television in your bedroom, since the light that they emit can hurt your chances of falling asleep on time. In addition to the light from your electronics being a problem, electronics can also act as a distraction. For example, it’s easy to lie in bed watching television, but this won’t necessarily help you sleep. When you feel tired, you might fight sleep to watch your television show to its ending credits, or you might opt to stay up watching a movie instead of closing your eyes to rest.


If you must keep electronics in your room, make sure to keep them turned off and/or out of sight when you are trying to sleep. Feel free to unplug them, or to hide your remote controls if you must.

, While the idea of cuddling your pet may be appealing, the cuddling is not worth the lost sleep.

, You should buy a mattress that is ideal for your needs.Figure out what type of mattress you prefer and make the purchase. You should be willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a new mattress and you should buy a new mattress every seven years to maintain optimal sleeping habits.Here are some things to consider when you are purchasing a mattress:


Do you need a large bed because you co-sleep with a child, a partner, or a pet?
Do you need a small bed because you have limited space in your bedroom?
Do you need a firm bed because you have a bad back?
Do you prefer to sleep on a feather soft bed?
Do you like memory foam?
Do you prefer a pillow top mattress?

, If you have windows, make sure that you hang curtains or blinds that block out natural light.This will improve your sleep. If light is able to shine into your room, it can disrupt your natural bodily rhythms and signal to your brain that you should be awake.

, You should use dim lamps or dimmer switches on overhead lights. If you dim the lights about an hour before you want to fall asleep, you’re letting your body know that it is time to get ready for bed.Don’t ever use overly bright or harsh lighting in your bedroom.

, If you like satin sheets, be sure to buy satin sheets. If you prefer cotton sheets, then invest in those. The same is true for pillows. Know whether you prefer a plump pillow, a thin pillow, a plush pillow, a down pillow, or a hypoallergenic pillow.

, Most people prefer sleeping in cooler environments.You want to make sure that your room is neither too hot, nor too cold since the temperature of the room will affect your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.

, Sleeping can make us feel vulnerable, so it’s important to have a working lock on your bedroom door. Locking your door will make you feel safe and secure and will help you to relax at bedtime. This is especially important if you live with roommates who may wander into your room when you are trying to sleep.


In addition to locking your bedroom door, you will also want to make sure that you lock all of the other doors and windows in your home before you go to bed. Safety and security is important.

, By warming your body up in the shower, you are allowing endorphins to be released into your brain, which will relax you.Also, if you step directly from your warm bath into cooler air, you’ll be slowing down your body’s metabolism and letting it know that it is time for bed.Taking a warm bath directly before you go to bed is a great routine to begin.

, Having something warm to drink a little while before bed can help to make you sleepy. Try having a cup of caffeine-free herbal tea, some warm milk, or Horlicks (a malted milk drink that is served warm)., When you lie in bed, consciously tighten and then relax every single muscle group in the body.This will help you relax all of your muscles, which will allow your body to drift off to sleep faster. It also helps to release any built up tension from the day.

, There are several breathing exercises that you might try, but one of the best known exercise is the “4-7-8” breathing technique.It is said to put a person to sleep quickly and easily. For the “4-7-8” breathing technique do the following:


Inhale through your nose for four counts.
Hold your breath for seven counts.
Exhale through your mouth for eight counts.
Repeat steps 1-3 of the technique until you fall asleep.

, Don’t dwell on the stresses of your day or the worries of the future.You want to slow your thoughts until your mind is completely clear. You might even try imaging calming places or moments in time.If you have trouble doing this because your mind is racing, you can always promise yourself to return to your thoughts tomorrow.Reading a book before bed might also help you to forget your day and get sleepy. Try reading a chapter or two out of a book before you go to bed.

, Lavender and vanilla aromas have been shown to help induce sleep.By breathing in calming scents, you are encouraging your body to relax. In fact, aromatherapy can help you fall asleep quicker, sleep deeper, and sleep for a longer amount of time.There are scents that help people relax and fall asleep including, but not limited to:Lavender
Vanilla
Chamomile
Vetiver
Ylang Ylang
Bergamot
Sandalwood
Marjoram
Cedarwood
Lemon
Clary Sage
Jasmine
Please do not ingest or put essential oils directly onto your skin. Aromatherapy should make use of an essential oil diffuser, which will allow you to breathe in the scent of the oil without having to touch it or ingest it.

It’s important to determine whether your symptoms are typical of pregnancy or if they seem more extreme or enduring for longer. If you’ve suffered from some of the following symptoms more days than not for two or more weeks in a way that affects your normal functioning, it may be related to depression:Decreased energy/feeling constantly exhausted
Feeling restless; fidgeting often
Feeling overly lethargic or making slow movements;
, Pregnancy often affects emotions, and it’s important to differentiate between emotional changes that are part of a normal pregnancy and those that may be due to depression. Check to see if you have had emotional symptoms of depression for two or more weeks that have affected your functioning at home, school, or work. Emotional symptoms that may indicate that you have depression include:Feeling worthless
Difficulty concentrating, problems with memory
Persistent sadness, crying
Low mood, feeling numb
Feeling irritable, angry or aggressive
Decreased interest in activities you used to enjoy
Feeling unmotivated or detached from your typical routine
Having thoughts of harming yourself or the baby

, You or other people may see changes in the way you act that differ from your normal behavior.

If you notice behavior changes that impair your functioning and that last 2 or more weeks, it’s time to consider depression. Behavioral symptoms can include:Changes in sleep habits (sleeping too much or too little, such as staying up all night or wanting to sleep all day even if you slept well at night)
Changes in eating habits (beyond what may be considered “normal” in pregnancy, such as binge eating or not wanting to eat at all)
Socially withdrawing from friends and family, isolating yourself
Engaging in reckless behavior (like things that may harm the fetus, like drinking)

, Look at your family members and ask yourself if there’s a family history of depression. Then, ask yourself whether you’ve previously experienced depression at any point in your life. If so, you are at a higher risk for developing depression.Does anyone in your immediate family (parents, siblings) suffer from depression or take medication to treat depression? What about your extended family (grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins)?
Have you ever taken medication, seen a therapist, or struggled with symptoms of depression in the past?

, Dealing with the changes and pain from pregnancy can become wearing day after day. From morning sickness to back pain to minimal sleeping positions, the physical stress from pregnancy can deplete normal ability to cope and leave you drained and exhausted.Are you finding it more difficult to respond to stress due to the pain you experience regularly? Do you feel like you have a shorter fuse or that your discomfort is making you excessively sad or irritable? How is your pregnancy affecting your emotional state?
Help your body relax by taking warm baths, using a heating pad for muscle aches, and using good posture., If you’re struggling with a high-risk pregnancy or have increased medical complications with your pregnancy, you may be at higher risk for depression. Dealing with stress and the fear of any problems with your baby can be too much to handle.You may also feel frustrated or unhelpful if you’re not allowed to work or do things you could previously do with ease.Are you feeling worthless or unneeded in your family due to a complicated pregnancy?

, A previous loss such as a miscarriage can impact your feelings about the current pregnancy.You may find yourself excessively worried about the baby and if it will survive. Acknowledge the loss and allow yourself to work through the grief and disappointment.


Do you find yourself constantly worried about the baby’s health? Have you fully healed from the past loss? Does this affect your own well-being and emotional health?
If you’ve experienced a pregnancy loss, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. Your friends and family want to support you. Talk about the baby and use the name. It’s okay to acknowledge what would have or could have been.For more information, check out How to Cope With Grief.

, If you think you may be depressed, ask a friend to reflect back to you any changes to your emotional health that he or she has noticed. Ask someone you know will be honest with you, such as a sibling or best friend. Share how you’ve been feeling and if he or she has noticed changes in your behavior, emotions, or moods.

, If you have suspicions that you may be depressed during your pregnancy, seek a mental health professional. You can talk about your symptoms and how you feel. A therapist can give you a diagnosis and help emotionally support you through the pregnancy. She or he can help you find coping strategies to help lift the depression, help shift negative thoughts, give you tools to help adjust behaviors, and arm you with how to prevent future depression., If you’re struggling with your romantic relationship with your partner, it can trigger depression. Some people try to stick it out and assume that having the baby will dissolve all the problems; it won’t. The baby will only add strain to the relationship.Do you find yourself taking your stress out on your partner? Are issues between you and your partner more tumultuous than before you were pregnant? Think about how your relationship may have changed since becoming pregnant.
Holding on to relationship stress can affect the growing fetus and increase the likelihood of the baby developing behavior problems in childhood. Let go of anger and resentment and work through relationship problems as quickly as possible.If your relationship is struggling, get counseling. Don’t delay on getting the help you need. For more information, check out How to Tell if You Need to See a Therapist.

, It’s normal to be concerned about affording a new baby. However, financial difficulties may cause a significant amount of stress and contribute to depression.Before the baby comes, create a budget to help you feel more in control and reduce finance related stress.


Try to make small changes to save money. For example, you can purchase generic items, watch for sales, clip coupons, buy frequently used items in bulk, or limit entertainment purchases, such as eating out or going to the movies.
Consider DIY options to save money, such as making your own baby food or making reusable cloth diapers.
Ask friends and family if they would be willing to help you with childcare after your baby is born. Friends and family members may also be willing to donate items to you such as baby clothes, a car seat, a baby monitor, or a stroller.

, A history of abuse as a child may contribute to your risk of suffering from major depression as an adult.Abuse may take the form of sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. No matter what type of abuse you suffered as a child, it is important to seek help as an adult.


If you were abused as a child, seek help from a therapist to work towards recovery.

Avoid bright light, especially from television, computer, and phone screens.,
Quit caffeine after 2pm.,
Quit smoking.",How to Get to Sleep," Light suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone your brain secretes to make you sleepy. Eliminating as much light as possible can boost melatonin production and help you get to sleep.Draw your blinds or curtains to block out any street lights.
If it's still too bright you can wear a sleep mask (or even drape a t-shirt over your eyes if you don't have one).;
, A cool environment can help ease your body into a state that is optimal for slumber.If you have control of your thermostat, make sure you adjust the temperature at night to a comfortable, cool setting.
If you don't have air conditioning, or if you share a house or apartment and can't adjust the temperature of your room, try cracking a window or using fans to lower the temperature if it's too hot. If it's too cold you can use a hot water bottle, heating pad, or an extra blanket to warm things up.

, Traffic, rowdy neighbors, snoring partners and barking dogs are just a few of the things outside of your control that may keep you awake. Combat distracting sounds by blocking them out with earplugs or drowning them out with another, more calming sound.Turn on a fan, turn on a sound machine, or tune your radio between stations to create white noise, a steady, monotonous sound that can effectively mask the noises that stimulate our brains and disturb our sleep.
If you don't have a fan or sound machine, there are many phone apps you can download with sounds like waterfalls, thunderstorms, or ocean waves to lull you to sleep.

, Breathing deeply is a simple, quick way to calm your body and soothe anxiety.Inhale deeply through your nose an exhale through your mouth.

, If you find you are having obsessive, circular, or anxious thoughts, try getting them down on paper.

, Eating before bed can affect people in different ways, but if you find yourself kept awake by gnawing hunger, it's probably better to have a snack.Foods containing carbohydrates and tryptophan, such as whole grain bread, turkey, and bananas, can help make you sleepy.
Stick to mild foods. Spicy, acidic foods can cause indigestion. Fatty, rich foods take longer to break down, and the work your body must do to digest them could prevent sleep.
Stay away from sweets with sugar or caffeine will stimulate your body and keep you awake.

, By keeping to a routine bedtime, you are effectively training your body and avoiding nights spent tossing and turning.


Go to sleep at the same time every night. Aim for a time when you naturally start getting tired.
Wake up at the same time every day. While it's tempting to get a few more hours of shut-eye on the weekends, this will throw off your sleep schedule and you may have difficulty falling asleep at the right time.

, You only need 20-30 minutes total of exercise each day to see a change in your sleep habits. While vigorous exercise is best, anything that gets you on your feet and moving is a great start.Choose an appropriate time to exercise. If you go for a run right before bed, chances are you'll be too wired to sleep. Give yourself a few hours to wind down before trying to sleep.
If you're short on time, try breaking up your exercise throughout the day. Even choosing to take the stairs over an elevator can give you a quick workout., While it's comfortable and fun to hang out on your bed and watch movies on your laptop, the action can confuse your body. You want to train your body to get into sleep mode as soon as you climb into bed.If you want to do a relaxing activity before bed, such as reading or knitting, try going into another room with soft light.

, It seems like a natural solution--you're trying to unwind so you flip on the TV, or your phone is charging on your beside table so you take a last peek to see if there's anything new on social media. The light will stimulate your brain and disrupt the process of quieting down for sleep.Use an alarm clock instead of your phone to wake you up in the morning, and keep your phone out of reach.
Keep the TV and computer in another room, not your bedroom.

Unplug from your electronic devices at least an hour before bed.,
Have a snack if you're hungry.,
Get things ready for the next day.,
Take a shower if you wash at night.,
Brush your teeth.,
Climb into bed.,
Read until you feel sleepy.",How to Get Ready for Bed Quickly1," Stop using your computer, television, tablet, and smartphone to get to sleep more quickly. All of these gadgets emit blue light, which can prevent you from sleeping for a time after being exposed to it. To make matters worse, these screens are brightly backlit, beaming light directly into your eyes. Wind down the day by powering down your devices.


Set the notifications on your phone to stop at night to keep from being distracted or tempted to look at its screen.If you can't tear yourself away from your devices, try reducing their damage instead. Use an app that filters out blue light before bed. Some phones and tablets now come with these settings already programmed in.Certain e-readers without LCD screens or backlights do not emit blue light or shine directly into the eyes. These are comparable to reading a conventional book and may be used before bedtime.;
, Hunger can make it difficult to get to sleep. If notice that you feel a little hungry while getting ready for bed, make sure to have a small snack. It's also a good idea to have some water if you're prone to waking up dehydrated.


Some foods that can help you get to sleep more quickly are bananas, turkey, yogurt, peanut butter, dairy products, and whole-grain crackers.Many people relax with a caffeine-free, nonalcoholic beverage like herbal tea or warm milk while getting ready for bed.
Don't eat a large meal before bed.
Make sure your snack isn't fatty or spicy., You'll also save time in the morning by taking care of a few things while you wind down. Some examples of things you can do are:


Laying out your outfit.
Setting up your coffee maker.
Packing your lunch.

, You can take care of most of the rest of your routine in a towel while you dry off.


A warm shower can help you relax before bed.
Most people don't need to wash their hair every day. Shave time off your bedtime routine by shampooing a few times a week or less. If you have fine, oily hair, though, you should probably keep up your daily washes.
Contrary to popular belief, it can be ok to go to bed with damp hair. However, you will need to pull your hair back and style it to pull this off.If you wear makeup, make sure to take it off before you go to bed. Leaving makeup on can clog your pores and give you acne., You should brush your teeth before you go to bed but only after you've finished eating and drinking. This will prevent bad breath in the morning and help protect you from cavities.


It should take two minutes for you to brush your teeth. It may be helpful for you to set a timer. Some electric toothbrushes even come with two-minute timers already built into their handles.
Use a soft-bristled brush to keep from wearing down your tooth enamel.
Stick to fluoride toothpaste for maximum protection.
Don't forget to brush your tongue, too.Quickly use the toilet if you need to. Afterwards, it's finally time to head to your bedroom.

, Remember to make your target bedtime as closely as possible. Lying in bed awake from turning in too early can be just as bad for your sleep as going to bed late. If you find yourself regularly taking a half hour or more to fall asleep, consider moving your regular bedtime a little earlier.


If you have trouble sleeping, you may keep a record of your sleeping habits called a sleep diary. Write down what time you actually get to bed. Keep your sleep diary on your nightstand in case you take a long time to fall asleep or wake up during the night., Unless you're the type of person who falls asleep right away, you may need to do something to occupy your mind as you drift off. Since you shouldn't look at LCD screens before bed, a book is the best low-stimulus form of relaxing entertainment available. One you feel yourself starting to get tired, shut off your light or e-reader and close your eyes.Avoid reading anything too exciting. If you get lost in a good story, you may not want to get to sleep. Dry technical writing will probably help you to fall asleep more quickly than an engrossing adventure novel.

Decide on a bedtime and stick to it.,
Exercise five to six hours before bed.,
Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bed.",How to Get Ready for Bed Quickly2," For quality sleep, it's important to establish a regular bedtime routine. A major part of this is getting ready for bed at the same time each night.


You'll use the bedtime you pick for most of your routine, counting backwards to figure out when to start getting ready for bed.
If there is a set time you need to be out of bed by, count backwards from that to pick your bedtime.
While many people think everyone should get eight hours a night, the actual amount varies from person to person.Figure out how much sleep you need to feel your best and set your bedtime with that in mind.

, Getting 20 to 30 minutes of exercise every day will help you get to sleep faster. However, exercising too close to your bedtime can overstimulate your mind and body, making it more difficult to fall asleep. Plan your activities five to six hours before you want to get to sleep for optimal results., All three of these substances can negatively affect your sleep quality.


Stop all caffeine consumption four to six hours before your bedtime. To keep you from being wired all night, avoid coffee, tea, chocolate, caffeinated sodas, and certain pain relievers. Remember that decaffeinated coffee and tea still have some caffeine. If you drink tea to relax before bed, make sure it's an herbal one that is completely caffeine-free.
Many people don't realize it because they may use tobacco products to relax, but the nicotine in them is actually a stimulant like caffeine. Additionally, withdrawal symptoms will make you wake up more frequently, ruining your sleep. While quitting tobacco products altogether will get you the best sleep, if you must smoke make sure your last cigarette for the night is at least two hours before bed.While alcohol may help you fall asleep faster, it also makes you wake up more frequently throughout the night. Have your last drink at least an hour before bed to allow your body time to process the alcohol."
"
Make yourself as comfortable as possible.,
Make sure your bedroom is completely dark.,
Take any sleep medications at the appropriate time.",How to Get Ready for Bed Quickly3," The last steps you take before getting to sleep are getting your mind to a relaxed enough state to wind down for the night. If you aren't comfortable in bed, you're more likely to take a long time to fall asleep.


Depending on what you like to wear, your pajamas can be loose or tight, soft or stiff. The only thing that matters is that your pajamas are the most comfortable thing in your wardrobe.
Make sure your bedroom is cool without being too cold.
Shop around for the right pillows, mattress, and bedding that fits your tastes. If some aspect isn't quite right, try a different item if you can.
Don't overlook your auditory comfort. If you're sensitive to noise, even minor disturbances can keep you up all night. Run a fan or white noise machine to mask intrusive sounds.

, The most important aspect of the bedroom for most people is to shut out as much light as possible. Light can trick us into thinking it's daytime, stalling our sleep cycle.


The exception to this rule is a small light for reading that you can easily turn off while lying down. You can use either a lamp with a low-watt bulb on your nightstand or a small book light.
If there is a light outside your bedroom window that is too bright, consider installing blackout curtains. The same strategy can be used if you work nights and are forced to sleep while the sun is still up.

, If your doctor has directed you to take a nightly sleep aid, it's important to take your medication at the right time each night.


There are a wide variety of sleep medicines on the market, each with their own optimal dosing time.
Some people react differently to medications and may need to take a sleep aid at a non-standard time.
Fast-acting medications, which includes most prescription sleep aids, should generally be taken right before you climb into bed.Depending on your reason for taking melatonin, you may be advised to take it anywhere from one to five hours before bed."

,,, Tie it back in a bun for volume or a braid for primps and waves. Ponytails aren't recommended because they will give you a crease in your hair that ends up not being helpful at all!

Remove any makeup.,
Wash your face.,
Decide whether to shower.,
Stay away from electronics.,
Find a bedtime ritual.,
Write in your diary before bed.,
Get comfortable in your bed.,
Avoid drinking caffeine close to bedtime.,
Make sure your bedroom is sleep-friendly.,
Aim to stick to a sleep schedule.",How to Get Ready for Bed (for Girls)," Sometimes you may feel so tired you want to skip removing your makeup before bed, but you should never go to sleep without removing it first. Leaving makeup on can clog your pores. Your skin needs to breathe and heal at night, so you should remove your makeup to allow this to happen.Wipe off any foundation, primer, or other products with a facial wipe. Make sure to wipe away any traces of makeup.
Even if you're just wearing mascara, you should still remove your makeup. Leaving mascara on can clog hair follicles, and it can also damage your lashes and make them brittle, which can cause them to brake. Brittle lashes may also bend and poke you in the eye.;
, You should always wash your face before bed. This can help prevent acne breakouts by removing dirt, bacteria, and oils that have accumulated during the day. You should use a mild soap meant to treat acne and wash your face in warm water.Do not scrub your face. Gently massage your face in circular motions until you've worked up a lather with the soap. Then, rinse your face off.
If you have any acne lotion, you should apply this after washing your face.

, Many people shower in the morning; however, if an evening shower is part of your routine, hop in the shower before bed. In certain circumstances, showering before bed may benefit you.If you typically have difficulty falling asleep, it's a good idea to shower at night. After you get out of the shower, you experience a rapid cooling effect on your body. This can help induce sleep.
If you have dry, flaky skin, your skin may respond better to a shower at night.
Make sure your sheets are clean. If you shower at night, you don't want to undo your shower by sleeping on dirty sheets.

, The light from a television, phone, or tablet screen can interfere with sleep. In the half hour before bed, avoid things like texting your friends, going online, playing games, or watching movies or TV (especially things that are exciting or scary). Find other ways to wind down.It's a good idea to remove these items from your bedroom completely. If you typically lie in bed texting your friends in the evening, or watching something on your tablet, you're likely interfering with your own sleep cycle.
It can be difficult to resist the temptation, especially after a long day. Try asking your parents to take your electronics before bed. This can help you prioritize sleep.

, A relaxing ritual will help you turn your mind off at the end of the day. It can also signal to your body it's time to rest. If you do the same thing one to two hours before bed each night, your body will recognize that it's time to sleep.Pick something non-stimulating. If you go for a walk at night, that may wake your body up.
Instead, do something relaxing. Listen to a calming playlist. Read a book (but avoid intense reading, like page-turning mysteries or suspense novels). Take a warm bath. Do a crossword puzzle.
Make sure you get all studying done well before bed whenever possible. This can make you stressed and feel more awake., Sometimes, it can be hard to get to sleep if your thoughts are spiraling from a long day. Before bed, try writing in your diary or journal. This will help clear your mind before falling asleep.You can keep a diary or journal by your bedside table. When night comes, jot down all your thoughts to get them out of your system before going to sleep.
This can be especially helpful if you had a long or stressful day. You don't want to go to sleep with stress over a fight with a friend or a coming exam interfering with your thoughts.
If you are thinking about everything you will need to accomplish the next day, try writing it down or making a to-do list in your journal.

, Once you feel like you've wound down, get comfortable. You want to make sure you're lying in a comfortable position, as this will help you drift off to sleep.Make sure your room is dark enough. Turn off the lights and pull down the curtains or shades.
Make sure you choose the position for your mattress, pillow, and blankets that are most comfortable for you.
Don't use your bed for anything other than sleeping. Don't study in bed. This way, your body will know that as soon as you hit the mattress, it's time for sleep.

, Stay away from things like energy drinks, sodas, tea, or coffee beverages in the hours leading up to sleep. Too much caffeine can interfere with your sleep cycle, even if you drank it a few hours before bed.Caffeine stays in your system for a long time after you consume it. It takes six hours for about half the amount of caffeine consumed to work its way through your system. This means that if you have a soda after dinner, you may still be feeling jittery at night.Stick to only one or two caffeinated beverages per day. When you do drink caffeine, make sure you do so in the morning or the early afternoon.

, If you consistently struggle to get ready for bed, the problem may be your bedroom. Make sure your bedroom allows you to fall asleep at night.If your room is too bright, you may need thicker shades or black-out curtains. Even at night, lights from street lamps can interfere with sleep. You can also try a sleep mask.
If there are unwanted noises in your room, consider ear plugs, ambient music, or a white noise machine.
Ideally, a room should be cool for sleep — between 60 to 67°F (15.6 to 19.4°C). Consider a small fan or a portable air conditioner. Adjust the room temperature to whatever works for you.

, If you get up and go to bed at the same time each day, this will help improve your sleep. Your body has a natural circadian rhythm that responds to a regular sleep/wake cycle. If you fall asleep at, say, 10 each night, and get up at 6, your body will adapt. You will begin feeling sleepy around 10, and wake up feeling alert.Although it can be difficult, try to stick to roughly this same schedule, even on weekends. Sleeping in on a Sunday can throw off your sleep Monday night.

Do not have caffeine four to six hours before your bedtime.,
Shut down all electronics and distractions several hours before bed.,
Do a relaxing activity.,
Make your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.,
Choose a comfortable sleep position.,
Go to bed at the same time every night.,
Wake up at the same time every morning.,
Adjust your sleep schedule if you are traveling to a different time zone.,
Avoid napping after 3 pm.,
Take sleeping pills only when necessary.,
Do not take over-the-counter medications that can lead to insomnia and sleep issues.",How to Get Ready for Bed," Caffeine is a known stimulant that can found in coffee, non-herbal teas, chocolate, soft drinks, diet drugs, and some brands of pain relievers. It takes your body awhile to process caffeine once you consume it. For example, if you drink a caffeinated beverage at 7 pm, about half of the caffeine will still be in your body by 11 am. To get a good night’s sleep, you should avoid consuming caffeine four to six hours before bed or try to eliminate caffeine from your diet completely.You should also cut down on the amount of alcohol you consume before bed. Limit your consumption to one to two drinks 1-2 hours before bedtime. Alcohol will only allow you to maintain a light sleep, causing you to possibly wake up and then have a harder time falling back asleep.;
, Turn off your television, smartphone, iPad, and computer or keep all electronics in an area that is not your bedroom. These electronics emit a type of light from their screens that can stimulate your brain, reduce your brain’s ability to produce melatonin (which helps you sleep), and disrupt your body’s internal clock.Consider shutting down your computer on a schedule. This option will automatically sleep your machine and remind you to avoid working on your computer too late or too close to your bedtime. Your computer should have a sleep setting that you can activate and set for a certain time. Many computer sleep settings also allow you to set a startup time so your computer will automatically wake itself up in the morning., Maybe you like to unwind by taking a warm bath, reading a chapter of a book, or talking about your day with your partner. Doing a relaxing activity can help your body to calm down and signal to your brain that it’s time to shut down and sleep.If you tend to toss and turn in bed at night, try to get up and go do a relaxing activity like reading or listening to music. This could then help you to fall back asleep.

, It can be difficult to get a good night’s sleep when your bedroom is loud, bright, and chaotic. Calm down your body and brain by putting up heavy curtains or shades to block out light from your windows. You can also cover any electronic displays like televisions or computers so the light from the screens does not cause a glow in your room.A sleep mask can also be useful to cover your eyes so you are not woken up by light. To keep your room cool, avoid putting space heaters in the room or using one heavy blanket. Instead, layer with blankets and sheets so you can shed layers when you get hot at night.
If you have a hard time sleeping due to loud noises outside or a loud, snoring sleep partner, you may want to invest in good earplugs, or a noise machine.

, If you tend to snore at night, you may want to reduce your snoring by elevating your head with pillows. Use one to two pillows to raise your head four inches off the bed. This will help you to breathe properly as you sleep. You can also buy specially designed pillows to encourage proper breathing and relaxed neck muscles to reduce your snoring.Most people who sleep on their left or right side, with their legs bent towards their chest will not snore as much as people who sleep on their backs. Consider sleeping on your side rather than your back or your stomach to ensure your body is relaxed, comfortable, and breathing properly as you sleep.
If you are pregnant, you should sleep on your left side with a body pillow and lots of supporting pillows. Lying down when you are pregnant should be done with care and awareness, as you do not want to put your body or baby at risk. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about sleep positions during pregnancy.
If snoring is an ongoing problem for you, then talk to your doctor. You might have sleep apnea, which can increase your risk for heart disease if left untreated., Maintain a regular sleep schedule by going to bed at the same time every night, even on the weekends or on your days off. This will ensure your internal sleep clock is set on a schedule that will make it easier for you to fall asleep at night.Though you may think that going to bed one hour later won’t affect your sleep schedule, any changes or shifts to your sleep schedule will have negative effects on your sleeping habits and can lead to oversleeping or a restless sleep. On average, you should be getting between seven to nine hours of sleep a night.To avoid messing up your sleep schedule, you can set an alarm on your phone or computer to remind you it’s time for you to go to bed. Have your phone alert you 1 hour or 30 minutes before bedtime so you can prepare yourself for bed and stick to your sleep schedule. You can also set an alarm on your watch or ask the person you live with to give you a 1 hour heads up before bedtime.

, Having a consistent wake up time every morning will also allow your body to adapt to your sleep schedule. To help maintain a set wake up time every day, you should avoid hitting the snooze button on your alarm or get rid of the snooze button completely. The snooze button will only throw off your wake time and throw off your sleep schedule.


If possible, try to trigger your wake up time with lots of light. You could set a timer so the lights in your room turn on at your wake up time or the blinds in your bedroom go up. Exposure to light in the morning will help your body’s internal clock to reset itself every day and help you to avoid oversleeping., If you are traveling to a different time zone, you will need to prepare your body for the time shift so you can get a good night’s sleep. It can take several days to a week for your body to adjust to a new time zone. If you are traveling eastward, you will likely experience more severe jet lag than when you are traveling westward. Traveling east requires you to shorten your day, making it more difficult for your internal clock to adjust to your new sleep schedule.Prepare your internal clock for the new time zone by getting seven to nine hours of sleep two to three days before your trip. If you are traveling west, you should adjust your sleep schedule by delaying your normal bedtime and wake time in 20-30 minute intervals. If you are traveling east, you should increase your normal wake time by 10 to 15 minutes a day two to three days before your trip and increase your normal bedtime by 10 to 15 minutes.
To fight off jet lag and poor sleep in a new time zone, you should decrease your exposure to light when it’s time for bed and increase your exposure to light when it’s time for you to wake up. You should also spend more time outdoors so your body gets used to the light cues, such as the sun rising and falling, in your new time zone.

, Napping before 3 pm will allow you to maintain your existing sleep schedule and not throw off your internal clock. Keep your naps between 10 to 30 minutes to prevent sleep inertia, which is when you feel groggy and disoriented when you wake up from a deep sleep.Naps any longer than 30 minutes and after 3 pm will likely throw off your internal clock and make it more difficult for you to go to sleep at night. It can also make it more difficult for you to wake up in the morning, leading to oversleeping.

, If you struggle with getting to sleep or falling back asleep once you have woken up, you may depend on sleeping pills to get a good night’s rest. If you are taking sleeping pills for a short period of time and based on your physician’s recommendations, they may be useful. But they should only be a temporary solution for getting to sleep as sleeping pills can often make insomnia and other sleep issues worse in the long run.Only use sleeping pills for short periods of time and for specific situations, such as travel to a different time zone or recovery from a medical procedure. Taking sleep pills only when necessary, rather than daily, can also prevent you from becoming dependent on them.
Make sure that you talk to your doctor before taking any medications to help you sleep. Your doctor will evaluate you to see if there are any underlying conditions, before prescribing treatment. Medical illness, stress, and psychological issues can affect your sleep.

, Many over-the-counter medications have side effects that can negatively affect your sleep patterns. Common medications that can disturb your sleep include:Nasal decongestants.
Cold and allergy medications containing an antihistamine.
Aspirin and other headache medications.
Pain relievers that contain caffeine.
If you are taking any of these medications, try to reduce your dosage or switch to medications that do not have side effects that lead to interrupted sleep patterns. You can also research alternative methods to treat your condition so you no longer need to take these over-the-counter medications.

Beware of sneaky stimulants.,

Watch When You Exercise.,
Do not label yourself as having any kind of sleeping problem.,
Not falling asleep because you are worried about not falling asleep.,
Don't think you are going to be tired, just because you didn't get the required eight hours of sleep.,

Start by lying flat on your back.,
Use affirmations or read something uplifting before even putting your head on the pillow.",How to Get a Better Nights Sleep Using the Law of Attraction," While most of us are aware of the caffeine products we should avoid before going to sleep, quite often we overlook some of the less obvious items that can affect our sleep without even realizing it. For instance, there is the obvious coffee or soda, but did you know that chocolate, cake, ice cream and certain cookies have enough sugar in them to affect your sleep as well? There are even some fruits that have enough natural sugar in them that can also keep you awake. If you are having a harder time falling asleep than usual - review what you have been eating before going to bed lately. If you have been on an ice cream or cookie kick for the last few weeks before bed and have been having trouble sleeping for the same amount of time, there could be your simple connection.;
, But then you don't sleep very well. So the next day you are even crankier and enjoy another few drinks when you get home to try to make yourself feel better. But then you don't sleep very well again. It seems like a vicious circle but the truth is - it could be the alcohol itself that is causing your sleep deprivation. It has been discovered that while alcohol might help you fall asleep initially, it appears to disrupt the second half of your sleep cycle. So you will wake during the night with all sorts of weird dreams or you toss and turn and have a hard time getting back to sleep again. Think about trying a different soothing ritual before bedtime if it is that ""calming"" effect you seek. Switch to a decaffeinated herbal tea and a couple of sugar free cookies. When you consume them before bed think of that as your way of unwinding at the end of a hectic day. You will see an amazing difference in not only your quantity but quality of sleep.

, You have probably heard this before but exercising even a couple of hours before bedtime can sometimes affect your falling asleep. Your blood is pumping, the energy is flowing - is it any wonder your body might have a hard time slowing itself down? You should even beware of certain kinds of yoga. While some practices are great for winding down, some might have the opposite affect. O.K. - now that we have gotten some of the possible physical causes out of the way let's work on the mental.

, You would be amazed at how what could be just a temporary problem could last a lot longer by how you think or label it. Do not think or say things like ""I just can't sleep, I have insomnia, I suffer from insomnia, I constantly wake up, I never get enough sleep, I am always tired etc."" By putting these kinds of thoughts and statements out there you are just attracting more of it. Do not give the situation more attention or worry than it deserves. It is simply temporary - do not make it a fact by bringing more attention to the problem.

, We have all been there. You only have a few hours to sleep and when you can't fall asleep you become worried about how much time you have left to sleep and on and on it goes.

, While it is true that the average person usually requires 7 to 8 hours of sleep at night it is by no means true for everyone. For instance, Donald Trump only sleeps 4 hours a night and that is more than enough for him. Another fact to consider is that you don't need to have a full 8 hours of sleep every night. The trick is to not mentally brainwash yourself into thinking that ""you are going to have to be tired"" the next day simply because you didn't get your full 8 hours. Your body changes every day. So does your energy levels. Some days you may need more sleep - some days you might need less. It's like when you are hungry. Some days you can be hungry all day long - some days you barely think about food. Just go with the flow. Don't psyche yourself out mentally by thinking ""Oh I only got 3 hours of sleep last night so it means I'll be dragging my tail all day"" Who says? Don't give it any thought and just focus on doing your thing.

, One of the trickier problems to deal with. You either can't fall asleep because a problem is on your mind or you wake up in the middle of the night in a panic when a thought occurs to you.


The first question to ask yourself is there anything you can do about it at that exact moment. Usually there isn't much you can do about any problem at 3:00 in the morning. If this is the case - tell yourself you will find a way to deal with it tomorrow or better yet, hand it over to the Universe to handle. Say to yourself ""While I am doing my job of getting some sleep, Universe is doing its job of finding me an easy solution to this problem. I can't wait till tomorrow to see what it comes up with."" You will be surprised how often a solution will present itself the next day. Just leave yourself open to the possibility.
Find at least one good thought to soothe yourself with in the middle of the night and focus on that thought when panic tries to set in. The Law of Attraction is all about taking control over your thoughts. The more you practice it, the better you get. You really do have control over what you think about. So if a panic thought tries to let itself in at the middle of the night - counteract it. Think about even one good thing you experienced the day before or plan on experiencing. Did you stick to your diet that day, get a compliment from your boss, get a call from that person you have a crush on? Did you meditate, take your vitamins, do you have something coming up that you are looking forward to? When a panic thought tries to worm it's way in, deliberately and consciously replace it with a better thought even if it is totally unrelated.
It might seem difficult at first - but you really will get better at it with practice. If your thoughts keep trying to drift to the problem, keep bringing your thoughts back to the good thought. Again and again until it sticks.

, You are currently on a spiritual quest. Every day you are growing spiritually and every day you are gaining more control over your reality. Do not let yourself forget this.


As you lay there in bed at night imagine that you are holding the Earth as a little globe in your hand and now sense your immenseness in comparison to it. This is how big you really are. You are a spiritual being having a human experience which means there is truly nothing on this planet that you cannot handle. In reality you are so much bigger than all of it. Truly feel your immenseness in relation to the problem and realize that in ""reality"" that problem is nothing more than a speck of dust you can simply blow away. This is a great mental exercise.







, This is an awesome exercise you may have learned in gym class. It is simple, but can be very effective in getting yourself to sleep or back to sleep.

, Tense your feet as tightly as you can to a count of 8 then gently release the muscles also to a count of 8. Then feel as if your feet have simply ""disappeared"" into oblivion. Next do your calves. Tense, tense, tense as you count to 8, release, release, release as you count to 8 - until you feel them completely disappear. Then move up to your thighs, your butt, your stomach, your chest, arms, hands etc. Do this for your entire body. By the time you are done, you will feel as if you are floating or as if your body has completely disappeared. Now the only thing you will sense is your deep breathing. This exercise can work wonders for both your body and your mind. You will find it even works really well if you've had a nightmare, so give it a try.

, You can experience far more spiritual growth in your sleep than you ever can during your waking hours. For years I have purposely said affirmations or read particular spiritual concepts that I have wanted to absorb subconsciously and have found how much easier the ideas stick when I absorb them right before bedtime. So not only can this help distract you from your normal worries but it in fact also expedites your spiritual growth.

Be open to hypnosis.,
Find someone you can trust.,
Clear your mind.,
Choose a focal point.,
Practice breathing exercises.,
Enter a trance.,
Disconnect your body from your mind.",How to Fall Asleep by Having Someone Else Hypnotize You1," Studies show that hypnosis engages pleasant memories and reduces pain perception in the brain by 50%.However, for hypnosis to work, you must be open to it. If you’re skeptical, you won't be able to relax into what your hypnosis partner is suggesting. Hypnosis works better for people who are considered “highly hypnotizable.""Someone who is ""highly hypnotizable"" has a high level of hypnotic ability. This basically means that they fully believe in the hypnotic process and do not have many doubts about hypnosis working on them.
A person's ability to be hypnotized is usually classified as high, medium or low.;
, The most important part of a hypnosis environment is trusting the person you’ve recruited. Opening your mind up to someone is a vulnerable thing, and you don’t want someone who might take advantage of this.


Make sure you find someone who doesn’t like playing practical jokes. Even though you trust someone, if they enjoy playing tricks, chances are they may use your hypnotic state as a joke. This can induce mental stress.
You may be called upon to hypnotize someone else to help them sleep. Try to be someone whom others can trust implicitly.
Have your partner read up on hypnosis practices, like guided imagery and breathing exercises.

, High levels of adrenalin make it difficult to sleep, so mulling over your day’s anxieties right when you’re about to undergo hypnosis does not work. Sweep anxiety away by having your partner suggest things that trigger feelings of happiness.Your partner should ask questions to help you push fear, anxieties, and stress out of your mind focus instead on happy thoughts. For example, a good starting question might be, “What is an object that makes you feel relaxed when you touch it?”


The questions your partner asks should help you reach a positive mental state. For example, your partner might ask you to visualize going to your favorite place. This place can be attached to a memory, or it can be a place you create purely from your imagination. Picture yourself walking to the place, opening the door, and stepping inside.
It helps to picture your body being located in a soothing position, such as suspended in water, floating in space, and so on.
If you can’t get to a relaxed state with guided questions, have your hypnosis partner describe in great detail a place that is peaceful, such as someone walking through a forest and finding a soft place to rest.

, A focal point can be a memory or thought that has arisen from your hypnotist’s questions, or it can be an object in your room. Use this focal point to dismiss negative or wandering thoughts. Let your mind fill with the memory or object, dismissing all other thoughts and worries.


For example, when a stray thought surfaces, repeat the name of the focal point object in your mind until the unwanted thought disappears.
If your focal point is a memory, repeat the name of the place or people involved until the unwanted thought goes away.
Verbalizing your mental experience will ground you in it and create a deeper zone of comfort.

, After your mind is settled in your favorite place, let your hypnosis partner guide you through breathing exercises. These help your body purge negative emotion and muscle tension, further relaxing you.


One breathing exercise is to pretend you have holes in your feet. Imagine hot air blowing up through these holes, visualizing the air flowing up through your legs and filling your lungs. When you release the breath, imagine the air flowing back down through the same holes., The ability to “let go” in your mind is essential for entering a hypnotic state, otherwise known as a trance. This is why you’ve selected someone you trust and are very comfortable with. You feel suspended between wakefulness and sleep, often feeling like you are hovering above your own body.


In a trance, you aren’t exactly unconscious of your surroundings, but you’re disconnected to the point of not being aware of them.
In other words, your mind is awake while your body is asleep. The less mental activity you perform, the deeper your trance will be., Bring your awareness inward. In a trance, you are able to use your imagination without being shackled by your inward critic.As you begin your journey toward a trance, you will probably hear a negative voice in your mind get louder. This is your ""inner critic,"" and if you are not already a highly hypnotizable person, this critical voice will increase. This is because your doubts about hypnosis will try to stop the process from happening.
Silence the negative voice by concentrating on your focal point. The critical voice should fade to the background as your trance deepens.

"
"
Allow yourself to get drowsy.,
Start falling asleep.,
Be aware it might not always work.",How to Fall Asleep by Having Someone Else Hypnotize You2," Once you are in a hypnotic state, you should feel very relaxed and drowsy, like you’re about to fall asleep for a nap. Go with the feeling as you allow yourself to be verbally guided by your hypnotist to places in your imagination.


At this point your partner should be quietly waiting for you to drift off to sleep. He or she should leave the room when you seem to be in a relaxed, drowsy state. Further intervention could keep you awake.

, After establishing your mind in a visualized comfort zone and you feel that your mind is in fact disconnecting from your body, you're ready to begin falling asleep. The anxious thoughts that might have bothered your mind without hypnosis have been silenced, and as a result, it is likely your dreams will be less disturbing and your sleep will be deeper.


If you're doing this in the evening, your body will already be feeling the need for sleep. Do not fight this feeling! It is an indication that the hormone melatonin is being released into your body, a facilitator in falling asleep.Stage one of sleep includes dozing off because our brain waves and muscle activity are slowing down.Hypnosis pairs perfectly with this stage because you are purposefully slowing down your brain activity and telling your muscle activity to cease.
Understand that our bodies don't switch on and off between sleeping and wakefulness. It takes time for your brain to gradually shut down. That is why you are undergoing hypnosis.

, If you struggle with insomnia, hypnosis might take some time to work. If you are not a highly hypnotic person, it may also take a few days of practice before you are willing to let go and get into a trance.


If you follow a sleep routine, your body will learn to take its cues from your activities. Your brain will trigger sleep hormones and be more willing to fall asleep.
If you don't have a hypnosis partner every night, you can walk yourself through some of the guided imagery alone, such as getting to your favorite place and doing the breathing exercises.

Take a warm bath.,
Dress in comfortable clothes.,
Make a cozy bed.,
Use aromatherapy.,
Listen to soothing sounds.,
Dim the lights.",How to Fall Asleep by Having Someone Else Hypnotize You3," Submerging your body in warm water actually causes a rise in skin temperature—resulting in a drop in body temperature—that triggers your mind for sleep.The key is to obey the drowsiness.

Don’t use linens that will heat you up in your sleep. For example, jersey knit or flannel sheets are soft, but they tend to hold in body heat.
Use a mattress that's just right for your back. One either too soft or too firm can cause back pain. Experts say that people sleep better on newer mattresses, and a good mattress is one that relieves pressure on joints., The scent of lavender is known to help people fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply. You can add scent to your bedroom before a hypnosis session by diffusing an essential oil or lighting a candle.

In several studies, people who sniffed lavender before sleep slept better, and infants cried less and slept better after a bath with lavender oils in it., There are many self-hypnosis audio recordings available on the internet. Even though you’re having someone else hypnotize you, having these soothing sounds in the background can enhance the effects of hypnosis.

, Lights can interrupt sleep rhythms, not to mention make it difficult to fall asleep in the first place.

Make your room cool, clean, and quiet.,
Use muscle and mental relaxing exercises to prepare your brain for sleep.,
Five minutes before bed, turn on light music or white noise.,
Fifteen minutes before going to bed, stretch out gently.,
A half-hour before going to bed, take a bath or eat a light snack to start getting drowsy.,
An hour before going to bed, turn away from all electronic screens, media, and work.,
Two hours before bed, dim the lights in your house.,
In the afternoon, avoid drinking any caffeine or consuming a lot of alcohol.",How to Fall Asleep1," The best conditions to sleep are when you are:


Cooler than room temperature, a little below 72 degrees Fahrenheit (or 22 degrees Celsius).
In soft, breathable clothing. You want room between your skin and the fabric.
In the dark. You should turn off all lights and keep nightlights at a distance.;
, Once you've laid down and are ready to sleep, it's time to think about anything but sleep. Use the following techniques to distract your mind. Remember, stressing or thinking about falling asleep is the quickest way to stay awake.



Contract and relax your muscles. Tense, then release each and every muscle in your body slowly. Focus on ""moving"" from your toes to your neck, then back again.

Count your breaths. Focus on deep, regular breaths. Inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, then exhale for eight seconds.

Visualize something repetitive. Watch yourself shoot free throws, water your garden, or count sheep. Pick an activity you know and drift into it, counting each one.

, Constant sounds, unlike those coming from a window or snoring partner, make for great sleep. Even more importantly, they make the odd noises in the night -- like a barking dog-- seem less loud by comparison, soothing you to sleep.


Try a classical music station on Pandora, Spotify, or any music player that you know.
Listen to waves, raindrops, wind noises, or other calm, consistent sounds. You can find them on many white noise and music apps.
Make use of a meditation app like Slumber, Calm, or Headspace.
Try dimming the lights 30 minutes to an hour before bed. Research shows this to be helpful falling asleep.

, Reach down and gently touch your toes. Pull your foot back to your bum to stretch your thighs. Slowly reach your arms up and stretch to the sky.


Do the stretches that you love, holding them gently and without pain.
A little basic yoga is often used to go to sleep. Try out yoga for meditation.

, A warm bath, especially with a little lavender oil, will slow down your body's activity and make it easier to fall asleep. A light snack will do the same thing, creating a pleasant sense of drowsiness.


Good snacks include bananas, dairy, avocados, lean proteins like poultry or fish, and also nuts. Anything that isn't sugary or fatty will generally feel best.
Lavender oil, or lavender essence, is a great way to get the drowsy benefits of a bath without actually taking a bath.

, The time for screens and work is over. Computer screens actually trigger your brain to stay awake, as the blue light subconsciously tricks you into thinking that it's daytime.


Once work is over, there is nothing you're going to fix or make better by continuing to think about it. If you're really struggling to turn off work mode, try writing your thoughts or plans by hand in a journal.
Reading, talking to a partner, and preparing lunch, clothes, etc. for the next day are great ways to get off the screens and start the process of relaxing.
Sleep is not a switch you just turn on. The earlier you start relaxing, the easier it will be to sleep.
If you feel that using your phone before you go to bed is a way for you to relax make sure to use apps like Twilight that reduces the blue light and don't do anything engaging or stressful. That means, stay away from email, social media, heavy reading, and movies. Instead, engage in things that make you more relaxed like meditation videos, playing sleep games, or light reading.

, Bright light after sundown tells your brain that the sun is coming back up, and it's time to sleep. Use your dimmers, adjust the brightness on computers and TV, and aim for soft, yellow-orange lights. Yellow light can signal sunset, and the need to sleep.


Try a computer program like Flux that automatically lowers your screen brightness as the sun goes down, helping your brain adapt.
You may not feel like the light is keeping you up, but it actually prevents the creation of melatonin, a neurochemical essential for sleep.

, Both of these chemicals will keep you up and lead to uneven, difficult nights in bed. Instead, try exercising in the afternoon, which will give you a boost in metabolism and energy in the short term and make it easier to sleep when night approaches.


Switch to decaf after 12:00, as caffeine will stick in your system hours after you've felt the effects.
While some people think alcohol makes you drowsy, it leads to uneven, restless sleep in the long run.

Spend at least one hour before bedtime relaxing your mind in preparation. Do this outside of bed.
Dim the lights, and avoid television, computer, and phone screens. You're trying to quiet your mind.;
, Just as a warm bath, a bottle, and a bed-time story lets a baby's body know that it's time to start winding down, a set, relaxing routine before bedtime will train your body to start relaxing.Take a relaxing bath.Add a few drops of one of the essential oils, such as rose or lavender, to help yourself relax.
Read a set amount of a good book. Only read one chapter a night — don't let yourself get sucked into reading through the night.
Listen to calming music. The British Academy of Sound Therapy has put together a playlist of the most relaxing songs according to science. Their playlist includes artists such as Marconi Union, Coldplay, and Enya.

, Believe it or not, a glass of warm milk might really help you sleep better. Dairy products are high in tryptophan, an amino acid that helps make you feel sleepy.You may also enjoy the sedative effect of an herbal tea, such as chamomile, passion flower, or valerian root.Avoid beverages that have caffeine, including some teas. Green tea and black tea tend to have fairly high levels of caffeine, so choose an herbal tea that says “caffeine-free” instead.
Avoid alcohol before bed. While it may help you fall asleep faster, alcohol also reduces your REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which can make you feel unrested when you wake up the next morning. It may also cause sleep apnea, which further disturbs your rest.Cherries contain natural melatonin, a compound that helps your body fall asleep. Try drinking a small glass of tart cherry juice before bed., Some people may find eating a small snack before bedtime helps them sleep. Doctors recommend a small, carbohydrate-rich snack to increase your levels of tryptophan. Try a slice of toast or a small bowl of cereal.Don’t eat a huge meal before bed. Your digestive system slows down when you’re asleep, so having too much food in your system can cause heartburn or could even cause you to choke.
One study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that eating a small bowl of jasmine rice -- a complex carbohydrate that digests slowly -- four hours before bed helped participants fall asleep more quickly than a quickly-digestible carbohydrate.Avoid snacks that might have caffeine, such as chocolate. You should also stay away from foods that are very high in sugar, as these may make you feel more awake and jumpy.
Other snack foods that may help include bananas, eggs, peanuts, oats, and yogurt. They all contain tryptophan.Bananas also contain magnesium and potassium, which can help your body relax., Though different people will have different preferences, everyone should make sure the blinds are drawn to block out any light that may come through the windows. Light in your bedroom may keep you from falling asleep.Set the temperature to your ideal sleeping temperature. Some people like it warmer, some like it colder — figure out what you like.
Use aromatherapy if you find that relaxing, though some will find it cloying and distracting. Do not light a scented candle, as it could be very dangerous if you fell asleep before extinguishing the flame. Try a scented oil reed diffuser or something like a Glade plug-in.

, Change into designated sleep clothes that don't restrict your comfort or movement. Some people hate the feeling of high collars when trying to sleep, while others can't bear sleeves. Some people need socks to warm their feet, while others can't stand it. Figure out what works for you.Consider the fabric choice for your sleeping attire. Cotton fabric is lightweight and breathes easily. Silk allows your body to regulate its temperature effectively. Bamboo naturally wicks away moisture.If you want to sleep nude, go for it. Especially if you’re prone to overheating while you sleep, going au naturel could help you sleep more comfortably.

, This will block out any unwanted light that might be drawing your attention away from sleeps. Cooling sleep masks are often especially relaxing.

, Concentrate on your breathing and how it feels in your body. If you find your mind wandering, acknowledge it and bring your attention back to your breathing.Close your eyes.
Inhale deeply through your nose for four to five seconds.
Hold your breath for a comfortable amount of time (try to count to “7”).
Exhale purposefully, controlling the rate of exhalation instead of letting all the air just rush out of your lungs. Try to exhale for a count of “8”.
Repeat this sequence three times.

, Studies have shown that learning mindfulness meditation can significantly improve the quality of your sleep.Mindfulness focuses on accepting your experiences in the moment without judgment. These techniques can be especially helpful when you find your mind wandering.Lie in bed. Prepare with your breathing exercises. Continue breathing deeply as you proceed.
Check in with your thoughts. Just see what’s going on in your mind. Don’t try to “stop” thinking or resist your thoughts in any way. Accept their flow.
Check in with your body. Focus your attention on where your body makes contact with the bed. Is your weight distributed evenly? Are there any places where you feel discomfort?
Check in with your senses. What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you feel? Determine whether these sensory experiences are things you can change or things that are out of your control. If you can’t control the noise, acknowledge this.
Return your attention to your body. Do a “scan” from head to toe. Observe any areas where you feel discomfort, tension, or tightness. When you notice tension, remind yourself that you will soon be asleep, and that rest will relax you. Also notice any areas where you feel pleasant or comfortable.
Go through your thoughts, starting at the beginning of your day. Take about three minutes to review your day in a focused way. Allow yourself to “replay” the events, thoughts, and feelings of the day, but don’t get wrapped up in them. Acknowledge that each happened and then move to the next thought or event.
Finally, “switch off” your body. Go through your body from toes to head. Focus your attention on one part of your body, such as your feet, and tell yourself “time for sleep” or “switch off.” Proceed up through your body until you reach your face. Once you have told your whole body to rest, relax and drift off.
Dr. Deepak Chopra has a video tutorial for a mindful sleep meditation.The UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center has a downloadable MP3 “sleep scan” meditation., Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) helps you relax your body by intentionally tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups throughout your body.It can be very helpful in teaching your body to completely relax before sleep.


Lie down and close your eyes. Begin with your feet. Tense the muscles in your feet by curling your toes downward and clenching as hard as you can for about 5 seconds. Then, exhale as you release the tension. Allow yourself to feel the difference for about 15 seconds, then move to the next muscle group.
Move up to your calves. Tighten your calf muscle by sticking out your heels and pulling your toes up towards your face. Hold this position as tight as you can for about 5 seconds. Exhale as you release the tension. Enjoy the relaxation for 15 seconds, then move on again.
Repeat the tensing and releasing process through the rest of the muscle groups: leg, hand, arm, buttocks, stomach, chest, neck and shoulders, mouth, eyes, and forehead.
Dartmouth and Brigham Young University offer downloadable PMR audio exercises on their websites.You can also find helpful videos on YouTube.

, Counting sheep is an old standby, by it’s generally too “active” and requires too much concentration to put you to sleep.Instead, try picturing a relaxing scene that you find pleasant and soothing. Studies have shown that this type of “imagery distraction” helps you fall asleep faster and sleep better.Begin by closing your eyes and imagining yourself in a restful, calming place. This can be anywhere: a waterfall, a beach, the woods, anywhere where you have felt peaceful and relaxed.“Color in” as many sensory details as you can. What does the place look like? What are the various sounds and smells? What can you hear? What are the textures and touch senses you feel?
Imagine yourself in your restful place. You don’t have to “do” anything there, but if you do choose an activity, go for something steady and rhythmic that mimics your breathing, such as rocking in a hammock, rowing a boat, or walking on a path., Your brain processes sounds even when you’re asleep. Playing ambient sounds or “white noise,” such as a waterfall or raindrops, can help your brain “tune out” other background noises.Some people do better with “pink noise,” a combination of sounds that increase and decrease frequency.Avoid sounds with words or other information that your brain may try to process. Don’t listen to music with words or have the TV on when you’re trying to sleep.
Experiment with what works for you. You may find that jungle noises or the sound of waves on a beach is more soothing. Others may prefer soft mechanical noises.
You can purchase a white-noise machine or download one of the many apps for your phone or tablet. Commonly recommended apps include Lightning Bug, Sleep Fan, White Noise, Sleep Bug, and Chroma Doze., If you have done all these activities and you still don’t feel sleepy, don’t stay in bed fighting the frustration. This may actually key you up and make it more difficult for you to get to sleep later. Instead, get up, go to another room, and do something relaxing for a little while.Don’t do anything too stimulating, like watching TV or doing physical activities.
Keep the lights dim. Bright light will keep you awake.
Try reading or listening to soft, soothing music for a few minutes.
When you start to feel drowsy, go back to bed.

, Just as your body will start keying down if you have a regular bed-time routine, it will also start keying down if you have a regular sleep-schedule from day to day.Don't stay up till 2 a.m. one night, then wonder why you can't fall asleep at 10 p.m. the next. Choose a reasonable bedtime that will allow you to get the recommended 7-8 hours of sleep you should be getting each night.
Experiment with when you need to go to bed and wake up to feel most rested. This can vary from person to person. Try to go to bed at the best time for you every night.

, If you use your bed all the time — when you're reading, when you're working from home, when you're watching TV — then your body won't think of it as a place to shut down and sleep. Use the other rooms in your house during the day, and return to your bed only when you're ready to sleep in it., It's good to work through the problems that might keep you up at night be writing them down in a journal. This will help you vent frustrations, and maybe even help you work out solutions to how to fix these problems.


Don't do this right before bed, as that will keep your worries fresh in your mind.
Do this before the hour of relaxation that should precede bedtime.

, If you're letting your body rest during the day, it won't feel the need to wind down at the end of the day. Even if you're tired during the day, push through until bedtime.If you must nap, set a timer for 15 minutes.That's all you need to restore your alertness and energy — anything beyond that is overkill.
Try to avoid napping after 5 PM., If your mattress is making your back hurt, or your pillow is making your neck hurt, you'll never get to sleep. If you can spare the cash, it's worth it to buy a mattress that will help you get the rest you need.Go to a mattress store and try out several different beds. You must be able to test the mattress, preferably for at least 5 minutes.
Figure out if you need a firm or soft mattress, and buy the mattress that works best for you. You should feel comfortable on the mattress.

, If you're trying to fall asleep but keep getting interrupted by noises from the street or around the house, try to block them out with a regular noise.


Turn on a fan.
Close the windows.
Invest in thick, sound-dampening curtains.
Turn your phone on silent, not vibrate.

, Caffeine, in particular, should be avoided after 2-3PM, as it takes a long time to leave your system and will absolutely affect the quality of your sleep. Alcohol may make your drowsy, but it will hurt deep sleep, leading you to wake up later in the night or feel restless or tired the next day.Nicotine has a similar effect as caffeine, so you should avoid smoking before bed for the best sleep.

, If you go to bed at the same time each day, your body will quickly adapt and help you fall asleep at that time each and every night. This same thing happens if you wake up at the same time each day, as you body will adapt to become tired when 7-8 hours before it expects to wake up the next morning. The best way to fall asleep regularly is to make sure your sleep cycle is regular. If you don't know your schedule, or how long you should sleep for:


For two weeks, go to bed at the exact same time.
Get out of bed when you wake up in the morning — don't hit snooze or keep sleeping.
Write down the time you wake up each morning.
After two weeks or so, you'll notice that you start getting up at the same time every morning. If you've been going to bed at the same time, you can use this to find out exactly how much sleep your body needs, personally, each night., Regular exercise, including 1-2 hours of cardio (running, biking, swimming, etc) each week and 2-3 strength training sessions (yoga, weights, aerobics) as been shown by the University of Maryland to significantly decrease sleeping problems in adults.Don't exercise in the three hours leading up to bedtime. Exercise awakens you, with the impact often lasting up to three hours after you've completed the exercise, as well as decreasing the secretion of needed melatonin (naturally helps regulate your sleep)., If you need a nap, nap no more than 15 minutes (a power nap). Naps break up your sleep schedule and make it much harder to fall asleep in the future. Anything longer can make it much harder to fall asleep in the evenings., Stress, anxiety, worry, and depression can all contribute to an inability to fall asleep. Seek help for stress management, including finding positive techniques to handle stress such as yoga, relaxation, cognitive behavioral therapy, self-hypnosis, assertiveness training, meditation, exercise, visualization, etc.Psychotherapy can be helpful if you have underlying anxiety, trauma, or depression issues., Stress, anxiety, or depression can all affect your sleeping patterns.If it's bad enough that you're losing sleep on a regular basis, contact your primary care physician. Some symptoms to look out for include:


Long standing insomnia, continuing for several weeks or months.
You are unable to stay awake during the day, especially during crucial moments.
You have mood swings, irritability, or constant feelings of stress.
You wake up in pain, or unable to breath."

Ingesting caffeine before bed, even if you are a regular coffee drinker, can make you feel more alert, delay your sense of sleepiness, and keep you from getting to bed on time.This means avoiding beverages like coffee (even decaf coffee), soda, and non-herbal teas.
Chocolate also contains measurable amounts of caffeine. It’s a good idea to skip the chocolate before bedtime as well.;
, It’s important to give your brain a chance to slow down from the day before you try to make yourself go to bed. For this reason, you should stop working (whether it’s job-related or school-related) at least one hour before bed so you can unwind a bit.This also means that you should quit working on homework or other projects at least one hour before you plan to go to sleep.

, One of the main problems with eating before bedtime is that these most likely constitute as extra calories from an extra meal that may push you over your caloric intake for the day. But eating before bed, especially sugary (or otherwise unhealthy) items can cause a spike in your blood sugar that delays your sleep hormones.A good rule of thumb is to avoid eating for at least two hours before bed.
If you must eat something before bed, try to eat something that is high in fiber and low in sugar like apple slices and almond butter, some carrot sticks with hummus, or half an avocado.

, While the jury is still out about whether or not herbal tea actually helps people become sleepier, studies have shown that it does help people feel more relaxed as they drink it. This is equally important when getting ready for bedtime.Try choosing a tea that contains chamomile, lavender, peppermint, spearmint, or lemon grass.
Make sure you choose an herbal tea with no caffeine.

, Different people have varying sleep needs. For example, babies need much more sleep each day than adults. And older adults require even less sleep than younger adults. Knowing how much sleep you need each night will help you calculate when you need to set your bedtime.Newborns typically need 14-17 hours per day.
Infants typically need 12-15 hours of sleep per day.
Children need 9-11 hours of sleep per day.
Teenagers require 8-10 hours of sleep per day.
Adults typically need 7-9 hours of sleep per day

, Don’t wait until you start to feel sleepy, as this may keep you up longer than you want to stay awake. Additionally, the act of getting ready for bed may make you more alert, causing you to stay up later than your desired bedtime.Set a reasonable bedtime goal that works for your schedule.

, Doing the same things every night before bed will help signal to your body that it is time to start getting sleepy. Try to create a sleep time ritual that you can perform every night before bed so you get into the habit. This will help you go to bed at the desired time every night.Your bedtime ritual could include things like brushing your teeth, washing your face, setting out your clothes for the next day, packing your lunch for work tomorrow, or taking the dog outside to go to the bathroom.

, In an effort to reduce your stress at bedtime, it might be beneficial to spend a little time preparing yourself for what you have to do in the morning. Feeling ready for the next day will help you relax and fall asleep more quickly.You can do things like picking out your outfit for the next day, packing your lunch, catching up on correspondence, reviewing notes for a big meeting, creating a to-do list, or organizing your purse/briefcase.

, Reading in bed is one of the best ways to relax and destress yourself after a long day. Immersing yourself in another world allows you to forget the worries of your own life and start relaxing your body and your mind as your prepare yourself for sleep.You should start to feel more relaxed and ready for bed after as little as six minutes reading.
The genre doesn’t matter. Even reading a suspenseful story will help you relax before bed.

, One of the best things you can do to ensure that you won’t get distracted while you’re trying to fall asleep is to turn your phone on silent. Nothing is worse than getting jolted awake by the sound of your phone’s ringtone when you are almost fast asleep.Turning your phone on silent will allow you to still receive your messages and check your phone for the time (if you need to) without giving other people the opportunity to distract you and keep you awake.

, Keeping your bedroom dark at night helps maintain your body’s circadian rhythm and helps you fall asleep at a reasonable time. Eliminating the light source will help your mind relax while you are trying to drift off to sleep.Exposing yourself to as much daylight as possible during the daytime will also assist in syncing your body’s internal clock so that you can go to sleep at a reasonable time once the sun has set.

, Using the internet before bed can be counterproductive to sleep for several reasons. First, it keeps your mind busy and occupied, which means that your brain can’t begin its wind-down toward bedtime routine. If you read something exciting or interesting, this will make you feel more alert and energized, making it harder for you to fall asleep immediately after.Watching television before bed can be quite disruptive to your sleep patterns. There is a special blue light emitted by electronic screens that suppresses melatonin (the hormone that regulates sleep) and keeps you awake longer.This also applies to playing games on your smartphone or tablet as you try to fall asleep. These electronic screens have been proven to prevent people from getting the sleep they need.
If you must use a screen before bedtime, try turning the brightness down.

Engage in progressive muscle relaxation.,
Do some gentle yoga.,
Take a warm bath.,
Steer clear of caffeine.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Be physically active during the day.",How to Relax Before Going to Bed1," If you regularly struggle with nighttime relaxation, getting ready for bed might itself be a source of stress. This leads to a vicious cycle where your nerves make it even harder to fall asleep. You can counter your nerves by practicing deep breathing techniques. Close your eyes and breathe in deeply through your nose, counting to five. Then slowly breathe out through your mouth, counting to five again. Continue for several minutes, until you feel your heart rate slowing down and your muscles relaxing.Focus solely on your breathing and try and clear your mind of all other thoughts during this time.Make this part of your regular bedtime routine so that you associate the deep breathing exercise with going to sleep. Soon the deep breathing exercises will signal to your body that it should prepare for bed.;
, Tense and then relax each of the different muscle groups in your body one by one. This can be an effective way to relax you before bed or even while you are lying in bed.Tense the muscle by flexing and contracting them for around ten seconds. Visualize the muscle being tensed. Release the tension and allow your whole body to go limp before moving on to the next muscle group. Start with your toes, and then work your way up to your calves, thighs, back, arms, and face. You should feel more relaxed throughout your entire body and forget the troubles of the day.Be sure to keep all other muscles relaxed while you tense a particular one.

, Gentle yoga can also help your body relax as you prepare to go to bed. A slow and steady yoga routine of five to fifteen minutes can relieve physical and mental tension.Only use basic poses, no power poses that might energize you. Just do basic twists and stretches. Some examples are:


Child's pose. For this, you sit on your heels, and with your arms out to the side, lower your body down over your knees, bringing your forehead down towards the floor.
Standing bends. Lift your hands up above your head, stretching your spine and gently bend down, keeping your back straight.
Jathara Parivrtti. Lie on your back with your arms out away from your body, palms down. Bend your legs and raise them so your hips and perpendicular to the floor. Lower your legs to right, bring them back up to the center, and then lower them to the left., Having a warm bath 15-30 minutes before bed can be a great way to help you relax before sleep. Ensure the bath is warm rather than really hot to get the best possible conditions for relaxation.Having a regular warm bath before bed can help your body to recognize that it is the end of the day and time to wind down.


You can couple a warm bath with soothing music and aromatherapy oils to help you relax even more. Use lavender or chamomile to create a relaxing aromatherapy bath.

, Cutting down on stimulants such as caffeine can be very helpful if you are struggling to relax before bed. Avoid tea, coffee, or other caffeinated substances in the late afternoon and evening as they make it harder to fall asleep and can prevent the important deep sleep you need. The effects of caffeine can last up to 24 hours, so it can be an important factor in sleeping problems. Caffeine can also raise your heart rate, making you feel more nervous and jittery.Replace caffeine with warm milk or herbal teas, such as chamomile or peppermint.
Other stimulants such as nicotine,sugary foods and beverages, and heavy meals can also make it harder to relax., While many people experience sleepiness immediately after drinking alcohol, alcohol makes sleep overall less restful and restorative. Alcohol can also increase your chances of experiencing middle insomnia when you wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep. Steer clear of alcoholic beverages if you want to feel fully relaxed overnight., Keeping your body active during daytime hours can help your body be prepared to relax before bed. Exercise vigorously for 20-30 minutes daily by running, jogging, swimming, or biking. Make sure that you exercise in the morning or early afternoon. Evening exercise tends to energize the body instead of relaxing it.Having exposure to sunlight during the day will also help your body relax in the evening hours. Consider exercising during daylight hours to get a dose of sunlight."

Establish a pre-sleep routine.,
Write down what's on your mind.,
Breathe out of your left nostril.,
Read.,
Meditate.,
Listen to relaxing music.",How to Calm Your Imagination Before Sleep1," It's difficult to calm your imagination and your mind if you are going until you try to fall asleep. Keeping your body and mind active before bed makes it nearly impossible to shut it off so you can sleep. To help this, establish a pre-sleep routine. This helps wind your body down so that it and your mind is relaxed when you finally crawl into bed. Plus, routine helps your body know what's coming when you do those activities or when it's that time of day. Start your routine at least 30 minutes you plan on falling asleep.Try reading, doing light stretches or yoga, listening to relaxing music, or watching some light, calming television.;
, One way to help calm your imagination is to write down what's in your head before bed. Keep a journal by your bed. An hour or so before bed, write down the thoughts whirling through your head. Try to be as detailed as possible. Think about emptying your head of any thoughts so it will be clear when you go to bed.








This can also work with any anxieties. This can help you get out your worries before bed so you're not lying there and stressing., Breathing out of only your left nostril is supposed to help relax your sympathetic nervous system.This can calm your mind and imagination and help you fall asleep.









Close your right nostril with the thumb of your right hand. Breathe in slowly and deeply through your left nostril. Hold, then exhale. Repeat, letting the tension release from your body as you calm your mind., Engaging in a calming activity, like reading, before bed can help the body start to relax as it prepares for sleep.Since you don't want to stimulate your imagination too much, make sure to read a book that won't get your adrenaline or mind racing. Try something fun and soothing, or something you have read before.








, Take up meditation. Try meditation before you go to sleep. Meditation calms the mind, and some types of meditation teach you how to clear your mind completely. Try these tricks when you're starting:









Concentrate on each breath you take. Breathe slowly and enjoy each breath. Concentrate on how good it feels to be able to breathe. When you slow your breathing, this tends to slow your heart rate as well, which ultimately calms you down.
Clear your head of all thoughts and focus on how good it feels to have your mind completely empty. If a thought comes into your mind, refocus, and just relax.
Clear your head by throwing away the thoughts that keep you awake. Imagine a garbage bag. Lift up the predominant thought that keeps you awake from your head, and imagine that you put it in the bag. Now that this thought is out of your head, you can notice a previous thought popping up in your head. Throw this in the bag as well. Keep doing this until your head feels clear of thoughts. Then, tie up the bag and throw the bag as far away as you can imagine. You have now let go of the things that keep you awake, and you are ready to start falling asleep.
Try progressive muscle relaxation. Starting at your feet or your head, single out each muscle group. Tense that muscle group, then relax it., If your imagination won't calm down, try turning on some relaxing music. This helps keep your mind from focusing on what is in your head and more on the music which in turn relaxes you. Make sure you listen to the music at a low volume. Listen to music that is soothing, like instrumental.

Disregard the text and numbers at the top of your scan.,
Start from the top of the image.,
Consider the differences in colors.,
Watch for common visual effects.",How to Read an Ultrasound Picture1," Most hospitals and ultrasound centers use this space to include details like your name, hospital reference number, or ultrasound machine settings. Since this information does not have anything to do with what you see on the ultrasound image, you can ignore this information., The top of the screen or printed image is where the ultrasound probe was placed. In other words, the image you see shows what the organ or tissues look like from the side rather than from the top.For example, if you are having an ultrasound of your uterus, then what you see at the top of the screen or printed ultrasound would be the outline of the tissues above your uterus. As you look further down the screen, you will see deeper tissues, such as the lining of your uterus, the inside of your uterus, and the back of your uterus.

, Most ultrasound images are in black and white, but you can see differences in the shades of black and white in your ultrasound scan. The color differences come from the differences in the densities of the materials that the sound passes through.


Solid tissues, like bone, will appear white because the outer surface reflects more sound.
Tissues that are filled with liquid, like the uterus, will appear dark.
Ultrasound imaging does not work well for gas, so organs that are filled with air, like the lungs, are generally not examined with ultrasound.

, Since ultrasound uses sound to create images of the inner structures of your body, the images are not crystal clear. There are many different visual effects that can happen as a result of the ultrasound’s settings, angle, or of the density of the tissues being examined. Some of the most common visual effects to watch for include:Enhancement. This is when part of the structure being examined appears brighter than it should due to an excess of fluids in the area, such as in a cyst.

Attenuation. Also known as shadowing, this effect causes the area being scanned to appear darker than it should.

Anisotropy. This effect has to do with the angle of the probe. For example, holding the probe at a right angle to some tendons would cause the area to appear brighter than normal, so it is necessary to adjust the angle of the probe to avoid this effect.

, Regardless of age and general sleep recommendations, your body requires adequate rest to function at its best.


Make sleep a priority in your life. It contributes to your body and mind’s optimal functioning.Numerous negative consequences of insufficient sleep include disease, chronic inflammation, high blood pressure and stress, diabetes, obesity and mood disorders.Lack of sleep also affects mental performance such as the ability to focus. It may affect your ability to do your job well., When you wake up every day, record in a sleep diary how long and well you slept, and how you felt after waking up. Your sleep diary can help you identify patterns that are hindering (or helping) your sleep.Your sleep diary may indicate factors that are impacting your sleep. Remove or adjust these as necessary and continue to write in your diary. For example, you might notice that on days you nap that you don’t sleep as well at night. If this is the case, try skipping your nap and see if that helps you get to sleep on time.
Talk to your doctor if you have trouble sleeping over a long period of time or notice distinct patterns in your sleep., There will be circumstances in which you need to adjust your sleeping habits. From high stress events to illness and even to just identifying problems in your sleeping habits with a sleep diary, adjusting your sleep to these situations will help you get enough sleep and maintain your health.


Accommodate for situations that require you to change your sleep. Be flexible in your schedule and sleep habits to accommodate events that will disrupt your sleep. By adjusting your sleep plans before and after the event, you can make sure you aren’t negatively affected by the change.
If you know that you’re about to enter a particularly stressful time at work, home, or school, you would also want to adjust your sleep patterns to make sure that a lack of sleep doesn’t cause you more stress.

, Naps are a popular way to take a break and recharge during the day. But they can also have the side effect of keeping you from falling and staying asleep. Avoiding naps during the day may help you fall and stay asleep.If you find that you need a nap or naps, take it before 5pm and keep it short. Thirty minutes is enough to help you refresh and recharge.If you find that you need multiple naps during the day or are just generally exhausted at times when you should be awake, consult your doctor to rule out medical conditions., Establish a reasonable time to get to bed on most days, including weekends. Having this designated bedtime will help regulate your circadian rhythms, or body clock, and may also help you fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.When you set your bedtime, make sure that you consider factors like exercise, eating, and alcohol consumption. You want to make sure your body has at least two to three hours to process these activities before you go to bed.The best way to set your internal body clock is to wake up at the same time every day, even if you had a bad night’s sleep.Don’t set a bedtime that is too late or one that corresponds to when you feel tired so that you don’t stay alert and in turn not get tired.Stick to this schedule as much as possible and adjust it if necessary., You won’t want or be able to sleep if your bedroom isn’t comfortable. By controlling factors such as the temperature and darkness, having comfortable bedding, and removing stimulating electronics, you will help yourself get to bed on time and fall and stay asleep.


Set temperature in bedroom to between 60 to 75 °F (15.6 to 23.9 °C) for optimal sleeping conditions.Keep computers, TV and work materials out of room to strengthen association between bedroom and sleep.Light stimulates you to be awake, so make sure that your room is dark enough to sleep. You can use curtains or eye masks to help with rooms that are exposed to a lot of light.Noise will also keep you from getting to sleep. Keep your room as quiet as possible and consider a white noise machine to combat any loud noises that may filter into your bedroom.A comfortable mattress, pillows, and bedding can make you want to get to bed on time., Exercising early in the day can help you fall and stay asleep because it tires your body and will also relax you. But avoid exercising too close to your bedtime, which may stimulate you and keep you from sleeping.


Exercise at least three hours before bed so that your body temperature and cortisol levels can return to normal. Higher body temperature can make it difficult to sleep and having more cortisol in your system from exercise may stimulate you.Vigorous exercise best, but any activity is better than nothing.Don’t exercise at the expense of your sleep., Caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes are stimulants that will interrupt your sleep. Avoiding them before bedtime will help you get to and stay asleep.


If you consume nicotine or caffeine, avoid them within four to six hours of your bedtime.Limit yourself to one to two alcoholic drinks per day or less and avoid drinking within three hours of bedtime.Even though alcohol might help you fall asleep, after a few hours it acts as a stimulant., Eating too close to your bedtime or having heavy meals can affect your ability to sleep. Plan to eat lighter fare at dinner and within a few hours of your bedtime to ensure that you are able to get and stay asleep.


Try to eat two to three hours before your bedtime.Big or spicy meals can cause discomfort and indigestion.If you’re hungry before bedtime, have a snack about an hour before you turn out the lights., Your body needs time to shift into sleep mode. Taking an hour or so to begin winding down before bed will signal your body and brain that it’s time to sleep and help you get the best night’s rest.Avoid electronics such as televisions, laptops, tablets, and smart phones within an hour of your bedtime. Not only can shows, work, or social media stimulate your brain, but the light from these devices also makes it difficult for your body to fall asleep.Dim the lights in your home and bedroom. Light will stimulate you, so dimming the lights within an hour of your bedtime signals your brain that it’s slowly time to go to bed.Having a calming bedtime ritual will help you wind down for a good night’s sleep.

, Once you’ve begun to wind down and are close to bedtime, having a set ritual will further clues your body that it’s time to go to bed. There are different activities you can do as a part of your ritual such as having tea or a warm bath.


A bedtime routine reduces anxiety, stress or excitement that can make it difficult to fall or stay asleep.Reading a book in bed with the lights dimmed will relax and entertain you while not overstimulating you.
A warm cup of herbal tea such as lavender or chamomile will relax you and help you sleep.A warm bath is not only relaxing, but the rise and fall in body temperature it causes will promote drowsiness, Go to bed at the same time every night whether or not you’re tired. Sticking to this consistent sleep routine will help you get to sleep and stay asleep throughout the night.Getting into a comfortable bed with the lights dimmed may help you get to sleep faster even if you don’t feel tired.
If you can’t fall asleep within 20 minutes of going to bed, go to another room and do something relaxing until you feel tired enough to sleep., If, despite all of your efforts to get a good night’s sleep, you are unable to get to sleep or stay asleep, then consult with your healthcare provider.

Schedule time to wind down before bed.,
Distract yourself instead of stewing.,
Avoid electronic screens at night.,
Visualize positive images.,
Do mental exercises before bed.",How to Relax Before Going to Bed2," Rather than simply hopping into bed and expecting to be relaxed, give yourself at least 15-30 minutes to let your mind unwind after a long and stressful day. There are techniques you can use to let go of taxing or stressful thoughts so that you can relax overnight. For example you can: Write a list of what you have achieved during the day.
Check off your achievements from a to-do list. These can be mundane, everyday tasks which are often the cause of most of our stress.
Write down your thoughts in a diary or journal.Write down your tasks for the next day so that they are not weighing on you in bed.Meditate for 15-30 minutes to clear your head.

, If you find yourself unable to relax in bed, don't let yourself stew for too long. If you cannot relax after 10-15 minutes in bed, get out of bed and do another relaxing activity. Your anxiety will not dissipate on its own. Instead, break the cycle by taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to classical music for 15 minutes or so. Then try to go to bed again. Just be sure that your distraction doesn't involve bright light., Watching television, using a computer, or staring at a smart phone can all have detrimental effects on your ability to relax and go to sleep. In particular, staring at a small bright screen in the dark can disrupt the secretion of melatonin, which regulates our sleep cycle.Ensure you have a clear break between using technological devices and going to bed.Evidence suggests that playing video games in the early evening is linked to loss of sleep, and teenagers who use their phones in bed are more likely to be drowsy during the day., Visualization exercises can reduce stress and anxiety. If you're feeling tense before bed, try a positive visualization exercise. Imagine a place where you feel happy and relaxed. Imagine the sights, sounds, smells and tastes you want to experience. It could be an imaginary scene or a happy memory.Images you might visualize include:


A warm beach.
A cool forest.
Your childhood backyard.

, If you have trouble letting go of stressful events from your day, try to distract yourself with mental exercises. These could be word or number puzzles, or even something as simple as trying to memorize a poem or a song.These mental exercises should be simple enough to help you to feel relaxed but distracting enough that you do not have the mental energy to stress out about your day. For example, you might try:


Sudokus
Crossword puzzles
Reciting your favorite song backwards
Naming all the authors whose last name begins with a certain letter, such as B

Have regular bedtimes.,
Don't use the snooze button.,
Avoid long naps during the day.,
Wake up at the same time every morning.,
Stick to a nightly bedtime routine.",How to Relax Before Going to Bed3," Sticking to a schedule is very important if you want to send relaxing signals to your body at the right time. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule works because you follow your body’s circadian rhythms.It is not just children who need a good bedtime routine; adults also need to relax and unwind before they go to bed. Try to have regular times when you go to bed and wake up every day--even on weekends., The snooze button might be tempting, but it does not lead to high-quality, restful sleep. Instead, it makes it more likely that you will be overtired in the mornings and overenergized in the evening hours when you should be relaxing. Try to resist the urge to hit ""snooze"" in the mornings and instead make yourself get out of bed., It's important to avoid long naps during the day as much as possible. If you can restrict your sleeping to night-time only you will likely have a more relaxing bedtime.If you absolutely have to nap, be sure that you nap for less than 30 minutes and that you nap in the mid-afternoon while it is still light outside. Napping for too long or napping in the evening hours can disrupt your ability to relax at bedtime., It can be difficult, but if you want to stick to your schedule you have to try to avoid sleeping in as much as possible. Set your usual alarm during the weekend as well as during the week. If you go to bed and get up at roughly the same time every day you will program your body to sleep better., Develop a relaxing routine that you perform every night 15-30 minutes before you go to bed.Take a warm bath. Stretch your body. Read a book. Listen to relaxing music. Doing these things every night will help your body know when bedtime is approaching. Incorporating a relaxing activity into your routine will help you fall asleep (and stay asleep). Eventually these activities will signal your body to begin relaxing and preparing for good sleep at the same time every night."

Use your bed only for sleep and intimacy.,
Create a relaxing atmosphere.,
Keep it dark.,
Keep your bedroom cool.,
Choose the right mattress for you.,
Use a white noise machine to cover up stressful sounds.",How to Relax Before Going to Bed4," Avoid doing work, making phone calls, or paying bills in bed. Instead, get used to the idea that your bed is for sleeping or romantic activities. You want your bed to be a place of relaxation--not a work desk. Keep your bed free of clutter, and never perform work activities in bed., Your bedroom should be a relaxing safe haven, one that is free from stress, distractions, or anything nerve-wracking. Try to avoid doing work or anything stressful in your bedroom. Keep your bedroom free from electronic screens or noisy items such as televisions, computers, and phones. These electronics have been known to give out blue light which interferes in sleep. Other ways to have a relaxing bedroom space include painting your room a calming color such as light blue or light gray, using lamps that create soft light, and using calming essential scents such as lavender oils or potpourri. Essential oils can help you sleep better.

, Having a dark room is very important for relaxing and sleeping well in bed. The sleep-inducing hormone melatonin is very light-sensitive. Check to see if your room is too light by turning off all the lights at night. Wait for your eyes to adjust: if you can clearly see objects, there is too much light. Now you can look for areas where the light is leaking in.If you are in a city with lots of street lights outside your window, consider getting a blackout lining for your curtains or buying an eye mask.

, A room that is too hot will stop your core temperature from dropping, something which is necessary to switch on your body's sleeping mechanism. Your body drops to its lowest temperature when you are asleep so keeping your room cool can help. You should aim for a temperature of around 18 - 24 degrees Celsius, or 64 - 75 Fahrenheit. Being overheated can make you feel dehydrated, anxious, or restless at bedtime.Keeping a window slightly open, if it is safe to do so, can help by ensuring there is a good circulation of air. An oscillating fan can also help create the proper temperature in a bedroom during the warmer months.
Be sure to keep your extremities warm. If it's cold opt for a warmer duvet rather than leaving the heating on, which can dehydrate you.It is especially important that you keep your feet warm, so you might want to wear socks to bed., A mattress that is made of breathable, hypoallergenic materials will help your body relax more effectively at bedtime. Be sure that your mattress is also your desired firmness and size. Choosing the correct mattress for your body type and sleeping style will contribute to a relaxing environment., Noise is one of the great sleep disruptors, and it can make you feel stressed out before bed or overnight. White noise is a calming, ambient sound that can help cover up stressful noises such as voices, cars, snoring, or your neighbors' music.White noise machines can be specifically purchased, or you can use a fan or dehumidifer as a white noise machine. There are also white noise generators to be found online.

Visualize.,
Count something.,
Alphabetize.,
Picture an object or scene.,
Recite lyrics or quotes.,
Create a story in your mind.",How to Calm Your Imagination Before Sleep2," Imagine a scene where you are being swept off to sleep. Maybe you are a leaf on the wind, maybe you are walking into a pool of fog, or maybe you are sinking down in a soft cloud. Visualizing scenes like this can help focus your imagination and draw it away from distracting, emotional thoughts.







, Engaging your mind in repetitive mental exercises can help you fall asleep. Sheep are very popular for this purpose, but almost anything will do, as long as you can picture it clearly and keep counting.This repetition and refocusing can help quiet your imagination.








, This is another mental exercise that can distract your brain and help promote sleep. Go through the alphabet and think of items in a single category, A to Z.








For example, you could list fruits or animal names from A to Z, such as aardvark, bumblebee, crayfish, dog and so on.

, Focus on a very specific object, like a box. Think about the color of the object, the shape, the size, what it looks like from each side, and its use. Or try walking yourself through a scene. For instance, imagine that you're riding a bike. Picture a particular route in your neighborhood that you frequently walk, drive, or bike. Imagine you are biking along this road, and think of it at exactly the same pace as it would take if you were actually on a bike.








While you are biking, have a look around and imagine all the streets, houses, shops, and other things that you pass along the road. Try to remember as many small details as possible., Another mental exercise that might distract your imagination is reciting the lyrics to your favorite song or quoting your favorite movie. Repeat the lyrics over and over, like a mantra. This helps focus your brain on something repetitive so that your imagination can calm down and let you sleep.








Try recreating a familiar movie from any point in your mind. Follow through the plot, think about the dialogue, and try to focus on specific details from the movie., Come up with a story to occupy your mind. Create a character, or use a familiar character. Tell a story in your mind about what happens to this character. Focus on details, like what the character is wearing, what the room looks like, and what they are doing.









If you can't think of a story, use yourself. Walk yourself through your favorite hobby. Imagine that you are sailing a boat around a lake or decorating a new room."

Lower your body's temperature.,
Take a bath.,
Exercise.,
Try deep breathing.,
Drink tea.",How to Calm Your Imagination Before Sleep3," One way to promote sleep and help calm the mind down is to cool yourself down. Being too hot can disturb your sleep, which can keep your imagination going. Lower the temperature in the room or remove a blanket to help cool yourself down.








Keep your room between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit., Taking a bath raises your temperature, and then going into your cool bedroom lowers it. This change in body temperature causes you to be drowsy because of a decrease in metabolic activity.








Try burning scented candles or using aromatherapy bath salts or body wash. Or burn essential oil or place it in a diffuser. Lavender and Roman chamomile oil both promotes sleep., Exercise helps you fall asleep more quickly and sleep better. It can help tire your mind and body so you can hit the pillow and drift off. Make sure that you exercise at least 3 hours before bedtime. If you have trouble falling asleep, try exercising even earlier in the day.







, Deep breathing can be effective in calming the body and the mind. Sit up straight on the floor just before bed. Make sure the lights are off and the room is quiet without any distractions.









Close your mouth and inhale through your nose for a count of 4. Hold your breath for a count of 7.
Exhale completely through your mouth for a count of 8.
Do this for a total of 4 times., Some teas can have a calming effect on the body and the mind. An hour or so before you want to fall asleep, brew a cup of chamomile, Valerian, or lavender tea. Some tea companies also sell blends specifically for helping sleeping.








Don't put sugar in the tea. This can help you stay awake.

"

Reduce the amount of light in your room.,
Reduce caffeine intake.,
Go to sleep when you're actually tired.,
Use your bed only for sleep.",How to Calm Your Imagination Before Sleep4," One reason your imagination may be active is because of the amount of light in your room. Light at night, and while you're trying to sleep, throws your body's natural circadian rhythm off. Turn off all lights when you are sleeping. This includes electronics. Lights can confuse your body and mind, making your mind work overtime. Start dimming the lights an hour before bed so your body starts producing melatonin.








If you need a little light at night, go for red lights instead of blues. Blue tones increase energy and attentiveness, which disrupts sleeping patterns,Avoid looking at bright screens for 2-3 hours before bed.
If you can't get away from the light, try wearing an eye mask.

, Caffeine is a stimulant. Drinking too much caffeine too close to bedtime can make your mind and imagination work overtime. Try limiting the amount of caffeine you drink throughout the day, or don't drink so much tea close to bedtime.







, One reason your imagination may run away with you and keep you up at night is because your body and mind aren't actually tired. Staying in bed and tossing and turning just causes your imagination to keep working. Instead of lying there and being frustrated at your mind, get up and go to another room. Do a relaxing activity for 20 minutes, like light reading or listening to calming music. Then return to bed.







, When your imagination is in overdrive, don't lie in bed tossing and turning. This makes your body start to believe that the bed is a place to think and be mentally awake. Instead, move yourself to another room.

Identify your womb.,
Spot the baby.,
Determine your baby’s sex.,
Consider a 3D or 4D ultrasound.",How to Read an Ultrasound Picture2," You can identify the outline of your uterus by finding the white or light grey line around the edges of the ultrasound image. Just inside of this area, there should be a black area. This is the amniotic fluid.Keep in mind that the edge of the womb may not go around the entire image. The technician may have positioned the probe in a way that centered the image on your baby. Even if you only see white or grey lines along one or two sides of the image, this is probably the outline of your womb.

, Your baby will also look grey or whitish and will be located within the amniotic fluid (the dark area inside of the womb). Look at the area within your amniotic fluid to try to make out the outline and features of your baby.


The details that you see in the image will depend on the stage of your pregnancy. For example, at eight weeks, the fetus will look something like a gummy bear or a baked bean; at 12 weeks, you may only be able to identify the head of your baby; while at 20 weeks, you may be able to see the spine, eyes, feet, and heart., At around 18 to 20 weeks, you will have an ultrasound to check your baby’s development, identify any problems, and possibly even identify the sex of your baby. It’s important to remember that it is not always possible to determine the sex of your baby at this stage and you won’t know for sure until your baby is born.To determine the sex of your baby, the ultrasound technician or obstetrician will look for a penis or three lines that represent the labia. Keep in mind that this method of determining the sex of your baby is not 100% accurate. A visual effect may create or obscure the image of a penis on an ultrasound.

, If you are interested in seeing more details of your baby than a traditional ultrasound can provide, then you may want to ask your doctor about a 3D ultrasound. A 3D ultrasound can show your baby’s facial features and it may even be able to detect certain defects, such as a cleft lip and palate.A 4D ultrasound uses the same imaging as a 3D scan, but a 4D scan makes a short video recording of your baby in the womb.If you want to have a 3D or 4D ultrasound, the best time to do so is between 26 to 30 weeks.
Keep in mind that these scans can be quite expensive and may not be covered by your insurance unless there is a medical reason to have one done, such as to investigate an abnormality.

Know if you are at risk.,
Be attentive to possible symptoms.,
Contact your OB/GYN immediately if you notice any of these symptoms.",How to Prolong a Pregnancy With an Incompetent Cervix1," Women who have previously had miscarriages in the second trimester (between weeks 14 and 27) are the most likely to have a cervical insufficiency, so it is important to disclose any prior pregnancy complications or miscarriages to your doctor. Women are not diagnosed with an incompetent cervix until they have suffered one or more late miscarriages. Knowing about this condition in advance will allow your doctor to monitor your condition more closely from the beginning. This can result in earlier detection of a weak cervix, which leads to an increased chance of prolonging the delivery. Any surgery on the cervix also puts women at risk, including a D&C, cervical cone, or LEEP., Although it is possible for an incompetent cervix to be present without any outward symptoms, in some cases there may be warning signs. These would typically occur between 14 and 22 weeks of pregnancy and include backache, discharge or warm liquid felt within the vagina, and pelvic pressure., Although they may be completely unrelated to an incompetent cervix, it is always best to err on the side of caution and let the doctor do a complete exam to rule it out. This might include an ultrasound. Keep in mind that diagnoses of cervical insufficiency are based on a woman’s past medical history of miscarriage during the second trimester. If you do have a cervical insufficiency, you have some medical options."

Watch for early pregnancy symptoms.,
Take abdominal or pelvic pain seriously.,
Be aware of back pain.,
Note vaginal bleeding.,
Look for signs of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.,
Factor in your pregnancy history.,
Consider your reproductive health.,
Know that infertility treatment may increase your risk.,
Understand that an IUD increases your risk.,
Factor in your age.,
Seek medical attention immediately.,
Confirm the pregnancy.,
Have a pelvic exam.,
Ask for an ultrasound.,
Get emergency treatment for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.,
Understand that the pregnancy is not viable.",How to Recognize and Treat an Ectopic Pregnancy," Some women who experience ruptured ectopic pregnancies do not realize they are pregnant at all until they are rushed to a doctor or an emergency room for urgent life-saving treatment. It’s therefore critical to know and look for the earliest signs of pregnancy, including:


a missed menstrual period
breast tenderness
nausea and vomiting (“morning sickness”);
, If you have pain in your lower abdomen or pelvic area or cramping on one side of your pelvis, you may have an ectopic pregnancy. If this pain persists, worsens, or occurs alongside any other symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately.

, Back pain can occur for a variety of reasons, but if you experience back pain, especially lower back pain, in conjunction with other symptoms, see a doctor.

, Abnormal vaginal bleeding is a common symptom of ectopic pregnancy, but unfortunately, it’s also one of the most confusing: if you weren’t aware of your pregnancy, you may think the bleeding is your menstrual period, and if you did know you were pregnant, you may think you are having an early miscarriage.

, When an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, your symptoms may get more severe. At this point, the condition is potentially fatal, so watch carefully for:


dizziness and fainting
a sensation of pain or pressure in your rectum
low blood pressure
additional pain in the shoulder area
sudden, severe abdominal or pelvic pain

, Some women will never know what caused their ectopic pregnancies, but there are certain factors that seem to increase your risk. The first of these is a history of ectopic pregnancy: if you’ve had one before, you are at an increased risk of having another.

, Sexually-transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, and congenital problems with your fallopian tubes all increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy.


Any surgeries performed on your reproductive organs, including failed tubal ligations, reversed tubal ligations, and any other pelvic surgeries elevate your risk.

, If you’ve used fertility drugs or had in vitro fertilization, you have an elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy.

, Women who use intrauterine devices (IUDs) to prevent pregnancy are at an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if the birth control method fails and they become pregnant.

, Women over 35 seem more likely to have ectopic pregnancies.

, If you suspect an ectopic pregnancy, whether or not you’ve already had a positive pregnancy test, get to a doctor or emergency room as soon as possible.

, If you haven’t already had a pregnancy test, your doctor will perform one. A pregnancy test will come back positive whether the egg has implanted in the uterus or in another place.

, If you are indeed pregnant, your doctor will probably start with a standard pelvic exam. He or she will check for any particular areas of pain or tenderness and feel for any palpable masses. At the same time, he or she will check to see if there are any other visible causes of your symptoms.

, If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy, you should have a vaginal ultrasound immediately. Your doctor will insert a small device into your vagina to perform the ultrasound and look for evidence of an ectopic pregnancy.


Occasionally, it may be too early for an ectopic pregnancy to show on an ultrasound. If this is the case, and if your symptoms are mild or questionable, your doctor may monitor you and repeat the ultrasound at a later date. At a month past conception, though, the pregnancy – whether normal or ectopic – should be visible on an ultrasound.

, If you are bleeding heavily, show symptoms of shock, or exhibit other signs of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, your doctor will skip the preliminary tests and diagnose and treat you surgically.

, The only treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is removal of the developing cells. This will be done surgically.


In some cases, your fallopian tube may have to be removed as well. If this happens, know that many women successfully get pregnant again with only one fallopian tube.

Watch multiple pregnancies carefully.",How to Recognize Preeclampsia," One of the most common symptoms of preeclampsia is swelling (also called edema), especially in the hands, feet, legs, and face. It can be difficult, especially in mild cases, to distinguish the swelling associated with preeclampsia from the normal swelling experienced by many pregnant women, but call your doctor if the swelling begins suddenly, seems severe, or is located in the hands or face (as opposed to the feet or legs, where normal swelling often takes place).;
, Women with preeclampsia often experience persistent headaches, which may feel either dull and constant or severe and throbbing. Occasional headaches are no cause for alarm, but if your headache won’t go away, even after you’ve tried over-the-counter pain relievers, or if it is extremely painful or accompanied by other symptoms, such as swelling or visual disturbances, see your doctor immediately.

, Weight gain is a normal, necessary part of pregnancy, but sudden weight gain of more than a few pounds in a week can be a sign of preeclampsia. Discuss your weight gain regularly with your doctor, and call for an appointment if you see a sudden gain, especially if you have any other symptoms.

, Pregnant women often experience heartburn and indigestion, and these are not generally signs of preeclampsia, but if you have severe upper abdominal pain, especially if it radiates to your back or shoulder, seek medical care immediately.

, Although queasiness and vomiting are associated with normal first-trimester “morning sickness,” a sudden onset of these symptoms later in your pregnancy might be a cause for concern.

, Like many of the other symptoms, back pain is common during pregnancy and does not necessarily indicate a problem all by itself. However, if you have severe lower back pain, it could be the result of a problem with your liver – something that can happen with preeclampsia. See your doctor, especially if you have other symptoms.

, Women who develop preeclampsia sometimes notice increased symptoms of anxiety: they may feel panicky, experience shortness of breath, or notice a racing pulse. If you notice mild versions of these symptoms or have a general sense that “something might be wrong,” speak to your doctor at your next appointment. But if these symptoms are severe or appear alongside other signs of preeclampsia, get help right away.


According to the Preeclampsia Foundation, many women who develop preeclampsia report that they have felt an intuitive sense that something was very wrong. You may have feelings of anxiety or a sense that something is going wrong with your pregnancy even if everything is fine, but trust your instincts and call your doctor anyway. Some women worry about annoying their doctors or seeming high-maintenance, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.

, Some women with preeclampsia experience blurred vision, light sensitivity, vision loss, and other visual disturbances. These symptoms can be very serious, so if you notice them, call your doctor immediately or go directly to an emergency room.

, Anyone can get preeclampsia, and doctors aren’t completely certain why it develops, but there are some factors that seem to heighten a woman’s risk. One of these is age: women over 40 or under 20 may have a higher risk of developing endometriosis.

, If you’ve had preeclampsia before, or if you have a history of high blood pressure, your risk is elevated. If you have an autoimmune disorder, diabetes, lupus, or polycystic ovarian syndrome, you may also have an increased risk.


The increased risk of preeclampsia that comes with diabetes also applies to gestational diabetes (the form of the disease that afflicts women only during pregnancy). If you have gestational diabetes, watch carefully for symptoms of preeclampsia.

, You also have an increased risk if your mother, sister, aunt, or grandmother ever had preeclampsia. If possible, ask your parents and grandparents about any family history of the condition.

, If you are obese, you are more likely to develop preeclampsia.


Do not attempt to eliminate this risk by going on a strict diet during pregnancy. Instead, talk to your doctor about a safe rate of weight gain, and eat as healthfully as possible.

, Women who are pregnant for the first time develop preeclampsia more often.


There is some evidence that your first pregnancy with a new partner – even if you’d had a baby with another person before – may also increase your risk.

, If you are pregnant with twins or triplets, your risk of preeclampsia is higher.

Understand that the average person's chance of having twins is about 3%.,
Know that older women are less likely to GET pregnant, but if they do, they are more likely to have twins.,
Take your vitamins.,
Be well nourished, and eat certain foods.,
Consume dairy and yams.,
Stop birth-control pills right before.,
Let a doctor help you increase your chances of twins.,
If you are undergoing IVF, you could be spending some serious money.,
Talk to your doctor about an oral medicine called Clomid.,
Go through IVF (Intro Vitro Fertilization.)",How to Raise Your Chances of Having Twins," Not so high. But you are probably not average. If you have any of the below, your chance increases. If you have a lot or all of the below, your chance increases a lot. Conversely, if you are a young, underweight female of Asian descent with no twins in the family, the chance of twinning will be extremely low.


Having twins ""in the family,"" particularly on the mother's side. If you already have twins, your chance increases at least 4x.
Being of African descent makes the highest chance of having twins, followed by European descent. Hispanic and Asian people have the lowest chance of having twins.
Being tall and/or well nourished or even overweight.
Having prior pregnancies. Women with 4 or more pregnancies increase their chances of twins dramatically. It seems that the body is more likely to have twins after it knows you ""can take it."" Many of the families that have a dozen children or more, show increasing numbers of twin births as they have more pregnancies.;
, The older you are, the more likely you are to have twins. If you are around 40, your chance is substantially higher, around 7%. At 45, if you can get pregnant, the odds are about 17%.


Older women are most likely to get IVF, see below. IVF also increases your chance of twinning.

, People low on nutrition are less likely to have twins.


All vitamins are good, but folic acid supplements are proven to increase your chances.You can get them at any pharmacy.






Folic acid is now recommended for all pregnant women as well; it prevents birth defects. However, you don't want to take more than 1000mg a day.

, Overall, underweight people are less likely to have twins.


Overall, being better nourished or overweight may increase your chances of twinning.Better nourished means to put on weight in a healthy manner. Consult your doctor about any plans for weight gain.

, There are foods that are possibly linked to better chances of twins.


A study conducted by a leading fertility specialist found that women who consume dairy products during the timeframe they're trying to conceive increase their chances of having twins by as much as 5 times over women who avoid such foods.

Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF), which is produced in the livers of cows, is believed to be the chemical instigator in this phenomenon.
Others suggest drinking milk of cows treated by rBGH hormones can influence human women to have twins more frequently.An African tribe whose diet is rich in wild yams (cassava) boasts a twin birth rate 4 times higher than the global average. Nutrients in the vegetable are believed to stimulate the ovaries into producing more than 1 egg during ovulation.Many doctors are skeptical that the yams have anything to do with twins. On the other hand, there is no harm to eating yams, and they are delicious.




, Try stopping the pill right before trying to get pregnant. When women first stop taking the pill, their bodies work furiously to re-regulate their hormones. During the first month or two after getting off the pill, ramped up ovaries sometimes release 2 eggs.


This is not proven either, but again can't hurt. Some studies suggest it is true., Some doctors will help anyone have twins, like the doctor of the Octomom. Others will only help if there is a ""medical necessity.""


There are several medical reasons for a doctor to help you have twins.

If you are older, the doctor may suggest having twins is lower chance of birth defects than having two single pregnancies.
There are other reasons why a woman may medically not be able to have more than one pregnancy, known as Secondary Infertility. Age and fertility windows are other reasons for needing to have twins.



, Implanting multiple eggs is cost effective since each IVF egg has a lower chance of implanting, so best to try a bunch at once.

, It is normally used as a treatment for women who do not ovulate, but when taken by women with no issues it can raise the chance of having twins to over 33%, depending on the woman.


Clomid works by encouraging the ovaries to drop more eggs in a cycle. Clomid can result in triplets or more, so be warned!

, IVF used to be called ""test tube babies.""


IVF procedures result in twins at a high rate. Normally the doctors will try to implant many embryos in the hopes that one sticks, but if one sticks, two is also likely. Overall, the chances of having twins in IVF are between 20% to 40%.

IVF can be expensive. There are many clinics that do IVF, so get referrals and shop around.
IVF is now fairly routine. It's not cheap or quick, but it is not unusual these days either.

, The combination of physical changes, stress about things that have to be taken care of, and just the general newness of it all can mean changes for your relationship with your girlfriend.Attending some prenatal counseling sessions can help the two of you prepare for the changing roles and expectations.Things to expect include:


Changing roles at home (taking on more chores, for instance).
Alterations to sleep schedules.
Less attention to each other as you work to meet the needs of pregnancy and a new baby.
Different sexual habits, desires, and needs.

Take note if you bleed through more than three perineal pads after birth.,
Take a breath to see if you are breathing rapidly or shallowly.,
Notice any pain in your stomach or vagina.,
Have a friend feel your hands to see if they are cold and clammy.,
Check your blood pressure to notice any abnormalities.,
Notice less severe accessory symptoms.,
Be aware of risk factors that can increase your chance of suffering from PPH.,
Get immediate medical attention if you recognize signs of acute PPH.,
Get a physical examination to determine the source of the bleeding.,
Have a blood test done to determine if there are deficiencies in clotting factors.,
Get an ultrasound to determine the source of the bleeding.,
Look into angiography or a blood vessel x-ray.",How to Recognize the Signs of a Postpartum Hemorrhage," Uncontrollable bleeding is the most obvious and indicative sign of postpartum hemorrhage.


Note that the blood loss that you can see is only a portion of the total amount of blood lost, since the total amount can only be measured internally.
Bright red blood is also an indicator of postpartum hemorrhage.
The most common source of uncontrolled bleeding is the uterus and the cervix.;
, Rapid and shallow breathing (tachypnea) is often associated with postpartum hemorrhage.


This kind of breathing indicates your body compensating for the loss of blood.
As blood is lost, your body loses its oxygen supply, and responds by breathing at an increased rate.

, Lower abdominal pain is also commonly associated with postpartum hemorrhage, due to the loss of blood and potential tissue damage in those areas.


Stomach pain can also occur if the bleeding causes peritoneum (stomach membrane) irritation.
In cases such as this, your abdomen might also feel rigid and board-like.

, Cold and clammy extremities can indicate extensive blood loss.


You may not be able to feel this change yourself, so it is always best to have it verified by a friend or family member.
Additionally, your nail beds will turn white, because of the lack of oxygenated blood circulating through your body.

, Decreased blood pressure is a common symptom associated with blood loss.


A significant drop in blood pressure is an alarming sign that indicates the potential for shock.
Additionally, a noticeable drop in blood pressure indicates that significant blood loss is already apparent.

, Although acute PPH is often accompanied by signs of shock, such as reduced blood pressure, tachycardia, low pulse rate, fever, rigors, faintness, or collapse, there are also less severe symptoms that may occur in the few days immediately after your delivery.


These accessory symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, painful urination, general weakness, and abdominal tenderness

, There are a variety of risk factors and pre-existing conditions that can drastically increase your risk of PPH. These include:


A previous incidence of PPH during a prior pregnancy.
Extra heavy baby birth weight, due to the size of the baby causing further tearing and stretching of the uterus.
Labor induction and augmentation using methergine.
Trauma (lacerations, instrumental delivery).

, Acute PPH, as evidenced by massive blood loss and symptoms of shock, should be treated by immediate and comprehensive medical care.


Call the Emergency Services, and do not attempt to transport yourself to the hospital, as you are at risk of feinting behind the wheel.
It is paramount that you get medical attention before you lose too much blood and risk permanent injury or death.

, Your doctor will determine the source of your bleeding with a physical examination.


This will allow the medical team to provide the most relevant care, and get you on the road to recovery.
The physical examination will consist of a methodical examination of your body to identify the cause of bleeding.

, Getting a blood test done can identify blood disorders, such as anemia, or low platelet count that could be the source of your excessive bleeding.


Recognizing an underlying disorder or disease can be a great help in treating your PPH.

, In case a physical examination doesn't reveal enough information about the source of your bleeding, get an ultrasound to confirm its source.


An ultrasound uses sound waves to assess the internal structures of your body, and can allow the doctor to gain a greater understanding of the source of your bleeding.

, In this procedure, your arm or groin is injected with an anesthetic.


Your doctor will then insert a catheter or a long, thin, hollow tube through an artery until it reaches your heart.
A dye is then injected, in order to locate blockages within the blood vessels.
In PPH, this is helpful especially when the cause is pregnancy induced hypertension.
This procedure can last 30 minutes to an hour.

Educate yourself about pregnancy.,
Bust some pregnancy myths.,
Be abstinent as much as you can.,
Find other ways to get sexual release.,
Talk to a trusted adult.,
Find independent care.,
Stay away from drugs and alcohol.",How to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy1," Start by educating yourself about how pregnancy starts. Many studies have found that the better education you have regarding how sex and pregnancy work, the better able you will be to make good decisions regarding sex. You can find lots of high quality information online using sources like Mayo Clinic and Wikipedia.


The short version is that a man produces a substance in his body, called semen, which exits his body through the penis. This substance is deposited in a woman’s vagina (through sex or other means), where it combines with an egg in her uterus to form a baby. Women only have eggs in their uterus sometimes and even then, the egg doesn’t always get what it needs from the semen. This is why you won’t get pregnant every time you have sex.;
, There are lots of myths about how you can get pregnant. If you know the truth from the facts, you’ll be much better able to protect yourself. Remember, when it doubt, play it safe. It’s better to wait until you have proper protection than risk getting pregnant because of something you read on Tumblr.


Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you have sex during your period.” Your body will usually release an egg half-way in between your periods...but loads of women can have an egg release just about any time in their cycle. In fact, this method may be more likely to get some women pregnant, so don’t rely on this to help you.
Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you use the pull-out method.” The pull-out method is when the guy pulls his penis out of the vagina before ejaculating or “cumming” (orgasming and releasing his semen). The problem is that the penis will release fluid before ejaculation that can still get a girl pregnant! Using the pull-out method is very unreliable and for most people, the chances of getting pregnant with this form of “birth control” is about 30%.Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you use certain positions or have sex in certain places.” It doesn’t matter if you’re having sex in a pool/hot tub or if the girl is on top during sex. If there’s a penis in a vagina, pregnancy can happen.
Myth: “You can get pregnant if you do _______ afterwards.” Unless that blank is filled with medication or medical devices like Plan B or an IUD, then this is a total myth. Jumping jacks, douching, showering, peeing, eating certain foods: you name it, these things won’t help keep you from getting pregnant.

, We don’t want to sound like that guy at your church, but abstinence really is your best bet at not getting pregnant. Even the most effective forms of birth control only work most of the time. If you want to guarantee that you won’t get pregnant, find other ways of getting sexual release that don’t involve penetration.


Pregnancy isn’t the only risk of sex, either. It’s important to remember that. You also need to be safe and use protection to keep yourself from getting STDs.
There are also merits to taking things slow, in your relationship. While sex is fun and feels good, it adds a lot of complication. You might think you’ll have fewer problems once you start having sex but really you’ll have more. This is why, if you can make it work, it’s better to stay abstinent until you’re in a place in your life where you’re better able to deal with those complications.

, Full, penetrative sex isn’t the only way to get sexual release. If you don’t have access to birth control or if you just want to be super sure that you don't get pregnant or get anyone else pregnant, try other ways of getting physical that don't lead to babies.


Try something like mutual masturbation. This is where you stimulate yourself in front of your partner or you stimulate each other. As long as no penetration occurs and the man's semen is kept away from the vagina, no pregnancy can occur. This is also relatively safe in terms of protecting you from disease.
You can try something like oral or anal sex. This should still be done with a condom, however, because both can still spread disease and infections.

, Talk to an adult that you trust about sex, sexual health, relationships, and pregnancy. They should at least be able to give you some advice. They might even be able to help you find resources so that you can better protect yourself from getting pregnant. Schedule some private time to talk with them and then tell them why you want to talk. It might be awkward at first and it might take more than one conversation, but you’ll find that having someone who can help you will make you much more comfortable and happy.


Say something like, “Brian, I’m not comfortable going to mom and dad, but I really want to get intimate with my girlfriend and I’m worried about her getting pregnant. Can you help me choose the right condoms?”

, In lots of states, you can get birth control from doctors and pharmacies without your parents legally needing to be told. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your family about your situation, make an appointment with an organization like Planned Parenthood. They’ll educate you and get you everything that you need at a price you can afford, so that your parents don’t need to know about what you’re doing.


You can find your local Planned Parenthood clinic by visiting their website.
If you live outside the US or in an area not serviced by Planned Parenthood, check with your local health department to get advice about what services might be available to you.

, There are lots of reasons that you might want to stay away from drugs and alcohol, but one of the major ones is that both can lead you to make really bad decisions. When you’re drunk or high, your brain doesn’t work as well as normal (that’s why it feels so good). This means that while you might normally make the smart choice and use a condom, your drunk brain doesn’t even consider it.


You also have to worry about what might happen while you’re passed out. When you’ve had so much alcohol or enough drugs to make it so that you can’t move or are passed out, you have no control over what other people do to your body.
For example, more than 20% of teen pregnancies were the result of sex that was influenced by alcohol."

Discuss treatment options with your doctor.,
Consider with your doctor whether serial ultrasounds might be a good first step.,
Undergo a minimal surgery to get a cerclage.,
Speak with your doctor about having a pessary put in place.,
Ask whether bed rest or pelvic rest might help.",How to Prolong a Pregnancy With an Incompetent Cervix2," He or she will be able to lay out the possible options—cerclage, a pessary, and bed rest—and tell you which ones would best for you. Keep in mind that a cerclage (suturing the cervix closed) is by far the most common treatment, and allows many women with previous histories of miscarriage to successfully carry a baby to term. A pessary, similar to the outer ring of a diaphragm, changes the angle of the cervix and reinforces it., With ultrasounds every two weeks during the second trimester of your pregnancy, the doctor can monitor the risk of an incompetent cervix. If he or she sees warning signs, then you can have a cerclage., Once you are diagnosed with incompetent cervix, your doctor will likely suggest a cerclage. A cerclage is a procedure in which a stitch is placed around the cervix and tightened to keep the cervix closed. There are five types of cerclage that can be performed, and your doctor will determine which type is best for your situation depending upon how far along you are in your pregnancy.


A cerclage is usually removed near the end of pregnancy to permit normal delivery.
Occasionally, depending on conditions that are present during the pregnancy, the cerclage will be left in place and the mother will undergo a cesarean section to deliver the baby., A pessary is an apparatus that is positioned within the vagina to help raise up and reinforce the cervix. This may be used instead of, or in conjunction with a cerclage., Bed rest may be prescribed by your doctor for an incompetent cervix. Bed rest restrictions can vary from simply avoiding any heavy lifting or housework, to total bed rest where you must remain in a reclining position at all times, including for bathing and going to the bathroom.Talk to your doctor about whether or not some type of bed rest might be a good option for you.


You may also need to abstain from sex during a period of bed and pelvic rest.

"
"
Ensure you are getting adequate rest.,
Ask your doctor about vigorous exercise.,
Do your kegels.",How to Prolong a Pregnancy With an Incompetent Cervix3," Even if you are not prescribed bed rest, ensuring that you get adequate rest is important. Make sure that you get plenty of sleep and avoid overexerting yourself.

, He or she might suggest you refrain from high-intensity workouts and from having sex. Because your cervix is weak, exercise can further exacerbate your condition., Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. To ensure that you are doing them correctly, while you are urinating clench your muscles to stop the flow of urine, and then release to continue the flow; that is what exercising your kegels feels like. While is it not certain that kegels will prevent an incompetent cervix, they do have certain benefits including enhanced sexual pleasure, aiding in vaginal birth, help for incontinence and a quicker postpartum recovery.

Educate yourself and your teen about sex.,
Help them bust pregnancy myths.,
Make birth control private but accessible.,
Communicate with your teen about your concerns.,
Talk about drugs and alcohol with your teen.,
Give them hopes for the future.,
Keep them busy.,
Pay attention.",How to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy2," Education is, according to the statistics, your best weapon in preventing teen pregnancy. It has been shown repeatedly that the more a teen understands about where babies come from and how they can prevent pregnancy, the better off they will be.Of course, it's possible you were taught incorrectly too, so you'll want to refresh your memory before educating your teen.


Educating yourself might also make you more comfortable about the subject, especially if you're from a very conservative background.
You can find information on sex from books in your local library, at a doctor's office, and even on the internet.

, When kids don’t get educated about sex, they’ll try to make their best guess about how stuff works. Often, those guesses are horribly, hilariously wrong. Now, as funny as some of these ideas can be (“You can get pregnant from kissing!”), sometimes misinformation can lead to your teen getting pregnant or getting someone else pregnant. You’ll want to make sure that any misconceptions they have are thoroughly dealt with so that they can make good choices for themselves.


You can find examples of pregnancy myths in the section of this article for teens.
The best way to find out what bad ideas your teen has about sex is to talk to them about what they know. Ask them: “What do you know about sex? How does a woman get pregnant? What role does a man play? How do you think pregnancy can be prevented?”

, Even with open communication and a good relationship between the two of you, your teen might still feel uncomfortable about asking for what they need when it comes to preventing pregnancy. You can eliminate this concern by making sure that they can access birth control without having to ask you directly.


One option would be to teach them where to go to get birth control on their own and at low cost, such as by making their own doctor’s appointment.
Another option would be to let them know that you’ll keep a fresh box of condoms at the back of the drawer in the bathroom. They can take condoms without having to ask and you will replace them if the box runs out.

, Now, no one’s advocating here that you just run into this 100% liberal and promoting sex to your teen as if there are no consequences. It’s important for you to talk to your teen about what you worry about and how sex can go wrong. If you communicate your concerns in a healthy, non-judgmental way, you’ll actually e more likely to convince them that they might want to wait. Talk to them about:


The health risks
The emotional risks, and
The risks to their future

, Drugs and alcohol are also a nearly unavoidable part of growing up. While your teen might normally make very good choices, it only takes one night of bad choices to wind up with a pregnant teen. Head this off at the pass by letting them know that if they’re going to do those things, they need to at least do them in a safe environment. Tell them that impaired judgement can lead to poor decisions about sex or no ability at all to even make the choice.


Girls should be warned about what boys might do to them if they pass out and boys should be warned about how getting consent is crucial to having sex but that alcohol can make you forget that.

, If your teen has goals and hopes for the future, they’ll have much more incentive to stay away from sex or at least be responsible about the sex that they do have. Help them pursue their dreams in order to keep them busy and make their goals seem reachable. Encourage them and help them believe that they can be more than they are now.

, If your teen’s day is packed with activities, they’ll have less time and energy with which they can get themselves into trouble. Don’t expect that this will make them abstain from dating and physical intimacy altogether but it should remove some of the opportunities and certainly keep them from having sex just because they’re bored.


Get them signed up for clubs or extra classes which let them engage in their interests and hobbies. If their hobby is something that they can do at home, invest it getting them some tools so that they can fully immerse themselves in that activity.
If you don’t have the money to pay for them to take an extra class in their favorite subject, talk to your local community center or community college. There may be grants or special tuition available to help your teen pursue these activities.

, At the end of the day, you can’t control the choices that your teen makes: you’re simply not driving the car that is their life. But if you need to, you can direct their path by limiting the roads they can take. Pay attention to what they’re doing. If they’re dating someone much older (for girls) or much younger (for guys), do what you can to make sure that they make good choices. You should also talk to them if their dating relationships seem to be very “serious”. If your teens are going out a lot to parties, it might be time to reign in their behavior. While these situations aren’t always easy to control, doing something is better than doing nothing.

Learn about how birth control works.,
Learn what types of birth control are available.,
Use any birth control you choose correctly.,
Discuss birth control, even if it’s uncomfortable or you don’t know how.,
Know your options if you do get pregnant.",How to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy3," First, it's important to know how birth control works. You might get misinformation about how it causes abortions or how it can do all sorts of terrible things to your body, but those things aren't true. There are lots of different kinds of birth control, from condoms to implants, and all work by making sure that either a man's sperm never reaches a woman's egg or by ensuring that that egg can't implant. Do research for each type of birth control you want to consider.


Knowing how it works will not only make you more comfortable about using it or recommending it, it will also help you use it correctly and choose one which is best for your habits. Some birth control needs to be used in a very specific way or it won't work, so if you're bad at remembering to do things (for example) you might not want to take some forms of birth control.

, Birth control doesn’t just mean pills. There are lots of forms of both medication and devices that all do roughly the same thing: keep you from getting pregnant. Choose what’s best for you and, to be extra safe, use more than one method at a time. This is especially important for teens and people that aren’t in serious, long term relationships. You can use:


Condoms. Condoms should be your first stop, since these protect from STDs as well as pregnancy. It doesn’t matter what gender you are, you should have these on hand. Even if you decide to use another form of birth control, wear condoms anyway.
The pill. There are many different varieties of “the pill” but all are taken by a woman to keep her from getting pregnant. These do not cause an abortion, as you might have been told. Instead, they make a woman’s uterus inhospitable to an egg, preventing it from implanting. Usually, you take a pill every day and the pill is very small. This is an easy an effective form of birth control and it has many other benefits (like clearing acne and making your periods more comfortable).
Implants and IUDs. There are several different implants and IUDs (intrauterine devices) available, all of them for women. Some of these go in your arm and some are fit into your uterus. All are considered some of the most effective forms of birth control. While it can be uncomfortable to put in, these are great options for teens because you can get it put in and then forget about it. Most of these devices are good for at least 3 years, and some for as many as 12. This means that you wouldn’t have to worry about getting pregnant until it was really time for you to get pregnant.
Other methods. There are also many other methods, like the vaginal ring, the sponge, and the patch. Talk to your doctor about what options might be best for your situation and habits.

, No matter what form of birth control you use, make sure you’re using it correctly. Most forms of birth control are very effective and work 99% of the time, but that’s only if you use them the way they’re meant to be used. If you’re a teen, learn how to use your chosen method correctly. If you’re a parent or adult, do your own research and then make sure your teen knows what to do.


You can find information about how to use each form correctly on Planned Parenthood’s website.

, A basic piece of advice in life is that any problem you have can generally be made better by talking about it. Talking about family planning methods with your parent, trusted adult, son, daughter, or other teen can seem awkward. We’re raised to feel uncomfortable discussing sexual topics. But by opening communication and just getting everything out there, everyone can be better informed and more comfortable. Like a monster under the bed, you’ll find that discussing sex in a practical and healthy way is less scary once you understand it.


Now, it can take more than one try to have the discussion you really need to have about family planning. Don’t give up!
Parents wanting to discuss birth control can say something like, “Jon, you’re going to have a lot of urges. You’re getting older and that’s normal. But a big part of being an adult is being responsible about the things that you want to do. I want to talk to you about what your responsibilities are now that you’re becoming a man.”
Teens wanting to discuss birth control can say something like, “Mom, I’m getting older and I want to make sure that I don’t ruin my future before it starts. I’d rather get birth control that I might not need for awhile than make a bad choice. Can you help me figure out what I need to know before something goes wrong?”

, If someone does become pregnant, it’s important to know what options are available, so that you can make an informed choice about how you want to handle the situation. Since society tends to be really divided on what to do in this situation, you should get as many opinions as you can from many different sources.


One good source of information is Planned Parenthood, which will discuss all of your possible options with you and let you decide what’s best for you. If you decide to keep the baby, they will also help you find services and resources.

They can also increase the elasticity of your skin. Because you want your skin to bounce back after pregnancy, elasticity is essential.Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish such as sardines, herrings, and salmon. You can also eat walnuts and canola oil to help get fatty acids in your diet, as well as flaxseed.Skip fish that may have a high mercury content, such as swordfish or king mackerel.You can also try flaxseed oil supplements. Take up 2.2 grams a day in pill form.;
, Collagen is one of the main building blocks of your skin, a protein that provides structure, so you need collagen to help tighten skin after pregnancy.

Some fruits to try with high levels of vitamin C include strawberries, cantaloupe, kiwi, mango, and citrus.For vegetables, eat leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes (white or sweet), or tomatoes, to name a few.The daily requirement for vitamin C is 120mg for postpartum moms and taking more than this amount has not been proven to have any benefit.

, Soy concentrate has been shown to have an effect on skin elasticity and collagen fiber. A supplement of 100 milligrams a day of isoflavone genistein is sufficient, but you can also try adding more soy protein to your diet through tofu and edamame., This vitamin is in the same family as niacin or vitamin B-3. Though more research needs to be done, this vitamin likely improves skin elasticity over time.If you're looking to add niacinamide to your diet, try lean proteins, nuts, beans, and grains.If you prefer, you can try using a cream that contains this vitamin, applying it topically to your abdomen. Some anti-wrinkle creams have this vitamin., Peptides have been shown to increase collagen production.As noted, collagen is essential for elastic skin that bounces back after stretching, retaining its structure. Try applying an anti-wrinkle daily to your abdomen area while you're pregnant., One of the major causes of sagging skin after pregnancy is excess weight gain. Of course, your skin is going to stretch some no matter what you do--you're growing a baby inside! However, if you can limit the amount of extra weight you put on, you can also limit how much your skin stretches.Try moderate exercise 5 to 7 days a week. You can exercise for about 30 minutes at a time.Try less-strenuous exercises such as swimming or low-impact aerobics. You can also cycle or walk.Don't push too hard. Drink enough water while exercising, and take the time to warm up and cool down., Many important elements of your skin are made up of proteins, from collagen to elastin. These proteins provide structure and keep your skin elastic. Therefore, make sure you are eating enough protein while pregnant.If you're 25, about 5 feet (2 m) and 4 inches tall, and weighed 110 pounds before you were pregnant, you need 5.5 ounces of protein in your first trimester, 6.5 in your second, and 6.5 in your third. If you are about 140 pounds, you need 6 ounces in your first trimester, 6.5 in your second, and 6.5 in your third.If you're 25, about 5 feet (2 m) and 9 inches tall, and weighed 128 before you were pregnant, you need 6 ounces in your first trimester, 6.5 in your second, and 6.5 in your third, while if you weighed about 162, you need 6.5 in your first, 7 in your second, and 7 in your third., Of course, you want to eat healthy to support your growing baby.However, eating healthy can also reduce the weight you put on while pregnant, which reduces how much your skin stretches.


Eat whole grains and low-fat dairy. Try yogurt with oatmeal for breakfast, topped with fruit. Eat brown rice as a side. Try whole-grain bread topped with low-fat cream cheese.Additionally, make vegetables and fruit a steady part of your diet, filling up half your plate with them at meals. Eat a bowl of berries with breakfast. Add a side salad to lunch. Incorporate vegetables into your casseroles by adding a couple of handfuls of chopped spinach or kale. Eat soups rich in vegetables., In the past, you might have been told you had to wait a month and a half to exercise. However, these days, most doctors will give you the go ahead as soon as you feel comfortable after a vaginal delivery, as long as you pregnancy wasn't complicated.However, you'll need to wait longer if you had a complicated pregnancy or you had a C-section.


Exercise can reduce your weight overall, which helps reduce your belly flab. It also can increase the strength of your abdominal muscles, which support the skin around your stomach. Also, some of the sagging skin could actually be sagging muscle.For an exercise that specifically targets your abdominal muscles, try a pelvic tilt. Lie down on the floor with your back to the floor. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Tighten your abdominal muscles and lift your back off the floor slightly. Hold it for about 10 seconds and repeat., Continue to eat foods high in vitamin A. In addition, try adding a vitamin A cream to regimen, known as a retinol cream. You could also try a vitamin C cream. Rub the cream on at night, leaving it on while you sleep. These creams can help firm up your skin, reducing sagging.


Keep in mind that retinol creams can be quite expensive, and using them over a large area of your body will add up.

, Some women have good luck with massaging their abdominal area. Pick a good lotion, one that contains vitamins A, K, C, and E, and preferably one that has collagen. Rub it into the skin, gently massaging it in using a circular motion. Try applying regular lotions twice a day, in addition to your nightly creams., Skin has water in it, just like the rest of your body. In fact, it is about a third water. If you're not hydrated enough, your skin will suffer. Drier skin results in less elasticity, which means more sag. As a woman, you should be drinking about 9 cups of water a day.Try adding fruit to your water to help encourage you to drink it. Also, drinks such as teas, coffees, and juices count towards your overall water consumption, though you should limit yourself to decaf if you're still breastfeeding. In addition, because juices are high in sugar, you should drink those in moderation.
Also consider fruits and vegetables that are high in water, such as watermelon and cucumber.

, Consuming health proteins will continue to help your skin. In addition, getting a balance of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy will help you ensure you are getting the right nutrients for a healthy body and healthy skin., Losing the weight that you gained during your pregnancy can help to prevent sagging skin as well. Exercise and follow a healthy reduced calorie diet to take off the pounds that you gained. Keep in mind that if you are breastfeeding, then you may not be able to lose all of the pregnancy weight right away., Sometimes, the only way to get rid of sagging skin is through a cosmetic surgeon. That doesn't mean that you must have surgery. You have other options available to you, such as laser treatments and infrared treatments. These treatments encourage the increase of collagen in your skin, helping to tighten it up.

Foods containing omega 3s, which keep cell membranes healthy and make your skin glow. Eat fish, fish oil, walnuts, eggs and oysters. Make sure to thoroughly cook eggs and oysters. Don't eat fish high in Mercury. Mercury consumed during pregnancy has been linked to developmental delays and brain damage.;
, Water helps detoxify your body and keeps your skin cells plump, which makes your skin healthier and more likely to bounce back from the stress caused by stretching. Get plenty of water by practicing these habits:


Drink 8 glasses of water a day. If you find it difficult to ingest this much water, carry a large water bottle that holds the equivalent of 2 glasses (16 ounces) of water. Refill it 4 times throughout the day, rather than having to refill a single glass 8 times. It will make drinking enough water less of a hassle.
Drink herbal tea. Choosing teas without caffeine helps your body stay hydrated, and can alleviate the boredom of drinking only water every day.
Eat watery fruits and vegetables. Eating vegetables that contain a lot of water is another great way to hydrate yourself. Eat big salads filled with cucumbers, fresh bell peppers, and celery. Choose watermelon, strawberries, honeydew, and other watery fruits instead of eating baked desserts.

, Exercising helps the skin retain its elasticity by improving your body's circulation. As an added benefit, exercise will help prevent you from gaining too much weight, too quickly, nipping stretch marks in the bud. Incorporate exercise into your daily schedule in the following ways:


Perform exercises meant to make pregnancy easier on your body. Stretches, Kegel exercises, and other simple movements can help keep your blood moving and keep you more comfortable during pregnancy.Try pregnancy yoga and other low-impact exercises. Yoga and Pilates give you an excellent workout without requiring you to move in ways that may feel uncomfortable while you're pregnant.

, Stretch marks happen when you gain a lot of weight, fast. If you follow your doctor's guidelines for gaining weight gradually, rather than putting on your pregnancy weight all at once, you greatly reduce the chance that you'll end up with stretch marks.


Avoid ""eating for two."" You should be eating more calories that you did before you were pregnant, but not twice as many.When you feel cravings coming on, have a little taste of the food you really want - say, ice cream - and a hefty serving of strawberries or fruit. You'll satisfy your palate and feel full.

Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids daily.,
Take vitamins to help prevent infection.,
Choose whole foods in place of overly refined or processed foods, or foods that contain a lot of sugar.",How to Prevent UTI During Pregnancy1," Water can help flush bacteria from your system, preventing new infections and perhaps even flushing the beginnings of an infection from your system.


Drink six to eight 8-ounce glasses (1.4 to 2 liters) of water every day.Consider adding lemon to your water to increase the acidity of your urine and fight bacterial growth.Drink unsweetened cranberry juice daily. While studies remain inconclusive, some evidence exists to suggest cranberry juice may reduce bacteria in the urinary tract and reduce the formation of new bacteria.Avoid other fruit juices, alcohol and caffeinated beverages.Check the color of your urine to see if you're getting enough fluids. Dark urine indicates that you may be dehydrated, which can lead to a UTI when pregnant.;
, The right blend of vitamins can also boost your immune system, which can help your body fight off UTIs and other infections.


Ask your doctor which vitamins are safe to use during pregnancy. Ensure they won't interact negatively with any medication you are taking. In general, your daily regimen should consist of 250 to 500 mg of vitamin C, 25,000 to 50,000 IU of beta carotene, and 30 to 50 mg of zinc.While standard prenatal vitamins will include some of these vitamins, you will likely want to take additional supplements to ensure you receive sufficient doses., Sugar can inhibit white blood cells in the body from fighting off bacteria, including the bacteria that cause UTIs.


Consume antioxidant-rich foods such as blueberries, cherries, tomatoes, and squash."

Consider condoms.,
Try contraceptive sponges.,
Ask your doctor about prescription barrier methods.,
Ask your doctor about a copper IUD.,
Use natural methods with caution.,
Consider permanent solutions.,
Follow instructions carefully.,
Combine methods.,
Add spermicide.",How to Prevent Pregnancy without Hormones," For many people, condoms are a fantastic method of birth control: they are relatively cheap, readily available at drugstores and supermarkets, and effective when used correctly. They also provide protection against most sexually transmitted infections (STIs), making them a top choice for people who are not in monogamous relationships.


Although the male condom is more familiar to most people, note that female condoms – plastic pouches that cover the inside of the vagina – are also available. These are a good alternative if you want to control the contraceptive method yourself rather than relying on your partner.
People with latex allergies should not use latex male condoms. If you have an allergy to latex, though, you can still use the female condom.;
, Sponges, which are made of foam and cover the cervix to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus, are now available over the counter, making them relatively inexpensive and easy to purchase.


Sponges are much more effective for women who have never given birth. Be aware that if you have given birth in the past, they may not be the best option for you.
Women with sulfa allergies should not use contraceptive sponges.

, Your doctor can prescribe barrier methods that are fitted to your body, including the diaphragm and cervical cap (flexible silicone devices that cover the cervix).


Both the diaphragm and the cervical cap may need to be re-fitted if you gain or lose a significant amount of weight.
The cervical cap, like the sponge, is much more effective for women who have never given birth. If you’ve given birth in the past, a diaphragm is a better choice.

, There are different kinds of intrauterine devices (IUDs) on the market, but the “Copper-T” IUD does not use hormones. Your doctor can insert the IUD into the uterus, where the copper will prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg. Copper IUD's are very effective, and they can last more than ten years; once in place, you can quite literally go a decade without thinking about birth control. They are, however, very expensive unless your insurance covers the cost.


Unlike most other non-hormonal methods of birth control, copper IUDs can produce unwanted symptoms in some women, including cramping and heavier menstrual bleeding.
Because they stay in your uterus all the time, copper IUDs also allow you to be completely spontaneous about sex; there’s no pre-planning necessary.

, There are a variety of methods available for tracking your menstrual cycles and predicting which days you are most and least fertile. Women who use natural methods simply avoid sex on their fertile days. If you have a predictable cycle and use these methods very carefully, they can be relatively effective; however, it’s best not to rely on natural planning if avoiding a pregnancy is extremely important to you. There are simply too many variables involved.


The most common natural methods are tracking your ovulation and menstruation days on a calendar, taking your temperature daily and watching for changes that signify ovulation, and checking for changes in your cervical mucus. The most effective way to approach natural birth control is to combine all of these methods.
If you want to try natural methods, there are many books and classes available – and, now, even apps for your phone – that can help you.

, If you are in a committed relationship, your partner can choose to get a vasectomy, a surgery that seals the vas deferens to prevent sperm from entering your partner’s semen. Alternatively, you can have a tubal ligation, a surgery that ties or cuts the fallopian tubes to prevent eggs from being fertilized. Both can sometimes be reversed, but this is not always possible, so it’s best to think of them as permanent solutions.


If your partner has a vasectomy, you must use a back-up method of birth control for several months, until a follow-up test confirms the absence of sperm in your partner’s semen. Follow your doctor’s instructions.

, All of the methods above – except for the copper IUD, which your doctor inserts for you – are less effective if you do not follow instructions exactly. Don’t assume that you know how to use any of these methods, and don’t assume that your partner knows how to use any of these methods. Read instructions and follow them to the letter.

, You can almost always increase the effectiveness of your birth control by combining methods. For example, if your partner wears a male condom, you can also use a sponge, diaphragm, or cervical cap. Or you can combine natural methods with a barrier device.

, Many of the options discussed above work best when combined with spermicidal foams, films, gels, or suppositories. Spermicides contain a chemical, nonoxynol-9, that destroys most sperm. They aren’t reliable enough to use alone, but they make condoms and other barrier devices much more effective.


Be aware that spermicides don’t prevent STDs at all, though it was previously believed that they did. In fact, some studies suggest that spermicide use alone can actually increase your risk of contracting HIV and other STIs because the chemical can cause irritation. Use spermicide with a condom unless you are in a monogamous relationship.

Avoid foods that trigger heartburn.,
Don’t drink a lot when you eat.,
Chew gum after meals.,
Consume some ginger.",How to Prevent Heartburn While Pregnant1," There are many foods that are known to cause heartburn, especially in pregnant women. Here are some foods and types of food that you should avoid:


Fried food
Spicy food
Especially rich foodFatty foods
Caffeine
Chocolate
CitrusTomatoes
Mustard
Vinegar
Processed meats
Minty productsCarbonated drinks
Onions
SugarSince the specific foods that cause problems can vary from person to person, pay attention to what you eat prior to heartburn flare-ups to determine which foods are the biggest culprits for your symptoms. If heartburn is particularly bothersome, it might be valuable to keep a food diary that logs what you eat and when your symptoms occur. This will help you identify the specific foods that are best avoided throughout your pregnancy.;
, You should certainly stay well hydrated when you’re pregnant. However, drinking a lot while you’re eating a meal will fill up your stomach and increase your chances of heartburn. Therefore, you should try to drink more in between meals and less when you’re sitting down for a meal., Chewing gum can help to reduce stomach acid after a meal because of the increase in saliva.However, minty products can often cause heartburn, so try chewing a non-mint gum., Some women find that ginger can help with heartburn, as well as with nausea and vomiting. Try some ginger ale, ginger tea, or even ginger chews."

Practice dry brushing.,
Don't use harsh chemicals on your skin.,
Moisturize your skin.,
Use sunscreen.",How to Prevent Pregnancy Stretch Marks2," Exfoliating your skin using a dry brush improves your circulation and keeps your skin healthy. Its recommended as a way to reduce the appearance of stretch marks that have already formed, but dry brushing can also be used as a preventative technique.


Use a dry brush made from natural fibers. The bristles should be stiff, but not too tough.
Start from the bottom of your legs and brush your skin upward toward your heart. Focus on areas where stretch marks might become a problem, like your buttocks and abdomen. When you're finished brushing, take a shower to wash away the dead skin cells.
Don't use a dry brush on your breasts, since the skin there is more sensitive and could be damaged by brushing.

, Many commercial body washes contain sulfates, which can dry out your skin and reduce its elasticity over time. Choose a cleanser made with natural oils that will hydrate your skin, rather than making it lose too much moisture.


Coconut oil can act as a healthy skin cleanser. Rub it over your skin, rinse with warm water, and pat your skin dry with a soft towel.
It may not be necessary to use a cleanser on your skin, especially if it's prone to becoming dry. Wash your skin with lukewarm water and pat it dry.

, Its important to use a moisturizer to hydrate the skin on your belly, sides, lower back, thighs, legs, and anywhere else you might get stretch marks. Regular lotion won't penetrate the skin deeply enough to keep it hydrated, so use a product specifically made for pregnant women, or choose a natural oil.


Cocoa butter, kokum butter, almond oil, egg oil, shea butter, and wheatgerm oil are popular and effective choices for moisturizing skin during pregnancy. Pure lanolin, which is made from the oils produced by sheep to keep their wool supple, also works very well. Other popular oils include tamanu oil, rosehip oil and baobab oil. These oils are rich in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. They support the regeneration of new tissues and accelerate the formation of healthy skin.
Moisturize your skin in the morning after bathing and again at night. If you notice itching where your skin is being stretched, that is a sign to add more moisturizer in that area.

, If you go swimming or spend some time in the sun, make sure you use plenty of sunscreen on your belly, sides, chest and other areas where stretch marks might occur. The sun's rays are tough on skin, so its especially important to protect yourself during pregnancy.

Continue eating foods that nourish your skin.,
Ramp up the exercise.,
Treat stretch marks.",How to Prevent Pregnancy Stretch Marks3," Don't give up the fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, fish, and avocados after your baby is born. The period after you give birth is an important window for making sure your skin continues to get the vitamins it needs to renew itself and recover from stretching.


Don't go on a crash diet to lose weight after pregnancy. Lose it gradually, just as you gained it gradually, so your skin has time to tighten itself.
Continue hydrating yourself with plenty of water to help your skin retain elasticity.

, Now that the baby has been born, you are no longer limited to exercises that are safe to do during pregnancy. Exercise four or five times a week, focusing in the following areas:


Strength training. Building strong muscles helps your skin tighten up. Try weightlifting, and work with a trainer to figure out what exercises are right for you.
Cardio workouts. Swimming, running, and biking keep your circulation healthy and help your skin bounce back into shape.

, If you do end up with a few stretch marks - which can happen even if you take preventative measures - treat them while they're still new. Apply a stretch mark salve containing glycolic acid to your abdomen, sides, and wherever red streaks have appeared.


Prescription creams containing retinoids, which should not be ingested while you are pregnant or nursing, have also been shown to help with stretch marks.Using glycolic acid and retinoids at the same time may produce better results than using the products on their own.If these products just aren't making the marks go away, laser treatments for stretch mark removal are an effective choice."

Keep your genital area clean.,
Go to the bathroom as soon as you feel the urge.,
Go to the bathroom before and after sexual intercourse.",How to Prevent UTI During Pregnancy2," Avoid using strong soap, cream, douches, powders and sprays. These products may increase the chances of contracting a UTI during pregnancy.


Take a shower rather than a bath. If you must bathe, avoid taking more than two baths per day or bathing for more than half an hour at a time.Avoid bubble bath or bath beads, which can inflame the urethral opening.
Make sure the tub is cleaned and rinsed well before taking a bath.

, Holding your urine keeps bacteria in your bladder longer and gives it a greater chance of developing into an infection. Take care to completely empty your bladder during each trip. Remember that the pressure of your growing uterus may complicate this practice; you'll need to carefully consider whether you're actually done urinating.


Blot dry with toilet paper and do not rub your genital area. Wipe from front to back every time.Treat constipation properly as soon as possible., Wash your genital area with warm water before sex to eliminate bacteria. You may use a water-based lubricant during sex.You should not have sex if you are being treated for a urinary tract infection.

"
"
Switch to cotton underwear and change them daily.,
Wear loosely fitting pants and skirts.,
Cross your ankles instead of your legs when you sit.",How to Prevent UTI During Pregnancy3," Synthetic fabrics trap moisture next to the skin, while cotton allows your genital area to ""breathe."" Clean garments prevent bacteria from accumulating in the genital region.


Ensure your underwear are fitting properly. The style of your underwear is less important than the garment's fit. Wear the type you find most comfortable, but make sure they are sufficiently roomy., Tight, restrictive clothing may make it more difficult to completely empty your bladder. This encourages back-up in your urinary tract and causes infection.


Polyester and synthetic garments can retain moisture and can promote the growth of bacteria. Look for garments made from cotton, linen, and other natural fibers.Tights and pantyhose (especially non-cotton varieties) also trap moisture near your genital region, so consider your pregnancy an excuse to enjoy the freedom of bare legs whenever possible.

, Crossing your legs restricts airflow and traps moisture against the skin, creating a hospitable environment for the growth of bacteria."

Contact your doctor right away if you believe you might have a UTI.,
Consult your doctor before using additional supplements.,
Ask your doctor about vaccines.",How to Prevent UTI During Pregnancy4," UTIs are more likely to develop into kidney infections in pregnant women than in women who aren't pregnant. By treating your UTI right away with antibiotics you'll reduce the risk of a more serious infection., You may come across articles recommending UTI prevention regimens such as d-mannose, a kind of sugar related to glucose which may prevent certain kinds of bacteria from sticking to the walls of the urinary tract. Far less research has been done on the impact of these supplements upon pregnant women. Never begin a supplement regimen without asking your doctor about its potential risks and benefits for your health and the health of your child., Although vaccines for UTI were in development stages in 2014, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Michigan, among other institutions, are actively pursuing vaccine research. Scientists are confident vaccines will be a viable treatment approach in the future.they are expected to be available in the next couple of years.

Eat fewer, smaller meals.Switching from three large meals a day to six smaller ones can have a significant impact on heartburn during pregnancy.,
Eat more slowly.,
Don’t lie down after meals.,
Avoid eating too close to bedtime.",How to Prevent Heartburn While Pregnant2," Eating less food reduces stomach pressure that can cause food particles and acid to back up into the esophagus.

, Slowing down your eating can also help you feel full faster, so you may tend to eat less at your meals.Take your time chewing and swallowing. You should be eating smaller meals, so you can also try to make them last longer by eating slowly.

, Lying down after a meal can increase your chance of heartburn. Instead, you should go for a quick walk or run an errand. Even if you are tired, try to spend at least an hour or two being on your feet or sitting in a chair before you lie down., Try not to eat for at least two to three hours before you go to bed. You should also be drinking less liquid during this time.At bedtime, you should also try to elevate your head and chest. You can buy a wedge-shaped pillow online or at a bedding store.You can also raise the bed frame or simply prop up your head and shoulders with additional normal pillows. Sleeping in a reclining position in a chair may also be an effective heartburn treatment.

Wear loose clothing.,
Don’t smoke.,
Take antacids.",How to Prevent Heartburn While Pregnant3," Your stomach and organs will receive even more pressure if you wear tight clothes. Stick to loose, flowing, comfortable clothes, such as dresses, big T-shirts, and sweatpants., You shouldn’t smoke anyway when you’re pregnant, but smoking can also trigger heartburn. Smoking makes your stomach more acidic, so it can make your heartburn worse. If you are struggling to quit, talk to your doctor. There are many different tactics you can employ to help you quit., There are lots of over-the-counter antacids that you can take, such as Tums. You should take these as directed for your symptoms. Feel free to take the ones with calcium (which is beneficial) and magnesium.


However, do not take antacids with aluminum in them, because they can cause constipation, and it can be toxic in large amounts.
Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) can cause swelling, so, if that is included in your antacid, find an alternative antacid option.If you have questions or concerns about your antacid, you should definitely call your doctor before taking one.

Stretch your legs.,
Sleep on your left side.,
Avoid tight fitting clothing.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Stay hydrated.,
Reduce your salt intake.,
Soak your feet.",How to Prevent Swollen Feet During Pregnancy1," Put your feet up as often as you can during the day and stretch your legs. You should flex your feet, rotate your feet, and wiggle your toes. These stretches and gentle walking can all pump blood back into your feet to prevent swelling. Try to avoid long periods of sitting or standing. If you do, take a five minute walk every hour to keep your blood flowing.If you have to sit for long periods of time, raise your legs for 10 to 15 minutes. Try to elevate your feet above your heart (by sitting in a recliner) and avoid crossing your legs or ankles as you sit.;
, Since pressure on your veins can cause swollen feet, ease pressure on the veins that return blood from your legs. To do this, try sleeping on your left side. Sleeping on the left side can also support kidney function. Don't worry if you wake up and you're on your back or right side. Just roll onto your left side and try to go back to sleep., Don't wear tight clothing like socks or stockings with elastic at the top that can restrict blood flow, especially to your feet or ankles. Instead, wear all-elastic support hose that are made for pregnancy. These can reduce swelling in your feet and will allow for your growing abdomen.You can also find pregnancy support knee-highs and thigh-highs that apply pressure all along the legs. These can encourage the flow of blood to your heart and prevent swelling.

, By the end of your pregnancy, the ligaments in your body are loosening to prepare for delivery. This may make your regular shoes feel too small since your feet may actually get larger. Choose shoes that don't pinch and give your feet some room to grow. Consider wearing shoes made of breathable material (like cloth or leather) that can stretch.Your shoes shouldn't have more than a one-inch heel. Any higher and you could be more prone to falls. High heels also put more pressure on your feet which can make swelling worse.

, It's important for pregnant women to drink more water than they did when they were not pregnant. Aim to drink 12 to 13 eight-ounce glasses of water a day. Water helps flush out your tissues to prevent swelling. Drinking plenty of water can also prevent constipation, hemorrhoids, urinary tract infections, and fatigue.If you're tired of drinking water, remember that milk and juices can count towards your daily fluid intake. Just avoid caffeine and limit your soda intake.

, Your doctor may have already talked to you about watching your salt intake, but you may want to cut back a bit more if you notice swelling. Eat foods that are already low in salt (sodium) and avoid adding salt to your meals. Sodium can cause you to retain fluids, making swelling worse.Instead of flavoring with salt, try seasoning your meals with fresh herbs.

, On hotter days (when your feet are more likely to swell), try cooling your feet and ankles by soaking them in cool water. Run a cool foot back and add 1/2 cup of Epsom salts. You may even want to add a few drops of lavender essential oil to help you relax. You could also drape cold washcloths over your ankles to prevent swelling.Try to stay cool in hot weather since the heat will make you swell more. If you can, go for a quick swim or soak in a tub full of cool water.

Avoid tight hairstyles.,
Use a comb with widely spaced teeth.,
Be careful with heat.",How to Prevent Hair Loss after Pregnancy1," Pulling on your hair, or styling it tightly, can cause hairs to be pulled out. Styling or playing with your hair too often may also contribute to hair loss. Opt for loose hairstyles to lessen the strain and damage to your hair.Avoid tight braids, using hair rollers, or tight hair clips and holders.
Don't use hot oil treatments on your hair either, as they can be damaging to the hair and scalp.
Avoid playing with your hair often, twisting or pulling on it.;
, If your comb has tightly spaced teeth, it may pull on your hair more than a brush with wider teeth would. This pulling can cause more hair loss. Use a comb with widely spaced teeth for a gentler way to brush your hair.When brushing your hair, always brush gently.
Wet hair is more fragile than dry hair. Be careful when combing or brushing wet hair and don't tug or pull on tangles., Using any heated tool on your hair can cause damage and increase hair loss. Try to avoid using any device such as hair dryers or curling irons. If you must use a hair dryer, set it to the coolest setting possible."

Know if you are at risk.,
Eat healthily and maintain optimal weight.,
Stay Mobile.,

Wear compression stockings.,
Contact a doctor.",How to Prevent Blood Clots During Pregnancy1," A blood clot can happen without any underlying cause. However, pregnancy increases your risk of getting blood clots, you are predisposed until 6 weeks after delivery. There are three major reasons for this increased risk:


Increased clotting. During pregnancy, your blood is more likely to clot. this is a survival mechanism that prevents your body from losing too much blood during labor and birth.
Slower blood flow. The blood flow in your veins becomes slower which leads to higher probability of blood clotting. This is caused by the hormones in your pregnancy.
Vein damage. During delivery, the baby presses on the veins in the pelvis, minor damage can occur in these veins leading to an increased risk of having a clot for up to six weeks after delivery.;
, The likelihood of developing clots during gestation or pregnancy can be further elevated by certain risk factors. Knowing these risk factors can ensure that you stay on guard. The following preexisting conditions can greatly increase your chances of clotting. If you suffer from one or more of the following, discuss specific preventative measures with your doctor:


Hypertension, diabetes, cardiac diseases, or vascular diseases. A damaged heart cannot pump blood as effectively as normal one, increasing the chance that blood pools and clots.
Thrombophilia. Some people are born with a tendency higher risk of blood clots.
Cesarean delivery. This doubles the risk of clots in comparison to vaginal delivery.
A personal or family history of clots. If you've had blood clots before, you're more likely to have blood clots in pregnancy. This risk also increases if you have had an immediate family member with an elevated blood clot risk
Previous use of oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives increases your blood’s ability to clot. These characteristics can continue after oral contraceptive use has ended.
Multiple births. Being pregnant with twins (or more) puts more pressure on your pelvis and legs, increasing the risk of DVTs.
Dehydration. Dehydration increases the viscosity of the blood, which can contribute to the formation of blood clots.
Age. Pregnant women over the age of 35 are at increased risk of blood clots.

, Obesity is one of the major risk factors for DVTs during pregnancy or after delivery, which means that it is important that you maintain optimal weight. If you are planning to have a baby, you should try to reduce you weight so that your BMI is below 30.


Minimize the amount of salt in your diet. Salt leads to retention of fluids in your body which cause swelling.
Eat a healthy, balanced diet. This is especially important if you are overweight, as it will help ensure that you do not take on any more unhealthy weight during the pregnancy.
Drink plenty of water. This will help you avoid dehydration.

, Immobility is another factor that increases your likelihood of getting DVTS. You should motivate yourself to do light exercise, such as walking and swimming. Most normal pregnancies allow for moderate exercise such as walking and swimming until full term. However, you should consult your doctor before you plan daily exercise, just to be sure.

, Smoking has been linked to DVTs, especially during pregnancy. Therefore, once you find out you are pregnant, you should quit smoking.

, Compression stockings are must-have for all women who are at risk of getting blood clots during and after their pregnancy. They are specifically effective for those who are faced with immobility for reasons such as travel or bed rest.

, If you have a history of blood clots or have a genetic predisposition to blood clots, inform your obstetrician or midwife. Your obstetrician may prescribe you injectable anticoagulants, a drug that prevents your blood from clotting.

Learn what causes normal swelling.,
Watch for signs of preeclampsia.,
Recognize symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).,
Look for signs of cellulitis.,
Get medical attention for swelling.",How to Prevent Swollen Feet During Pregnancy2," Because of the hormonal changes and physical pressure of pregnancy, your feet will probably swell at some point. Hormones can cause your body to retain fluid. This fluid and the growing baby can put pressure on the veins in your pelvis and legs, restricting the blood flow to your feet.You may notice swelling get worse in the evening, in warmer weather, or in the third trimester.

, If you have preeclampsia, your blood pressure increases and too much protein is excreted in your urine. You might see swelling on your face, hands, and feet. You may also have headaches, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Since preeclampsia can become very serious very quickly you should contact your doctor.If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia, your doctor will consider the specifics of your pregnancy to manage the condition. Once you're 37 weeks, the doctor will probably want to deliver the baby to prevent complications.

, DVT is a serious condition during pregnancy because blood clots can form in the veins of your legs. If you notice swelling, pain, tenderness, warmth, or redness in only one of your legs, contact your doctor immediately. DVT can happen during pregnancy because more clotting factors are produced and there's more pressure on the veins of your pelvis.Your doctor will probably recommend starting injections of a medication that prevents the clot from getting bigger so your body can break it down. You'll need injections throughout your pregnancy and up to six weeks postpartum.

, If your swelling is associated with redness or severe tenderness in your feet, you may have cellulitis. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection deep within your skin. You may also have a fever. Pregnancy can increase your risk for cellulitis, so if you think you may have it, contact your doctor.Treatment for cellulitis usually includes antibiotics.

Consider using hormonal birth-control.",How to Prevent Hair Loss after Pregnancy2," Certain hair products, shampoos, and conditioners, are believed to help keep hair looking full and healthy. You may have to try a few different products before you find one that works best for your hair and hairstyle. Try looking for some of the following qualities:Look for products labeled “volumizing shampoo.”
Avoid “conditioning shampoos,” as these can make the hair appear less full or heavy.
Avoid “intensive conditioners.” These may be too heavy and cause your hair to look less full.
Try to find conditioners that are designed for fine hair.
Products that contain biotin or silica may help as well., Being under stress can increase hair loss. Stress may cause your hair follicles to go into a resting phase, resulting in thinner hair coverage. Hair loss caused by stress can be reversed by reducing that stress.This, of course, may be difficult to do with a new baby. Make sure you are asking for help when you need it and your partner is helping you as much as possible.

Flavonoids and antioxidants. Vegetables and fruits can contain flavonoids and antioxidants, which can help with the maintenance of hair follicles., Some supplements are recommended to keep hair healthy and strong. While you wait for your hormone levels and hair growth to return to normal, you can treat your hair with certain supplements.Try vitamins B, C, E and zinc.
There is some evidence that taking biotin in oral form, zinc, and topical application of a cream containing clobetasol propionate, can help with hair loss.Applying lavender oil mixed with thyme, rosemary and cedar wood oils, may help treat some forms of hair loss., After pregnancy, your estrogen levels will be lower than normal. Hormonal birth-control can help boost estrogen levels, which in turn, may help with hair loss after pregnancy.You must wait at least four weeks after giving birth before starting any hormonal birth-control. Starting too soon can increase the risk of blood clots.
If you are nursing, you should wait until your supply of milk is established, as birth-control can disrupt milk production.

Notice any elevated temperatures in sites where blood clots are common.,
Check for any swollen veins.",How to Prevent Blood Clots During Pregnancy2," Heavy or painful feeling, redness, swelling or tenderness in one of your legs can be a sign of blood clots. Most commonly, the pain will be in your calf or thigh.


Swelling and discomfort in your legs is common in pregnancy, so it doesn't always mean that there's a serious problem. If you're worried you might have a blood clot, talk to your midwife or GP. Blood clots don’t always have symptoms, so it’s important to understand your personal risk.

, This pain may worsen when you walk. You may feel pain in other related areas due to the lack of oxygen to this region.

, If you suspect a blood clot, check for warm skin at the location of the suspected clot.

, Veins on your legs that look larger and swollen more than usual may be a sign of a blood clot.

Have your infant vaccinated.,
Avoid head injuries.,
Be on the lookout for signs of jaundice in your infant.,
Seek immediate emergency treatment if you witness any of the following in your infant:


Ceaseless crying at a high pitch.",How to Prevent Cerebral Palsy," Proper prenatal care can help prevent premature birth, low birth weight, and infections - all of which could lead to CP.;
, This increases the risk of premature delivery, making your infant more susceptible to illness.

, Infections in the mother can cause inflammation or increase the risk for prematurity, which is a major risk factor for CP.,, increases the chance of prematurity.,, There are numerous infections that can be prevented by having your child vaccinated. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (bacterial meningitis) is a known common cause of CP. Rubella, better known as the measles, in early childhood can also be a cause of CP. Vaccinations against both these infections are important for your infant.

, Take the following steps to protect your child from possible brain damage:


Use the appropriate car seats and booster seats.
Watch over your child in playgrounds. Never allow young children to climb on play equipment unattended.
Make sure your child wears a helmet when riding a bicycle.

, A little jaundice is quite common in newborns. Left untreated it can cause Kernicterus, a type of brain damage that can cause CP. Look for the following symptoms:

Correct anemia before childbirth.,
Eliminate routine episiotomy.,
Make sure your vital signs are monitored to ensure safety and prevent shock.,
Monitor your vaginal blood flow.,
Monitor your third stage of labor to prevent the onset of hemorrhage.",How to Prevent and Treat Postpartum Hemorrhage1," Identifying and correcting the presence of anemia before child birth can go a long way towards preventing postpartum hemorrhage.


Anemia is a strong precursor hemorrhage, due to the lack of iron in the blood inhibiting blood clotting.
The effects of anemia can be managed by increasing your iron intake throughout the course of your pregnancy.
Using iron supplements and consuming foods that are rich in iron (green leafy vegetables with vitamin C) are a good way to boost your levels of iron.;
, If you are undergoing episiotomy, it should be eliminated because laceration and other forms of trauma can greatly increase your risk of postpartum hemorrhage.


This can only be done if the perineum is a limiting factor in child birth and delivery.

, You should make sure your vital signs are thoroughly evaluated and monitored before being discharged from the delivery room.


A sudden change in your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate) can indicate that you are going through shock, which can be a complication of postpartum hemorrhage.
Doctors and nurses should make sure that all your vital signs are stable before rooming you in a recovery area or a general ward.

, Vaginal flow must also be monitored to ensure that you notice hemorrhage immediately.


A significant increase in blood flow is only the tip of the iceberg, revealing a tiny part of what is actually happening inside your body during hemorrhage.

, Active management of the third stage of labor is the best preventive strategy you can use.


This involves the administration of uterotonic medications immediately after delivery, controlled cord traction, and early cord clamping and cutting.

Starting this relationship early will not only help you get vital advice, but also help you make sure you end up with someone that you like when you really are carrying junior!;
, It's important to go to the doctor and make sure you've had your important vaccinations and that any that have lapsed get updated. This is because while it's rare to get illnesses like measles, if you get them while you're pregnant it can have serious consequences for your baby.

, STIs and STDs can often go asymptomatic and exposing your baby to them can cause lifelong problems for your child or even death. Don't allow misconceptions about how one gets STIs to keep you from getting tested. Even if you think it's impossible, just get tested anyway to be sure!

, You'll want your doctor to do a full check-up to keep an eye out for any health complications that might make getting or staying pregnant dangerous or difficult. Pregnancy is very hard on your body and if you already have, for example, mild high blood pressure then you could be in for a dangerous ride.

, Many prescription medications and some dietary supplements can be dangerous for pregnant woman and their babies. Check with your doctor about all medications you are on and find out what adjustments will be necessary.

, You will, of course, have to stop taking birth control before you can become pregnant. However, it's important to understand how long it will be after you stop before you are capable of becoming pregnant again. You should look up the specifics for the medication or birth control method you are on, but generally:

Birth control pills will generally be out of your system within a few days, but your body may not be ready to become pregnant for 2-3 months.
Depo-Provera can take as much as 9-12 months to fully exit your system.
IUDs, hormonal and non-hormonal, can often have you back to normal in less than a month.
Condoms, cervical caps, and other barrier methods will not stop you from getting pregnant as soon as you stop using them.

, If you use cigarettes, you have to quit while pregnant. If you drink, you have to stop. On the off chance that you use drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or any other illegal substances such as these, stop. All of these things can kill your baby or cause it to be born with serious mental and general health problems.

, Serious stress while pregnant can be dangerous for you baby and dangerous for you too! Your blood pressure is often affected by pregnancy and so added stress can be the straw that broke the camel's back, or in this case, the straw that caused the camel to go into early labor.

Find healthy ways of coping with stress, such as doing a creative task or screaming into a pillow.

, Water is so important for you normally, so you can imagine how important it is for you to get water while you're pregnant. You've no doubt heard about how often you'll be peeing when you're pregnant, so making sure your body starts off in a well-hydrated state is very important.


A normal person with regular activity should drink 2 liters (0.5 US gal) a day. However, a pregnant woman, like an athlete, should drink a little more...perhaps even up to 3 liters (0.8 US gal) a day. This is to help maintain the hydration and elasticity of your skin and later on, to help create good levels of amniotic fluid.

, Folic acid is scientifically proven to be vital in making sure your baby develops correctly. You want to start getting this nutrient in your system even before the baby arrives. You can take supplements, or get it naturally (and more effectively) by eating leafy greens and whole grains.

, If you eat a lot of junk food or foods that are naturally dangerous, like certain types of seafood (high in mercury), then now is the time to stop. Exposing a baby to high amounts of fat, sugar, and toxins like mercury can seriously negatively affect their development.

, Eat a healthy diet to make sure your body is rich in all of the nutrients your baby will need. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Remember: the more green it is, the better. Kale is way better for your baby than celery. The same with fruit. Forgo sugary apples in favor of Vitamin C-rich oranges.

, If you already exercise, you may need to tone down your workouts. Especially stressful workouts, like Crossfit, can make it extremely difficult for your body to carry the pregnancy to term. Skip stressful workouts like jogging in favor of exercises like swimming.

, Core exercises, like sit-ups and squats, will strengthen your stomach muscles. This will help ensure that they heal correctly after you have your baby. Incorrectly healed muscles can lead to a permanent bit of puffy tummy, even if you're otherwise thin.

, Generally, being in shape leads you to a stronger, healthier body. That of course can really help contribute to a stronger, healthier pregnancy. Make sure you get light activity every day at an absolute minimum. If you can work out for half an hour every other day, this is great!


Yoga is a great workout once you're actually pregnant.

, Use lanolin and shea butter on your skin to help prevent stretch marks. You should also take Vitamin E supplements or eat foods naturally rich in this nutrient to keep your skin strong and healthy-looking.

Get uterine massage to help alleviate bleeding.,
Use oxytocin to contract middle layer of the uterine wall.,
Get ergot alkaloids administered to induce contractions.,
Take prostaglandins to increase vasoconstriction (tightening of blood vessels).,
Receive sutures to stop severe bleeding.,
Make sure the uterus is properly positioned.",How to Prevent and Treat Postpartum Hemorrhage2," Uterine massage is performed by your OBGYN placing one hand in your vagina and other hand on your abdominal wall.


One hand compresses area above your abdominal wall, while the other hand is in your vagina.
The back part of your uterus is massaged with the abdominal hand while the front is massaged using the vaginal hand.

, Oxytocin is able to stimulate the upper part of your myometrium (middle layer of the uterine wall) causing it to contract rhythmically.


This constricts the arteries in the area, resulting in a decreased blood flow to your uterus.
Oxytocin is the drug of choice for the treatment of post-partum hemorrhage.
Generally, 10 IU is injected intramuscularly or 20 IU is infused with 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of saline using a rate of 250 ml per hour, applied intravenously.
In some instances, 500 ml can be infused over a period of 10 minutes without causing further complications.

, Ergot alkaloid medications, like methylergonovine and ergometrine, cause smooth muscle contraction in your uterus.


This can have a similar effect to oxytocin, working to reduce blood flow to the uterus and preventing further blood loss.
Generally, methylergonovine is administered intramuscularly at a dose of 0.2 mg.
The dose can be repeated every two to four hours.
Since this drug can raise blood pressure, it is not given to women who have pregnancy induced hypertension (preeclampsia) or hypertension.
You should watch for side effects that include nausea and vomiting.

, Prostaglandins are can increase your uterine contractions and cause vasoconstriction in your blood vessels.


15-methyl prostaglandin F2 and carboprost (Hemabate) are commonly used prostaglandins.
Keep an eye on the following side effects: nausea and vomiting, hypertension, diarrhea, headache, and pyrexia (fever).
Another prostaglandin used is misoprostol.
This drug is able to increase uterine tone, while decreasing postpartum bleeding.
Misoprostol is administered orally, sublingually, rectally, and vaginally.
The usual doses range from 200 to 1000 mcg.
This drug is not approved by the American Food and Drug Administration because of the side effects (fever, diarrhea, and shivering).

, Postpartum hemorrhage caused by trauma can usually be managed through hemostasis (termination of bleeding using chemical or mechanical means) and immediate repair.


However, in some cases, direct pressure is not able to stop bleeding.
You then need to receive sutures.

, Every attempt must be made in order to reverse the uterus if it has become inverted.


Once the uterus is put back in place, you must administer uterotonic agents to promote uterine tone elasticity and to prevent a recurrence from happening.
In cases where the initial attempt at replacing the uterus fails, magnesium sulfate administration, nitroglycerin, terbutaline, and general anesthesia can be used in order to allow enough uterine relaxation for manipulation to take place.
If all else fails, surgical replacement of the uterus can be done.

Eat smaller meals more frequently.,
Take your time and chew your food well.,
Chew gum after meals.,
Drink a small glass of milk after a meal.,
Don't lie down right after you eat.,
Stay active during the day.,
Be conscientious of your sleeping position.,
Manage your stress.,
Avoid eating fatty foods.,
Avoid spicy and acidic foods.,
Cut out caffeinated beverages.,
Stop drinking alcohol.,
Take antacids after meals.,
Try H2 blockers.,
Consider proton pump inhibitors.",How to Prevent Acid Reflux During Pregnancy," Another recommendation for combating heartburn is to eat smaller portions of food spaced out through the day. Eating smaller meals every few hours instead of three large meals many hours apart prevents your stomach from becoming too full and putting pressure under your diaphragm and pushing acid up into your esophagus.As such, switch to eating 5-6 small meals or snacks daily spaced about 2 hours apart.


Your last meal or snack of the day should be eaten early in the evening, at least 3 hours before you head to bed. This gives your stomach enough time to properly digest the food and send it on to your small intestine.
Aim for small meals or snacks that are around 300 to 400 calories each. Gaining some weight during pregnancy is necessary as you're eating for two, but significant weight gain increases your risk of diabetes.;
, Slow down when you eat your meals or snacks and chew each mouthful thoroughly before swallowing because it promotes better digestion.Conversely, eating too quickly and not chewing properly reduces the amount of saliva release into your mouth and causes your stomach to work harder, which increases the likelihood of indigestion and heartburn. Eating slowly also tends to prevent over-eating because you feel full quicker.


Take small bites and chew each mouthful of food for between 20-30 seconds so that there's lots of saliva in your mouth before swallowing.
Chewing your food well reduces the need to drink lots of liquids with meals in order to ""flush the food down."" Drinking more than a few ounces of liquid with meals can dilute digestive enzymes and promote indigestion.

, Chewing gum can help provide relief from heartburn because it stimulates the production of saliva, which contains acid-neutralizing bicarbonate.Swallowing more saliva can literally ""put the fire out"" because it neutralizes the stomach acid that's gotten into the esophagus. In this sense, saliva is your body's natural antacid.


Avoid minty and menthol-flavored gum, such as peppermint, because they can actually stimulate your stomach's production of digestive juice.
Choose sugar-free gum with xylitol because the artificial sweetener can kill cavity-causing bacteria in your mouth and ulcer-causing bacteria in your stomach.
Wait about 15-30 minutes after meals before chewing on gum because food needs an acidic environment to be properly digested and broken down.

, Your stomach needs to be very acidic in order to properly digest food, but the problems start when too much acid is produced or if the acid gets past the esophageal sphincter to irritate the esophagus. As such, wait about an hour or so after a meal before drinking a small glass of milk. The minerals in milk (mainly calcium) can neutralize any acid in your esophagus and help to soothe any irritation.


Use low-fat milk so that the animal-based fat doesn't make the acid reflux worse.
Sometimes the sugar (lactose) in milk and other dairy products can trigger heartburn, so experiment with the milk drinking, but stop it if it creates more problems.
Don't drink milk after meals if you are lactose intolerant (don't produce enough lactase enzyme) because the symptoms of bloating and cramps can make your acid reflux worse., While eating food it's best to sit up straight, but resist the urge to lie down after you finish your meal.Keeping upright works with gravity and promotes the travel of digested food down through your gastrointestinal system. Lying on a couch cancels out the effect of gravity and allows partially digested food and stomach acid to leak through the esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus.


It's the irritation of the lining of the esophagus that causes the burning feeling in your chest — aka heartburn. Other symptoms of acid reflux include: sore throat, difficulty swallowing, dry cough and hoarseness.Wait for at least a few hours before lying down on a couch / bed. You can sit down and put your feet up to rest, but make sure your upper body is erect.
Avoid eating big meals to reduce your tiredness (and desire to lie down) due to the sudden secretion of lots of insulin hormone into your bloodstream from your pancreas.

, Moderate-to-heavy exercise immediately after a meal greatly increases your risk of indigestion and heartburn, but mild exercise (walking) can help promote intestinal motility — push undigested food and waste material through your intestines so nothing gets backed up.After you finish cleaning up the dishes, go for a 15-20 minute gentle walk or do some light chores around the house.


Too much exercise diverts blood away from your gastrointestinal system and into muscles of your legs and arms, which compromises digestion.
Focus on doing more exercise during the day instead of at night so that it doesn't affect your sleep.
Mild exercise promotes regular bowel movements, which prevents a ""log jam"" in your intestines and a build up of pressure from gas.

, If you're suffering from a bout of acid reflux while pregnant (or any other time), be conscious of your body position while in bed at night. To combat heartburn, try elevating your upper body and head with pillows, which will put gravity to work — although pillows may not always be effective because they're too soft.If this isn't comfortable, then lie on your left side, which makes it more difficult for stomach acid to reflux into your esophagus.Foam wedges meant to prop up your upper body in bed are available at some pharmacies and most medical supply stores.
Avoid lying on your side while your upper body is propped up by pillow or a wedge because you can irritate your upper spine (mid back) and ribs.

, Stress and anxiety often causes more acid to be produced in your stomach and less blood to circulate around your intestines for food absorption, which are factors that can aggravate acid reflux. As such, try to manage your stress with relaxation therapies, such as deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, yoga or tai chi.A variety of techniques to reduce stress and anxiety can reduce the signs and symptoms of acid reflux / heartburn.
Practice relaxation techniques after you come home from work / school, but before eating any food. These techniques can also be done just before bedtime in order to promote better sleeps.

, Fried and fatty foods tend to trigger heartburn or acid reflux because they take longer to digest, require more stomach acid and make it easier for the acid to slosh back up into your esophagus.As such, choose leaner cuts of meat and poultry, consume low-fat dairy products and bake more items instead of frying them.


Foods to avoid include: French fries, most fast food items, potato chips, bacon, sausages, gravy, regular ice cream and milkshakes.
Some fat is needed for your baby to develop normally, so focus more on avocados, coconut products and nuts / seeds that have healthier fatty acids.

, Another group of foods to avoid are spicy and acidic types, because they can irritate your esophagus on the way down, then trigger acid reflux once they hit the stomach.As such, avoid hot sauces, cayenne pepper, jalapeños, salsas, tomato sauce, onions, garlic and peppercorns.


Despite their delicious flavors and health benefits, Mexican and Thai cuisine should be avoided if you're experiencing a bout of acid reflux.
Be careful with acidic citrus fruits, such as oranges and grapefruits. Stick to fresh-squeezed varieties and don't drink them on an empty stomach to avoid heartburn.

, Caffeine is a known trigger of acid reflux (it stimulates stomach acid production), but almost all beverages that contain caffeine are also acidic, so it's another double whammy situation for heartburn.As such, limit or avoid coffee, black tea, hot chocolate, colas, most other sodas and all energy drinks.


Colas and sodas may actually be a ""quadruple whammy"" for heartburn because they are acidic, caffeinated, sugary and carbonated. The bubbles expand your stomach and make it more likely acid is pushed past the esophageal sphincter.
You should also avoid caffeinated beverages because the caffeine can decrease your blood flow and limit the nutrition your baby gets.

, Alcohol is a common cause of heartburn due to its acidity and relaxing effect on the esophageal sphincter, but pregnant women should also avoid it completely due to the negative effects on their baby — it could lead to fetal alcohol syndrome.Alcohol is not safe in any amount or at any time during pregnancy, so cut it out of your lifestyle immediately.


All types of alcohol are equally harmful to your baby, including all types of wines and beer.
If you still want to go out to lounges and bars with your friends and family, switch to virgin cocktails, grape juice or non-alcoholic beers instead.

, Antacids are the safest heartburn medicine for pregnant women primarily because they are not absorbed into the bloodstream, meaning that they only travel to your gastrointestinal system and don’t get directed towards the growing baby.Common antacids that can provide quick heartburn relief include: Maalox, Mylanta, Gelusil, Gaviscon, Rolaids and Tums. Take them about 30-60 minutes after a meal or snack.


Antacids don't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by digestive acid, so use them for symptomatic relief only.
Some antacids are combined with compounds called alginates, which work by forming a foam barrier in your stomach to prevent acid reflux.
Overuse of antacids can trigger diarrhea or constipation, so be cautious and don't take them more than 3 times per day.

, Over-the-counter (OTC) medications that reduce acid production are called histamine-2 (H2) receptor blockers and include: cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC), nizatidine (Axid AR) and ranitidine (Zantac).In general, H2 blockers don't act as quickly as antacids do for heartburn, but they typically provide longer relief and can decrease stomach acid production for up to 12 hours.


OTC H2 blockers are considered safe for pregnant women, although the drugs do get absorbed into the bloodstream and impact the baby in some capacity.
Stronger versions are available via prescription, but talk to your doctor about the pros and cons if you're pregnant — there is a risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.

, Other medications that block acid production are called proton pump inhibitors, but they also are able to heal the tissue membranes of the esophagus.Proton pump inhibitors are more effective blockers of stomach acid compared to H2 blockers and allow time for an inflamed esophagus to heal.


OTC proton pump inhibitors include: lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid OTC).
Taking proton pump inhibitors right before a meal will still allow for some stomach acid to digest your food, but it will prevent over-production.

Eat a high fiber diet.,
Drink an adequate amount of fluids.,
Include regular physical activity.,
Decrease your iron supplementation.",How to Prevent Constipation During Pregnancy1," One of the best defenses for preventing or alleviating constipation during pregnancy is ensuring you're eating a high fiber diet.


Women should aim for at least 25 g of fiber every day.Track your fiber intake with a food journal or app to see how close you are to that goal.
Fiber helps prevent constipation in two ways. It helps make your stool softer which can make it easier to go in addition to increasing the speed of your GI system.The best high fiber foods include: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, and starchy vegetables.
If you're not currently eating a very high fiber diet, suddenly increasing your fiber intake can cause stomach aches or other gastrointestinal issues.Slowly increase your fiber intake by a few grams over the course of several days.;
, Many people know the importance of drinking adequate fluid and constipation prevention. This is also especially important during pregnancy.


When you're dehydrated, your body withdraws fluid from your colon, making your stools harder and more difficult to pass. This is a common reason for constipation.When you're pregnant you'll need more fluids each day to help support your growing baby. Most professionals recommend going for 12-13 glasses of water daily. Each glass should be 8 oz.If plain water isn't your thing, try some of these flavorful substitutes: flavored sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea, flavored plain waters, and even low-fat milk (contains about 7 oz of water per 8 oz glass).

, Like fluids and fiber, regular physical activity is essential for preventing constipation.


Exercise, especially cardiovascular exercise, help get the insides of your body get moving.This is a great an easy way to help keep things moving and prevent constipation.
Aim for about 150 minutes of low to moderate intensity activity each week.Although it's generally considered safe to continue most exercises you were doing prior to your pregnancy, you may need to modify them based on your doctor's recommendation and your level of comfort.If you weren't very active prior to your pregnancy, that doesn't mean you can't start adding in some activity. Start slow and with low intensity activities. Take your time as you build up strength.
Avoid any aerobic exercises that are jarring, have a lot of bouncing or have a risk of abdominal injury.
Try the following exercises: walking, slow jogging as you're comfortable, swimming, doing the elliptical machine or using stationary bike. What's easy or comfortable may change as your belly grows.

, Another common cause of constipation is iron. Many prenatal vitamins do contain iron which may be causing your constipation.Iron can make stools hard and difficult to pass. If you're taking a prenatal vitamin with iron or taking an extra iron supplement, this may set you up for constipation.Talk with your doctor about decreasing the amount of iron from a supplemental source.
Even when you're pregnant, a well-planned and nutritious diet can provide you with adequate amounts of iron during your pregnancy.

Make regular trips to your doctor.",How to Prepare for the Birth of Twins1," If you’re feeling tired, sit down and put your feet up. With twins, you have all of the discomfort of a single pregnancy, times two. Consider taking a tepid bath, relax in the tub with a good book and unwind.;
, Let him know how you are feeling. Be sure your partner understands and is compassionate to the remarkable and incredible changes your body is going through, both physically and emotionally. A sympathetic ear is wonderful comfort when you’re just not feeling like yourself.

, Your pregnant body needs added nutrition, especially when you’re expecting twins. Increase your intake of calcium by eating calcium rich foods like milk or broccoli. Extra protein is also important when pregnant with twins. Protein acts as building blocks for body tissue and contains enzymes that are essential in regulating chemical reactions to keep your body functioning properly while your babies grow. Be sure you are getting enough iron as well; iron deficiency anemia is common in multiple pregnancies. To avoid this, be sure you are eating enough iron rich foods. Take a prenatal vitamin each day to account for other important nutrients.

, If it seems like you're visiting your OBGYN a lot, understand that frequent visits are a normal part of pregnancy when expecting multiples.

Drink warm prune juice.,
Add in some psyllium husk.,
Take a probiotic.",How to Prevent Constipation During Pregnancy2," If you are constipated, drinking warm prune juice is an easy and natural way to get things moving along.


Prune juice works as a natural ""laxative"" due to it's high sorbitol content. Warming it also has shown to help its constipation relieving effects.Try drinking about 4 oz of prune juice everyday to help get rid of constipation.
If you're not into drinking prune juice, eating a few dried prunes or plums will also help get your bowels moving.

, Psyllium husk is a natural supplement that can be added to your diet to help relieve constipation.


Psyllium husk is generally sold in a powder, tablet or capsule form and can be added to your diet or a variety of foods to help prevent or treat constipation.Psyllium husk works by adding soft bulk to your stools which stimulates your GI system to speed up.Add in a psyllium husk supplement daily to help treat constipation.

, There have been conflicting studies on whether or not probiotics can help treat or prevent constipation. However, it's not harmful during pregnancy and might be helpful to you.


It's generally thought that probiotics (beneficial and healthful bacteria found in foods) is perfectly safe during pregnancy.It's thought that these good bacteria can help constipation or diarrhea during pregnancy.
Take a probiotic supplement daily during pregnancy. These are sold in liquid or tablet form and can be purchased at health food stores and pharmacies.
You may also want to increase the amount of foods you eat that contain probiotics. Try eating more of: yogurt, fermented yogurt drinks, kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha (if its pasteurized), and pickles."

Avoid harmful medications.",How to Prevent Constipation During Pregnancy3," If you've tried a few natural methods of preventing and treating constipation, but have no success, talk to your OB/GYN about other options.


If you notice you're feeling constipated and you're pregnant, give your doctor a call to update her on your symptom and ask for advice.
Also tell your doctor if you've tried certain things to relieve constipation and how successful those changes were.
Lastly, ask if there is anything over-the-counter that she recommends to help increase the success of your lifestyle changes to treating your constipation.

, Stool softeners are a common over-the-counter medication that many people use to help treat or prevent constipation.


Generally, stool softeners are considered safe for intermittent use to treat constipation during pregnancy.Taking a stool softener as needed can help make it easier to go. These medications do not stimulate your GI system like a laxative.

, In addition to getting fiber from your foods, there are also fiber supplements that you can purchase at your local pharmacy that may help treat your constipation.


Many fiber supplements work by adding soft bulk to your stool so it's easier to go.
Occasionally there are other supplements that will stimulate your GI system as well to speed up the transit time.Many fiber supplements are sold in powder form that you can sprinkle into beverages to help add in more fiber. There are also supplements that are sold as gummy supplements or in capsule form.

, Although there are many safe methods of treating constipation during pregnancy, there are medications and treatment options that are not safe for you.


Avoid stimulant laxatives if you can. These are generally not pleasant regardless of whether you're pregnant, but many doctors do not want their pregnant patients ingesting these types of medications.Also, do not take mineral oils like caster oil to treat constipation. They can prevent the absorption of many vital nutrients in your GI system."

However, you can make yourself a home cooked meal that won’t just save you money, but will also ensure that you’re eating healthier for the babies.

, Consider trading in your current vehicle and purchasing a used one. Many car dealerships offer used vehicles with little wear and tear, and will even include a warranty.

Purchase a basic layette.,
Create a gift registry.,
Consider borrowing baby items whenever possible.,
Purchase a stroller.,
Stockpile diapers.",How to Prepare for the Birth of Twins3," Include all the baby basics such as sleepwear, one piece undershirts, socks, hats and bibs. The more basics you have on hand, the less laundry you’ll be doing. Consider mix and match interchangeable outfits. Twins don’t always have to be dressed alike; their wardrobe will seem larger if you have a wide variety of items to choose from.

, Go to a popular department store, baby specialty store or online merchant and generate a registry. This will make it easy for family and friends to shop for your babies when they arrive.

, This is especially helpful if you are trying to stay within a budget. Nearly new baby gear is usually just as good as brand new items in the stores.

, One of the greatest challenges of having twins is getting out and about with them. There are many strollers on the market geared for twins, some more practical than others. Be sure to go to your local department store and try them out. Try pushing a few different double strollers around the store; you will quickly realize they are not all created equal. Decide which one best suits you and your traveling needs.

, Go to your local warehouse store and buy diapers and wipes in bulk. It is estimated that twins will go through 140 diapers a week. Buying in bulk will save you a great deal of money and lessen your time spend at the store.

Determine if your babies will share one crib or if you will have two separate cribs.,
Decorate the room with coordinating bedding sets rather than an exact match.,
Determine whether you twins will be breast or bottle-fed.",How to Prepare for the Birth of Twins4," There are double cribs on the market, but they tend to be very expensive. If you choose to use one crib, you can purchase a divider which will give each baby his own space, however, even this is not a necessity. Some parents feel it’s best to keep the twins in the same crib in the beginning then graduate to two cribs as the babies grow.

, This will give each twin a distinct space while keeping a unified theme. You can also choose two colors of paint for the walls, or decorate each twin’s area with different wall decals. This is especially helpful when a boy and girl are sharing a nursery.

, Not only is breastfeeding healthy for babies, but it’s free. Think of all of the money you will save not having to buy formula for your twins and what’s more, breastfeeding burns calories so you’ll get a jump start on losing that baby weight. If you choose to breast feed it will be useful to purchase a nursing pillow. This will allow you to breast feed the babies at the same time, while the pillow helps to support the twins. If you will be bottle feeding your babies, be sure to stock up on bottles or use bottles with disposable liners. This will cut down on the time you spend washing bottles.

Choose a theme that is particular to you.,
Try a seasonal gender reveal theme.,
Use balloons or a pinata for the gender reveal object.,
Do the gender reveal with food.,
Make a custom gender reveal object.,
Make a guest list.,
Create gender reveal invitations.,
Plan gender reveal games.,
Pick decorations based on the theme.,
Enlist others to help you set up.,
Do a walk through of the location before the party begins.",How to Plan a Gender Reveal Party," Think of a theme in your life that feels important or a theme that speaks to your interests. For example, maybe you love awards shows and want to use an award show theme for the party, complete with an envelope that contains the gender that is opened at the end of the party. Or maybe you love a specific animal and want to have it as the theme of the party.If you are a sports fan, you may do a “gender bowl reveal” theme, based on the idea of a Super Bowl themed party. Go for decorations that mimic Super Bowl decorations, but with rubber ducks, babies, and clouds instead of team names, logos, and colors.;
, You can also choose a specific season, such as the season when you will be giving birth, and use it as a theme for the party. For example, if your due date is right after Easter, you may have an Easter themed party with the gender reveal done through the opening of Easter eggs.You could also do a winter/Christmas themed party where the gender reveal is done through gift boxes being unwrapped if your due date is in December. Or you may choose a summer theme for the party if your due date is during the summer months.

, As part of the theme of the party, create a gender reveal object that will reveal the gender to your guests. One popular option is to fill a box with balloons that are pink for a girl or blue for a boy. Then, you can open the box in front of your guests to reveal the gender of your baby.Another option is to use a pinata as the gender reveal object, where you have guests hit the pinata until the candy falls out. The candy will then be blue or pink based on the sex of your baby.
If you are looking for a fun, easy option, get a can of silly string in blue or pink and spray your guests with it to reveal the gender of your baby.

, Another popular gender reveal option is to have food that contains blue or pink color inside. You may make your own cupcakes with pink or blue frosting inside, or get a local bakery to make you gender reveal cupcakes. You could also fill a cake with a specific color based on the gender of your baby or make cookies that have a colored filling.You may decide to make another food part of the gender reveal, such as your favorite donuts or your favorite macarons from a local shop. Or you may turn a traditional family recipe into a gender reveal by dying the inside blue or pink based on your baby’s gender.

, If you’re feeling creative, you can make your own custom gender reveal object for the party. This could be a t-shirt that you make with your handprints in blue or pink that you put on at the end of the party. Or maybe you decorate a baby onesie in a particular color to then show your guests., Sit down and write down the people you plan to invite to the gender reveal party. If you are planning the party on behalf of the mom-to-be, make sure you include her when making the guest list. You may put a cap on how many people you can invite if you plan to keep the party small and intimate. Or you may allow for a long guest list if you are planning to have a big bash to reveal the baby’s gender.You may start by focusing on individuals that are must invites, such as close family of the mother and the father of the baby. You may then add on close friends and then only add on acquaintances if there is enough space on the guest list.

, Once you have the guest list, create the invitations for the party. You may create your own invitations or get them done professionally. You may also opt for email invites or paper invites you send in the mail. If you have a lot of guests, you may go for evites to save money and paper.In the invitation, you may include a brief explanation of what a gender reveal party is, as some guests may have never been to one before. For example, you may write: “This is a gender reveal party, where we will all find out the gender of the baby together.”
Try to send out the invitations at least two to three weeks before the party date to give your guests enough time to RSVP.

, As part of the preparations for the party, have a few gender reveal games and activities planned. One popular game is to divide the party into two teams, one team for each gender, and have them wear t-shirts or pins to support their team before the big gender reveal at the end of the party. Another option is to have a chart where people guess if the baby is a boy or a girl.


Another option is to ask guests to show up dressed in blue or pink based on their prediction of the sex of the baby. You can then tally how many people show up in each color and determine how close everyone was with their guest once the gender is revealed.

, Go for decorations that really drive your chosen theme home. For example, you may choose all Easter decorations in pastel shades for the balloons and streamers for the party. Or you may go for Christmas decorations for a holiday gender reveal theme.You may go all out and get decorations like centerpieces for the tables, themed cutlery, posters or images for the wall, a banner, and fresh flowers.

, Setting up for the party can be a big undertaking, especially if you are planning the party on your own. Get friends and family to help you set up the decorations on the day of the party so everything goes smoothly. You may delegate certain tasks to each person on the day of the party so the decorations get done before the party starts.You may find it helpful to make a list of tasks for the party and then delegate them out to others that way.

, Make sure everything is ready for the party by doing a walk through of the party location. Check that the refreshments are all there as well as the party favors. Confirm all the decorations are up and there is enough seating for all the expected guests.You should also make sure the gender reveal item is set up and ready to go before the party begins. If you are using a pinata for the gender reveal, for example, check that it is secure for the gender reveal portion of the party.
You may want to have a camera handy to capture the gender reveal during the party. You may also suggest that guests film the reveal on their phones during the party and use a specific hashtag when they post the images on social media.

Connect to resources that can help you better understand your situation.,
Recruit help.",How to Prepare for the Birth of Twins5," Take to the Internet or even your local library; look for groups or forums that cater to parents of multiples. Educate yourself and ask questions. You will soon realize you are not alone and may feel comforted by the stories and advice of other moms in similar situations.

, Once those babies are born everyone will offer to lend a helping hand; just say yes! Neighbors, family and friends will be thrilled to be of assistance. Take advantage of these opportunities, they won’t be around for long.

Discuss the birth plan.,
Put together a hospital bag.,
Maintain open communication.,
Provide reassurance and pain relief.,
Advocate for the mom and baby.,
Provide support that keeps you comfortable.",How to Prepare For the Birth of a Child As a Father2," The uncertainty of childbirth can scare women and men. There may be an explicit birth plan for the labor and delivery and newborn’s aftercare. Discussing the birth plan with the baby’s mother in the days before the delivery can help you best support and advocate for her and the baby during birth.Talk about things such as:


Her preferences on the place and positions in which she’d like to birth the baby
Her preferences on your role in the birth
Any fears or expectations she has
Her preferences for pain relief
Her feelings about medical procedures such as an episiotomy, or IV-hydration
Any clothes or other things such as a TV she wants to make her comfortableHer feelings about having a forceps, vacuum-assistance, or a C-section, if necessary

, In the weeks before the birth, pack yourself bag of things you, the mother, and your baby need in the hospital. Try to include things such as:A copy of the birth plan
Entertainment
Comfortable clothing and footwear, including a change of clothes
Personal items including bathing products or pillowsClothing and diapers for your baby
A camera
Insurance cards and drivers’ licenses.Car seat

, Having an open line of communication during labor and delivery can help ease any discomfort, pain, or tension during birth. Provide as much support as the baby’s mother needs. You might consider soothing messages such as, “You can do this,” to help relax and distract her. Open communication also allows you to advocate for her if necessary.Tell jokes only as necessary. During the early stages of labor this may be fine, but as she progresses, she may not find them funny., Labor is an intense experience. The stress from birth can make pain worse. If the baby’s mother allows, offer a gentle touch, embrace, light massage, or some reassurance. This can convey a message that reduces pain and makes mom—and you-- feel better.Touch or massage lightly an areas she may have pain. You can lightly or firmly stroke, kneed, or apply deep pressure as long the baby’s mom is comfortable.
Provide reassurance as much as you can. A simple, “You’re doing great,” or, “I know you’re in pain, but you’ve got this,” can do a lot to help her push through the pain of labor.

, Doctors, midwives, and doulas are available during birth to ensure that mom and baby are doing well. But you also have a significant role in ensuring their wellbeing and communicating any of the mom’s wishes. There may also be cases when she can’t give her wishes, so you would need to step up and communicate them for her.Remind anyone attending the birth about the birth plan. You can reinforce this by saying things such as, “I know you think forceps are necessary, but we discussed this earlier today, and she is very opposed to a forceps delivery,” or, “She really doesn’t want any pain medication unless there is a medical necessity.”
Make the best decision you can in case of emergency. For example, an episiotomy may be the safest procedure to deliver the baby, even if mom doesn’t want it. If she is not able to communicate, make the decision that she would want in this type of situation. If she is able to communicate, gently explain to her that your goal is to keep her and your baby healthy and this is the safest decision towards that goal.

, Birth is a very physical process that may make some men uncomfortable. Part of providing the best support is that you are also comfortable. Only participate in the birth in ways that make you comfortable. Explain any of your concerns about blood, fainting, or cutting the umbilical cord, which can help you relax and provide the best support for your baby and its mother.Remember that there are no rules about how you participate. You can choose to catch the baby once it is born, cut the umbilical cord, or watch the actual delivery if you wish. You might even choose to not be in the delivery room because you are so nervous. If this happens, make sure your baby’s mom has someone who can support her through the birth process.

Personal relationships
Finances
Living situations
Lifestyle

, The concept of labor, delivery and a new baby may cause fear and anxiety because they involve things you can’t necessarily control. You may ask yourself questions like “Am I able to provide support during and after the birth?” or “What happens if I pass out?” You are not alone in having these feelings and it’s important that you recognize these are completely normal concerns.Avoid bottling up any fears and concerns you might have. Talk with the baby’s mother, family members, friends, and doctors any questions you have about preparing for your baby.
Remember that having a baby can really change your life and your relationship. Keeping in mind things such as the biological inclination for mothers to nurture a baby can help you prepare for the baby., Even if you are not together with the baby’s mother, a baby is likely to thrive when its parents have a positive and/ or healthy relationship. Maintaining a strong and healthy relationship throughout pregnancy can prepare and help you be as supportive as possible during birth and beyond.Discuss anything related to pregnancy, delivery, your baby and your relationship with the mom. You may not agree on everything, but finding compromises can help you better prepare for the birth of your baby.

Talking about how you can help her may reduce your fears and also promote a healthy relationship.Ask if you can attend doctor’s visits and about your role during the baby’s birth and beyond.

, Babies cost a lot and need large amounts of your time and attention. Discussing your finances and how you’ll tackle the considerable workload can prevent miscommunication.See how you can reduce the overall workload. This may include figuring out how to do household work with a newborn or who will pay for basic expenses.
Keep an open dialogue about career plans, such as when and if mom wants to return to work. Talk about childcare, who and how you will pay for it. You may want to meet with a financial counselor to develop a budget that works for everyone.

, Your baby is a new family member, which can cause the dynamic in your home and other relationships to change considerably.Let your family and friends know that you are expecting a new baby to help them get ready for any changes and offer you support.Send out pregnancy announcements if you like.

, Just as a new baby can change your interpersonal relationships, it also creates new dynamics with your other children.Letting your other children know about the new baby can help them understand the changes they may experience.Let other children know in person so that you can answer any questions or fears they may have. Give siblings an idea of what to expect at a level they can understand. For example, “The new baby will sleep, eat, and cry a lot. She won’t be able to play right away, but you can help me change diapers and feed her.Recognize that smaller siblings may not understand the concept of a new baby. Put it in terms they understand such as, “We’ll have a new baby when the Easter bunny visits us.”"

Hold your baby
Bathe your baby
Dress your baby
Swaddle your baby
Feed and burp your baby
Clean an umbilical cord
Care for a circumcision
Clear nasal passages
Recognize health concerns
Soothe your baby, No matter where you live, your baby needs somewhere to sleep. You’ll also need some space to store baby supplies including bottles, diapers and clothing.Keep in mind that any space will work. Babies don’t need much space in during their first few months. You can use a separate room or decorate one specific corner or area of a room for the baby.Decorate with non-toxic paint, wall decals or other features you’d like to use.
Measure the space so that it fits the baby’s bassinet, crib, or basket.
Set aside an area in your kitchen for bottles and formula.

, Every baby needs certain items at home for health and wellbeing. Purchasing these items before the birth can be a nice way to reduce stress and welcome your new baby home.Get the following items for your baby:


Federally-approved car seat
Crib, bassinet, or cradle with slats that are no more than 2 3/8 inches apart
Bedding
Bottles, nipples, and bottle cleaners
Changing table or non-slip pad
Diapers
Diaper pail for dirty diapers
Receiving blanket(s)
Clothing including onesies
Washcloths and baby wipes.Baby wash and shampoo

, Most facilities will not let you leave if you do not know how to use a federally-approved car seat.In the weeks before the birth, practice placing the removing the seat from your car. This can prevent any delays in going home and assure you that your baby is safe in the car.Use the LATCH technique when installing the seat. LATCH stands for “lower anchors and tethers for children.” It means attaching the seat’s anchors and tethers to the metal latches or hooks in the back of your car.Consult the car seat’s instruction manual before installing it.Make sure the car seat faces backwards., Babies have very sensitive skin. Before your baby comes home, wash any items such as clothing or bedding that may come in contact with baby’s skin.Wash items in a gentle, baby-friendly detergent that has no dyes or scents that can irritate delicate skin.Don’t use fabric softener or dryer sheets because they can irritate a baby’s skin.

, Your baby may not start cruising your home for a few months, but will grow quickly and become increasingly curious. Secure anything that could harm your baby before the baby becomes mobile to avoid potential accidents. This includes sharp corners or electrical outlets.


Keep in mind that no electrical device is completely babyproof.Install safety latches and locks on cabinets and drawers. This can keep babies from harmful items including poisons, medications, and sharp objects.
Use safety gates in areas where your child could encounter dangers, such as the stairs.
Put covers on doorknobs and locks on doors to any areas that you don’t want your baby to access.
Use anti-scalding devices on faucets and showerheads. Consider setting the water temperature to 120 degrees to prevent burns.
Install window guards and safety netting to prevent falls from windows or balconies.
Make sure smoke detectors are working properly.

Know when to contact a doctor.",How to Perform Fetal Kick Counts," The fetal kick count is the count of any movements that the unborn baby makes such as jabs, punches, rolls, twists and turns. However, fetal kick counts do not include hiccups. If the fetal kick count is not normal, then this could be a sign of fetal distress.


Keep in mind that even if the baby’s movements are decreased, you may still go on to have a healthy baby.
Fetal kick counts can also help you learn your baby's sleeping and waking cycles, and it is an excellent way for you to bond with your baby before he/she is born.;
, Doctors recommend that pregnant women should begin to start counting “kicks” during their third trimester, usually around 28 weeks. The baby usually becomes noticeably active between 18 and 25 weeks into the pregnancy.If this is your first pregnancy, you will not notice the baby kicking until you are closer to 25 weeks.The baby will be moving, but you will not feel it.
For second or third time mothers, babies usually begin to start kicking around 18 weeks. For high risk pregnancies, doctors recommend that the mother begins documenting fetal kick counts at 26 weeks., At first, it is difficult to distinguish gas and stomach discomfort from the fetal kicks. However, a healthy baby should soon establish a pattern of movements, becoming active during some parts of the day and resting during others. These patterns will soon become recognizable to the mother.In the third trimester, the baby begins to demonstrate waking and sleeping cycles. When awake, the baby should kick frequently (at least 10 times in two hours). When sleeping, the baby will be still. You should be able to identify patterns of when the baby is asleep and awake from feeling the kicks., Once you have identified fetal kick patterns, monitor them closely. You should perform a fetal kick count once a day after 28 weeks of pregnancy as a way to monitor your baby’s health.Remember to always track your kick counts in a journal or notebook. For more on this process, see part 2.

, If your baby doesn’t kick the first time you perform a fetal kick count, then you may want to call your doctor to have a checkup and make sure everything is okay. While your baby will establish a pattern of movement in the womb, these patterns are not set in stone and are subject to changes on a day-to-day basis.You can also try to coax some movement out of your baby by eating a meal or drinking something sugary, like a cup of juice., If a discernible pattern does not begin between the 28th and 29th weeks of your pregnancy, you should immediately schedule an appointment with your doctor or OBGYN. Also, if a pattern emerges after 28 weeks, but then suddenly ceases or changes drastically, you will want to call a medical professional as soon as possible to identify any problems or issues with your pregnancy.The baby may not be kicking for a number of reasons. However, the following medical concerns could be related to a lack of kicking:


The baby is not getting enough oxygen.
The baby could have shifted to an awkward position, such as into a breech (sideways) position. Changes in position are normal and they may result in decreased fetal movements.
The baby has died in the womb.

, This is important to have so that you can record the time it takes the baby to move. It is a good idea to keep a record of all the movements of your baby in one notebook or binder that has the charts in it, to make it easily accessible., Each baby has a time when it is most active, such as after you have eaten a meal, drank a beverage that contained sugar, after being very active, or just during certain times of the day. When you have figured out when your baby is the most active, use that time to chart the fetal kick counts.In most pregnancies, babies will be the most active between 9pm and 1am, as this is a time when mothers are relaxed enough to notice their baby’s movements.

, Find a position that is comfortable for you in which you can relax and still feel your baby's movements pretty well. Keep in mind that you still need to be able to write while in this position.


The ideal position is to lay on your side, with your head propped up comfortably with a pillow. This should help you feel the kicks more firmly.
You can also rest in a recliner with your feet in the air. Not only is this position comfortable, but you will still be able to feel your baby's kicks.
Before you start counting the kicks, write down what week of pregnancy you are in, the day, as well as the starting time of the kicks., Every time the baby makes any movement, make a check mark in your notepad or chart.You should count only up to ten kicks, and note how long it took for you to feel the baby move ten times.Write down the time of the first movement, and the time of the tenth or last movement., The baby should have moved at least ten times within two hours. Below you will find an example of how to note the fetal kicks in your journal.WEEK 29
Sunday, 9/27, 9:00pm, XXXXXXXXXX, 11:00pm, 2 hrs
Monday, 9/28, 9:15pm, XXXXXXXXXX, 10:45pm, 1 hr 30 mins
Tuesday, 9/29, 9:00pm, XXXXXXXXXX, 11:45pm, 1 hr 45 mins

Thursday, 10/1, 9:00pm, XXXXXXXXXX 10:30pm, 1 hr 30 mins

, If you did not feel the baby move ten times within those two hours, try eating or drinking something to see if it gets the baby to move.You may try tracking the movements at a later time if the baby doesn’t seem to be very active.

, If, after eating, drinking, or monitoring fetal activity at a later time, the baby still doesn't move at least ten times, you should contact your health care provider immediately."

For this reason, it's essential that you make regular pre-natal appointments and attend all of them.


Your initial visit will include a comprehensive assessment of your health history, medical history, nutritional history, and more. Successive visits will also include a physical exam, laboratory tests, and an ultrasound exam.
During your prenatal check-up, you should ask questions regarding any concerns you might have about possible complications, immunizations, and other ways to maintain a healthy pregnancy.;
, During your prenatal checks, your health care provider may order a series of tests to find out your health status.


Pelvic examinations and cervical or vaginal smears may also be ordered to determine the presence of any issues or infections.
Do not hesitate to ask your health care provider for more details about any tests. Your health care provider is responsible for explaining the procedure and the purpose of the test, and to let you know about the results of the test.

, Many of the causes of bleeding and other maternal complications are because of an unhealthy lifestyle. Therefore, the obvious solution is to modify your lifestyle according to your pregnancy needs. For some, lifestyle changes are not quite easy, but just think about how both you and your baby will benefit.

, Pregnancy is not an excuse for physical inactivity (unless contraindicated by your health care provider due to health reasons). A pregnant woman may still exercise during pregnancy but with lower intensity and duration.


Exercise improves blood circulation, contributes to stress reduction, enhances self-esteem, and improves the over-all health of a pregnant woman. The exercises you may consider include swimming, walking, or stretching. These exercises are known to be non-weight bearing activities. They are less strenuous and very convenient for pregnant women to engage in.
Exercise at least three times in a week for 30 minutes, then rest for 10 minutes after exercise by lying on your side. This removes pressure on a major vein in your abdomen that carries blood supply to your heart.

, Towards the end of your pregnancy, you may experience increased respiratory effort and decreased cardiac reserve. This can lead to physiologic stress. To avoid this, you should not engage in strenuous exercise during the advanced stages of pregnancy.


Stop exercising immediately if you feel any shortness of breath, dizziness, numbness, tingling, pain of any kind, more than four uterine contractions per hour, decreased fetal activity, or vaginal bleeding. Consult your health care provider immediately.

, Nutrition is a major factor that can contribute to a successful pregnancy. Ask your health care provider or a nutritionist to come up with a diet plan that provides you with the right balance of nutrients, vitamins and minerals that you need for your pregnancy.


You may also check the recommended daily dietary allowances or the recommended daily intakes of selected nutrients during pregnancy on the internet or in books on pregnancy.
Reading such informative materials will help you to understand the role of nutrition during pregnancy and the recommended food sources.

, Pregnancy itself can be very stressful, as you are going through a lot of physical changes and discomforts. Unfortunately, stress is bad for the baby and can contribute to bleeding and other issues.


Therefore, it's important to minimize outside sources of stress and to try to stay as calm as possible.
Resting and relaxing are encouraged during pregnancy. One technique that can be very effective in getting yourself to relax is conscious relaxation.

, Conscious relaxation is the process of releasing tension from the mind and body though deliberate effort and practice.


Preparation: Loosen clothing; assume a comfortable sitting or side-lying position with all parts of the body well-supported by pillows. The use of soothing music is optional.
Beginning: Allow yourself to feel warm and comfortable. Inhale and exhale slowly, and imagine a sense of peaceful relaxation coming over each part of your body, starting with the neck and working your way down to the toes.
Maintenance: Use imagery to maintain the state of relaxation.
Awakening: Return to the wakeful state gradually
Practice conscious relaxation for 10-15 minutes each day and you will feel refreshed and invigorated.

, Drinking alcohol is associated with high rates of miscarriage. Cigarette smoking is also associated with increased frequency of abruption placenta, placenta previa, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm labor. , For obvious reasons, these elements are harmful for the fetus and for the mother as well. These substances have the potential to cross the placental barrier which protect the baby.


Check with your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medications. Some medications contain ingredients that could be harmful to your pregnancy. Also remember to read the labels for the ingredients and proper use of certain medications and products.
If you are working in a hazardous environmental workplace (e.g. Radiologic department, laboratories and factories especially dealing with different kinds of chemicals), consider changing of job assignment or workplace.

, Sex is usually safe as long as it feels comfortable. However, there are certain conditions under which it is not safe to have sexual intercourse.


Abstain from sex if you if you have history of premature dilation of the cervix and abnormal vaginal bleeding.
Report to your health care provider if you are experiencing vaginal bleeding and/or uterine cramping during intercourse.

, Physical abuse is harmful for both mother and baby. Maternal battering increases the risk of maternal complication, bleeding, infections, and other harmful condition.


Therefore, it is highly important that you report any form of physical abuse to your health care provider or to recognized authorities.
This is never an easy step, especially for women who value their relationships with their partners.

, Bleeding means different things throughout pregnancy. If you are bleeding heavily and have severe abdominal pain and menstrual-like cramps or feel like you are going to faint during first trimester, it could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the uterus, and can be life-threatening. Heavy bleeding with cramping could also be a sign of miscarriage in first or early second trimester. These are the terms used to describe the approximate amount of vaginal bleeding:


Heavy vaginal bleeding: greater than the heaviest normal menstrual flow.
Moderate vaginal bleeding: equal to heaviest menstrual flow.
Light vaginal bleeding: less than the heaviest menstrual flow.

, It's very common for women to have some nausea when pregnant. However, if this nausea becomes severe, it may be a sign of something more serious.


If you can’t eat or drink anything, you run the risk of becoming dehydrated. Being malnourished and dehydrated can harm the baby.
If the you experiences severe nausea, it's important to tell your health care provider. The doctor may prescribe medication or advise you to change your diet.

, A doctor will usually ask you to lie your side to see if this gets the baby moving. Counting kicks can also help.


As a general rule, you should feel 10 or more kicks in two hours. Anything less should prompt a phone call to your doctor.
The doctor has monitoring equipment that can be used to determine if the baby is moving and growing appropriately.

, Symptoms such as a persistent, severe headache, abdominal pain, visual disturbances, and swelling during your third trimester could be a sign of preeclampsia.


Preeclampsia is a serious condition that develops during pregnancy and is potentially fatal. The disorder is marked by high blood pressure and excess protein in the the urine, typically occurring after the 20th week of pregnancy.
If you suspect preeclampsia, you should call your doctor right away and get your blood pressure tested. Good prenatal care can help catch preeclampsia early.

, If you see any tissue protruding from your vagina, do not pull it out; you must go immediately to a physician to get it checked out. You might be experiencing a miscarriage.


Though traumatizing, a miscarriage is often followed by a healthy pregnancy; there are very rare cases in which a women has repeated miscarriages.

, Try to wear a sanitary pad in order to see approximately how much bleeding there is. It is extremely important to pay attention and look for clots in the blood (clots could be an indication of internal hemorrhage or another clotting disorder) and to take note of the color of the blood (you need to see if it is a lighter red or a darker one.

, If you have vaginal bleeding, it is best to lay down for two reasons: first of all, to avoid dizziness and second of all, if you lay down, you minimize the rapidness of the blood loss. Most of the time, the treatment for bleeding is rest. The doctor or midwife may also advise a pregnant woman to take time off work and stay off her feet.

, If you are bleeding (even minimally) do not have sexual intercourse for at least a few days after the bleeding has stopped, unless you are told otherwise by your gynecologist. This measure is meant to protect you against physical trauma that could lead to another bleed.


Do not use tampons. Do not use tampons to control the bleeding, use pads instead. This is important as tampons can irritate the vaginal orifice or the cervix, possibly leading to further bleeding.

, Do not engage in any physical activity after you have experienced a bleed, as this could lead to greater blood loss. Remember that you are supposed to get as much rest as possible following a bleed during pregnancy.

, Clearing your vagina this way could affect the equilibrium of the bacterial flora present in the vagina. By altering this equilibrium, you could make the vagina more susceptible to other infections which could affect your pregnancy.

, You might experience some spotting in the early stages of pregnancy, but this occurs in many women. This spotting is due to implantation and it usually occurs within 12 days from the fertilization.


Implantation means that the fertilized egg it has attached itself and penetrated into the uterine mucosa, preparing for further development.
Besides implantation bleeding (in many cases harmless), there might be some other diseases that can generate vaginal bleeding during this stage of pregnancy. Therefore, it's important to make your doctor aware of any bleeding and to undergo testing if necessary.

, Bleeding during pregnancy can be a sign of miscarriage. However, it is very important to know that not all women who have vaginal bleeding are suffering a miscarriage, so if you are experiencing this type of bleeding do not panic - just call your doctor.


It's important to be aware that a miscarriage also has other symptoms such as abdominal cramps (these can be very severe, having more intensity than normal abdominal cramps that many pregnant women experience sometimes) and you might see foreign tissue passing through your vagina.
If this is the case, you should immediately go to the hospital.

, Another medical condition that might lead to vaginal bleeding (also associated with internal hemorrhage) is ectopic pregnancy. This means that implantation has not occurred in the normal place (the uterine cavity) but in the fallopian tubes.


After the implantation, the embryo grows and develops until the fallopian tube cannot support anymore. The ectopic tissue then ruptures, leading to a potentially lethal hemorrhage. This condition is much rarer than miscarriage.
The main symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include severe pain in the lower abdomen (caused by the rupture of the fallopian tubes), low blood pressure (caused by the loss of blood through the fallopian tube rupture ), tachycardia (also caused by the loss of blood, as the heart needs to pump faster because it has a smaller quantity of blood to work with).

, Another potential cause of vaginal bleeding is molar pregnancy – this is when abnormal tissue grows inside the uterine cavity instead of a fetus. This occurs as a result of a genetic abnormality.


Other signs of this condition (besides bleeding) would be a rapidly growing uterus (because the abnormal tissue grows much faster than a normal baby) or excessive nausea and vomiting.
Another possible symptom is the presence of a foreign tissue protruding through the vagina, which looks like a bunch of grapes.

, Any vaginal infection due to unprotected sex can lead to vaginal bleeding during the first trimester. One of the most common vaginal infections is gonorrhea.


Vaginal infections can cause bleeding as they lead to inflammation and blood vessel dilation, which makes the blood vessels more susceptible to rupture.

, Because the fetus is more developed in this stage, any vaginal bleeding could mean that he or the mother are in danger. There are some medical conditions that are associated with bleeding during this late stage of development, one of them being placenta previa.


This medical condition does not occur very often but it can generate a troublesome pregnancy. In placenta previa, the placenta (the anatomical structure that connects the fetus to the mother) is abnormally located, lower than usual, blocking the uterine cervix.
A bleeding placenta previa does not cause pain, thus making it harder to diagnose on time; so if you have vaginal bleeding — even if it is not associated with pain — you should get it checked out.

, Placental abruption is a very serious condition that endangers both the mother and the baby.


This rare medical condition is caused by the disruption of the placenta from the uterine wall, causing hemorrhage due to the blood vessels rupturing.
Other signs of placental abruption include lower abdomen and back pain,and blood clots through the vagina.

, Another cause of vaginal bleeding is preterm labor. This occurs before the 37th week of pregnancy and requires immediate medical assistance.


You might experience some mucous-like vaginal discharge, sometimes associated with blood. This occurs when the mucous plug that normally covers the uterine cervix opening is expulsed.
Contractions are also present, as is lower abdominal and back pain.

Look for music that is soothing, rather than too loud or aggressive.,
Find music the mother also likes.,
Get advice from an associate at a music store or on blogs.,
Play music for your baby on stereo speakers rather than using headphones on the mother’s pregnant stomach.,
Be aware of the volume of the music.,
Expose your baby to 5-10 minutes of music twice a day, or a maximum of 1 hour a day.,
Play music for your baby to make the womb a soothing, relaxing place.,
Expose your baby to music to help with their brain development.,
Keep in mind there is no scientific evidence to suggest listening to classical music in the womb can make your baby smarter.,
Remember that the music will also reduce stress on the mother, which in turn will also reduce stress for the unborn baby.",How to Play Music for a Baby in the Womb," Classical music is ideal, as babies in the womb will appreciate the calming sounds and may begin to breathe in time to the music.Look for classical options like music by Beethoven, Mozart, or Bach, but be aware that certain compositions can have loud passages.
In fact, Mozart's music is said to affect the brain development of its listeners, in particular spatial memory. The center for music activities in the brain is in the right hemisphere of the brain, which also includes the center for spatial relationships among objects.So it is possible that development of one part of the brain could affect the development of another part in the same area of the brain.;
, If the baby’s mom does not enjoy classical music, for example, then it will not have a beneficial effect on the baby in her belly.


You can try alternatives to classical music like lullabies and new age music. Popular CDs include Baby Einstein, Disney Lullabies, and Dreamland lullabies.You can also try other musical styles that are not too noisy and loud, such as slow r&b, reggae, and pop tracks.Record sounds of nature, water, and waves can also be soothing for a baby in the womb.Look for music that is harmonious and has a basic melody. Dramatic changes in rhythm , tempo and volume of the music can disturb the baby and can cause the baby to be startled., If you aren’t sure what is appropriate for a baby in the womb, ask for help at your local music store.


You can also go online and search for soothing music intended for babies on blogs.

, Contrary to popular belief, putting headphones on a pregnant stomach isn’t necessary; in fact, it can make the music too loud for the babyand overstimulate him.Instead, playing music in your house will filter into the womb.

, The amniotic fluid in the womb will amplify the sound and make things much louder to the baby than they might sound to the parents.Aim to keep music around 50-60 decibels, or about the level of a washing machine to make it comfortable for the baby.To put it in perspective, 60 decibels is the noise level of a normal conversation, 30 decibels is a whisper, so 50 decibels is a good in between level of noise.
The American Association of Pediatricians has found that babies exposed to loud music for a long period time are more likely to be born prematurely and have other negative side effects like low birth weight and hearing deficiencies., Do not go overboard with the amount of time you play music for your baby in the womb. Too much exposure to music may over-stimulate the baby., Though the womb is naturally relaxing environment for your baby, it is also loud with the sounds of amniotic fluid, the mother’s heartbeat, and other outside noises, so calming music will help your baby relax even further.

, Studies have shown that babies who hear the same song, such as a lullaby, multiple times while in the womb will recognize the song once they are born.Singing lullabies or other children’s songs to your baby while in the womb can strengthen their relationship with their parents and help the baby recognize your voices once they are born., Playing classical music for the baby also does not mean they will enjoy classical music once they are born.Numerous studies have focused on the study of influence music on the baby in the womb but it's difficult to know exactly what a baby in the womb thinks and feels. But if playing music for them is done with care and at the right volume, it certainly cannot hurt.

, Any increases in stress in the mother means an increase in cortisol, which travels through the mother’s bloodstream and into the placenta around the baby. In fact, stress during pregnancy can lead to serious consequences like premature birth, low weight in the baby and a greater chance of miscarriages.Music, especially if it suits the mother’s tastes, can reduce stress and stimulate beneficial emotions that lead to a release of serotonin and endorphins in the mother, which will also put the baby in a good mood, too."

Consider the seasons during which you will be pregnant.,
Purchase a maternity bra.,
Select a belly band in a neutral color.",How to Plan a Maternity Wardrobe1," The seasons into which your pregnancy fall (especially in the later months) will dictate the kind of clothing you should focus on. For winter, several pairs of long maternity pants are crucial. A summer maternity wardrobe, however, may contain no long pants, focusing instead of skirts and short-sleeved blouses.;
, One piece of clothing that you will certainly need to buy during a pregnancy is a maternity bra (or at least a bra in a bigger size). You may need to invest in a maternity bra as early as your first trimester.


To ensure a good fit, go to a lingerie store or department store and have yourself professionally fitted for the new bra. A good fit will help prevent unnecessary aches and pains in your back.
Look for a maternity bra in a comfortable, natural fabric like cotton. This will make the bra more comfortable on your potentially itchy skin, and will also ensure easy laundering - which is a big benefit once your baby has arrived and requires much of your energy.

, A belly band is a simple, stretchy piece of clothing that covers the gap between your pants and the bottom of your shirt. A belly band will keep you from exposing your midriff as your shirts ride higher and higher on your growing belly. Purchasing 1 or 2 in white, black, or other neutral colors will allow you to coordinate them with your entire existing wardrobe.

Find a pair of comfortable work shoes.,
Choose bottoms in versatile, basic colors.,
Select maternity tops for your work wardrobe.",How to Plan a Maternity Wardrobe2," Late in your pregnancy, your feet are likely to swell up a bit (often necessitating a larger shoe size). Your balance can also suffer, and the extra body weight can easily lead to aches in your feet, legs, and back. Even if you cannot wear sneakers to work, you should try to find a pair of work-appropriate shoes with adequate support. Avoid high heels, as these can further impair your balance.

, Work-appropriate maternity bottoms often include trousers and skirts. A few pairs of maternity trousers or skirts in neutral colors like gray, black, and brown will provide an adequate foundation for your maternity work wardrobe. These bottoms can even be dressed down by pairing them with a casual top, which will allow you to stretch their usage into your everyday engagements.

, If you typically wear cardigans, jackets, or other layered pieces as part of your work wardrobe, you may be able to fit into these even late into your pregnancy. You may need to purchase a few maternity shirts and blouses, and buying basic tops will allow you to dress them up or down for work or casual engagements, respectively.

Invest in some casual, comfortable shoes.,
Choose light, breathable fabrics for everyday wear.",How to Plan a Maternity Wardrobe3," For everyday wear, you may want to treat yourself to a new pair of highly supportive tennis shoes. Structured, supportive shoes will go a long way in reducing potential back pain. You should also look for shoes with no-slip soles for extra balance.

, A pregnancy can cause your body temperature to rise above its usual level; in addition, your quickly stretching skin can generate itches and the extra body weight can increase your sweating. For these reasons, stick to natural fibers like cotton for everyday use, and dress in layers to achieve warmth in cool weather. Synthetic fibers can irritate itchy skin and trap in sweat.

Learn what it means to abstinent.,
Engage only in outercourse.,
Talk to your partner about the advantages and disadvantages of abstinence.,
Find a partner that respects your choice to be abstinent.",How to Not Get Pregnant1," Abstinence is a method used by many people to prevent pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.It can be practiced in a variety of ways for many reasons. No one definition is the right one, but the overarching theme and purpose for abstinence is to prevent pregnancies and STDs.


Outercourse is a form of abstinence where people abstain or avoid vaginal sexual intercourse. This means all other forms of sexual intercourse or play can be practiced.
Abstinence can also be defined by not engaging in any sexual activities with a partner.;
, Keeping sperm from reaching the vagina is an effective way to prevent pregnancies. Instead of engaging in sexual intercourse that includes vaginal penetration by the penis, try:Kissing
Masturbating
Fondling
Rubbing
Acting out sexual fantasies
Using sex toys
Oral sex
Anal sex

, Many people find it difficult, but when it comes to preventing pregnancy it is the cheapest and most effective way not to have a baby. It also has no medical or hormonal side effects compared to other methods that help prevent pregnancies.


The benefits of practicing abstinence can go beyond preventing unintended pregnancies. Abstinence can be practiced until you're ready to have sex or until you have found the right partner to have sex with. It can be a way for you to be in a romantic relationship without being sexually active. Or it can serve to symbolize a moral or religious choice.
The disadvantages to abstinence come from people who find it hard to abstain from sex and who jump into sex without properly educating themselves or protecting themselves against pregnancies and STDs.

, It can be difficult to be in or continue to be in a relationship with someone who does not believe in being abstinent. It's best to speak to your partner about your choice and explain to them what abstinence is and why you have chosen to practice it.


Talk to your partner before things get sexual. It's always helpful and important to communicate with your partner what you expect from a relationship and what boundaries you may or may not have. Determining what is allowed or appropriate within your relationship can help clarify and prevent misunderstandings when you engage in any sexual activity.
Being abstinent is not forever unless you want it to be. Your relationship and beliefs can change with time or experience.

Eat a BRAT diet to firm up your stool.,
Eat cheddar cheese to introduce enzymes that solidify stool.,
Avoid foods that are high in fat and sugar.,
Avoid other foods that can irritate your digestive tract.,
Increase your fluid intake to stay hydrated.,
Eat some salt crackers to replenish lost sodium.,
Drink sports drink or oral rehydrating solution to replace lost electrolytes.,
Seek medical help if you have more than 3 loose or watery stools.",How to Naturally Treat Diarrhea During Pregnancy," BRAT stands for Banana, Rice, Apple, and Toast. These foods are effective in treating diarrhea and making your stool firm.


The rice should be brown rice and the toast should come from whole wheat bread.
The fiber found in these foods absorbs water and makes the stool “bulkier” and solid.
Bananas and rice are also great sources of fiber.
Apples contain pectin that helps bulk up stool and treat diarrhea.
Eat something from this diet with every meal to prevent loose or watery stool.
4 to 6 servings per day of this diet will do.;
, Cheese can help solidify stool by introducing rennet, an enzyme found in cheddar cheese that regulates digestion.


¼ serving of cheese per meal will do.
Avoid processed cheese like American cheese and cheese spreads.
Do not eat cheese if you’re lactose intolerant, as this will further aggravate any stomach symptoms you are feeling.

, Foods high in fat and sugar aggravate diarrhea.


Any drink that contains high sugar, like soda, should be avoided for the mean time.
Make sure you avoid ""healthy"" sources of sugar like sweet fruit and juices.
A diet high in sugar stimulates acid secretion, causing irritation to the inflamed gastric and intestinal linings.
Foods high in fat are not easily digested because they are not soluble in water, making them hard for the intestines to absorb and digest.
This can cause stomach upset and exacerbate diarrhea.
Examples of foods you should avoid are: fruit juices, soda, butter, dried fruits, candies, ice cream, meat, and processed foods.

, Some foods are gastric irritants, and can inflame your digestive tract and worsen gastrointestinal problems.


These categories include: spicy foods, caffeinated foods, and dairy products.
Examples of foods you should avoid are: chili peppers, spices, coffee, tea, soda, milk, butter, and yogurt.

, Since diarrhea takes a lot of water away form your body, you should replace it right away to stay hydrated.


Fluid intake should be increased by 1L per hour for 1 to 2 hours, until symptoms resolve.
This will help you prevent dehydration.

, Eating salt crackers that are high in sodium can help replenish the sodium and electrolytes that you lost during diarrhea.


Eating small bites of salt crackers every 2 to 3 hours can help.
Having a small amount of food can also help you feel stronger by giving your body energy and calories.

, ORS, and sports drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade, contain sodium and electrolytes that your body may have lost during diarrhea.


This does not cure diarrhea, however it can help treat and prevent the dehydration caused by diarrhea.
Sports drinks contain potassium, sodium, chloride, and glucose, all of which are important nutrients to replenish when you are suffering from diarrhea.
Drinking 500ml to 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of Gatorade per day will help.
For ORS, specific instructions will be given on the back of the label.

, Dehydration must not be ignored, because it is especially dangerous for pregnant women.


3 or more loose and watery stools indicate that your diarrhea is not improving.
You should immediately notify your doctor to receive a prescription anti-diarrheal.
This will prevent you from becoming dehydrated.
Dehydration can be harmful not only to you, but also to your baby in your womb.
Additionally, if you experience any of these symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention.

Severe diarrhea (more than 10 loose and watery stools in a 24 hour period).
Black stool or presence of blood in stool.
Fever above 37.5 degree Celsius
Extreme dryness of your mouth and eyes.

Make an appointment with your doctor or healthcare practitioner.,
Empty your bladder before measuring.,
Change into a hospital gown.,
Lay on the examination table.,
Lay still and breathe normally as the doctor palpates your uterus.,
Allow the doctor to measure your fundal height.,
Get dressed and discuss your results with your doctor.,
If your fundal height measurement is abnormal, schedule a follow-up.",How to Measure Fundal Height1," Though measuring your fundal height doesn't take long, it does typically require an office visit.


Being at the doctor's office also gives you the added benefit of being able to immediately discuss the results of your fundal height test with your doctor, should anything out of the ordinary be found.;
, Depending on how far along you are in your pregnancy, your doctor may ask you to empty your bladder.


The reason for this is that starting at around the 17-week mark, a full bladder can cause the fundal height measurement to off by a matter of centimeters., Fundal height measurements are fairly precise - a discrepancy of only a centimeter or two can make the difference between a ""normal"" measurement and an ""abnormal one"".


Clothes, belts, and so on can cause small differences in your fundal height, so they are typically removed before measuring. Changing into a hospital gown minimizes the possibility of an inaccurate result and additionally offers your doctor the ability to easily access all areas needed for a good fundal height measurement.

, Your doctor will ask you to lay in a semi-recumbent position (this is simply laying on your back with your head slightly elevated). The semi-recumbent position makes it easy for the doctor to feel for your uterus by palpating the skin near your belly button.

, Before the actual measurement takes place, your doctor or his nurse or midwife will palpate your pregnant uterus to determine the baby's size, the baby's positioning and the baby's presentation.


The doctor, nurse, and/or midwife will also check the volume of amniotic fluid and also attempt to identify the uterine fundus - the point on your stomach where the ""top"" of the uterus can be felt.

, After the palpation, the doctor will hold a metric-based measurement tape at the top of the uterus (or fundus) and stretch it along the top of your pregnant uterus, measuring along the longitudinal axis.


This means that the doctor will measure from the highest point of your uterus to the top of your symphysis pubis (the area located below your belly button where your pubic bone begins). The doctor will record your fundal height measurement in centimeters and enter it on your chart.
As a very general rule, a woman's fundal height should be within 1 to 3 centimeters of the baby's gestational age in weeks. For example, for a woman who's been pregnant for 20 weeks, a fundal height of about 17-23 cm is expected., After giving you a chance to dress, your doctor will come back and talk to you. At this point, if your fundal height measurement was abnormal, you'll probably discuss the possibility of additional tests.

, If your measurements do not fall within the normal parameters for your projected due date, this is not always a reason to worry. However, your doctor will probably want you to follow up with a sonogram in order to find out why your measurement was outside of the normal range of values.


This can be for a variety of reasons - some completely harmless, others that are cause for concern (but by no means catastrophic).
Below are many of the causes for an abnormal fundal height:Being especially tall and thin or short and heavy
Having a full bladder
Having twins, triplets, etc.
Abnormally slow or rapid fetal growth
Too little or too much amniotic fluid
Uterine fibroids
Having a child that has settled into breech or another unusual uterine position

Use condoms when engaging in sexual activity.,
Use spermicide to aid in pregnancy prevention.,
Use a contraceptive sponge.,
Get fitted for a diaphragm.",How to Not Get Pregnant2," When used correctly and consistently, condoms can help prevent pregnancy while still enjoying sex. There are a variety of colours, flavours, and textures available to use. You can buy them at a drugstore or get them for free at health clinics.



Female condoms are also available to be worn. Just like condoms for penises, female condoms collect pre-cum and semen.
When used and applied directly, condoms are 98% effective at preventing pregnancies. It's important you learn how to wear a condom, read the expiration date, and inspect that the condom is in working order.

, Spermicide is a gel, foam, or film that is applied to a condom and works by blocking the entrance of the uterus with a sperm-killing chemical.They can be purchased at drugstores, pharmacies, and retailers or can be found already applied to certain brands and types of condoms.


When used alone, vaginal spermicides are only 78% effective but if combined with a condom, the effectiveness increases to 95% or greater.
Women who use spermicides should lie on their back briefly after engaging in intercourse to ensure the spermicide stays against the cervix.
Spermicide can cause infections in both the vagina and penis and cause irritation to develop. Consult your health care provider if irritation or discomfort arises after using spermicide.

, The contraceptive sponge is a small, donut-shaped sponge that contains a spermicide and is placed within the vagina and along the cervix. You and your partner should not be able to feel the sponge if it is inserted correctly. The sponge is not as widely available as condoms and spermicides and they are often more expensive. Talk to your pharmacist if you cannot find one. To use a contraceptive sponge:First, wet the sponge with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of water to activate the spermicide. Squeeze out the excess water.
Insert the sponge into the vagina by sliding the sponge along the back wall until the reaches the cervix. The dimpled or concave side should face your cervix and the loop should face away for easy removal afterwards.
Leave the sponge in for a total of 24 hours. You should leave it in for at least 6 hours after you have vaginal intercourse.
Take out the sponge by washing your hands and taking a hold of the loop and then pulling it out of the vagina carefully. Make sure the sponge is in one piece after you have removed it.

, A diaphragm works similarly like a contraceptive sponge. Instead, the diaphragm is made of rubber with a flexible rim. Unlike the contraceptive sponge, diaphragms come in different sizes. Your doctor will measure your pelvis and order a diaphragm that you can insert before any sexual activity to prevent pregnancy. You can remove the diaphragm 6 hours after intercourse or after a 24 hour period.


Diaphragms do not protect you from all STIs. It can protect you from gonorrhea and chlamydia but does not protect you from HIV or herpes."

Use an emergency contraceptive if your primary method of birth control does not work.",How to Not Get Pregnant3," Birth control pills work by either keeping eggs from leaving the ovaries or making cervical mucus thicker which keeps sperm from travelling to the eggs. There are several different brands your health care provider can recommend one that is best for your health and sexual activity.


Discuss side effects and risks associated with any birth control you are prescribed. For example, women over 35 who smoke are more susceptible to blood clots when they take birth control pills.
Birth control pills require you to diligently take the medication at the same time, every day. A missed dose could potentially increase the likelihood of pregnancies if sex is engaged in the period it is missed.

, The birth control shot, or Depo-Provera, is an injection of synthetic hormones that protects you from pregnancy. You will need to get a shot every 12 weeks.


Depo-Provera releases a hormone called progestin which prevents the body from releasing eggs into the uterus and thickening the cervix mucus wall to prevent sperm from travelling.
Always discuss health risks and side effects whenever you decide to take birth control.

, Dubbed as the Morning-After Pill, emergency contraceptives work by preventing eggs from being released from the ovary for longer than usual. This ensures that any rogue sperm dies off or is expelled from your body. It can take up to 6 days for someone to become pregnant. Emergency contraception cannot be used as a regular way to prevent pregnancy.


Purchase emergency contraception in pill form over the counter at a pharmacy. If you are 17 years or older, you can get it without a prescription at your local walk-in clinic.
Take the pill as directed. Some contraceptives come in a 1 pill dose, and others have 2 pills.

Ensure sterilization is the right choice for you.,
Try non-surgical sterilization methods.,
Undergo a surgical sterilization.",How to Not Get Pregnant4," Make sure you do not ever want to get pregnant before choosing a surgical form of birth control. You should not undergo surgery to prevent getting pregnant if you might want to have more children one day in the future.


Many people sterilize because they do not want to put their health at risk, or would not like to pass on a certain disease or genetic mutation to their offspring or children.
Sterilization is a serious matter that affects not only you and your body, but also those around you. If you have a partner or family, it's important to discuss with them the decision to go ahead and sterilize. Of course, in the end, it is your body and you should be able to do what you want with it.

, Essure is a permanent birth control procedure that creates a natural barrier against pregnancy. This procedure can be performed in a doctor's office in less than 10 minutes. A device will be inserted into each fallopian tube so that scar tissue forms, blocking the fallopian tube and preventing the sperm and egg from coming together.


You will need to use an additional method of birth control for 3 months after the procedure. It takes about 90 days for the scar tissue to develop in your fallopian tube and for the procedure to take effect.
This procedure is permanent and cannot be reversed.

, Commonly called a tubal ligation or getting the ""tubes tied,"" a woman's fallopian tubes can be surgically tied, cut or sealed.


Males can have a vasectomy to ensure pregnancy is prevented. A vasectomy works by cutting off the vasa deferentia or tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis shaft. The sperm is absorbed by the body instead of travelling out.

Avoid salt and high-sodium foods.,
Eat more whole grains.,
Add potassium-rich foods to your diet.,
Indulge with dark chocolate.,
Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks.,
Add soy and low-fat milk products to your diet if you have not done so already.",How to Naturally Lower Blood Pressure During Pregnancy2," Although your body requires sodium in small amounts, consuming too much sodium is bad for you and can lead to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. If you suffer from high blood pressure, take steps to reduce your sodium intake:Do not add salt to foods when cooking but use other spices instead (cumin, lemon pepper, fresh herbs).
Rinse canned foods to remove sodium.
Buy foods that are labeled “low sodium” or “sodium free.”
Avoid processed foods, such as crackers, fried items, and baked goods, that often are high in sodium.
Also avoid eating fast food and ask for reduced sodium when ordering in restaurants.

, Whole grains are high in dietary fiber and studies have shown that adding more fiber to your diet may reduce hypertension.Make sure you get at least six to eight servings of whole grains every day.
Switch refined grains to whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat pasta and bread.

, Potassium-rich foods should be a part of your hypertension management diet. Foods you should add include sweet potatoes, tomatoes, kidney beans, orange juice, bananas, peas, potatoes, dried fruits, melon and cantaloupe.Keep your target potassium levels moderate (around 2,000 to 4,000 mg a day)., According to a clinical study, dark chocolate may actually assist in lowering blood pressure.Eat a half an ounce of dark chocolate that has at least 70% of cocoa per day.Because dark chocolate is high in calories, be sure not to overindulge.

, Besides being bad for blood pressure, caffeine and alcohol also have other negative health effects to you and your baby during pregnancy. Thus, you should avoid both, especially if you suffer from high blood pressure.


Drinking caffeine during pregnancy has been linked to declined placental blood flow and a risk of miscarriage. Although more studies are needed to confirm the effects of caffeine, it is best to switch to decaf during your pregnancy.High alcohol consumption is known to raise blood pressure and it is also known to have negative effects on your unborn baby. Before drinking any alcohol, even just one glass of wine, consult your doctor., A clinical study demonstrated that systolic blood pressure can be lowered by adding these foods to your diet.Add low-fat or fat-free dairy products (such as milk, cottage cheese, yogurt) to your diet.
If you are lactose intolerant, try a milk alternative, such as almond, coconut, or hemp milk. You can also try soy milk, but you may want to limit soy products during pregnancy since it may increase estrogen levels in your fetus.Go easy on the amount of cheese you eat (even low-fat) due to their high sodium content.

Wear compression stockings and comfortable footwear.,
Use cold compresses.,
Rest your feet.,
Stand or walk in a pool.",How to Minimize Swelling During Pregnancy1," As swelling often occurs around the feet and ankles, take care in how you treat your feet during pregnancy. Select proper footwear and ask your doctor about compression stockings.


Your healthcare provider may be able to recommend a brand of tight, compression stockings during the day. Such stockings can help reduce swelling and provide needed support to your legs during pregnancy.You should also be careful about what kind of shoes you wear. Tight fitting shoes or heels can restrict blood flow to the feet, making swelling and related pain worse. Stick with comfortable, loose-fitting flats and tennis shoes.;
, Pressing a cold compress to the swollen areas can help reduce swelling and lessen the pain. You can use a cold washcloth, a bag of ice wrapped in a paper towel, or buy an ice pack at the supermarket. Remember, ice and store-bought ice packs should never go directly on the skin. Make sure you wrap it in a cloth or paper towels before use., Resting your feet during pregnancy can also help lessen pain and swelling. Make sure you stay off your feet and know the proper ways to rest your legs after a long day.


Try not to stand for too long. If you have a job that requires you to be on your feet for long hours, talk to your boss about making accommodations during your pregnancy.When you get a chance to sit down, elevate your feet and occasionally roll the ankles. If possible, lie down with your feet elevated., Standing or walking in shallow pool can help compress the tissues in your legs and ankles. For some women, this seems to reduce pain and swelling. If you do not have a pool, consider buying a plastic child's pool from the store and filling it with cool water."

Empty your bladder and remove your clothing.,
Grab a measuring tape.,
Lay on your back.,
Find your pubic bone.,
Find your fundus.,
Measure from your pubic bone to your fundus.,
If your fundal height appears abnormal, contact your doctor.",How to Measure Fundal Height2," It's not difficult at all to measure your fundal height on your own. To begin, empty your bladder and shed your clothing as you would in preparation for a fundal height measurement at the doctor's office. If you'd like, you may choose to put on a loose gown or similar garment (like an over-sized tee shirt) to simulate a hospital gown.


Because most laypeople aren't medically trained in the procedure of measuring fundal heights and because, as noted above, an abnormal fundal height can have a wide variety of causes, it's important to remember not to make any medical decisions based on the results of a self-performed fundal height test. If you obtain an abnormal result, follow up with a trained doctor, nurse, or midwife for confirmation.

, Soft, flexible sewing-style measuring tools work best, as they can conform to the curve of your stomach for a more accurate measurement. However, in a pinch, a ruler or even your fingers can work as a measuring tool. Typically, fundal heights are measured in centimeters, but if all you have are tools that measure in inches, use the conversion factor 1 inch = 2.54 cm.

, Hard surfaces (like the floor) work best - soft surfaces (like some mattresses) can allow your posture to ""sink"" into the surface somewhat. If desired, feel free to place a pillow under your head.

, The symphysis pubis (pubic bone) is a small, ridge-like bone on the front of the body just above the pubic area. Feel for the top of the pubic bone just below the bottom of your stomach - usually, this is near the top of where your pubic hair naturally extends. The pubic bone is often covered by a layer of subcutaneous fat which can make it somewhat tricky to find - you may need to press gently into your skin with your fingers to feel it.

, Next, find your fundus (the ""top"" of your uterus) by feeling near your belly button. Relax your stomach muscles as you gently massage the area above and below your belly button. Feel for a vague ""ridge"" beneath the skin - this is your fundus.


Generally, before the 20th week of pregnancy, the fundus will be below the belly button, while after the 20th week, it will be above it., When you've found both your pubic bone and your fundus, it's time to measure. Hold the ""0"" end of your tape measure against the top of your pubic bone and carefully stretch it across your pubis, up and over the curve of your stomach, and to your fundus. Record this measurement (in cm). Generally, fundal heights should be within 1-4 cm of the baby's gestational age in weeks. For example, a 20 week-old pregnancy should have a fundal height of about 16-24 cm.


If you don't have measuring tape or a ruler handy, use the old, traditional method of using your fingers. The width of one finger in the fundal height is roughly equivalent to one week of gestation time. Thus, for a 15 week-old pregnancy, you should expect roughly 15 finger-widths of fundal height.

, As noted above, there are many, many reasons why a woman's fundal height may not be within the expected 1-4 cm range of the baby's gestational age in weeks. Some of these reasons are harmless, while others are causes for mild concern. If you seem to be obtaining fundal height measurements that are outside of your expected range, contact a doctor for a definitive fundal height measurement and, if necessary, follow-up tests.

Sleep on your side.,
Minimize salt and caffeine intake.,
Drink water.,
Take precautions when traveling.,
Exercise.,
Stay cool.",How to Minimize Swelling During Pregnancy2," When sleeping, shifting your weight to the side can help alleviate symptoms of swelling. Your inferior vena cava is a large vein that helps with blood flow throughout the body. Sleeping on your side can take pressure off this vein. This can help encourage blood flow and prevent swelling. It also might help to elevate your legs slightly when you sleep., Salt and caffeine can encourage swelling during pregnancy. They can also lead to other health issues, like high blood pressure, that could have a negative impact on your overall pregnancy.


Minimize your overall salt intake. This can be achieved fairly easily by avoiding processed food and not adding additional table salt to your meals. Salt can cause water retention and raise blood pressure and elevated blood pressure during pregnancy can lead to a number of health effects for you and your baby.The effect on caffeine in pregnancy is not yet fully understood as many studies are inconclusive or produce conflicting results. However, it is advised pregnant women not consume more than 200 mg of caffeine a day. This is equal to about one 12 ounce cup of coffee. Be aware caffeine is also in teas, chocolates, and some over-the-counter medications. Always read labels to watch for caffeine. If you're experiencing swelling, however, you might want to reduce your caffeine intake further and see if it helps., Water intake can help reduce water retention, which can have a positive effect on reducing swelling overall. If you're pregnant, it's recommended you drink 10 cups, or 2.3 liters, of water each day. Doing so may help with swelling., Sitting too long in a car or airplane can cause discomfort and swelling even if you're not pregnant. The effects are more intense during pregnancy. Try to take frequent breaks when traveling to get up and walk around periodically if you travel during pregnancy., Strive to stay physically active throughout pregnancy to reduce swelling and have a healthy pregnancy overall. Talk to your healthcare provider about what workout routines are safe for you and your baby.


Exercise to the legs is particularly important to reduce swelling. Walking during pregnancy is usually a healthy, safe activity that does not negatively affect most pregnant women.Discuss other activities you might want to engage in with your doctor. Some mild Pilates, yoga, and aerobics might be okay at certain stages of pregnancy depending on your fitness level, overall health, and pregnancy., Warm weather can make swelling during pregnancy worse as it may lead to increased dehydration and water retention. If you live in a warm area, you should make sure you have access to air conditioning during your pregnancy, especially if you're pregnant over the summer months. Stay indoors if it gets too hot or make a trip to the pool or beach."

Accept or refuse alcohol as you wish.",How to Navigate the Holidays During Pregnancy," Your priority when pregnant is caring for yourself and your unborn baby. You may want to celebrate the holidays to the fullest, but may not always feel your best. Developing a general plan on how to tackle the holidays that you can change if need be may give you some comfort and help you more easily navigate the holiday season.Write out a tentative plan based on invitations and things you’d like to do. Make sure to include meals and periods of rest.
Remember that doing what makes you feel best lets you focus on your wellbeing, even if it means disappointing someone.;
, Pregnancy is a great time to allow yourself to focus on what you need. This is especially true if it’s your first baby. After you deliver, children often become the focus of the holidays. Allow yourself to what you want, be it going to parties, staying in to cuddle, or enjoying a massage.Explain to others why you decide to take or decline offers during the holiday season. Most people understand that you may need time to yourself when you’re pregnant. For example, “Hi Diane, thanks so much for your invitation to join you on New Year’s Eve. I think I’m going to stay at home. I’ve been really tired and with my due date getting closer, I’d like to just have a quiet evening at home.”

, The holidays are a time when many people indulge on rich foods, meals, and drinks. Being pregnant makes your appetite bigger and you may be tempted to treat yourself a bit more. Stress can also cause you to eat more. Maintaining a healthy diet with a few treats can keep you and your baby healthy.Eat everything in moderation. Make sure you are getting plenty of vital nutrients at each meal and then allow yourself to have a small treat, such as a cookie or piece of pie., Many people run themselves ragged during the holidays. Take your pregnancy as an opportunity to ask for help when you need it. This can help you not only navigate the holiday season, but also truly enjoy it.Reach out whenever it’s necessary. For example, “Sander, can you please clear the table? I’m a little tired and I can’t reach across the table with my big belly.” You can also send out a message saying, “Hey guys, since we’re expecting this year, we propose having Christmas dinner at a local restaurant. It’ll be easy for everyone with no clean up and plenty of time to enjoy one another.”
Recognize that friends and loved ones want the best for you and are willing to help. Asking someone else to host a holiday meal or gathering or even something as simple as clearing the table can give you much needed “me” time.

, Women generally get dressed up for events during the holiday season. This might include tight dresses and itchy sweaters. In order to make yourself comfortable, which can make getting through the holidays easier, wear clothing that incorporates your expanding belly.Put together a couple of comfy outfits you can wear through the holidays. For example, a festive dress with an empire waist that grazes your belly while highlighting your décolleté is comfortable and beautiful. You can also put on a pair of black stretchy pants with a loose, embellished top and comfortable flats.

, Even if you ask for help, there are still some things you’ll need to do during the holidays. This may include buying and wrapping gifts, decorating, and maybe some baking. Start tackling any tasks you may have early and pace yourself each day as you do them.Focus on one or two manageable tasks at a time or even each day. This can help you do what you need without getting tired or overwhelmed.

, Many women experience fatigue when they’re pregnant. You may find that the rush of the holidays tires you out even more. Take time to sleep whenever you get tired. Getting enough rest may help you navigate and enjoy the holidays with greater ease.Let yourself sleep late, take naps, and go to bed early as you like. Even sitting down more often, such as when you’re shopping, can give you a bit of rest.

, The holidays are a time to enjoy with family and friends. Many pregnant women stay or host at their homes during the holidays. Although this can be fun, it can also tire you. Welcome who understand that you’re pregnant and are willing to help. Host them in a way that makes you comfortable.Recognize that most guests understand that you’re pregnant and need some extra help or “me” time. Feel free to offer pre-prepared meals, say you need a nap, or even not clean in your usual way.

, The holidays can be very stressful even when you’re not pregnant. You probably have friends, family members, or other people who are excited about your pregnancy. You may not want to deal with them during the holidays for reasons such as they are high maintenance or you’ve cut them off. However, declining guests during the holidays can be a very touchy and emotional situation. Focusing on yourself and finding a constructive way to refuse visitors can help you navigate the holidays.Talk to the person if you are on good terms. For example, “Dad, it would be easier if you and mom stayed at the B&B down the street. I’ve been really sick and feeling tired and having guests is just a bit much for me right now.”
Ask a partner, relative, or friend to talk to an unwanted or otherwise high maintenance guest. For example, “Dan, John and Marion want to stay with us over Chanukah. I really like them, but John is such a neat freak that it would be easier for them to stay with other friends. Can you please talk to them about this?”

, Benjamin Franklin once said, “Fish and visitors smell after three days.” Having guests is exhausting for anyone, even if it’s only a short visit one afternoon. Having visitors should be fun and easy for you. If someone visits you and stays longer than you want, tell them it’s time to go. Ways you can politely ask a guest to leave include:”It’s so nice to see you, Willow! I hate to do this, but I’ve been so sick during this pregnancy that my doctor told me I need to rest every couple of hours. I’m happy to visit with you but am going to have to lie down at 12:00.”
”It’s been nice visiting with you, mom, and the cookies are so tasty. I’m not feeling well and going to rest for a while. Why don’t I call you later about dinner tomorrow.”

, You probably have a lot of invitations for holiday parties, gatherings, and other events. You may want to go to all or some of them but are not sure how you’ll feel. Visiting people as you like allows you to come and go as you please and control the situation. It can also help you more easily navigate the holidays as you’re expecting.Excuse yourself whenever you like. You can say, “Oh, that was a burst of heartburn. I’m really sorry, but I left my medicine at home and should really get it to combat this.”
Back out of invitations as you wish. Sending a note or making a phone call to say, “We’d really like to be there tonight, Andie, but I’m feeling big and tired. Let’s schedule dinner or lunch around Christmas instead?”

, You may be in the early days of your pregnancy and not ready to announce it. You may even be showing a bit and not want to say anything because of complications or you not feeling well. Answer questions and discuss your pregnancy only as your are comfortable, even if people show enthusiasm and support.Let anyone to whom you’ve announced your pregnancy know if it is ok to say something to other people or if you prefer to tell people when you’re ready. For example, “Sara, can you please not say anything to anyone at the party about me being pregnant? It’s still so early that I just want to make sure everything is ok before I announce it to everyone.”
Prepare yourself if someone lets the cat out of the bag without your approval. Come up with a generic acknowledgement such as, “Yep, it’s true I’m pregnant. I’ve been so sick that I’m just laying low until I start to feel better.”

, Many women who are pregnant find out that everyone is an expert on pregnancy and childbearing. This can be especially true with family members. If you are around a lot of different family members during the holidays, develop ways to handle relatives with pesky questions and advice. This can help you more easily navigate and enjoy the holidays.Make a list of family who may be invasive about your pregnancy. Think about ways in which you can engage them without offending their sensibilities. For example, say to yourself, “Ok, I know Aunt Laurie is going to ask me to name the baby after my great grandfather. But I hate the name Aloysius. So I’m just going to tell her its on the list we’re considering so she leaves me alone.”
Acknowledge family members’ positions with respect. For example, you may not be married to the baby’s father and have no plans to wed. If your partner’s father makes comments, counter them with, “Sal, I understand that things are different in your culture and generation, but attitudes towards marriage and pregnancy are different in my generation.” You could also say things like, “Uncle Peter, we don’t go to church and think it’s disrespectful to those who do to baptize our baby.”

, Family members are not the only persons who can ask inappropriate and invasive questions if they know you’re pregnant. Friends, colleagues, and even people you do not know may use the festive holiday mood to inquire about intimate details about your pregnancy. Developing a plan to deal with these situations and following through on them can help you get through the holiday season more easily.Expect that people may want to touch your belly. Remember that your body is your own and it’s your choice if you want someone to touch your belly. You can say, “Please don’t touch my belly, Sandy. I understand you’re very excited but it makes me uncomfortable.”
Be diplomatic when answering pesky questions. For example, if someone asks if you plan on a natural or Cesarean birth, you can say, “I plan seeing what happens during delivery and do what’s healthiest for the baby and me.”

, Consuming alcohol is a touchy subject for many pregnant women. Some women avoid alcohol altogether, while others may allow themselves one glass of wine or beer. Drink alcohol according to your beliefs and prepare diplomatic responses to any questions you may get on your decision.Some ways to respond to questions about alcohol include:


Not divulging your pregnant and not drinking alcohol by saying, “You know, Bob, I hit the booze a little hard last night. I’m going to take some time off.”
Enjoying one drink by saying, “In my culture, it’s acceptable to allow yourself one drink. I asked my doctor and he said it is ok for me.”
Avoiding alcohol altogether by saying, “I know many people allow themselves a sip of wine during pregnancy, Sam. But I’ve decided to not have any while I’m pregnant.”

Get surgery for toxic megacolon.",How to Manage Ulcerative Colitis During Pregnancy1," Contact your doctor as soon as you suspect you're pregnant or after you've taken a positive home pregnancy test. You'll need to discuss your treatment plan with your doctor, who can inform you about how to best manage your ulcerative colitis.If you're planning to conceive, discuss your plans with your health care provider early. Although ulcerative colitis shouldn't affect your fertility, you should have the condition under control to avoid conceiving during a flare.;
, Most ulcerative colitis medications (like corticosteroids, most 5-ASAs and some immunosuppressant medications) are safe to continue taking even during pregnancy. It's important to talk to your doctor about your risks for flares during pregnancy.Your goal will be preventing ulcerative colitis flares. Your doctor might prescribe a medication that you wouldn't normally take, if the doctor thinks this will prevent flares.
Disease flares are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, which are more common than birth defects or toxicities associated with the medications used to treat UC. For this reason, you may need to use a potentially harmful medication to prevent poor pregnancy outcomes from the potential flares. Make sure that you discuss these risks and benefits with your doctor.

, Some medications to manage ulcerative colitis should be avoided during pregnancy because they may cause birth defects or harm the fetus. Avoid taking thalidomide. Some immunosuppressants, like methotrexate, should also be avoided.Some biologics, antibodies grown to fight the condition, are low risk, but may need to be avoided by the end of your pregnancy. The biologics adalimumab and infliximab can cross the placenta so they shouldn't be given near the end of your third trimester. However, in some situations, the potential benefits might outweigh the risks. Discuss the potential risks and benefits with your doctor.

, It can be difficult to keep track of which diagnostic procedures are safe during pregnancy. In general, you should be able to safely get a colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, upper endoscopy, rectal biopsy, abdominal ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if needed while you're pregnant.Avoid computerized tomography (CT) scans and standard X-rays during pregnancy.

, Although most pregnancies won't experience complications from ulcerative colitis, rare complications do happen. If you are diagnosed with toxic megacolon, severe swelling and inflammation of the colon, your doctor will recommend surgery. The surgery will remove and repair the colon.Your doctor and surgeon will take into account how far along you are in the pregnancy to determine the specific surgery you'll need. You may need more surgery several months after delivering the baby.

, You can go online to find templates, pull a template from a prenatal book, or download a pregnancy tracking app. Depending on what kind of chart you have, insert the measurement. As the weeks go by, plot each measurement on the chart so that you can see a line indicating your baby’s steady growth.You may find that posting a chart on your refrigerator is easy to keep up with and fun for your family to enjoy together.
Consider choosing a chart that allows you to plot out the measurements so that you can see the growth as a line graph. You can choose to connect the dots to see a steady incline, or you can leave your dots singular.
You can also find charts that compare the size of your baby at each stage of growth to different types of fruit. These charts can be a fun way to track fetal growth.

, Babies grow at different rates, but you can find readily available baby growth charts that provide averages for each week of pregnancy. Your baby’s growth can vary, so don’t be concerned unless your healthcare provider tells you that your baby’s growth is too slow or too fast.If you think that your baby’s growth is too slow or too fast, talk to your healthcare provider.

Visit a doctor or ultrasound technician.,
Stay still as the doctor listens to the uterus.,
Listen to your baby's heartbeat with a doppler device.,
Get treatment if there is a problem.",How to Monitor Fetal Heart Rate1," The best way to know the fetus’ heart rate is to have a medical professional perform an external examination. The doctor or technician will be able to locate the fetus using sophisticated equipment.Your doctor may not be able to pick up on the fetal heart rate until between ten and fourteen weeks of development.
Whoever performs the test will need to lift up your shirt or gown to reach your bare belly.;
, The doctor may use a fetoscope, which is similar to a stethoscope. They will press one end of it to your stomach to listen for the fetus’ heartbeat. Wait patiently as they do this., A doppler device will let you hear the baby's heartbeat on an electronic monitor while measuring the heart rate. The technician will apply gel to your stomach before pressing a wand called a transducer to your skin.Dopplers are typically used at the same time as ultrasounds.

, Fetal heart rate alone cannot tell you if there is a problem or not. If the heart rate is abnormal, a doctor may do other tests to make sure that the fetus is in good health. Follow your doctor’s guidance and advice."

Eat smaller meals.,
Try a low-residue diet.,
Stay hydrated.,
Take a prenatal vitamin.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Get regular exercise.",How to Manage Ulcerative Colitis During Pregnancy2," You may find that some of your early pregnancy signs include nausea or indigestion on top of the nausea you may experience during a flare. To manage your morning sickness or a flare, try to eat 5 or 6 small meals during the day instead of 3 large meals.Your digestive system won't have to work as hard to break down and absorb larger meals when you eat smaller meals.

, If you're experiencing a flare or have early pregnancy indigestion, try to eat bland or low-residue foods. These foods are low in fiber which will keep you from passing stools frequently. Include these foods in your diet:White bread.
Refined (processed) breakfast cereals.
White rice, refined pasta and noodles.
Cooked and peeled vegetables.
Lean meat and fish.
Eggs.

, If you experience a flare and have diarrhea, it's important to drink a lot of water. Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which can cause pregnancy complications. Aim to drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water every day. While juices, milk, and tea count towards your water intake, avoid drinks that irritate your digestive system (like carbonated drinks).Avoid drinking beverages that contain caffeine and alcohol. You should always avoid alcohol during pregnancy and limit the amount of caffeine you consume.

, Prenatal vitamins are an important part of proper nutrition during pregnancy. They're even more important when you have ulcerative colitis since many medications for the condition lower your folic acid levels. Ensure that you take a daily prenatal vitamin that contains 2 mg of folic acid.If you have trouble taking a large capsule or tablet prenatal, gummy prenatal vitamins are available. These may be easier to take.

, Relaxing during a flare may reduce the symptoms. It's also a good skill to have for the upcoming labor and delivery of your baby. You can practice yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises to manage stress.For example, make yourself comfortable and practice breathing in deeply through your nose. Breathe out through your mouth. Continue to breathe in and out deeply until you feel more relaxed.

, Exercise is an important part of any pregnancy, especially if you have ulcerative colitis. Exercise can prevent pregnancy back pain, help you manage stress, and improve your mood. Talk with your doctor about what exercises you can do during pregnancy. In general, try to choose exercises depending on your trimester.For example, walking, jogging, swimming, and yoga are good choices for most of your pregnancy. But many doctors recommend stopping cycling, diving, and gymnastics after the second trimester."

Empty your bladder.,
Get a measuring tape that measures centimeters.,
Take off your clothes and lie down.,
Find your fundus.,
Feel your lower abdomen to locate your pelvic bone.,
Run your measuring tape from your fundus to pelvis.,
Take your measurement.,
Compare your measurement to your gestational week.",How to Measure Fetal Growth2," Use the bathroom within 30 minutes of taking your measurement. A full bladder can throw off your measurement by as much as 3 centimeters., For best results, use soft measuring tape such as the type used for sewing.While you can use other means of measuring, such as a ruler, remember that they can cause variations in measurement since your belly is round. If your measurement is wrong, then it is useless., You need to have a bare abdomen, so remove your clothing. Lie down as comfortably as you can and extend your legs out from your body. Avoid contorting your body in any way because other positions can cause variations in your measurement. The most accurate measurement can be taken lying down.

If you have an enlarged uterus, place a wedge under your buttocks., The fundus is the top of the uterus. To find it, run your hand up your belly until you feel the ridge of your fundus. Gently press into your upper abdomen until you feel the difference between the fundus and the area around it. The fundus should be located near the top of your abdomen.You may want to mark off the top of your fundus with a washable marker or pen so that you can more easily measure.
You will essentially be measuring the length of your baby bump.

, Your pelvic bone will be a hard line across your abdomen below your stomach. It should be just above where your pubic hair begins. Feel around with your fingers to find the bone., Center the “zero” point on the measuring tape on the top of the fundus. The tape should go along the center of your belly from the top to bottom. Position the end of the tape over your pelvic bone., Take the measurement at the point over your pelvic bone. This is your fundal height. Your measurement should be in centimeters., After 20 weeks, your fundal height should match your gestational week in centimeters, with an allowable variation of 2 centimeters.For example, at 25 weeks, your fundal height should measure between 24-26 centimeters.

Your fundal height does not tell you how long the baby is, but it does show you if your baby’s growth is healthy and as expected for its gestational age.
Your measurement can be incorrect if you are obese, have a history of fibroids, or are carrying multiples.If your fundal height is outside the expected range, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss possible reasons behind the difference.

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Wear two-piece clothing.,
Keep your bladder full if it’s early in the pregnancy.,
Ask your doctor how your baby is developing.",How to Measure Fetal Growth3," While you can get an ultrasound at any point in your pregnancy, you will have to use an ultrasound to measure fetal growth before 20 weeks or after 27 weeks of pregnancy. Depending on how busy your doctor’s office is, you may need to plan ahead to make sure that you get in for an appointment.


Ask your doctor if you need a full bladder.You may also be able to get a measurement of your baby at an ultrasound clinic or specialty ultrasound provider.
Frequent ultrasounds are not recommended for a normal pregnancy, so talk to your doctor before getting one.

, While early in the pregnancy your doctor may need to do a transvaginal ultrasound, they are most often performed by moving the wand over your abdomen. To allow easy access, wear a two-piece outfit so that you can easily pull up your top.

Don’t worry about getting the lubricant on your clothes. The doctor will allow you to wipe it off with a towel after the ultrasound., The sound waves used in the ultrasound will travel better through liquid, so early in your pregnancy a full bladder can help you get a better result. Later in the pregnancy, it may not be necessary since there will be more amniotic fluid in your body., An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of how your baby looks. It can allow your doctor to determine how well that your baby is growing.For example, ask, ""Is my baby's growth normal?""

Invite your friends over to celebrate with you, or have a friend host the party for you. If you want, offer real cocktails to your friends who are drinking.Tasty mocktails include Shirley Temples, alcohol-free mojitos, margaritas, and daiquiris.
Serve non-alcoholic drinks like agua fresca or lavender lemonade in your cocktail glasses and champagne flutes for a festive feel.

, Plan a movie night with your friends or partner. You could also plan a brunch or dinner date with your partner or a group of friends at your favorite restaurant or the best restaurant in town.If you can make time, try planning a short get-a-way for you and your partner before the baby arrives. If you plan on flying to your destination, make sure your OBGYN approves, and make sure to check the airline's rules for flying during pregnancy.

Use intermittent monitoring if there are no complications.,
Get continuous monitoring if there are complications.,
Undergo internal monitoring if the heartbeat cannot be found.,
Follow your doctor’s advice if there is a problem.",How to Monitor Fetal Heart Rate2," If your pregnancy is going relatively smoothly, you may only need intermittent monitoring during labor. This means that a nurse will check the heartbeat every fifteen to thirty minutes with a doppler device or fetoscope., If the doctor suspects there is a problem, they may perform continuous monitoring. In this case, a doppler device will be attached to your stomach with a belt. This will monitor the baby’s heartbeat constantly throughout labor.This method may be used if you have taken an epidural or oxytocin. It may also be used if there are complications with the pregnancy.

, In some extreme cases, your doctor may need to insert a special wire into your cervix. This wire will attach to the fetus’ head. The doctor will get a more accurate measure of the baby’s heart rate.Before this procedure, your doctor or nurse may do a vaginal exam first. They will then insert a catheter so that they can attach a wire to the baby. This can also help track the baby's movements.
This is a more invasive procedure that can only be done after your water has broken. It is typically only done if the doctor cannot find the baby’s heart using an external monitor or if there are severe complications.

, If the doctor determines that there may be complications, follow their instructions. They may recommend further procedures to check on the health of the baby during labor."

Get a prescription.,
Apply gel to your belly.,
Press the transducer into the gel.,
Determine if the heart rate is normal.,
Visit the doctor if any abnormalities occur.",How to Monitor Fetal Heart Rate3," In the United States, you must have a prescription from a doctor to buy a doppler fetal heart monitor. Ask your doctor if this device is right for you. You may even ask them to demonstrate how to use it.While there are no known problems with using doppler devices at home, it is best to have these tests done by a medical professional. Even with a device, you may not be able to recognize problems with the baby’s heartbeat without medical training.While a doctor may be able to detect the heart rate as early as ten weeks, at-home doppler devices may not work until five months., Lift up your shirt to reveal your bare belly. Squeeze ultrasound gel onto your stomach along your pubic bone or lower abdomen. Use the wand of the doppler device (called a transducer probe) to spread the gel over your skin.Ultrasound gel often comes with the device, although you may be able to purchase it separately.

, You can guide the transducer probe around your pubic bone area. If you’re having difficulty finding the fetus, hold the wand at different angles. The fetus' heartbeat will sound like a strong, consistent pulse.Do not use the device for longer than ten minutes at a time. If you cannot find the heartbeat in that time, try again in a few days.
It may be difficult to find the heartbeat using at-home devices. Visit a doctor for an external examination if you are concerned.

, Once you locate the heartbeat, the heart rate will appear on the electronic monitor of the device. The baby’s heart rate should be between 110 and 160 beats per minute (bpm). The heart rate can vary between 5 and 25 beats from minute to minute.If the fetus’ heart rate is between 160 and 180 bpm, they may have fetal tachycardia. Visit a doctor.If the heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm, you may have actually picked up on your own heart rate instead of the fetus’.The fetal heart rate is not an accurate measure of health. Complications can still happen, even if the heartbeat is normal. Do not delay getting medical attention if you suspect something is wrong., If you are concerned that there is a problem, visit a doctor immediately. The doctor can perform more tests to determine if there is an issue.If you have any abdominal pain, bleeding, dizziness, cramping, or discharge, see a doctor immediately, even if the fetus’ heart rate is normal.
If you notice any change in the baby’s heart rate or if you notice an irregular pulse, call your doctor.

Get blood glucose levels into the normal range before conception.,
Consult a physician to develop a plan for appropriate diet, exercise, and insulin use during pregnancy.,
Carefully track and record blood glucose levels.,
Visit your healthcare provider regularly to monitor your health and that of your baby.",How to Manage Diabetes During Pregnancy," Planning a pregnancy in advance can be one of the most effective ways to ensure a healthy pregnancy for diabetics, because it allows you and your diabetes management team the time to adjust and prepare for necessary changes in diet and treatments to keep you and your baby healthy.;
,


Gestational diabetes can often be controlled with simple diet and exercise changes and monitoring, and rarely requires insulin or treatment with other medications. Type 1 diabetics may need additional insulin during pregnancy, particularly during the last trimester. Type 2 diabetics taking oral medications or pills may need to switch to insulin to avoid the transfer of the medication to the baby.
Pregnant women with any kind of diabetes should work with a physician or dietitian to build balanced, varied, healthy meal plans that can aid in the management of blood glucose levels to avoid high and low ranges.
For most diabetic women, moderate exercise is also helpful in managing glucose levels, particularly after meals. If you have other health conditions such as high blood pressure, blood vessel or nerve damage, or problems with your eyes, kidneys, or heart, consult a physician or diabetic health professional before beginning or maintaining an exercise regimen during pregnancy. In general, diabetic women should not begin strenuous exercise programs during pregnancy.

, Maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible, especially during the first trimester. You may also need to increase the number of times you check your blood sugar to get a good feel for your levels when fasting, before and after meals, snacks, or drinks, and prior to sleep (for some women, an additional check during the night may be necessary).


The closer your blood glucose levels are to normal, the better your chances for a normal pregnancy and healthy baby. Take notes when you record blood glucose levels that include foods, exercise, and insulin use, and discuss these records with your doctor. Consult a professional if you believe changes are necessary.
It will take some time to figure out how pregnancy will affect your individual needs for dietary changes, blood sugar checks, and insulin.

, Frequent visits can help identify possible problems or upcoming changes that may be necessary. The regular care of a physician or diabetes management team can help prevent complications during pregnancy and delivery. Your doctor may also check how well your diabetes is being managed by performing an A1C test or blood or urine ketone tests. If you are experiencing considerable stress or illness, your doctor can also refer you to the appropriate specialists.

Do not try to diet while pregnant.You should never try to lose weight while pregnant unless your doctor specifically tells you otherwise.,
Know when weight loss may occur.While weight loss is not recommended during pregnancy, it is fairly normal for many women to lose weight during their first trimester.,
Talk to your doctor or dietician.,
Understand your caloric needs.,
Avoid empty calories and unhealthy foods.,
Take prenatal vitamins.,
Eat frequent, small meals.Eating multiple small meals throughout the day instead of three large ones is a tactic used by many dieters to maintain portion control, but it also benefits you as a pregnant woman.,
Maintain a healthy diet rich in pregnancy-aiding nutrients.,
Eat healthy snacks.,
Do light exercise.",How to Lose Weight While Pregnant," Do not start a weight-loss regimen after you find out that you are pregnant. It is actually recommended that all women gain weight during pregnancy.


Obese women should gain between 11 and 20 pounds (5 and 9 kg).
Overweight women should gain between 15 and 25 pounds (7 and 11 kg).
Normal-weight women should gain between 25 and 35 pounds (11 and 16 kg).
Underweight women should gain between 28 and 40 pounds (13 and 18 kg).
Dieting during pregnancy could deprive your baby of needed calories, vitamins, and minerals.;
,


Many women experience bouts of nausea and vomiting commonly referred to as “morning sickness.” This nausea is strongest during the first trimester, and it might be difficult to keep food down or eat normal meals during this time. Minor weight loss may not be anything to worry about, especially if you are overweight since your baby can draw from the extra reserve of calories in your fat tissue.

, If you feel you have a legitimate concern about your weight, talk to your doctor or a pregnancy dietician about how to manage your weight in a way that is healthy for both you and your baby. Never begin a special diet before discussing it with a medical or pregnancy professional.


You should also talk to your doctor if you cannot keep any food down or lose a considerable amount of weight, even during the first trimester., Women who started at a normal weight before pregnancy need an average of 300 extra calories per day during their second and third trimesters.Normal-weight women should consume between 1900 and 2500 calories daily.
Eating more calories than recommended may lead to an unhealthy increase in weight.
If you were underweight, overweight, or obese before pregnancy, discuss your caloric needs with your doctor. These needs vary from person to person. Even if there are rare circumstances surrounding your pregnancy that make weight loss a healthy option, you may still need to maintain or increase your caloric intake.
You should also talk to your doctor about your caloric needs if you are pregnant with multiples. You will likely need even more calories if you are carrying more than one baby.

, Empty calories will lead to unnecessary weight gain but will not provide your baby with any of the nutrients he or she needs. Avoiding empty calories is vital in maintaining a pregnancy weight that is healthy for you.


Avoid foods with added sugars and solid fats. The usual culprits include soft drinks, desserts, fried foods, rich dairy products like cheese or whole milk, and fatty cuts of meat.
Opt for low-fat, fat-free, unsweetened, and no-added sugar options when available.
Also avoid caffeine, alcohol, raw seafood, and potential sources of bacteria.

, Your body will have additional nutritional needs during pregnancy. Prenatal vitamins allow you to address these needs without having to ingest more calories than absolutely necessary.


Never rely on prenatal vitamins as a substitute for actual food, even if your doctor tells you that weight loss is acceptable for your circumstances. Supplements are absorbed best when taken with food, and vitamins obtained from food are generally easier for your body to access than those obtained through supplements.
Folic acid is one of the most important prenatal vitamins you can take.It markedly minimizes the risk of neural tube defects.
Iron, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements also help maintain your body functions while aiding your baby in his or her development.
Avoid supplements that provide excess vitamin A, D, E, or K.

,


Aversions to food, nausea, heartburn, and indigestion often cause the experience of eating a full-size meal to become unpleasant during pregnancy. Eating five to six small meals throughout the course of the day can make it easier and more comfortable to digest your food. This is especially true as your baby grows and begins to crowd your digestive organs.

, Focus on foods that provide folate and make sure to get plenty of protein, healthy fat, carbohydrates, and fiber.Foods rich in folate include orange juice, strawberries, spinach, broccoli, beans, and fortified breads and cereals.
Start off with a well-rounded breakfast to make you feel better for the entire day.
Opt for whole-grain carbohydrate sources rather than processed grains like white bread.
High-fiber foods can help regulate weight and prevent digestive problems like constipation. Whole-grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans are generally good sources of fiber.
Make sure to include fruits and vegetables in your diet as often as possible.
Opt for unsaturated ""good"" fats like olive oil, canola oil, and peanut oil.

, Snacks can be perfectly healthy during pregnancy, even if your doctor recommends a small amount of weight gain or weight loss. Choose healthy snacks rich in nutrition over processed foods and desserts heavy in sugar or rich dairy fat.


Consider a banana smoothie or frozen all-fruit nonfat sorbet instead of ice cream and shakes.
Munch on trail mix, nuts, and fruit in between meals.
Instead of white crackers and fatty cheese, eat whole-grain crackers covered with a small amount of low-fat cheese.
Hard-boiled eggs, whole-grain toast, and plain yogurt are other snack options worth considering.
Instead of sugary drinks, go for low-sodium vegetable juice, sparkling water with a splash of fruit juice, or flavored skim or soy milk over ice.

, Exercise is an important part of weight-loss diets outside of pregnancy and it also plays a significant role in achieving a healthy weight during pregnancy. Healthy pregnant women should get, at minimum, 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly.Exercise also relieves pregnancy aches, improves sleep, regulates emotional health, and lowers the risk of complications. It may make losing weight after pregnancy easier, as well.
Talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise regimen. Stop exercise immediately if vaginal bleeding occurs or if your water breaks prematurely.
Good exercise options to choose from include low-impact activities like walking, swimming, dancing, and cycling.
Avoid activities where you can get struck in the abdomen, like kickboxing or basketball. You should also avoid activities during which you might fall, like horseback riding. Avoid scuba diving since it could cause gas bubbles to build up in your baby's blood.

Try again in a couple of weeks.,
Ask for an anti-nausea drug.,
Don't force it.,
Get all the right nutrients.",How to Manage Pregnancy Food Aversions," If you're having trouble with the visual of protein, you can try hiding meats in your favorite casseroles. Some women find this trick can make it easier to stomach these proteins, since you won't have to look at a slab of meat.For instance, you could add finely shredded chicken to a taco casserole or include some ground beef in a baked ziti recipe with marinara sauce.;
, It may be that the biggest problem you have with certain foods is the smell. Eating foods cold may help cut down on that problem. For instance, you cold try eating grilled chicken breast cold on a salad instead of hot off the grill.You could also try eating sliced cold pork loin in a sandwich rather than having it hot.

, If you're having trouble stomaching the thought of a glass of milk, add it to other foods. You can add yogurt to smoothies or milk to casseroles, for instance. You likely won't notice the milk when it's concealed in another food.For example, if you're making a baked ziti casserole, you can add a bit of milk to the sauce to make it creamy, then add cheese to the top.

, If greens are turning you green, try adding them into places you won't notice. You can blend them into smoothies, for instance, or blend them up and add them to sauces (such as spaghetti sauce). You'll get the nutrients, but you won't have to taste them.


For instance, you could puree cooked spinach with some water, then add it to a jar of spaghetti sauce in a pan.
For a smoothie, try adding some of your favorite fruits, such as berries, pineapple, banana, or mango, to a smoothie with greens to help hide the flavor.

, Some women have trouble with meat-based protein while pregnant. If that's the case, try adding in more vegetarian sources of protein, such as tofu, beans, legumes, and nuts.You can also try eggs if you can stomach them.

, Some women don't like milk while pregnant. You can reach for other dairy instead, such as cheese or even chocolate pudding. However, if that upsets your stomach, try reaching for other sources of calcium that have no dairy at all.Some great sources of calcium include tofu fortified with calcium, canned salmon mashed up with the bones, green, leafy vegetables, calcium-fortified orange juice, and fortified breads and tortillas., You may be having a hard time with leafy greens. If they're a problem, try filling up on other vegetables, particularly red, yellow, and orange ones. If that still doesn't solve the problem, opt for fruits instead, such as apricots, papayas, and cantaloupe., In some cases, you'll only have an aversion to a food at certain parts of your pregnancy. You may find that if you wait a few weeks, you'll be able to stomach the food again., Sometimes, your aversions may be related to morning sickness. If that's the case, taking an anti-nausea drug may help. Either way, talk to your doctor, who may be able to offer you some medical help., If these tricks don't work, don't try to force yourself to eat it, especially if it makes yourself feel sick. Just try to make up for what you're missing with other foods, so you're not missing out on the nutrients.In fact, some aversions may be good for you. For instance, some women have aversions to tea or coffee, which just means you cut down on your caffeine.That's definitely not a bad thing when you're pregnant!

, You do need certain nutrients when pregnant. One way to make sure you are getting what you need is by taking prenatal vitamins. The main nutrients you need to get extra of are iron, folic acid, calcium, and protein. Most sources of protein also have iron in them, and of course, you can get calcium from both dairy and leafy greens or fortified breads.Greens, fortified cereals, beans, legumes, and nuts are all good sources of folic acid."

, Although you may not feel like having sex at 39 or 40 weeks, it may be the best way to induce labor and break your water. In fact, labor is common within one week of having sex. If you are comfortable enough, have sex at least once a day, which may make your water break. Consider deeply penetrating positions such as cowgirl or from behind. These may better stimulate your cervix and get the prostaglandins from sperm to induce labor.Avoid having sex once your water is broken. This can introduce harmful bacteria into the birth canal., If you’re hoping to start or already are in labor, use nipple stimulation to further progress your labor. Rub your nipples and areola between your forefinger and thumb, which mimics the how a baby nurses. Ask your partner for help if that is more comfortable for you.This can also make your water break because it release oxytocin, which causes your uterus to contract.Recognize that it may require significant nipple stimulation to start labor.

Breathing deeply helps slow the heart rate, relieve muscle tension, and promote sleep. Plus, of all relaxation techniques, deep breathing is the most accessible to pregnant mothers—you can do this almost anywhere.


For beginners, try deep breathing at home where you can sit or lie in quiet without interruptions. Sit comfortably on a couch or floor cushion. Or, lie down on your left side with a pillow beneath your right side (and a pillow between your legs, if desired).
Breathe in through your nose, noticing your abdomen expanding gently. Hold the breath for a few counts and then exhale through your mouth. You should see your abdomen deflating a little as you release the air. Repeat as needed.;
, This exercise helps you develop self-awareness to the tension in your body. You can do this in different settings to help you control your anxiety. To start, choose a place that is quiet and distraction-free.


Sit or lie down comfortably. Start at your head (or your toes) and gradually move up through your body contracting and relaxing different muscle groups.
For example, if you start at your head, you will wrinkle your forehead and eyebrows for a few seconds. Notice the tension. Then, release these muscles and notice how the tension melts away. Move on the next muscle group until you complete the entire body., Visualization, or guided imagery, is a relaxation technique that can help you achieve calm by envisioning a peaceful, stress-free environment. You can listen to a recorded audio/video of these exercises on YouTube or you can simply use your imagination.As an example, imagine that you are walking along a windy, sunny beach. Activate all your senses to hear the roaring waves as they meet the shore. Listen to birds circling overhead. Smell the salty water. Feel the sand in between your toes and the water as it washes it clean with each wave.
Perform this visualization exercise for as long as you’d like to relax after a stressful day.

, Massage is a wonderful treat for soothing your tired muscles during pregnancy. Luckily, massage therapy also offers a host of benefits like reducing joint and muscle pain, decreasing anxiety, reducing depressive symptoms, and improving labor outcomes.You can spring for a professional massage at a spa with a certified massage therapist, or you can ask your partner to massage your achy muscles.

, In addition to using relaxation techniques to relieve stress, you may also find relaxation while engaging in soothing activities. Self-care is a terrific way to manage your anxiety on a daily basis by taking time out to do things that bring you pleasure.


Self-care activities that help you ease tension and anxiety will depend on your individual preferences. Activities may include taking a relaxing soak in the tub, reading a new book, listening to music, chatting with your best friend, or watching the sunset.

, Certain types of yoga, gentle stretching, walking, and swimming are all generally approved for pregnant women. In addition to combating stress, getting your body and your baby moving has many advantages, such as promoting better sleep, improving mood and energy, and minimizing pregnancy complications like constipation, bloating and backaches. Staying active while pregnant also lowers your risk of getting gestational diabetes.Although exercise is usually recommended by your doctor, be sure to discuss it with him or her beforehand to verify that it’s okay in your situation.

, Pregnancy can result in sleep disturbances for women who’ve never had trouble getting shut-eye. Side effects of pregnancy like nausea, stress, and changing hormone levels all play a role in you not getting enough rest. Although getting adequate sleep can be challenging, there are tips you can follow to improve your sleep quality and quantity. These include:Doing relaxation exercise to manage stress.
Exercising at least 30 minutes per day (as long as your doctor says it’s okay).
Sleeping on your left side to improve blood flow and comfort.
Cutting back on fluids a few hours before bed.
Eating several small meals throughout the day and avoiding spicy, fried, or acidic foods that cause heartburn.
Not forcing yourself to sleep; if you can’t go to sleep, get up and do something like reading, journaling, or taking a bath.

, Consuming whole foods with adequate nutrients not only supports your physical health but will also help you manage anxiety. Choose balanced and nutritious foods, including fruit and vegetables, lean sources of protein, seafood (which has been shown to ease anxiety), whole grains, and healthy fats found in nuts, avocadoes, and olive oil.Pregnant women should avoid raw eggs, soft mould-ripened cheeses, deli meats, uncooked or partially cooked meat, and fish with high mercury content. In addition refrain from drinking alcohol and caffeine to prevent complications., It is important to cut back on your caffeine intake during pregnancy because caffeine may cross the placenta and increase your baby’s heartrate.However, cutting back on caffeine may also help to reduce your anxiety.

Avoid having more than 200 milligrams of caffeine per day. This is about the equivalent of two 8 ounce cups of brewed coffee.

, If you have trouble managing anxiety and stress on your own, schedule an appointment with a mental health provider. A therapist with experience treating anxiety in pregnancy can work with you to relieve worries and concerns and promote relaxation.


Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been shown to be particularly effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders.Consider this option before pharmacological treatments, as there is little research to show how anxiety medications affect your baby.
You may also want to discuss non-pharmacological options with your therapist, such as biofeedback, pet therapy, and outdoor therapy.

, If your anxiety is severe, your doctor may recommend that you take prescription medication to manage your symptoms. You may have some concerns about how anxiety medications will affect your baby. There may be some risks depending on what medication you take.Therefore, if you are unable to reduce anxiety on your own, or if you are suffering from anxiety and depression at the same time, medication may be a practical option. Your doctor may suggest medication to minimize the likelihood of these conditions worsening or evolving into more severe conditions like postpartum depression or psychosis.
Talk with your doctor to determine if medication is a good choice for your situation.

, Leaning on your network of family and friends is incredibly important to reducing your stress and anxiety during pregnancy. However, it can also help to express your feelings and concerns in a support group with others who are experiencing anxiety, too.Talk to your doctor or mental health provider to help you locate a local support group for pregnant women. These other women can help alleviate fears, answer common questions and ease concerns you have as your pregnancy progresses.

, If this is your first pregnancy, much of your anxiety may come from feeling unprepared. Reading up on pregnancy as well as talking with your doctor and health care providers can help you feel better equipped to handle the next several months. Feeling informed can address many of your worries and concerns and reduce the stress that you are experiencing.While becoming informed about pregnancy may be empowering to some women, in others, it may heighten anxiety. If certain information you read about pregnancy creates anxiety within you, limit your exposure to this kind of literature. Plus, if you read something in a book or online that causes concern, speak with your doctor so that they can address your concerns and alleviate your worries.

, It can be easy to fall into a negative thinking trap when you are pregnant. You may find yourself thinking about a lot of worse-case scenarios that only heighten your anxiety. Attack negative thought patterns and “what ifs” with positive thinking.When you find yourself thinking negatively or worrying, talk to your partner, a close friend or a family member who can help you put your fears into perspective. Simply say “I’m really worried that my baby will be premature…” This person can provide a realistic sounding board for you.
You can also challenge such thoughts on your own by stopping yourself and replacing such worries with more positive statements. For example, you say “I’m really worried that my baby will be premature…” To combat these worries, remind yourself that the majority of pregnancy complications won’t actually happen, but, if they do, you will take the necessary actions to ensure your baby’s health.

, It’s impossible and probably risky for you to maintain the same levels of activity and obligations as you did before your pregnancy. Force yourself to take it easy and start bowing out of excessive responsibilities. Say “no” to unreasonable demands on your time. Look through your daily routine and search for ways you can cut back on duties or include more rest and relaxation. You may be feeling stressed because you are trying to wear all the hats you did before you had a growing baby inside of you.

, Another way to manage stress during pregnancy is to accept your friends’ and relatives’ offers to assist you. Don’t try to do it all yourself. At some point near the end of your pregnancy, you will have to loosen the reins and start letting others help out more anyway. If you’re already feeling stressed, start early and delegate chores and tasks to those around you. Odds are, they will be happy to lighten your load."

,, If it's a basic one, it should come open very easily. Just pull along the line on the side where it connects.

, If you have a test that has the writing, try using white out to cover up the ""not"" on not pregnant. However, this can be tricky. the white out might not cover it up all the way and if you put too much on it will look very clearly covered up.

, Then gently rub it over the positive line or plus. This will make it faded, which is how positive tests look. If the label is wet after that DO NOT wipe it clean! This will smudge it. Use the other end of the q-tip to roll over it.

,,,, With the test open add the line or plus symbol (from the example directions)that will make the test look positive using the marker you purchased.

,,, Chances of conception increase drastically right before the female is ovulating. Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary and travels down the Fallopian tube, ready to be fertilized. When a female is ovulating, the cervical mucus changes to a slippery, egg-white consistency to help ferry the sperm along to the egg.


Your menstrual cycle lasts anywhere from 28 to 32 days. The first day of your period should be counted as day 1. Some women have irregular cycles.
Although it's not always exactly the same, ovulation usually occurs between day 11 and 21 of your cycle. After the the egg is released, it usually only lives for 12 to 24 hours.
Doctors recommend trying intercourse on day 9 (9 days after the first day of your menstrual period) and continuing every other day until after the 21st day has passed.

The highest chances of pregnancy occur 2 days prior to ovulation because sperm are able to live for 3 to 5 days, much longer than the lifespan of a mature egg. So if you have intercourse before ovulation, there's a good sperm will still be alive when the egg is released.
If you have a regular 28 day period, plan on having sex every other day around day 14. This means having sex around day 12, day 14, and day 16, although frequent intercourse will lower a man's sperm count.



, When an egg is released, your body produces a hormone called progesterone in anticipation of pregnancy. Progesterone causes the body temperature to rise slightly. Tracking this temperature shift is an easy, if inexact, way to tell when you are ovulating.


Use a basal thermometer right when you wake up, before you get out of bed in the morning. Most basal counters that you buy in pharmacies will come with a chart that will help you track your temperature.
Look for a spike of at least .4 °F (−17.6 °C) to indicate ovulation. Your body is producing progesterone as is shifts from the follicular to the luteal phase.If you have a drop in temperature, have intercourse.Some women record a drop in temperature when they ovulate. If you happen to come across a significant drop in temperature (.4° Fahrenheit), have sex just in case you are ovulating.

, There is a bunch of myths out there about the effectiveness of certain sexual positions, but there's no scientific evidence to back them up. Unless you're having intercourse sitting or standing up, there's no ideal sexual position to increase the likelihood of conception.

, You don't need to lift your legs into the air (because that doesn't change the direction of the pelvis), but try to stay put, lying down, for 15 to 20 minutes after sex. This will help the sperm travel up the cervix.


Don't go to the bathroom during this time either. Waiting 10 to 20 minutes will be enough time to give the sperm to travel up the cervix.

, Smoking affects estrogen levels and ovulation, and is damaging to the fetus once conception starts. Get a head start and kick the habit!

, Opt for foods high in folic acid, greens and vegetables, and organic foods. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as well as plastics, including plastic wraps.

, Men can boost their sperm count with a few simple tips. Try the following if you think the potential father is experiencing low sperm count:


Avoid stimulants like alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.
Eat a diet high in zinc, selenium, and vitamin E. Foods that contain some of these vitamins include whole grains, seafood, lean meat, eggs, mushrooms, and Brazil nuts.
Keep the testicles cool, not warm. Give the testicles some regular breathing room (there's a reason they're outside the body) and don't visit any saunas, hot baths, or hot tubs while trying to conceive.

, Pay close attention to cleaning along the hair and jaw lines, where pores can get clogged.

, Washing your hair too little will cause the scalp to become oily and can lead to breakouts. Washing your hair too much can strip it of natural oils and lead to scalp irritation.

There are many chemicals in hair dyes, but studies have not proved a direct link with birth defects. However, waiting until the second or third trimester will reduce exposure when the baby's vital organs are developing.
To be even safer, consider highlights. Unlike a single-process color, dye isn't applied to the scalp, reducing the likelihood of the chemicals entering your system.

,


Polish can contain trace amounts of chemicals, but they aren't absorbed through the skin around your nails and haven't been linked to pregnancy complications.







,


Be mindful that your skin is more sensitive during pregnancy. You'll also need to be propped up in your chair when getting a facial during the third trimester. Lying flat on your back can affect your circulation and balance.

,


If you haven't had a bikini wax before, wait until after labor. The pain of the treatment may prompt contractions. Also, be aware that you may experience more skin irritation post wax during pregnancy.

,


The effects of teeth-whitening procedures have not been fully studied and teeth are extra sensitive during pregnancy. Hot tubs, steam rooms, saunas and tanning beds can raise the body's core temperature and affect your balance.

Decide whether you should lift the object in question based on its weight.,
Divide or break up the object if you can.,
Stand in front of the object.,
Assume the squatting or kneeling position.,
Hold your back straight.,
Get a good grip.,
Flex your legs and arms to lift.,
Keep the object close to you.,
Avoid twisting.,
Walk slowly when carrying the object.,
Bend to set the object back down.,
Breathe naturally throughout the entire process.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Pay attention to the unique needs of your pregnancy.,
Ask other people for help.,
Listen to your body.,
Know your rights if you refuse to lift.",How to Lift Objects When Pregnant," The amount of weight that is generally safe to lift is connected to your stage of pregnancy. The more advanced your pregnancy, the more you should avoid lifting heavy objects. The frequency of lifting also matters, with occasional lifting being less risky than everyday actions.


Up until the 24th week, it is generally okay to lift more than 51 lbs. (23 kg) regularly if needed. However, it is still better if you lift this amount only sporadically if possible.After the 24th week, you should limit any constant lifting to a maximum weight of 24 lbs (11 kg).After the 30th week, you should eliminate any constant lifting and only sporadically lift up to 24 lbs. (11kg), if necessary.;
, When possible, divide large loads of materials into smaller groups or make several trips, rather than carry a heavy load at one time. For example, if you have one large box of books, see if you can split it up into multiple carry bags or smaller boxes before moving it. The extra effort could save you from back pain.


If you choose to divide the object up into bags, choose bags with handles. They will be easier and more stable for you to lift and move.
Also, consider pushing or sliding the object to its final destination before you lift it. This may work especially well with an object that only needs to go a short distance on a smooth surface.

, If you do decide to lift the object, position yourself as close as possible to it while standing. Space out your feet about a foot apart or a little more depending on the size of the object. Keep them parallel to one another. Make sure that your feet are stable and planted firmly.


Never lift a heavy object on unsteady ground when pregnant. The shifting ground makes it more possible that you could lose your balance and fall, possibly injuring yourself and your baby. This is especially the case if you are in the latter stages of pregnancy and your balance has shifted forward, throwing off your center of gravity., Squat down while standing near to the object. The item to be lifted should be positioned between your knees as you go down. If you need extra balance support, slightly slide one foot forward an inch or two.Or, if your knees need additional support, you can try the kneeling position instead. Kneel down to pick up the object by placing a single knee on the ground for extra balance. Then, when you need to lift up, you can push off this knee for additional power as well.If your belly hits the object at any time, with either position, you are too close and will need to move back slightly.
After you’ve gone down into a squatting or kneeling position, if you feel as if you can’t lift the object or even get back up, simply sit down on the ground. It is better to pause for a moment rather than risk injury.

, No matter which initial position you choose, make sure to keep your spine straight throughout the entire process. Picture a ruler placed against your back and try to straighten to meet it. You could also wear a maternity belt to provide a bit of extra back support. Many pregnant women wear these on a daily basis as they lessen pain by encouraging proper posture and providing lift.Your back is particularly vulnerable to strain due, in part, to a hormone called relaxin which your body produces early on in your pregnancy. It increases the flexibility of your connective tissues in order to prepare your pelvic area for the birthing process. The side effect, however, is that it can weaken the back., Always place both hands on the object, if at all possible. This increases your ability to maintain control over it as you move. Find a good handhold as well, if you can. For example, on a box this may mean using pre-punched handholds on the side or tilting it until you can reach under to grab it from below.


If you feel your handhold slipping as you lift, set the object back down on the ground smoothly and quickly. You do not want to risk dropping the object or hitting your belly with it if you lose control., After you’ve established your grip, it is time to lift. Your legs and arms should do the majority of the work. Tighten them to lift the object and rise slowly into a standing position. If you feel your back tightening, you need to use your legs more.


If you are in the kneeling position to start with you can lift the object to the top of your knee first. Then, use the knee on the ground to push upward, taking the box with you as you rise., This is a bit tricky when you have a pregnant belly to work around. But, holding the object near to your body as you lift and move will reduce the strain on your arms. “Bear hug” the object if you can, pulling it to you with both arms wrapped around it.Do not set the object on top of your belly bump at any point during the lifting process. This would keep the object close to you, but could also prove harmful to your baby by placing too much direct pressure on the abdomen.

, Keep your body facing forward as you lift. Maintain this position even as you move the object. Twisting or turning places weight-bearing pressure on your back and hip areas. After you’ve lifted the object into a standing position, if you need to head in a direction other than the one that you are facing, rotate your body by leading with your feet, not your spine., Don’t rush to get where you need to go. Take purposeful, small steps. Watch for any obstructions that may be in your path.

, When you are ready to drop off the object, set it down by bending your knees as you lower. Your waist and hip area will bend as well while your back should remain straight. This is essentially the reverse of the lifting position that you used before. You can go down to one knee or squat to place the object on the floor.Watch to make sure that you are not leaning too far forward as you go down.

, As with any type of weightlifting, it is very tempting to hold your breath at various points as you lift, stand, walk, and set down. It is more helpful, and safe for you and your baby, to maintain a consistent breathing pattern.

, Call your doctor before engaging in any physical behavior that you believe could be a risk to you or your child. Look at the object, estimate its weight, and explain the situation and your concerns. They will be able to explain the risk factors to you in detail while also giving advice tailored to your specific pregnancy., Not all pregnancies are the same. If you have had any pregnancy complications that require you to take it easy or to be put on bed rest, such as cervical incompetence, then you may need to modify the suggested weight lifting limits to be more conservative. Or, you may need to abstain from lifting altogether. If you’ve experienced no complications, you may be fine to lift within the given weight ranges until you deliver.


Even if you are used to lifting objects, be aware that moving heavy items more than once every five minutes can increase your potential for premature birth or miscarriage., Flag down a co-worker or get your spouse or another relative to assist you when moving items. You can request that you both lift the object together or they may offer to do it entirely on their own. This gets the job done at minimal physical strain to you., You know your own limits better than anyone. You’ve been paying attention to your body’s cues throughout your pregnancy, so do so now as well. For example, if you lifted weights and moved objects frequently prior to becoming pregnant, then your body’s level of tolerance for such actions could be high. On the other hand, if you’ve never moved boxes before, now may not be the best time to start.As a general rule, in late pregnancy, limit your lifting to 20-25% of what you could reasonably manage in a pre-pregnant state., There are protections in place for those women who have jobs that require the regular lifting of heavy objects. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act may be something for you to look into if you find that your pregnancy prevents you from completing your job as usual. The standard practice is for you to receive accommodations based on a ‘temporary disability’ status."

Aim to be good enough.",How to Look Beautiful While Pregnant," Part of looking beautiful while pregnant is gaining the necessary amount of weight to properly nourish your baby. Pregnant woman should eat between 2000 and 2500 calories each day, spread throughout 4 meals.Paying attention to your caloric intake will help you avoid gaining unnecessary weight that may put you at risk for certain medical conditions. You should gain the weight necessary to provide adequate nutrition for your baby and to allow him to grow to a healthy size, but you should pay close attention to gaining the appropriate amount of weight, which will keep you feeling beautiful throughout all three trimesters of your pregnancy.


If you have gained more weight then you planned (or more than your doctor deems healthy) you may need to lose weight. It is important to take great caution when attempting to lose weight while pregnant to ensure that your weight loss does not negatively affect your baby.;
, If consistent exercise made you feel confident and beautiful before your pregnancy, there is no reason that pregnancy should force you to stop (although you may need to alter your workout routine). Feeling fit and strong will make you feel more confident about the way you look and will also help in getting you pre-pregnancy body back after you give birth.Getting exercise during your pregnancy will help you keep your weight down, will boost your mood and energy level, and will increase your stamina and muscle strength.Together, these positive results will help you to feel more beautiful.


Consider attempting to get 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.Walking, aerobics, and swimming are all great low-impact activities that you may want to try during your pregnancy. These activities will help you stay in shape and feel beautiful.
Always confer with your doctor before starting a workout routine when pregnant. There are certain situations, such as if you have pregnancy-related high blood pressure, in which your doctor may advise you not to exercise., Dehydration is a very real risk during pregnancy, and drinking enough water will help you feel healthy and look beautiful. While a person should attempt to drink roughly one-half to one ounce of water for each pound that he weighs every day, a pregnant woman must pay even more attention to her water intake.Water helps form the placenta and is used in the amniotic sac in your pregnancy.In addition, not drinking enough water can have a negative effect on your appearance. Dehydration can make your skin look dull, negating the beautiful glow that will accompany your pregnancy. In addition, dehydration can make you feel sluggish and ill, and it is hard to look beautiful when you are not feeling up to par.


It is recommended that pregnant women drink about 10 cups (or 2.3 liters) of fluids daily.Drinking water for the majority of this requirement will help you avoid the sugars present in fruit drinks and sodas.

, Many popular brands (think stores like Gap) and designers (look at Isabella Oliver) sell maternity clothing. While some women feel “guilty” for spending money on clothing that they will only wear for a finite amount of time, it is important to purchase clothing that fits your changing body, is comfortable to wear, and makes you feel beautiful.If you do not have the budget to purchase maternity clothing, consider asking a friend who has had a child if she has anything you might borrow for the remainder of your pregnancy. In addition, consignment clothing stores can be a great place to find maternity wear for affordable prices.
Think about finding “staples”- clothes that can be worn and re-worn and apply to many situations. If you purchase a pair of jeans, some leggings, tank tops, and cardigans, you will find yourself able to wear these pieces over and over again.Choose clothes in solid color, which look more sophisticated and are wearable in many different situations! Darker colors can often help you appear slimmer, too.

, During your pregnancy, treat yourself to something that makes you feel beautiful. Whether it’s a manicure, pedicure, or facial, choose a spa treatment (or several!) that will provide a few hours to relax and enable you to walk away feeling beautiful. Alternatively, you can treat yourself to a pregnancy (or prenatal massage). Studies have shown that receiving massage therapy during pregnancy can help reduce anxiety, relieve muscle aches and joint pain, and improve labor outcomes.When booking a prenatal massage, ensure that you find a massage therapist who is specifically certified in prenatal massage.You may also want to confer with your prenatal care provider about obtaining a prenatal massage before booking one. You should absolutely speak with your doctor if you suffer from a high-risk pregnancy., Your body is going through a lot of dramatic changes right now, and in addition, your life is about to change forever with the addition of your little one. That makes the time during your pregnancy a great time to treat yourself. If looking beautiful is your goal, pick something to splurge on that will make you feel as beautiful as ever.


Book a haircut at the new fancy salon in town. Enjoy a new haircut that flatters your changing figure (which may include changes to the shape and size of your face). However, wait until at least the second trimester to schedule highlights, as there is worry that the chemicals in hair dyes can negatively affect your baby.Finally buy those new earrings that you’ve been eyeing up. Use your pregnancy as a reason to buy yourself something that makes you feel beautiful. Create a positive feeling about both your inner and outer beauty that you associate with that item, and anytime you need a bit of a “pick-me-up”, use that item to remind yourself that you are beautiful.

, One of the most important things that you can do is remember what your body is doing during pregnancy. It is growing, nourishing, and protecting another human being. All of the changes that are occurring are happening for a reason.


Try to associate with other mothers-to-be. Surrounding yourself with other women who are also going through the physical changes associated with having a baby can boost your confidence in yourself and your body, and in doing so, make you feel beautiful. In addition, you’ll be making friends who may be sources of fun and support once your baby comes.

, Besides the pregnancy “glow”, your body will change in many other ways. For example, you may notice your breasts increase 1-2 cup sizes, you lose your waistline as your belly expands, and you may have swollen ankles and fast-growing fingernails.One positive way to deal with these inevitable changes is to embrace and accentuate them. Once you embrace these changes, you are on your way to feeling beautiful.


Accentuate the positive aspects of your body to feel beautiful. Look for a feature (or several features) that you feel confidence about, and accentuate it. For example, wear a sleeveless shirt if you’ve got toned arms, a V-neck sweater to show off your new cleavage, or a long flowing dress to show off a newly-rounded belly.
If you are struggling to be positive, remember that your pregnancy is finite. You felt beautiful before your pregnancy, and you will feel beautiful after it as well.
If accentuating your pregnancy isn’t for you, minimize the attention drawn to your baby bump by wearing lose garments, solid colors, and layering your clothes (for example, wear a loose denim jacket over a button down shirt). You can also draw attention elsewhere, such as by wearing a vibrant headband, a cute scarf, or bright tights.

, Don’t worry about having the perfect shape or living up to the ideals you see in pregnancy magazines. Instead, focus on being healthy and happy in both body and spirit. You won’t know how your body will respond to pregnancy until you are actually pregnant.Try to give up the ideal image you may have had in your mind, and appreciate your body for what it is and for what it’s doing. Keep a positive attitude- this will help you feel beautiful.


Focus on the big picture. Your body isn’t changing because you’ve given up on taking care of yourself, your body is changing in order to help your baby come into this world as healthy and prepared as he can be."

Look out for implantation bleeding.,
Pay attention to sore breasts.,
Note feelings of fatigue.,
Wait for feelings of nausea.,
Notice food cravings or aversions.,
Watch for headaches, backaches and frequent urination.,
Determine if you have two or more of the early signs of pregnancy.,
Repeat the test in a week or opt to go to the doctor for a test.,
Make an appointment.",How to Know if You’re Pregnant if You Have Irregular Periods," Spotting or light bleeding six to 12 days after your last period could indicate a fertilized egg has embedded itself into your uterine wall.Some women may feel cramping, as if they're about to get their period.
The spotting can be mistaken for a light period, particularly if you have irregular periods.;
, Swollen and tender breast tissue is a sign that hormones are changing in your body. They can begin one to two weeks after conception. Your breasts might start to feel heavier, or fuller.If you frequently have tender breasts, move on to other symptoms to determine if pregnancy is likely.
Some women may even increase in bra size within a few weeks of getting pregnant. If this is the case, you may be pregnant.
Your areolas may also start to darken. This change is also caused by hormones from pregnancy., As your body adjusts to pregnancy, women usually start to feel tired and sluggish. This can occur as early as the week of conception.Fatigue is a result of increased progesterone, which makes you sleepy.
If there’s a chance you’re pregnant, avoid treating fatigue with caffeine. Caffeine isn't proven to be harmful at this early stage but if consumed in excess it can increase the chance of miscarriage. The exact amount is not known, but 200 mg is generally considered the cutoff.

, Morning sickness can start at about two weeks after conception and continue until eight weeks after conception. If you start to feel regular nausea, it is time to take an at-home pregnancy test.Nausea may also accompany food aversions. Some of your favorite foods may make you feel ill while you are pregnant.
Nausea may not always be accompanied by vomiting.
You may notice an increased sensitivity to smells. Even smells you may once have enjoyed may now trigger nausea.

, Even in early pregnancy, hormones alter your desire for particular foods. You may crave strange combinations of foods that you've never desired before. Your formerly favorite foods may cause nausea.You might notice a metallic taste in your mouth. This is normal in early pregnancy.
Many women report feeling disgusted by the smell of coffee when they're pregnant, even if they were heavy coffee drinkers before the pregnancy. If you find yourself nauseated by the smell of coffee, this may be a sign of pregnancy.

, These are characteristic signs of early pregnancy. They are caused by a combination of pregnancy hormones, a larger amount of blood in your system, and kidney function.It's okay to take some over-the-counter pain medication such as acetaminophen to help relieve pain from headaches and backaches. While ibuprofen is generally considered safe in early pregnancy, few physicians will recommend its use unless you are being closely monitored.
Instead of medication, consider treating aches with home remedies such as a warm bath, using a heating pad, getting a massage, etc.

, If you do, take an at-home pregnancy test. With most tests, you'll place the end of a dipstick into a small container of your urine, or move a testing stick into your urine flow. Within a few minutes, the dipstick should indicate results by changing colors, showing the words ""pregnant"" or ""not pregnant"" on the stick, or symbols.Most pregnancy tests will not be reliably accurate until the fifth week of pregnancy.
Instructions for home pregnancy tests vary. Follow the directions on the test you choose.
Home pregnancy tests check for the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) which accompanies pregnancy.

, Although at-home pregnancy tests rarely give false positives, they can give false negatives if it is early in the pregnancy. If you feel you are within a week or two of implantation, you should test twice.Take the home pregnancy test first thing in the morning when your urine is concentrated. Drinking too much fluid before taking a home pregnancy test can result in a false negative.
A false positive result can occur in cases where hormonal changes with menopause are occurring or if you are receiving HcG injections as part of infertility treatment.

, If you are consistently getting positive results in a home pregnancy test, or your symptoms of pregnancy persist despite getting negative results, call your gynecologist or family doctor. Blood tests that doctors perform can pick up on pregnancy quicker than at-home urine tests.The sooner your pregnancy is confirmed, the sooner you can learn about options. Your healthcare provider can discuss options for your pregnancy with you.
If you plan to continue your pregnancy, your healthcare provider can help you with prenatal care.

Eat pineapple.,
Eat spicy foods.,
Eat licorice.,
Eat garlic.,
Eat plenty of fiber.,
Drink red raspberry leaf tea.,
Drink cumin tea.",How to Induce Labor at Home1," Pineapple is one fruit that may trigger labor. It contains bromelain, which may help soften and “ripen” the cervix. This is a key stage in bringing on labor.Eat pineapple plain, drink pineapple juice, or make a fruit smoothie with pineapple.;
, Some people swear by spicy foods as a catalyst for labor. Mexican food or foods with hot chilis might help bring on labor. Be careful that these foods don’t give you indigestion in this late stage of pregnancy.


Some research shows that eating spicy foods might actually stave off labor, thanks to the capsaicin in some spicy foods. Capsaicin overtake naturally-occurring endorphins that help relieve pain., Black licorice is said to stimulate labor. Get natural licorice that contains less sugar. You can also get licorice in pill form. Licorice can stimulate cramps in the bowel by having a laxative effect. Bowel cramps may help induce uterine cramps., When you eat enough garlic, you may stimulate your bowels. This can cause you to empty your bowels, which gives room for the baby to move lower in your body. Once the baby moves down, it engages more with your uterus and cervix, readying your body for labor.Prepare foods with lots of garlic, as long as it doesn’t give you indigestion.

, Foods that are rich in fiber will help you avoid being constipated.If you are constipated, you will have a full bowel or rectum, which takes up space that the baby may need to move lower down in your body. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables during the last few weeks of your pregnancy. Eating prunes and other dried fruits can help as well.

, This tea can strengthen and tone the uterus, and can help the muscles start to contract. Brew a cup by pouring 6 ounces of boiling water over one tea bag. Let it steep for 3 minutes. Let it cool and drink.


Make red raspberry leaf iced tea in the summer for a refreshing drink.

, Cumin can be used for digestive problems and also to start menstruation and to relieve bloating.Brew a cup of tea using cumin seeds to bring on labor.


Add some sugar or honey to counteract the bitterness of the tea.

Rest on all fours.,
Don’t recline backward on the couch.,
Bounce on a birth ball.",How to Induce Labor at Home2," Resting on all fours will help the baby into a good position. When the baby’s head puts downward pressure on your cervix, the cervix starts to efface, or shortens and thins out. Resting on all fours for 10 minutes at a time, several times a day, can help move the baby’s head into the optimal position., You are probably exhausted at this late stage of pregnancy and ready to just relax. But reclining or sitting back on the couch can be counterproductive to making sure the baby is in the right position for labor. Instead, lay on the couch on your left side, slightly rolled forward. Prop yourself up with cushions to make it comfortable., A birth ball is a large bouncy ball (they are also used in exercising) that can help you sit comfortably towards the end of pregnancy. You can also use this ball to help you cope with labor. Sitting or bouncing on the ball, while spreading your legs wide, can help the baby move downward."
"
Go for a walk.,
Try galloping.,
Walk up a few flights of stairs.,
Clean the house.",How to Induce Labor at Home3," Walking can help stir the baby into moving downward in your body. Once the baby’s head puts pressure on the cervix, labor isn’t far behind. Try walking for 15-20 minutes. Getting out in the fresh air can also be beneficial.Try walking up a steep hill. This will force your body to lean forward at an angle. Leaning at a 40-45 degree angle can help the baby move in the right downward direction.

, Galloping, or moving one leg forward and hopping the back leg to catch up, can help jar the baby slightly. Be careful when trying this to make sure you don’t trip over your feet., Walking up stairs will force your body to lean at an angle (about 40-45 degrees), which can help the baby move lower down in your body. Be sure to hold onto the handrail to make sure you are ascending the stairs safely.Pounding your feet on each step can also help.

, Doing a semi-strenuous activity can help bring on labor. Cleaning out the garage, vacuuming, or mopping the floors gets your body moving, which can activate labor. You’ll have the added bonus of having a clean house when the baby is born.

Have sex.,
Stimulate your nipples.,
Use acupressure.,
Use reflexology.,
Try castor oil.",How to Induce Labor at Home4," Having sex with a partner can help release prostaglandins, which are similar to hormones in your body. Prostaglandins can bring on labor. Sperm from an ejaculation inside the vagina can help to soften and dilate the cervix, also readying the body for labor.Having an orgasm stimulates prostaglandins, so if you don’t feel comfortable having sex, you can still have an orgasm on your own.
Do not have sex if your water has already broken, as this can put you at risk for infection.

, Nipple stimulation is another way to induce uterine contractions. Use your thumb and forefinger to roll the nipple for 2 minutes. Give it a rest for 3 minutes. Continue this process for about 20 minutes. If you don’t feel any contractions, increase the rolling part to 3 minutes, with the rests lasting 2 minutes.


Use olive oil on your fingers to prevent irritation.

, Acupressure is similar to acupuncture, a traditional Chinese bodywork technique that promotes relaxation and healing. According to this healing technique, the body has acupoints through which energy flows.Applying direct, firm pressure to two of these points may help induce labor.To use acupressure:


Locate the pressure points, which are in the webbing between your thumb and your index finger and on your lower leg about 3 inches (8 cm) above the inside of your ankle bone.
Pinch the webbing of your hand. Rub for 30-60 seconds by moving in a circular motion.Press firmly with the tip of a finger or two fingers on the spot on your leg. Rub in a circular motion.
With either of these pressure points, stop rubbing when you have a contraction. Start rubbing again when the contraction stops.

, Reflexology is a method of using pressure points in the feet to trigger labor within 24-48 hours.Use the pressure points that correspond to the pituitary, bladder, solar plexus, and ovaries and uterus to activate your body into labor. Put direct, firm pressure on one of these points, or rub in a circular motion with firm pressure.Pituitary: Located on the big toe, this pressure point will activate the pituitary gland, which releases hormones like oxytocin.

Bladder: Located on the bottom of the foot near the instep, this pressure point can help the muscles around your uterus contract, which can in turn start uterine contractions.

Solar plexus: Located in the center of your foot sole, this point will help you relax and feel more balanced.

Ovaries and uterus: Located on your inner ankle, just below the malleolus (the bony part of the ankle that sticks out), this pressure point may be tender. This can jumpstart uterine contractions.
Do not attempt reflexology before you reach 38 weeks, which can put you at risk for preterm labor. Definitely do not try it in the first trimester of pregnancy, as it can put you at risk for a miscarriage., Inducing labor by ingesting castor oil happens by causing intestinal cramps and stimulating the bowels. By contracting intestinal and bowel muscles, you can cause uterine contractions. These methods will cause diarrhea, which can be extremely uncomfortable.Mix 2 ounces of castor oil in a glass of juice. Drink it all at once.
Alternately, you can try an in-home enema. However, use this method only once, and proceed with extreme caution. It can clear out your bowels and leave you quite dehydrated and uncomfortable.

"
Take evening primrose oil.,
Take cohosh.,
Try homeopathic remedies.",How to Induce Labor at Home5," Evening primrose oil contains prostaglandins, which is the hormone-like substance that induces contractions and helps soften the cervix. Take this oil orally in 500mg capsules 3 times a day. Alternately, insert a capsule at bedtime into the vagina. The moist environment of the vagina will melt the capsule and disperse the gel throughout the cervix.

, Cohosh root is a medicinal plant that can be used to treat symptoms of menstruation, menopause and osteoporosis, and to induce labor.It is available as black or blue cohosh root, typically in water-based or alcohol-based tincture form.Follow the dosing instructions on the package.


Black cohosh is thought to be more effective than blue cohosh.

, Homeopathic remedies such as pulsatilla and caulophyllum can be used to stimulate labor.Pulsatilla is often used to treat menstrual symptoms, as well as headaches and insomnia.Caulophyllum can also help tone the uterine muscles, which helps with productive contractions.Follow the dosing instructions on the package for both of these remedies.

"
"
Take a warm bath.,
Try visualization.,
Have a good cry.,
Get a massage.",How to Induce Labor at Home6," Sitting in a warm bath can help you relax your body and release tension in your muscles. Put a few drops of lavender essential oil into the water to help calm your mind.


Make sure the water is not so hot that your skin turns red. You don’t want to stress the baby with excessive heat.

, Sit in a meditative state and imagine the start of the birth process. Breathe deeply and visualize your contractions starting. Visualize your cervix dilating. Imagine your baby moving further down your body to the birth canal.Search online for an audio meditation for inducing labor. These are often available as downloadable mp3 tracks. They may also be available by searching for “hypnobirthing,” which uses similar techniques to sustain you throughout the entire natural birthing process., Crying can release tension in your body, which can help your body relax enough to bring on labor. This point in your pregnancy can be a very stressful time, so give yourself the opportunity to cry it out.


Grab a box of tissues and watch a good tearjerker movie to get the tears started if you need to.

, Getting a relaxing massage can be a great way to help your body stay calm. Make sure your massage practitioner is knowledgeable about giving prenatal massage. When you are getting your massage, lie down on your left side with a pillow between your knees to support your body.

Know when a would doctor will induce labor.,
Expect the doctor's first action to be to strip the membrane from the amniotic sac.,
Expect the doctor to potentially break your water manually.,
Prepare to be prescribed prostaglandin, a natural hormone.,
Expect to be prescribed oxytocin through an IV at the hospital.,
With your doctor, understand the risks of inducing labor.",How to Induce Labor at Home7," If you are committed to a home birth, you should still have a doctor or midwife present. Most doctors will not rush to induce labor unless there are extenuating circumstances, including when:


Your water breaks, but there are no contractions.
You are two weeks past your due date.
You have an uterine infection
You have gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, or not enough amniotic fluid.
There is a problem with the placenta or baby's positioning/growth., With gloved fingers, the doctor will reach into the cervix and rub the membrane of the amniotic sac until it separates from the uterine wall. Naturally-released hormones then usually kick-start labor., Known medically as a ""amniotomy,"" the doctor uses a thin hook to break the amniotic sac. This almost always brings on labor within a few hours.


While it is short, this may be painful and uncomfortable.

, It may be applied directly to the vagina or taken orally. This usually happens in a hospital, and it thins out the cervix to prepare it for labor.


This often leads to strong cramping and some pain., This is generally for slowed or stalling labor. In emergencies, like those outlined above, it can also help induce labor.


Labor induced with oxytocin often leads to more frequent contractions., These strategies do not always work, especially if the body is not quite ready to go into labor. If you've tried to induce labor and it failed, it is imperative to get to a medical facility. The following risks and precautions should be carefully minded:


Infection (especially if water has broken)
Tears in the uterine wall
Late pre-term babies (beginning labor prematurely)
Irregular contractions."

Understand that treatment is based on how far along you are in your pregnancy.,
Get an injection of amniotic fluid.,
Get fluid intravenously.,
Use a catheter to increase fluid levels.,
Talk to your doctor about having a shunt placed in your body.",How to Increase Amniotic Fluid1," The recommendations your doctor will have for treatment will be based on how far along in your pregnancy you are. Generally, your doctor will recommend one of the treatments listed in this section, as well as rehydration at home, which is outlined in the second section of this article.If you are not yet in full term, your doctor will monitor you and your levels very closely. Tests such as non-stress and contraction stress tests may be done to monitor your baby’s activity. Your doctor may also suggest one of the following medical treatments listed in this method.
If you are close to full term, your doctor may recommend that you deliver your baby via cesarean section as low amniotic fluid levels right before pregnancy can be dangerous for both you and your baby.;
, In this process, your doctor will inject the leaking amniotic fluids back into the amniotic sac with a needle. This will help your condition because it will increase the amount of amniotic fluid in your uterus. This procedure is a lot like amniocentesis (a way to check your amniotic fluid levels), except that instead of withdrawing the amniotic fluid, the doctor injects the leaking amniotic fluids back into the amniotic sac with a needle. This procedure is often used as a short term fix because amniotic fluid levels tend to drop again after a couple of weeks. However, doctors choose to use this method because it helps them to find the problem that is causing your amniotic fluid levels to be low.

, Some pregnant women are admitted to the hospital for additional intravenous fluid therapy if natural means of rehydration (like drinking lots of water) are not able to increase the amount of amniotic fluid. If you have tried rehydrating at home with no changes in amniotic fluid levels, you will most likely have to get an IV to stay hydrated.Once your amniotic fluid levels are back to normal, you will most likely be discharged.
Keep in mind that sometimes IV therapy will continue until you are ready to give birth if you are having troubles staying hydrated.

, Amnioinfusion is when Lactated Ringer’s Solution or a regular saline solution is infused into the amniotic fluid sac by a catheter. Doing this increases the amniotic fluid levels around your baby and provides extra padding for your baby and the umbilical cord.The amount of saline injected will depend on how low your amniotic fluid levels are.

, Shunts are used to move body fluid from one place in your body to another. In this case, a shunt diverts fetal urine into your amniotic fluid cavity if the reason you have low amniotic fluid levels is because of fetal obstructive uropathy (kidney problems that decrease amniotic fluid)."

Drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water each day.,
Eat fruits that have water contents.,
Avoid herbal supplements that can dehydrate you.,
Stay away from alcohol.,
Do light exercise regularly if your doctor has not asked you to get bed rest.,
Lie on your left side when you relax.,
Talk to your doctor about changing your prescription if you are taking Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE).",How to Increase Amniotic Fluid2," One of the simplest ways to increase your amniotic fluid is to make sure that you are always hydrated. When you increase the amount of water you have in your body, your amniotic fluid levels will also rise.Drink water throughout the day and try to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses at a minimum.

, A great way to stay hydrated while also getting good nutrients is to eat fruits and vegetables that have high water concentrations. As stated above, when you increase the amount of hydration your body gets, you will also increase the amount of amniotic fluid you have. Good fruits and vegetables to eat when needing hydration include:


Vegetables like: Cucumber (96.7% water), iceberg lettuce (95.6%), celery (95.4%), radishes (95.3%), green peppers (93.9%), cauliflower (92.1%), spinach (91.4%), broccoli (90.7%), and baby carrots (90.4%).
Fruits like: Watermelon (91.5%), tomatoes (94.5%), star fruit (91.4%), strawberries (91.0%), grapefruit (90.5%), and cantaloupe (90.2%).

, Some herbal supplements can act as diuretics that make you have to urinate more. The more you go to the bathroom, the likelier you are to become dehydrated. It is very important that you stay hydrated when you are concerned about your levels of amniotic fluid. Herbal supplements to stay away from include:


Dandelion extract, celery seed, watercress, and parsley., If you are pregnant, you should not drink alcohol at all because it is not good for your baby’s health. Alcohol can also dehydrate you and cause your amniotic fluid levels to shrink.

, You should try to get at least 30 to 45 minutes of non-weight bearing exercise every day. Exercises promote an increased blood flow to the different areas in your body. If there is an increased blood circulating in the uterus and placenta, there is also an increase in the amniotic fluid index and fetal urine production rate (the amount your baby urinates). As your baby passes more urine in the amniotic sac, the volume of the amniotic fluid increases. Exercises you should consider doing include:


Swimming or water aerobics. These are the best exercises to do when you are pregnant because it takes all the weight of your baby off of you.
Walking and light hiking.

, If your doctor has asked you to stay in bed (what is referred to as complete bed rest) you should lay on your left side when you can. When you lie on your left side, your blood flows more smoothly through the uterine blood vessels and allows your baby’s blood flow to also move at a regular rate. This may cause the amniotic fluid index to rise.

, ACE inhibitors are medications that help to lower your high blood pressure by stopping your body’s conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. While it is normally good to take these medications, you should not take them while you are pregnant because they can lower the amount of amniotic fluid that your body creates."
"
Understand what amniotic fluid’s purpose is.,
Be aware of the symptoms of oligohydramnios.,
Be aware of the risk factors that could lead you to having low amounts of amniotic fluid.,
Understand that low levels of amniotic fluid can generally only be diagnosed by ultrasound.",How to Increase Amniotic Fluid3," The most important thing that amniotic fluid does is keep your baby safe while he or she is in the womb. It does this by cushioning your baby. It also has other functions, which include:


Keeping the baby warm.
Acting as a lubricant. Sometimes, some babies are born with webbed fingers and toes due to insufficient amount of amniotic fluid.
Promoting proper lung and kidney development.
Helping the baby move freely, which in turn lets him/her exercise the limbs and become strong.

, Oligohydramnios is the condition that occurs when your amniotic fluid gets very low (specifically below 300 ml). If you are concerned that you might have developed this condition, you should always talk to your doctor. If you are concerned you might develop the condition in the future, it is helpful to know what to look for. Symptoms include:


Leakage of amniotic fluid.
Your abdomen is smaller than you think it should be given your gestational period (how long you have been pregnant).
Feeling like your baby is moving around less.
Smaller than expected urine amounts when you go to the bathroom.
Visible lack of amniotic fluid when you get an ultrasound.

, There are some conditions or factors that can predispose you to having troubles with your amniotic fluid amounts. Some of the more common reasons include:


If your baby is small for his or her gestational age.
If you have high blood pressure while you are pregnant (a condition called pre-eclampsia).
If your placenta partially or completely peels away from your uterine wall even before the onset of delivery. This condition is known as abruptio placenta.
If you are having identical twins. If identical twins share a placenta, sometimes their amniotic fluid levels become out of balance. This happens when one twin gets more blood via the placenta than the other.
If you have certain medical conditions like lupus.
If you are in post-term pregnancy. If your pregnancy has gone over 42 weeks, you have a higher risk of low levels of amniotic fluid due to declining placental function – amniotic fluid starts to decrease by the 38th week of pregnancy.

, The actual volume of amniotic fluid cannot be safely measured directly so the condition is diagnosed by using ultrasounds that check the amniotic fluid index (AFI).A normal AFI range is between 5 and 25 cm.

Hug someone.,
Offer affectionate touch.,
Have sex.,
Spend quality time with your partner.,
Share words of encouragement with another person.,
Smile.,
Give an animal some love.",How to Increase Oxytocin Levels1," Even a 20-second hug with your partner, a friend, or someone you care about can boost your oxytocin level. Offer or ask for a hug for a quick pick-me-up.Even if you’re arguing with a loved one, pausing to hug can increase feelings of trust and empathy, and maybe make your disagreement easier to handle.
Regularly hugging your partner helps you bond, and can even decrease your blood pressure and heart rate.;
, If hugging isn’t your thing, there are many ways to offer affectionate touch that increase your oxytocin. Hold hands with a loved one, cuddle, pet your child’s hair, kiss, or hold onto your friend’s arm while you walk.Stand close to each other, when you can. Physical proximity increases oxytocin – which may even promote fidelity between partners., A healthy sex life often correlates with higher wellbeing and happiness for both women and men. Having sex – in a healthy, consensual environment – boosts your oxytocin level. It can help you de-stress and promote feelings of warmth and trust between you and your partner.You may get an extra oxytocin boost if you have an orgasm, but if you don’t, it’s okay – you’ll still get the positive benefits of sex with a loving partner., Not all affection with your partner has to be physical to boost oxytocin. Share bonding moments together to accomplish the same thing – quality time, arousal, and wellbeing are all linked in terms of your hormones. Find a way to carve some special time out of your week to bond with your partner.Try doing a workout together to get the added hormone boost from exercise! Go on a bike ride, a run, swim together, or go to the park and throw around a Frisbee or football.
Do a jigsaw puzzle together, or work on a crossword or Sudoku – something collaborative and stress-free.
Go on an adventure together – explore a new part of your town you’ve never been to, or take a day trip!
Do a home-improvement project together. Plant a tree, weed the garden, repaint your bedroom, or build something for your yard like a bench or birdhouse.
Prepare and share a healthy meal together.Do something moderately stressful like riding a roller coaster or sky diving – this is a great bonding experience, and moderately stressful activities cause a spike in oxytocin., Kind words may be as powerful as touch when it comes to oxytocin. Whether you are giving or receiving a compliment or words of encouragement, you get an oxytocin boost. Call up your best friend or a family member, or even express kind words to a co-worker – you’ll improve their day, and get a mood boost yourself.Be genuine – empty words won’t accomplish anything. Dig deep and find a true, positive sentiment to express.
Spend time with friends and loved ones whenever possible, but also stay connected with those who are far away. Even loving emails, text messages, and Facebook comments help you feel supported and cared for, and boost oxytocin and mood., Even when you’re in a bad mood, smiling can make you feel better – even if you force it. Smiling and laughing boost your oxytocin and can improve your overall health. If you feel terrible, fake it! Often the hormone boost will turn your fake smile into a real one.Tell someone your favorite joke or a story that always makes you laugh.
Pull out your phone and look at that cute picture of your dog, cat, or child that always brings a smile to your face.
Watch your favorite goofy movie and giggle a little.
Smile at strangers.

, If you can, get a pet. Just playing with or petting your dog or cat causes an increase in oxytocin. If you’re an “animal person,” sharing cuddles with someone else’s pet may do the same. Or spend some time being charitable by volunteering at your local animal shelter as a dog walker. There’s often a position called “animal socializer,” who just pets cats and dogs all day long! This is healthy for you and a great kindness to them.Make frequent eye contact with your dog – studies show this boosts your oxytocin, and your dog’s oxytocin, too! Gazing into each other’s eyes promotes the same kind of bonding, and chemical response, as mothers and babies looking into each other’s eyes."

Exercise every day.,
Meditate on gratitude.,
Volunteer.,
Cry, if you need to.,
Spend some time being creative.,
Listen to soothing music.",How to Increase Oxytocin Levels2," You don’t have to go to the gym every day to get the benefits of exercise on your oxytocin level (though regular cardio exercise helps your body in many other ways). Even walking daily boosts your oxytocin level, along with other “feel good” hormones like dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin.Try to walk 10,000 steps every day. That’s the equivalent of about 5 miles, but many people get half that from day-to-day activities. Boost your steps by mowing the lawn, walking your dog, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and running errands by foot. Get a pedometer to help you keep track and stay motivated.

, Meditation calms your body and your mind, and decreases your stress level. It boosts oxytocin, too – oxytocin and the stress hormone cortisol have an inverse relationship; when one goes up, the other goes down. Pump up your calming hormones with daily meditation that focuses on what you’re grateful for – even 5 minutes a day can help.Prayer and yoga work similarly – anything that connects your body and your breathing, slows your down, and helps you focus on positive things and gratitude.

, Volunteer your time, give old clothes or goods to those in need, and spend some time giving thanks for what you have. Charity and gratitude boost your good hormones, help you feel better, and of course help others.Even giving someone a small gift – with no expectation of something in return – raises oxytocin., Don’t suppress your troubling emotions – this decreases your oxytocin level. Staying calm in the moment is always important, but then take time to process and express your difficult feelings. Cry if you need to. Punch your pillow. Yell at the wall. Write a scathing letter that you don’t send. Let your feelings out in a non-aggressive way for an oxytocin boost., Whether it’s with music, art, writing, or whatever your unique form of expression is, creative expression boosts your mood and positive hormones., All of your senses, when stimulated positively, can pump up your oxytocin level. Take some time to relax and listen to some calming music of your choice. Boost the experience with scented candles, or do it while soaking in a warm bath."

Discuss inducing labor with your OB/GYN.,
Try nipple stimulation.,
Get oxytocin medication at the hospital.,
Breastfeed your baby, if possible.",How to Increase Oxytocin Levels3," Inducing labor – using physical means or oxytocin medicines to start the labor process – is becoming very common, though it’s best saved for when it’s safer to deliver the baby than have the baby stay in the uterus. If you’re considering inducing labor, talk to your OB/GYN and prepare yourself for a hospital stay. Labor is most commonly induced because:Pregnancy has lasted longer than 42 weeks.
The mother is experiencing a health issue like high blood pressure, bleeding during pregnancy, heart disease, gestational diabetes, or a condition called preeclampsia.
The baby is in distress, or is at risk of not getting enough oxygen or nutrition from the placenta.
The mother’s water broke 24-48 hours ago but labor hasn’t started yet.
There’s an infection present in or around the placenta or amniotic sac.

, A natural way to boost your oxytocin level to start labor is with nipple stimulation. You can use a mechanical breast pump, or gently squeeze and touch your nipples yourself., When all else fails, you can be given a medicine called Pitocin® – a form of oxytocin – at the hospital. You’ll get it intravenously, through an IV needle into your vein, or as a shot in your arm. This strong form of oxytocin starts contractions or makes them much stronger.If you’re given Pitocin®, you’ll remain in the hospital until the baby is born so you can be monitored.
Getting oxytocin for labor can sometimes make contractions too strong, and hard to manage without pain medications.Rarely, medical oxytocin can cause more serious problems – let your doctor know right away if you develop confusion, headache, drowsiness, or seizures after you get this medicine.

, Breastfeeding has many positive effects for your new baby, but it also increases your oxytocin level. This helps alleviate stress and promotes feelings of bonding with your baby.If you cannot breastfeed, consider using nipple stimulation with a mechanical pump every time you give your baby formula. You may still get the hormonal benefits of breastfeeding.

Increase the use of your diaphragm while breathing.,
Use deep breathing.,
Try the humming breath.,
Do a Chinese breathing exercise.",How to Increase Oxygen Flow During Pregnancy1," Many people take short, shallow breaths in their everyday life. This limits your oxygen intake. To increase your oxygen intake, pay attention to how you breathe. If you find that your breaths are short and from the shoulders, you are taking shallow chest breaths. Instead, try to breathe from your diaphragm every couple of breaths, which will pull in more oxygen.


To do this, focus on your breathing. Instead of lifting your shoulders when you breathe, keep them down. Pull your breath into your nose or mouth with your diaphragm, which should push your stomach out.;
, If you want to increase your oxygen intake, you can try different breathing exercises, such as deep breathing. To start, lie flat on your back with pillow under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Place your hands on your belly right below the rib cage, palm down and fingers closed. Breathe in for one long, deep breath. Use the muscles in your belly to expand it out, moving your fingers away from one another as your belly fills with air. Hold it in for a moment, absorbing the oxygen. Then exhale slowly.


Repeat this exercise for about five minutes.
At first, you may feel dizzy because of all the extra oxygen. If you do get dizzy, take a few normal breaths, then return to this exercise once you feel better.
As you get farther along in your pregnancy, it may be harder for you to use your hands for this exercise. If this is the case, just put your hands where it is comfortable and breathe in and out as deeply as you can, watching to see if your belly rises and falls., There is a variation on the deep breathing exercise that can help strengthen your diaphragm, which will help you breathe deeper every day and increase your oxygen flow during pregnancy. Start by following the steps for deep breathing. When you exhale, make a humming sound. This will work your diaphragm muscles as you exhale.


If you feel dizzy while doing this exercise, stop right away. , The Chinese breathing exercise will help get a lot of air into your body at one time. To start, sit down in a chair, on a bench, or the edge of a bed. First, take one short inhalation of breath, lifting your arms and reaching in front of you with your arms at shoulder level. Next, take another short inhalation of breath without exhaling, moving your arms to the side at shoulder level. Last, take one final short inhalation of breath without exhaling, lifting your arms over your head. Then exhale.


Repeat this 10 to 12 times.
If you get dizzy at all, stop immediately and return your breathing to normal."

Strengthen your biceps.,
Try overhead extensions.,
Do triceps extensions.,
Perform leg extensions.,
Try swimming.,
Do prenatal yoga.,
Stretch more.,
Stay active.",How to Increase Oxygen Flow During Pregnancy2," Exercising your muscles allows them to extract more oxygen from your blood than they do while at rest. Since your body needs 20% more oxygen during pregnancy, it is beneficial for your muscles to be more efficient at taking oxygen from the bloodstream. While you are pregnant, it is good to work on your arm muscles because arm exercises are low-impact. Grab one to two pound weights to begin with and hold your arms down at your sides with one weight in each hand. Bend your elbows at the waist and bring your arm up towards your chest, pulling it all the way up and holding for five seconds. Slowly lower it down and switch to the other arm.


Repeat on each side eight to 10 times.
As you get stronger, you can increase your weight a little bit. But take it easy. You don’t want to strain yourself., These will help your biceps, triceps, and shoulders. Grab a weight with each hand. Start with your arms straight down in front of you. Slowly raise your arms straight out in front of you. Hold them there for five to 10 seconds. Next, lift your arms above your head. Hold them here for five to 10 seconds. Lower your arms to the bottom and rest a moment.


Repeat this exercise eight to 10 times., Tricep extensions help strengthen your tricep muscles. To start these exercises, grab a one to two pound weight with both hands. Raise both your hands hands above your head. Bend your arm at the elbow, lowering your hands behind your head. Hold them down for five to 10 seconds. Then straighten them back above your head. Repeat the exercise eight times.


As you lower the weights towards your head, be sure you don’t hit your head with the weight., Your feet and legs may swell a lot while you are pregnant. Keeping good circulation may help reduce swelling and get more oxygen into your body. Start by putting on 1- to 2-pound ankle weights on each leg. Sit in a chair or other flat surface. Slowly lift your legs off the floor and straighten them in front of you. Hold this pose for five to 10 seconds. Slowly lower them to the ground. Repeat eight to 10 times.


To add an element to the exercise that will strengthen your core, lay down on your back, preferably on a sofa, bed, or other comfortable area to reduce discomfort. Raise one leg as high as you can straight up in the air and hold it there for five to 10 seconds. Slowly lower your leg. Repeat this exercise eight to 10 times on this leg. Then, switch legs and repeat eight to 10 times on the opposite side.
You can also add a set while lying down where you lift both legs into the air at once, hold them up for five to 10 seconds, then slowly lower them. Repeat eight to 10 times.
If you want work your hips, lay down on your side and lift your leg up as high as it will go. Hold for five to 10 seconds, then slowly lower it. Repeat eight to 10 times, then turn over and repeat on the other side., Swimming is a great way to keep your circulation strong while you are pregnant. You can move around with little to no impact from the added weight of your pregnancy. Try swimming in your own pool if you have one or going to the local swimming pool.


You can also look into classes that may have swimming programs for pregnant women., Another low-impact exercise that helps improve circulation is yoga. This exercise is low-impact and has the added benefit of relaxing you as well.


Many yoga studios have special programs for pregnant women. Look into a program you can work into your schedule., To help get your blood flowing, you should stretch more. The stretches do not need to be hard or elaborate stretches. You just need to move all the parts of your body and gently stretch all your muscles. Talk to your obstetrician or midwife about specific stretching exercises for your particular stage of pregnancy., While you are pregnant, you should keep active and stay moving. You don’t have to do difficult or crazy exercise — and they really shouldn’t be while you are pregnant. Small exercises will help improve your blood flow and improve oxygen flow as well. Remember to breathe deeply as much as you can while you exercise to increase oxygen intake.


Try simple things, such as bending and straightening your legs at the knees and rotating your ankles. Flex your toes out and then back in. Take nice walks and swing your arms as you walk."

Talk to your partner.,
Answer questions about pregnancy plans vaguely.,
Find ways to side step uncomfortable questions.,
Make excuses for dietary changes.,
Ask close friends and family members to keep things private.",How to Keep Pregnancy Plans Secret1," Before you start actively avoiding questions from anyone, talk to you partner to ensure you are both on the same page. If you have a partner for this pregnancy, let them know what you want and listen to what they want regarding letting others know. Set some rules together regarding how you will each deal with questions. This helps keep your story more consistent, and takes both of your feelings into account.

You may, for example, decide that neither of you will tell friends or coworkers until a certain date, but allow each of you to tell your family on your own terms.;
, Oftentimes, people start asking about plans regarding future children if you're recently married or settled. If you don't want people to know you're planning to get pregnant, offer vague answers. Give people enough information that they will feel satisfied without having to go into a detailed plan.For example, say something like, ""I think I would want kids sometime in the future"" or ""My spouse and I are still figuring out the right timing for kids.""

, If you're trying to get pregnant, some people may notice changes. You may start eating healthier, for example, or cut out certain foods. If you feel strange outright lying, find ways to side step questions. This way, people may get the hint a certain question is off limits.For example, if someone asks about your sudden health food kick, start talking about new recipes you've found instead of offering an explanation. This will steer the conversation away from questions about your eating habits.

, You do not always have to side step uncomfortable questions. White lies can be acceptable, especially with something as sensitive and private as pregnancy. If someone asks why you're abstaining from caffeine, alcohol, or other foods, just make something up.For example, say something like, ""Coffee keeps me up at night, so I'm trying to cut back."" You can also try something like, ""I have a long ride home, so I'm going to skip the wine tonight.""

, A close friend or family member may figure out you're trying to conceive. They may see a pregnancy test, for example. You also may want to open up to close friends and family members if you're stressed about the process. If someone finds out, make it clear you want to keep things mostly private for now.For example, say something like, ""I really only want a few people to know I'm trying right now, so please don't mention this to anyone else. Thanks!""

Keep your story simple.,
Come up with an excuse for abstaining from coffee and alcohol.,
Alter your wardrobe.,
Decide when you're ready to tell people.",How to Keep Pregnancy Plans Secret2," If you want to keep your pregnancy a secret for awhile, there's no reason to come up with a complicated lie. When explaining odd behavior or changes, keep things simple. A lie may be hard to maintain.For example, do not invent an imaginary cleanse diet to explain abstaining from alcohol and caffeine. You can simply say that you're making different dietary choices for your health.
The more lies you create, the more you will need to remember, and the more lies you will have to tell in the future. It is best to simply not start lying in the first place. Vague answers work just as well, and they do not come with the stress of maintaining several fake stories.

, If you're a big coffee drinker or a frequent attender of work happy hour, people may notice if your drinking habits suddenly change. Find a few quick ways to address this that will squelch pregnancy rumors.For example, say something like, ""I've been having trouble sleeping, so I'm cutting back on caffeine"" or ""I'm trying to cut back on sugar, which means less wine and cocktails.""
At social events, you can accept a beer or cocktail from a co-worker or friend and merely pretend to be sipping. Later, you can hand it to your spouse or another party-goer. In a big enough crowd, people will hardly notice you're not drinking your drinks.

, If you start to show and aren't ready to announce your pregnancy, alter your wardrobe. Go for looser outfits that can conceal your growing stomach.Go for loose-fitting dresses, such as tank top dresses, that do not cling to your stomach.
Opt for more relaxed clothing when possible. Go for loose-fitting t-shirts over form-fitted blouses.
Do not completely overhaul your style. People may get suspicious. Pick things similar to what you regularly wear, but looser than normal.

, People have different feelings about when to reveal a pregnancy. There is no right time to do it. As you get farther along in your pregnancy, start thinking about the right time for you to make your announcement.Many people prefer to reveal their pregnancy after 12 weeks, as this is the point where the chance of a miscarriage decreases. However, there is nothing wrong with revealing your pregnancy sooner or later.

Be upfront if you don't want visitors at the hospital.,
Explain why privacy is important during labor and delivery.,
Offer to introduce the baby later.",How to Keep Pregnancy Plans Secret3," Close family members and friends may want to present for your labor and delivery. Parents especially may want to be at the hospital when a grandchild is born. However, you have every right to privacy during labor. Do not feel guilty about requesting privacy.Remember, no one has a right to be in the delivery room but you and your doctor, nurse, or midwife. If you prefer a private birth, do not feel guilty letting friends and family members know.
If anyone expresses hurt feelings at your decision, remind them it is not personal. You are making the right choice for you and are entitled to a delivery that makes you feel comfortable.

, Many new moms appreciate visitors at the hospitals and want friends and family members waiting when they go into labor. However, for various reasons, you may prefer to give birth alone. If this is the case, be upfront.Explain your feelings to close friends and family members who were planning to be there for the birth. For example, ""I'm very stressed about the pregnancy and want to keep things as private as possible. If I'm exhausted during or after birth, I do not think I would want visitors. I would prefer just me and my spouse be present for my labor and I don't want a crowd in the waiting room.""

, You do not have to explain anything as you have a right to privacy. However, if someone people are hurt and confused, it can help to explain. If you're comfortable doing so, let people know why you're choosing to keep your labor and delivery private.For example, you may want the first news people to hear is that your baby arrived safely. The idea of people waiting in the lobby may stress you out. Say as much.
Say something like, ""I don't want to have to worry about other people's stress while I'm giving birth. I would just rather let people know when that the baby's safe once its born.""

, Consider hosting a gathering or small party once the baby is home. This can allow you a controlled space to introduce the baby to your family and friends without the stress of having them at the hospital. This may also help them feel more included.Keep the gathering small, causal, and among close individuals. This will help reduce stress and keep things on the parent's terms.

Keep a food diary to track the foods you eat daily.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat smaller meals more frequently.,
Eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly.,
Get 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily for regular bowel movements.",How to Help Ease Gas During Pregnancy1," Doing so will help you evaluate which foods are causing you particular digestive problems. Different foods are triggers for different people, but pay special attention to common gas-causing foods such as beans, peas, whole grains, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, asparagus, and onions.


If dairy products are causing you problems, try replacing regular dairy products with lactose-free milk or other calcium-rich foods.You may also try consuming dairy products with active cultures such as yogurt or kefir. These cultures aid in digestion.Avoid consuming fried or fatty foods or artificial sweeteners. Consider adding a fermented food such as kimchee or sauerkraut to your diet. The beneficial bacteria in these foods can aid in digestion.Keep in mind that you won't want to eliminate all gas-causing foods from your diet. Consuming adequate fiber and a variety of nutrient-rich foods is vital during pregnancy and helps prevent constipation, which is another big problem in pregnancy. Noting which foods cause you the greatest problems, however, will help you plan your diet. You may opt, for example, to avoid problem foods when out in public or before an important meeting.;
, Staying hydrated will help you eliminate constipation, which can cause additional gas and bloating.


Drink from a glass without using a straw to ensure you avoid sucking in excess air.
Minimize your consumption of carbonated drinks to avoid ingesting gas bubbles., While you need to consume additional food overall during pregnancy, your slower digestive system may not be able to tolerate as much food at one time as it used to. Smaller, more frequent meals will help you ensure your digestive system does not become overloaded., A majority of gas is produced when bacteria in your large intestine break down food that has not been digested thoroughly by the enzymes in your stomach. Breaking down your food by chewing will lessen the load on your intestinal bacteria and reduce your gas production., Although foods that contain fiber may cause you to produce more gas, they will also help to ensure that you have regular bowel movements, which may help with gas. Maintaining good bowel health during pregnancy is also important to avoid constipation. Make sure to include some god sources of fiber in your diet, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Aim for 25 to 30 grams of fiber every day to help prevent constipation and promote regular bowel movements."

Exercise regularly.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Consider doing yoga.",How to Help Ease Gas During Pregnancy2," Exercise helps stimulate digestion. This means your food will move through your intestinal tract more quickly -- and produce less gas along the way. Check with your health care provider before beginning a new exercise regimen., Tight clothing around your waist can further constrict a digestive system that is already being crowded by your growing uterus. If your pants or skirts are causing welts in your skin, consider replacing them with looser garments., Three yoga positions, in particular, will help reduce gas and are feasible while pregnant. All three are done while on all fours:


The pelvic rock or ""cat"" position involves arching your pelvis up like a cat, then gently dropping it down to make a hollow in the small of your back.
The side-to-side or pelvic ""rock"" position involves arching sideways to the right, bringing your head and rear end close together, then gently arching yourself sideways to the left -- just like you're wagging your ""tail.""
The circular rock position involves rolling your pelvis around as if you were belly dancing, but while on all fours."

Try peppermint.,
Use an over-the-counter product containing simethicone.,
Consult your doctor if your symptoms become more serious.",How to Help Ease Gas During Pregnancy3," Peppermint products have long been used as a natural remedy for gas. Look for peppermint caps that are enteric coated, which means they can pass through your stomach and into your intestines before dissolving. This will give you a dose of peppermint where it is most needed.


You can also make tea from peppermint leaves to soothe your digestive tract., These products are safe to use during pregnancy, though it is still a good idea to check in with your doctor to ensure they're a good choice for your medical needs. Only turn to over-the-counter medications if dietary changes have failed to make a substantial difference in your symptoms., Contact your doctor immediately if your gas symptoms move beyond discomfort into the realm of actual pain, or if you notice severe diarrhea or blood in your stool."

As with the rest of your recovery, give it time to heal, but do takes steps to mitigate pain and avoid infection.Sit on a pillow to ease discomfort.
Use a squeeze bottle filled with warm water to cleanse after using the bathroom. Squirt a stream where you would normally use toilet paper, which can be irritating immediately after giving birth.
Use an ice pack or chilled witch hazel pad to alleviate pain.
Try painkillers or stool softeners (after talking to your doctor).
Talk to your doctor if you experience fever or intense pain, the wound becomes swollen or hot, or you notice discharge.

, Even if you did not have an episiotomy or vaginal tear during delivery, you will likely experience bleeding and a discharge called lochia for about two weeks (and perhaps intermittently for the next two months). Wear pads, not tampons, to deal with this.If your hospital offers disposable mesh underwear, take it. They won’t be enough to control the bleeding on their own, but they make a great foundation for pads. You can even wear them if you have had a C-section., Giving birth puts a strain on your pelvic floor, bladder, and urethra, leading to a number of problems with urination. These problems will usually go away on their own, but wear sanitary pads and try Kegel exercises in the meantime.Tighten your pelvic muscles (the same action you use to stop urinating).
Hold for five seconds, then relax.
Do this five times in a row.
Work your way up to tightening for ten seconds, then relaxing for ten seconds.
Do this three times a day in sets of ten repetitions.

, Whether or not you plan on breastfeeding, you may experience swelling, tenderness, and firmness in your breasts. Depending on your plans, there are a number of different ways to relieve this discomfort.If you are planning to breastfeed, try nursing, pumping, placing warm washcloths over your breasts, or taking a warm shower. Try cold washcloths or ice packs after nursing.
If you are not planning on breastfeeding, you don’t want to engage in any behaviors that will encourage milk production. Refrain from pumping your breasts, and wear a structured bra. This will help stop milk production, causing your symptoms to go away.
Regardless of your plans, pain relievers may help. Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are fine to use while breastfeeding, as are most medications. Ask your doctor if you have any questions., If you feel pain or swelling when you use the bathroom, you might have hemorrhoids, a common and uncomfortable post-pregnancy symptom. Take steps to ease this discomfort.Soak in the bathtub. Make sure the water is warm, not hot.
Use chilled witch hazel pads where you are experiencing discomfort.
Talk to your doctor about topical prescription medications.
Eat foods high in fiber to regulate and soften bowel movements.
Talk to your doctor about stool softeners or laxatives.

, Some women experience thyroid problems after giving birth, called postpartum thyroiditis. This usually involves a period of hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism. Postpartum thyroiditis can be hard to diagnose because its symptoms—tiredness, trouble sleeping, lack of energy, and weight changes—overlap with symptoms many women experience after giving birth, anyway.


In most women, thyroid problems go away on their own in about a year.
Talk to your doctor if symptoms persist.

, This includes exercise, sex, and other vigorous activity. Everyone’s recovery differs, however, so talk to your doctor before jumping back into anything.

, You are recovering from surgery, so you might find that the hospital wants to keep you for two or three days. This extended time is for a number of reasons:Intravenous pain management. Once you are awake from anesthesia, you may be given a pump that lets you manage the flow yourself.
Monitored movement. Your doctor will want you to get up and moving as soon as possible. While this can be difficult, it can speed your recovery, regulate digestion, and ward off blood clots.
Care for the surgery site. Your doctor will want to make sure that your incision does not become infected.

, Neither the incision itself nor the medications you are taking for pain management should interfere with breastfeeding. If you want to pursue this method, feel free to do so as soon as you are able.In fact, pain medication can actually make breastfeeding easier. Pain makes it more difficult to release oxytocin, which is necessary for milk production.
Hospital staff can help you find a position in which you can breastfeed while still supporting yourself.

, Just as you spent a bit longer in the hospital than someone with a vaginal birth might, your at-home recovery will take a little longer, too—at least twelve weeks.Observing these guidelines will make your recovery easier in the long run:Don’t overdo it physically. At first, this means that you will want to get up as little as possible. Try to keep everything you need close enough that you can reach it. At the very least, restrict your movements to one floor--you should avoid stairs as much as possible in the first few weeks.
Don’t do any heavy lifting. In the first few weeks, this means anything heavier than your baby. Try not to lift anything from a squatting position.
Use extra pillows or a pregnancy belt to support the surgery site.
Drink water. This will ease digestion and help replace lost fluids.
Take pain medication if you need it.
Wait until your doctor says it’s OK before having sex.

, Your healthcare providers will help you with this while you are in the hospital, but once you are home, you will need to keep an eye out for potentially dangerous symptoms. Call your doctor if you notice any of the following:A high fever and/or pain, redness, swelling, or discharge at the surgery site. These could be signs of infection.
Breast pain that comes with redness and/or an elevated temperature.
Vaginal discharge with an unpleasant smell.
Pain while urinating.
Heavy bleeding.

, Between hormonal changes, worrying about the baby, and sleeplessness, it is easy to become overwhelmed after childbirth. For many people, these feelings go away quickly, but postpartum depression can strike at any point within a year of giving birth. Call your doctor if any of the following symptoms persist for more than two weeks:Irritability
Sadness, depression, or frequent crying
Lack of energy
Headaches, chest pains, heart palpitations, numbness, or hyperventilation
Difficulty sleeping
Inability to eat OR overeating
Inability to focus or make decisions
Memory problems
Constant worrying about the baby
Lack of interest in the baby
Feelings of guilt and worthlessness
Inability to enjoy activities you used to get pleasure from

, Do not worry about feelings of shame or embarrassment. Healthcare professionals want to help you. Do what you need to do to protect yourself and your family., Many women are reluctant to talk to their doctors about postpartum depression because they think that it is their fault, that they are not good mothers, or that they are alone in these feelings. None of this is true. Postpartum depression reflects no weakness on your part, yet seeking treatment can have myriad benefits for you and your child.You will feel much better, making it easier to take care of your baby.
You will aid in your child’s cognitive development (children with mothers who experience postpartum depression show delayed language acquisition).
You will facilitate your child’s ability to bond with others.

, Many women wish to return to a more active lifestyle after giving birth for physical reasons, but there is an even more important reason to lace up your sneakers: by increasing endorphins, exercise can ward off feelings of depression, including postpartum depression. Just make sure that your exercise program has been cleared by your doctor.Walking is probably the safest option for you after you have your baby. Start with walking and only increase the intensity when your doctor says it is okay to do so.

Take a walk.,
Ask for help with feeding.,
Ask about vaccinations.,
Stay clean.,
Make a follow up appointment.,
Rest.,
Drink fluids.,
Eat well.,
Walk a little more every day.,
Take medication when in pain.,
Support your abdomen.,
Clean your incision.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Abstain from sex.,
Wear pads to absorb vaginal bleeding.",How to Heal Faster from a C Section," You will likely be in the hospital for two or three days. Within the first 24 hours, you will likely be encouraged to stand and walk. Moving helps prevent typical C-section side effects like constipation and gas build-up in the abdomen, as well as dangerous complications such as blood clots. Your nurse or nurse aid will monitor your movements.It is usually very uncomfortable to begin walking, but the pain will steadily decrease.;
, As soon as you feel well enough, you can start breast-feeding or bottle-feeding your baby. Ask your nurse or lactation consultant to help you position yourself and your baby in a way that puts no pressure on your healing abdomen.A pillow may come in handy.

, Talk to your health care provider about preventive care, including vaccinations, to protect your and your baby's health. If your vaccinations are not current, your time in the hospital is a convenient time to update them., Keep your hands clean during your hospital stay, and don't hesitate to ask doctors and nurses to sanitize their hands before they touch you or your baby. Hospital infections such as MRSA can be guarded against by simple handwashing., After you leave the hospital, you will need a follow-up appointment with your doctor within four to six weeks or sooner, depending on the doctor.Some patients come into the office a few days after discharge to have staples removed or for their incision to be checked.

, Sleep seven to eight hours a night if possible. Sleeping encourages tissue growth, which will help your injuries heal. Sleep also lowers your stress level, which in turn can lower your inflammation and otherwise improve your health.Getting a full night's sleep with a new baby can be challenging! Have your partner or other adult in your household get up at night. If you are nursing, they can bring the baby to you. Remember that some nighttime fussing will pass on its own: listen for a few seconds before you decide to get up.Take naps when you can. When the baby is down for a nap, take a nap too. When a visitor comes to meet the baby, ask them to watch the baby for you while you nap. It isn't rude: you're recovering from surgery., Drink water and other fluids to replenish the fluids lost during delivery, and to prevent constipation. Your fluid intake will be monitored in the hospital, but once you are home it is on you to drink adequate fluid. When breast-feeding, keep a glass of water beside you. There is no set amount of water an individual should drink every day. Drink enough so that you are not frequently parched or thirsty. If your urine is dark yellow, you are dehydrated, and should drink more water.In some cases, your doctor might advise you to decrease or not increase fluid intake.

, Eating nutritious meals and snacks is especially important when you recover from surgery. Your digestive system will be recovering from the surgery, so you might want to make a few adjustments to your regular diet. If your stomach is upset, eat bland, low-fat foods, such as rice, broiled chicken, yogurt, and toast.


If you are constipated, you may want to increase your fiber intake. Talk to your doctor before dramatically increasing fiber consumption, or taking a fiber supplement.Continue taking your prenatal vitamin to help promote healing.
Cooking can involve risky lifting and bending. If you have a partner, a family member, or a friend who can care for you, ask them to prepare your meals or organize a meal train.

, Just like when you were in the hospital, you will need to keep moving. Try to increase your time walking by a few minutes each day. This does not mean you should be exercising! Do not bike, jog, or do any strenuous exercise for at least six weeks after your C-section, at least not without consulting your doctor.Avoid taking stairs as much as possible. If your bedroom is upstairs, relocate to a downstairs room for the first few weeks of your recovery, or if you can't relocate your bedroom just limit the number of times you go up and down the stairs.Avoid lifting anything heavier than your baby, and do not squat and lift.Avoid sit-ups or any movement that puts pressure on your wounded abdomen.

, Your doctor may recommend acetaminophen, like Tylenol. Most pain medications are safe to take while breastfeeding, but you should avoid aspirin or aspirin-containing pills for the first 10 to 14 days following surgery, as aspirin can reduce blood clotting. Pain management is very important for a nursing parent, as pain interferes with the release of hormones needed to help milk flow., Supporting your wound will decrease pain and lower the risk of your wound re-opening. Hold a pillow over the incision when you cough or take deep breaths.Abdominal compression garments, or ""belly binders,"" are not proven to be useful. Consult your physician before you compress your incision.

, Wash it daily with warm, soapy water, and pat dry. If your health care provider has put strips of tape on your incision, let them fall off on their own, or remove them after a week. You may cover your wound with a gauze bandage for comfort or if it is weeping, but make sure to change the bandage daily.


Do not use lotion or powder on your incision. Rubbing, scrubbing, soaking or sunbathing your incision can slow healing, and risk re-opening the wound.Avoid cleaning products that can slow healing time, such as like hydrogen peroxide.Shower as you normally do, and pat the incision dry when you are done. Do not take baths, swim, or otherwise immerse your incision in water., Dress in loose, soft clothing that does not rub against your incision., After a c-section or a vaginal delivery, you body may need four to six weeks of healing before you can engage in most forms of sexual activity. If you have had a c-section, it might take even longer for your incision to be firmly healed. Wait until your doctor says it's safe before engaging in sex., Even without vaginal delivery, you will experience bright red vaginal bleeding, called lochia, in the first month after childbirth. Do not douche or use a tampon, as this can cause infection, until your doctor says it is safe to do so.If your vaginal bleeding is heavy or smells foul, or if you develop a fever above 100.4°F (38°C), call a doctor."

Determine whether a natural birth is possible for you.,
Consider the benefits of natural birth.,
Know the risks of natural birth.,
Keep in mind that medical interventions may be necessary in certain situations.",How to Have a Natural Birth1," Natural childbirth is not always an option. Certain health conditions, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, may make a natural birth more difficult or risky for you.If you have a high-risk pregnancy, consult a medical professional about your ability to have a natural birth. In some cases, you may be able to give birth naturally as long as you are monitored for complications.;
, Arming yourself with the positive reasons for having a natural birth can help keep you motivated throughout the birth process. Some of the reasons that you may want to consider a natural childbirth include:A natural birth can save both you and your baby from the stress and unpleasant side effects of medication, surgery, and physical intervention. Many women who are guided through a natural birth also report less pain, anxiety, confusion, and stress than women undergoing births with medical intervention.
Natural birth can provide a more personal experience that focuses on the overall well-being of mother and baby.
Because you will be fully aware during the birth, you may remember it better and be able to enjoy it more.
Having a natural birth reduces the chances that you will need a Cesarean section.
Women who have natural births also tend to recover faster.

, Although natural births have long been the norm, natural birth may put you at an elevated risk for complications.Natural birth may pose some danger to you if you have other health conditions, if you are not attended by a health professional, if you are not in proximity to a medical facility in case of emergency, and if the baby presents in a difficult position.
Remember that it's okay if you end up deviating from your plan and do not achieve natural child birth. There is no shame in this and it is not a failure. The most important thing is doing what is best for you and your baby, and at times this may mean not doing natural birth.

, Even with careful planning and the best prenatal care, situations may arise during childbirth that require medical interventions. Some reasons why medical intervention may be necessary include:Misplaced placenta (placenta previa)
Active herpes infection or HIV infection
Previous C-section deliveries
Baby will not tolerate labor
Induction of labor for the health of the mother or the baby

"
"
Evaluate your ability to have a natural birth at the hospital.,
Search for birth center options in your area.,
Consider a natural home birth.",How to Have a Natural Birth2," In some hospitals, medical staff is supportive of natural births and may have trained midwives or natural birthing staff to attend your birth. Research your options and visit your local hospital to ask questions and determine how well it would support a natural birth.If you are a high-risk pregnancy but would still like to attempt a natural birth, you may wish to deliver at a hospital so that medical assistance is immediately available should it become necessary.
Some hospitals have natural birth centers on site that allow a natural birth experience in an environment that feels less like a hospital, but still allows expert medical care to be in close proximity.
Talk to the nursing staff at the hospital about your options. Look for things like bath tubs for soaking during labor and birthing balls in the rooms.

, Many birth centers specifically design their facilities for natural birth support. They also have expert staff who are familiar with the natural birth process and who are committed to helping women experience natural labor.Ask the birth center about the amenities they have including options they offer for delivering your baby, such as in a bed or in water.
Request information on the qualifications of delivery staff and the center’s ability to offer care in emergency situations.

, Many women find that a home birth allows for the optimum level of comfort, relaxation, and empowerment during a natural birth. If you are a low-risk pregnancy and are able to have a birthing doula and midwife present, a home birth may be a safe and pleasant way to have a natural birth."
"
Choose a practitioner.,
Ask questions before you decide on a practitioner.,
Create a birth plan.,
Designate a birth advocate or birth partner.,
Inform your midwife or healthcare provider of your wishes.,
Take a class on natural childbirth.",How to Have a Natural Birth3," Before you go any further with your plans to have a natural birth, you should choose your team. An obstetrician (OB/GYN), certified nurse-midwife, perinatologist, or family practitioner are all qualified to help you deliver your baby. Each one has a different level of training and specialization, so it is important to consider your situation before you choose. Some differences to consider include:OB/GYNs are doctors who can deliver your baby as well as provide surgical care if necessary.
Certified nurse-midwives are qualified to deliver your baby and they will call on an OB/GYN if complications arise.
Perinatologists are doctors who are qualified to deliver your baby and who provide care for high-risk deliveries, such as women over 35, women who have STDs, and women who have diabetes.
Family practitioners are doctors who are qualified to deliver your baby, but they are not specialists, so they will call on an OB/GYN if complications arise.

, As you consider who will help deliver your baby, make sure that you ask questions to determine whether the person will be supportive of your plans to have a natural childbirth. Some questions to ask include:How do you feel about natural childbirth?
How many natural births have you been involved in?
Would you be willing to help me have a natural birth?

, Every expecting mother should have a birth plan that expresses her needs and desires for the birth of her child. You should work with your support team to create a birth plan. Ask your doctor, midwife, or doula to assist you in writing a birth plan. Your birth plan should include:Where your baby will be born
Who will deliver your baby
Who your main support person will be
Who else may be present during labor and birth
Types of support that you want during labor
Any pain medications that you want during labor
Details about the umbilical cord and blood
Will the baby stay with you or in the nursery after birth
Any special traditions you would like to observe
Who to tell first if there is a problem with you or the baby
Anything else you want your healthcare provider and support team to know

, For most women, it is easier to maintain your decision to have a natural birth if you have a partner or advocate. This person should be someone who will remind you of your reasons for a natural birth and who will be there to support you during the birth.If you give birth in a hospital, a vocal advocate or a professional doula may help you stand up for your wishes if medical staff seems resistant to your plan.
Having a birth advocate or partner can also help give you the encouragement and support you need to have a birth free of interventions, medications, or surgery.

, Deciding in advance to have a natural childbirth will allow your healthcare provider and birth assistant time to plan for your safety and that of the baby. It will also enable you to ask questions and arrange for your preferences to be accommodated no matter where you give birth.

, Learning about natural birth from women who have experienced it and even facilitated it for others can be the most informative and helpful preparation for your own natural birth experience.Discuss your fears, anxieties, and hopes with other women in the class. In many cases, women who have delivered naturally before can set you at ease about pain management and medical safety.

Use breathing exercises.,
Try visualization exercises.,
Change positions and move around.,
Get a massage.,
Use hot or cold therapy.,
Immerse yourself in a bath or take a shower.,
Try a TENS unit.,
Consider acupuncture or acupressure.",How to Have a Natural Birth4," Breathing exercises are a common form of relaxation and pain relief for women who desire to have a natural birth. The best way to learn breathing exercises prior to giving birth is to take a special birthing class. Choose one that focuses on breathing techniques.Look into Lamaze and the Bradley Method. Both methods teach breathing techniques to help minimize pain and to help you stay relaxed during childbirth.Some women find it helpful to pair a word or phrase with breathing to help them focus. For example, as you inhale you might think to yourself “Keep” and then as you exhale you might think “Calm.” Repeating this over and over as you breathe will help you to stay focused and calm., Finding a focal point or imagining a peaceful scene can help you to relax and manage pain during labor. For example, you might bring a photo to use as your focal point and focus your eyes on that image during your contractions. Choose an image that helps you to feel calm, such as a photo of a beautiful sunset. Or, you can close your eyes and imagine a peaceful scene. For example, you might picture yourself sitting on a beach or standing on top of a mountain.Meditation can help improve your visualization skills and it is also an effective way to deal with pain during labor. Consider taking meditation classes prior to giving birth to help improve your visualization technique.Hypnobirthing is another good way to use visualization techniques. Hypnobirthing uses self-hypnosis to help you cope with pain during labor.There are classes and voice-directed programs that teach this technique. You can put the voice-directed programs on a portable media player and take this with you to listen during labor.

, Listening to your body and changing positions often during childbirth can help you to feel more comfortable. If you feel the need to walk, sit, lay down, recline in the tub, or lean against something, then do it.Laying down in bed is actually not a very effective position for labor, so try to avoid the bed if possible.

, Getting a massage from your doula or your partner during childbirth can be a great way to relax and take your mind off of the pain. Sometimes, however, you may find it annoying for someone to touch you during childbirth, so don’t be afraid to let your birth partner know if this is the case., Using heating pads to relax your muscles may help to provide some relief, as may using cold packs to numb certain areas. You may even want to switch back and forth between hot and cold packs during labor. Make sure that the hot and cold packs are wrapped in towels and that you are not placing them directly on your skin., Taking a bath during labor can help to relax your muscles and reduce pain during labor. Even taking a shower during labor can help you to relax. If you have the option of water birth, then this is something to consider as well.Make sure that the tub is kept at body temperature (98.6°F or 37°C).

, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) uses a handheld device that connects to several sticky pads that are applied to your skin (you'll want to stick them to your back for labor pains). The machine sends small pulses of electrical current to the pads, which penetrate to your muscles. You can control the frequency and strength of the pulses.To use a maternity TENS machine, have your partner apply the pads to your back. You'll want them evenly spaced on either side of your spine. Place the top two pads at about where your bra band would hit, and the other two on your lower back, just above your butt.
Start with the machine on the lowest setting and turn it up as pain increases.
Your machine may have a ""boost"" button, which will cause the machine to immediately switch into the highest, most intense setting. Use this button at the peak of your contractions.
It may take at least an hour for TENS to start working.

, Acupuncture uses needles which are inserted into specific points on the body to provide pain relief. Acupressure is a similar method but pressure is applied instead of needles. If you are interested in having acupuncture or acupressure during labor, you will need to enlist the services of a certified acupuncturist or acupressurist."

Prioritize an aerobic exercise routine.One of the best things you can do for your blood pressure during pregnancy (and also for your overall health) is to prioritize an exercise routine.,
Stay as close as possible to your ideal body weight.Ideally, before becoming pregnant, you will already have been at your ideal body weight.,
Quit smoking.Smoking has been correlated to raising your blood pressure so, if you are worried about having blood pressure problems during pregnancy, now may be the time to quit smoking.,
Optimize the health of your diet.Prioritizing a healthy diet can have a noticeable impact on blood pressure.,
Reduce your stress.Psychological and emotional stress has been linked to high blood pressure; therefore, if you can take steps to stay as relaxed as possible during your pregnancy it will give you the best chance of maintaining a healthy blood pressure.,
Have your blood pressure monitored regularly.One key aspect of prenatal care is to obtain regular blood pressure measurements.,
Know which blood pressure medications are safe during pregnancy.There are a variety of different classes of blood pressure medications (in other words, there are many different drugs to choose from).,
Get tested for any other signs or symptoms that may occur concurrently with high blood pressure.,
Understand what defines gestational hypertension.Gestational hypertension is when you develop high blood pressure 20 or more weeks into your pregnancy (assuming that you were not diagnosed with high blood pressure prior to this point).,
Look out for signs of preeclampsia.Oftentimes preeclampsia is diagnosed by having both high blood pressure as well as protein in your urine; however, doctors have recently come to find that preeclampsia can be present even without protein in your urine if you display any other signs of potential organ damage.,
Be aware of potential risks to your baby.The reason that it is important to maintain good blood pressure control during pregnancy is to avoid possible complications to your pregnancy and/or to your baby's health.",How to Have Good Blood Pressure During Pregnancy," A simple way to start is to plan in at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at least three days per week. Do exercises that elevate your heart rate, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or cycling.


Exercise has multiple benefits for your health, not the least of which is having a positive impact on your blood pressure so that you minimize your chances of having any blood pressure problems during pregnancy.
Note that, if you are not already active, you should lightly ease into an exercise routine under the supervision of your doctor. Do not begin a new exercise routine suddenly without first consulting your doctor.;
, Your doctor can inform you of a body weight that is healthy and normal for someone of your height and build, should you have any questions about it.


Your doctor can provide you with guidelines as to the weight changes you should aim for as your pregnancy progresses, which will depend on how much you weighed prior to becoming pregnant.
If you are not yet pregnant, use diet and exercise to get as close to your ideal weight as possible before getting pregnant.
Losing weight during pregnancy is not recommended. Even overweight pregnant women are expected to gain weight during pregnancy.

, Quitting smoking will also have a noticeable impact on your baby's health and wellbeing. Therefore, not only is it in the best interest of you, but of your future baby as well.


Your family doctor can help you with strategies to quit smoking, if you are interested.
Your doctor may offer you nicotine replacement as needed, and/or medications to help diminish cigarette cravings (such as Wellbutrin or Bupropion).

, It can certainly help to keep your blood pressure in a safe and normal range during pregnancy.


Avoid consuming too much salt or processed foods (which are high in salt); this will help to prevent blood pressure problems during pregnancy.
Also, opt for healthier foods overall, such as more fruits, vegetables, and whole grain carbohydrates.
This is better for your blood pressure than unhealthier alternatives such as refined carbohydrates, snack foods and junk food.

,


Consider seeing a counsellor or psychologist if you have elevated stress levels. They may be able to help you with coping strategies to reduce your stress.
You may also want to consider activities such as yoga, meditation, or relaxing walks in nature to help calm your state of mind.
It may also help to share your emotions with close friends and family as you progress through your pregnancy. It can be a challenging nine months and it can help to know that you are not alone.

, A normal blood pressure is below 140/90 (where the top number represents the systolic reading and the bottom number represents the diastolic reading). If your blood pressure is elevated above that point, your doctor will likely advise that you be treated with blood pressure medications to reduce it.


You can check your blood pressure on your own at a local pharmacy or big box store should you have any reason to feel concerned.
If not, your doctor will perform regular blood pressure checks at each of your prenatal visits, to ensure that there are no problems.

, Some blood pressure medications are safe during pregnancy, while other are not ideal for pregnant women.


Blood pressure medications to avoid during pregnancy include any ACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, such as Ramipril and Captopril), any ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers such as Candesartan), and any renin inhibitors (such as aliskiren). These drugs may cause birth defects or disease in the fetus.
Blood pressure medications that are recommended in pregnancy include Methyldopa and Labetalol. Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine are also used frequently.

, The risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy often goes hand in hand with other symptoms, such as protein in your urine; therefore, if you demonstrate high blood pressure, your doctor will do a full evaluation of your health at this time.

, It may require treatment with a blood pressure medication, as well as continued monitoring to ensure that no further problems develop (such as preeclampsia).

, Preeclampsia is dangerous for you and your baby, and needs immediate medical treatment. If left untreated, it can lead to eclampsia, which is the onset of seizures. Potential signs of preeclampsia include:


Fatigue
Vision problems
Severe headaches
Rapid weight gain due to swelling
Nausea and vomiting
Reduced urine
Abdominal pain
See your doctor or go to the Emergency Room (if you cannot get a same-day appointment with your family doctor) if you notice the above signs or symptoms.

, Possible complications that may result from high blood pressure during pregnancy that is left untreated include:


A diminished nutrient supply to the placenta. With high blood pressure, less blood flow gets to the placenta which decreases the nutrient supply for your baby. This can lead to poor growth of the baby.
Placental abruption. Placental abruption is when the placenta detaches from the uterus wall as a result of the stress from untreated high blood pressure. This is an obstetrical emergency requiring immediate delivery of the baby.
Premature delivery. Your baby may need to be delivered prematurely if their wellbeing (or your own personal health) is compromised as a result of blood pressure concerns.

Set a budget for your pregnancy and follow it.,
Negotiate the price.,
Search for birth coaches who may still be completing their training.",How to Hire a Birth Coach1," Hiring a birth coach can be an expensive process and some birth coaches can charge up to a couple thousand dollars for their services. It will be easier to narrow down the list of potential providers if you know exactly how much you have set aside to spend on their services and stay within that budget.;
, The amount of money that birthing coaches charge can vary greatly and can depend on a lot of factors, such as the coaches popularity among pregnant women in the area and the level of experience. Negotiation is always encouraged and some birthing coaches will work with you.


Check to see if the birth coach offers a sliding fee scale. This is a fee that you will determine together with your birthing coach based on your current income. This can be a very helpful option and is definitely worth inquiring about.

, Sometimes you can find a birth coach who is finishing up a training program and is serving under an experienced birth coach to learn the trade. This can help you save a lot of money and will also give the coach-in-training some real labor experience.


This may seem like a scary option at first because you will be entrusting your emotional and physical well-being during your pregnancy, labor and birth to someone who has little to no active experience. However, you should keep in mind that the coach who is in training will be accompanied by the licensed birth coach during the labor and delivery process, so there will always be someone there who has the experience needed to help you through the process.

"
"
Make sure the birth coach is licensed in the trade.,
Talk to your friends and family members.,
Make sure your personality meshes well with the birth coach you choose.",How to Hire a Birth Coach2," It is not only important to make sure she has the proper licenses, it is also important to make sure she has been through the proper training. You don’t want just anyone assisting you with one of the most important times in your life, so put in the time and effort now to make sure she is everything you would expect from a professional birth coach.


One good way to do this is to check with your state. Many states require birth coaches to be registered within their specific state registry. Check with your state licensing program and make sure that the birth coach you are considering is a legitimate one.

, Ask them who they used as their birth coach. This can be a lot easier than just going out and searching for a birth coach on your own. Inquire at your doctor’s office as well, they may be able to refer you to a birthing coach that has been used by some of the other patients.


You can also find great birth coach recommendations from pregnancy organizations around your town.

, You don’t want a person in the room with you when you are giving birth that gets on your nerves or has a personality that you are not necessarily compatible with. Your birth coach should be a voice of reason during a crazy time and should have the power to calm you when you are feeling stressed. Your birth coach should help to relax you and focus you, not drive you crazy. Make sure that you get along well with the birth coach you eventually choose. This can be the most important piece to the puzzle when selecting a birth coach.

"
"
Choose a friend or family member to make you feel more at ease.",How to Hire a Birth Coach3," Sometimes your husband, mother, sister or friend is the perfect choice as a birth coach for you. Choosing someone you know will not only save you money, but it may make you feel more comfortable in the long run.


Keep in mind that the person you choose will be seeing every aspect of the birth and labor process and it will not all be pretty. This is why choosing someone that you know and already feel comfortable with can be a great option.
Another great perk of choosing a friend or family member is that they already know you and know all of your quirks. She will know the part of the labor and birth process that makes you scared or uncomfortable and she will be able to help you calm those fears and make you feel more at home.
Labor is already a scary and stressful process so you don’t want someone who adds to your stress. This can be one of the drawbacks of choosing a friend or family member as your birth coach. Because we are most comfortable with them, friends and family members are the people we tend to fight with the most. Make sure that you don’t choose your mother or your sister if you tend to get into arguments with them about their overbearing attitudes. You need to choose a person who is going to listen to you, understand what you want from your birthing experience, and be able to help keep you cool, calm and collected during the labor process.

Be prepared to feel a little fatigued.,
Be prepared to have tender and swollen breasts.,
Know that you may experience morning sickness.,
Be prepared to experience some food craving.,
Combat constipation.,
Know that you might also have to urinate a lot.,
Watch out for headaches.,
Understand that heartburn may occur.,
Keep your diet in mind.,
Take folic acid supplements.",How to Learn More About Pregnancy Trimesters1," Fatigue happens because your body starts working harder to metabolize nutrients when you become pregnant. Leg elevation will help to keep the weight off your legs, which in turn will help you to feel less fatigued.


Pregnant women, especially those who have full time jobs, should elevate their legs for 30 minutes during their break time.;
, Another discomfort that a woman experiences when she is pregnant is having tender and swollen breasts. This occurs because of the increase in estrogen levels brought about by the pregnancy.Wearing a bra that is made with a wide shoulder strap will help to support your sensitive breasts. However, keep in mind that you should contact a doctor if the pain does not let up, or gets worse as time goes on.

, There is still no definite cause as to why morning sickness occurs during pregnancy. One reason may be that when a woman gets pregnant, her body has less gastric motility, which means that her body does not process food correctly. This could lead to morning sickness.


To manage morning sickness, try to eat small, frequent meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals. Eating smaller meals will help your body to process the food more easily.
Keeping a pack of saltine crackers and eating them early in the morning before getting out of bed may help to settle your stomach.

, These cravings occur because your body is telling you that certain nutrients, vitamins, and minerals are lacking and should be consumed. When the cravings are healthy, they should be encouraged, but if not, in the case of pica, which is a craving for paper and hair, immediate medical attention should be warranted., Constipation happens because of the weight of the fetus and the gradual growth of the uterus that puts pressure on the bowels. This weight on the bowels can further slow down your ability to process food.


Eat fiber to control your constipation. Great sources of fiber include oatmeal, apples, whole wheat bread, and brown rice. Drinking at least one liter of water every hour may also help to fight constipation.

, Another discomfort during the first trimester of pregnancy is the need to urinate frequently. This happen because of the pressure that the uterus puts on the anterior bladder.


Avoiding caffeine may help to control your desire to urinate because caffeine is a diuretic, which means that it makes you need to go to the bathroom all the time.

, During the first trimester of pregnancy, you may experience headaches. These headaches occur because of the expanding blood volume in your body. The blood may put pressure on your cerebral arteries. To manage headaches:


Rest a cold compress on your forehead.
Talk to your doctor about taking acetaminophen to combat the headache.

, Heartburn happens because gastric motility, or the ability to process food, slows down. When this happens, gastric emptying is further slowed down.


Again, eating small, frequent meals rather than three large meals each day can help your body ability to process food.
Talk to your doctor about taking Amphojel or Maalox to combat heartburn.

, What you eat during your first trimester is important because it will set the platform for the rest of your pregnancy. It is important to eat fresh, wholesome, and healthy foods when you are pregnant. Foods rich in fiber are also good choices during this trimester as they can help to relieve constipation.Consider working with your doctor or nutritionist to come up with a diet that fits your dietary needs.

, Folic acid is especially important during the first trimester as it helps to avoid developmental defects in your baby such as neural tube defects. Talk to your doctor about taking a daily folic acid supplement that contains roughly 400 mcg of folic acid.

Understand that changes that will occur in the second trimester.,
Know that you may need to make some changes to avoid back pain.,
Know that your veins may become inflamed.,
Understand that your breasts may change to accommodate the milk your body will create.,
Know that your palms might start to itch.,
Know that ankle edema also occurs during the second trimester of pregnancy.",How to Learn More About Pregnancy Trimesters2," The second trimester of pregnancy is generally thought to be more comfortable than the first trimester. Symptoms of morning sickness and fatigue may be starting to fade, but there are new changes happening in your body. You may find that your abdomen is beginning to expand with the continued growth of your baby.

, As your baby grows, your body will change its posture to accommodate the new weight. There are certain ways to help relieve back pain that you might experience. This includes:


Wearing shoes with no heel. Wearing heeled shoes may affect the curvature of your spine so try to avoid them.
Walk with your pelvis tilted forward to give yourself a wider base of support.
Apply a warm compress to your back.
Squat rather than bend when you have to pick up objects.

, When your uterus increases in weight, it can put a lot of pressure on your veins, which makes it harder for blood to reach your lower extremities. When this occurs, your veins may become painful, inflamed and engorged.Resting in Sims’ position is one way to relieve varicose veins. This is done by lying on your back with both legs raised against a wall or a chair.
Avoid crossing your legs while sitting for a long period of time.
Walk for 30 minutes each day to promote blood circulation.
Eat vitamin C-rich foods to ease your inflamed veins. Great sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits like oranges and lemons. Green leafy vegetables are also rich sources of vitamin C.

, During the second trimester, your areola will begin to darken and their diameters will also begin to increase in size. This happens as your breasts prepare for milk production.

, Your palms will start to itch during the second trimester. This condition is more commonly known as palmar erythema. This is a normal occurrence throughout pregnancy and it happens because your estrogen levels are increased.


Calamine lotion can be applied on the affected area to soothe the itching.

, This may happen because there is a chance that your blood pressure will go up around this time. At the same time, your baby is getting larger, which cuts off a lot of the blood supply to your lower extremities, making your ankles swell up.Sleeping or resting in a left side lying position will help keep the weight off your lower extremities. Elevate your legs whenever possible to help improve blood flow.

"
"
Understand that shortness of breath may develop.,
Be aware that hemorrhoids can develop.,
Watch for Braxton Hicks contractions.",How to Learn More About Pregnancy Trimesters3," Because your baby is getting larger, your uterus starts to expand even more, causing pressure to be put on your diaphragm. This pressure can make you feel like you can’t catch your breath. You may find that you experience this more severely at night than during the day.


One way to relieve shortness of breath is to sit upright so that the weight of the uterus will be distributed away from the diaphragm. Add two or more pillows to support your head and neck when sleeping to relieve dyspnea.

, Your expanding uterus may put even more pressure on your veins, which can lead to the formation of hemorrhoids in your rectum. Luckily, these can be managed.


Rest in Sim’s position, which is when you lie on your back with both legs raise up against a wall or chair.
Talk to your doctor about taking stool softeners.
Try to reduce any constipation you are experiencing, as described in Part 1.

, During this stage of the pregnancy, you may feel Braxton Hicks contractions. Braxton Hicks contractions occur when your uterus starts to contract and relax periodically. You will most likely only feel minimal pain because of these contractions. The pain can be likened to that of menstrual cramps. This is one sign that labor is fast approaching.


Inform your obstetrician right away if you feel these contractions. Monitor the duration and severity of contractions as they occur.

Know what happens during the first four to twelve weeks of gestation.,
Understand what happens in weeks 16 through 24.,
Be aware of the baby’s condition during the last 28 to 40 weeks.",How to Learn More About Pregnancy Trimesters4," During the first trimester, the fetus’ internal organs, such as the heart, are starting to develop. Note that the fetus in this stage does not yet resemble a human being but more of a seed with facial features and a discernible tail ,which will later form the lower extremities. Upon ultrasound, at 8 weeks of gestation, a gestational sac can be observed. At the end of 12 weeks gestation, the sex of the baby should already noticeable.During this time, the baby will most likely grow from 1 centimeter (0.4 in) to 8 centimeters (3.1 in) in length. The weight should be between 400 mcg and 45 grams.

, During this time the fetal heartbeat should become audible with the use of a Doppler (an instrument that can detect fetal heart sounds) but towards the end of the second trimester it can be heard using a stethoscope. The sex can also be determined through ultrasound. Other internal organs such as the liver and pancreas are fully functioning. Other notable features of the fetus during this trimester are the presence of lanugo (downy hair at the back and extremities which help regulate heat upon birth), brown fat (for heat insulation) and vernix caseosa (a substance that regulates heat). The fetus has already established waking and sleeping patterns.


During the second trimester, the fetus should now be about 10 centimeters (3.9 in). Towards the end of 24 weeks it should be approximately 36 centimeters (14.2 in). The weight should be between 55 grams to 550 grams.
In case a woman gives birth at only 24 weeks of gestation, the baby should be able to survive with constant monitoring and care under a neonatal intensive care unit.

, Because of the presence of lung surfactant, the lung alveoli can fully function. Note that during the third trimester, the eyes of your baby should now be fully open. The fetus should now look more like a baby. Fat deposits are present on the arms and legs. It is best to start reading aloud and listening to classical music during this time because the fetus is now aware of sounds. During the third trimester, the baby now assumes either a vertex (head first) or breech position (foot or buttocks). There is now lesser lanugo towards the end of this trimester.


During this trimester kicks can be felt during the waking hours of the baby which can be strong enough to cause mild discomfort to the mother.
The length of the baby should now be around 35 centimeters (13.8 in).

However, make it a point to show your happiness and excitement about this pregnancy. Tell her how much you await the baby's arrival.;
, The first trimester is a very low period for most pregnant women. Most symptoms include vomiting and nausea, aversion from any strong smell, tiredness. Also the hormonal changes can make her feel very depressed. Find ways to make her smile. Remind her of the happy times. Keep strong smells that make her feel queasy, away. In short, welcome all her symptoms and adjust happily with this new behaviour.

, The second trimester is mostly a lot better in terms of moods, and for most women taste buds are back. This is the time when a woman needs to concentrate on eating foods with the required vitamins and minerals for the baby growing inside. Help her to make a food chart. However, don't force her to eat or not eat something. The taste buds for most women vary on a regular basis. Some women may feel a strong desire to eat something specific at a certain time (could happen at very odd hours). If possible try to get it for her.

, A woman's body goes through a lot of changes during pregnancy. Her belly bulges out. She most likely puts on weight on the rest of the body too.! Tell her she is beautiful even now and that even if she does not go back to her original form, its fine by you.

Learn the factors that affect the sound.",How to Hear the Fetal Heartbeat1," A basic stethoscope is one of the easiest ways to listen to the fetal heartbeat at home. When you are between 18 and 20 weeks pregnant, the heartbeat should be strong enough for you to listen to with this method. Simply place the stethoscope on your belly and listen. You may have to move it around a bit to find the heartbeat. Be patient.Quality does matter, so make sure to purchase a stethoscope from a reputable seller. You can find a wide variety of brands at your local drugstore, and even at a store selling office supplies. Or borrow one from a friend or family member in the medical field if you can.;
, New technology can make it very easy to listen to your baby's heartbeat wherever you are. There are several different apps that you can purchase and download to your smartphone to listen to the heartbeat. Some will even allow you to record the sound of the heartbeat so you can play it for your friends and family.These are most reliable later in pregnancy.

, You can buy relatively inexpensive fetal heart rate monitors to use at home. This can be a great option if you are prone to stress and are reassured by listening to the heartbeat between visits to your doctor. However, you should be aware that these monitors are not as strong as the ones used by your doctor. Don't expect them to be able to pick up the sound of the heartbeat until you are in at least your fifth month of pregnancy.Make sure to consult your doctor before purchasing an at-home monitor. Once you have one, follow the instructions carefully.

, Even when you are using the proper tools, there are many reasons that you may not be able to detect the fetal heartbeat yourself. It's important to know that things such as the baby's position and your weight can impact whether or not you will clearly hear a heartbeat. If you feel there is reason to be concerned, make sure to contact your healthcare provider right away."

Know the different tools.",How to Hear the Fetal Heartbeat2," The relationship between you and your doctor or midwife is very important. When you are pregnant, make sure that you are working with a healthcare professional whom you trust. Talk to your doctor about your baby's development, and the best ways for you to hear the heartbeat, both at home and in her office. Choose a doctor who thoroughly and patiently answers all of your questions., Ask your doctor when you can first expect to hear the heartbeat. Most physicians will schedule for a prenatal exam in your ninth or tenth week. Before your visit, make sure to prepare a list of questions to ask your doctor. The moment will be even more special if you understand what is happening and what to expect.This will be an exciting and emotional visit. Ask your partner or a close friend or family member to come with you to the appointment to share in your excitement.

, Talk to your doctor about what type of exam he will use to hear the heartbeat. Typically, you will first hear the sound when your doctor or technician uses a fetal doppler, which uses sound waves to amplify the heartbeat. You will lie down on an exam table and the doctor will move a small probe on the surface of your stomach. This is a painless procedure.While your doctor can usually detect the baby's heartbeat at nine to 10 weeks, sometimes it takes until 12 weeks to easily detect it.

, If your doctor schedules you for an early ultrasound, you may be able to hear the heartbeat through ultrasound as soon as your eighth week of pregnancy. This is typically performed early if you have some elevated risk factors in your pregnancy. Otherwise, the doctor will typically wait until you are at least 10–12 weeks along. , Be aware that your doctor might be able to use a stethoscope to listen to your baby's heartbeat. However, this instrument is not as powerful as others, so he likely will not do this until you are well into your second trimester. Your doctor or midwife might also use a fetoscope, which is specially designed to listen to fetal heartbeats."

Learn about fetal development.,
Keep the heart healthy.,
Know the risks.,
Bond with your baby.",How to Hear the Fetal Heartbeat3," When you are pregnant, it is important to know the stages of your baby's development. That way, you will know when you can logically expect to hear the heartbeat, and you can correlate this information with other development milestones. For example, it's good to know that you can expect that your doctor can usually detect the baby's heartbeat by weeks eight, nine, or 10. Remember that conception dates are not always precise. Don't immediately be alarmed if you think your baby hasn't developed fast enough — your conception date may be off by a week or two.

, There are many things you can do to help your baby's heart to grow strong and healthy. During your pregnancy, avoid alcohol, smoking, and recreational drugs. You should usually take folic acid supplements to help your baby develop.Eat a healthy diet and avoid caffeine.

, Even though you will be anxious to hear the fetal heartbeat, make sure that you know there are risks involved when using at home fetal heart monitors. The main drawback is that hearing a healthy heartbeat can lead to a false sense of security in expectant mothers. For example, if you are not feeling ""right,"" but can hear the heartbeat, you might put off going to the doctor. Make sure to listen to your body and contact your doctor at the first sign that something is wrong. Do not rely too heavily on at home monitors.In fact, having a monitor may actually increase your stress level.

, If your doctor agrees, make it a habit to be in tune with your baby's heartbeat. This experience can be a great way for you to bond with your baby bump. To get into a relaxed state, try taking a warm bath and talking to your belly. When you are far along in your pregnancy, the baby will begin to respond to your voice and moods. Your baby can start to hear sounds at around 23 weeks."

Try simple painkillers to reduce pain and inflammation.",How to Get Rid of Sore Muscles During Pregnancy1," Excessive tightness in your muscles can increase soreness. Try stretching exercises to loosen up a bit. Stretching exercises help avoid further muscle tightening, and relieve the muscles of their soreness.Stretching exercises have been shown to be beneficial for your joints during pregnancy.Your joints loosen as your body expands to accommodate the growing baby, so stretching them can keep them feeling healthier with less pain during this time of change.;
, The ideal total weight gain for the entire term of your pregnancy is usually 25 to 35 pounds. Many women are overweight in pregnancy, so it is important to talk to your doctor about a healthy amount of weight gain (an amount that adequately supports your baby's growth while not being excessive.)


The heavier you are (and note here we are talking about excessive, not normal, pregnancy weight gain), the greater the force of gravity is on your body. Gravity causes more stress to your muscles as you move, and can contribute to muscle soreness.
If you are in doubt, speak to your family doctor or obstetrician about the amount of weight gain that is ideal for you during your pregnancy.
Continue aerobic (fat-burning) exercise during pregnancy, as this can prevent excessive weight gain. Although you will need to consume approximately 300 extra calories per day for your growing baby, many women gain too much weight during pregnancy so keeping up an exercise routine can be helpful in this regard.
Aerobic exercise includes things such as walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, or other activities that get your heart rate up for 20–30 minutes. Try to do this at least three times a week.
If excessive weight gain is an issue for you, exercising more will diminish your weight, which will help to reduce muscle soreness resulting from pregnancy., While maintaining regular aerobic exercise is important, staying away from overly vigorous exercise is a good idea.You don't want to exhaust yourself or push too hard during pregnancy as this can make you even more sore.


It is best to take things slower and easier during pregnancy. If you are fond of going to the gym, running, and cycling, then try switching to a more mild form of exercise like yoga or pilates to reduce strain on your muscles.
Swimming can be a good exercise, because it is very low impact.

, Massage promotes good blood circulation and oxygen distribution to your sore muscles. This can speed up the repair of the damaged tissue. Oxygen is essential for maintaining cellular integrity, function, and repair when tissues are injured., Applying an ice pack for the first 24 hours of muscle soreness can help you minimize inflammation, through constricting the blood vessels. This will ease discomfort by reducing the nerves’ ability to send pain signals to the brain.


To do this, place ice cubes in a towel and apply on top of the affected area for 20 minutes.

, Applying a heating pad to sore muscles can be helpful as well. The key is to use cold (ice) for the first 24 – 48 after the onset of any sore muscle(s), and to use heat for more chronic and ongoing muscle soreness., If none of the lifestyle or nutritional strategies have worked to help with your sore muscles, taking painkillers can relieve pain related to sore muscles during pregnancy. Common over-the-counter medicines such as Tylenol (Acetaminophen) can help to relieve pain.


Speak to your doctor about which pain medications are most appropriate and safe for you to take during your pregnancy.

Be aware of your overall nutrition.,
Increase your protein intake.,
Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.",How to Get Rid of Sore Muscles During Pregnancy2," It is important to consume a well-balanced diet during pregnancy, not just to help your baby grow as well as possible, but also because nutritional deficiencies can contribute to sore muscles.


It is important to eat foods rich in magnesium, as it is a crucial mineral to combat muscle soreness. Eating foods rich in magnesium, such as pumpkin seeds, boiled spinach, Chinook salmon, Swiss chard, sesame seeds, or broccoli, can be helpful for sore muscles.
Foods rich in calcium can also help, as calcium works in concert with magnesium to help with muscle function. Calcium is found in many dairy products, or you can take an over-the-counter supplement if that is easier for you.
It is also advisable to take vitamin B6 and B12 supplements during pregnancy, particularly if you have sore muscles.

, Protein is necessary to repair and rebuild your muscles. For pregnant women, the ideal daily protein intake is at least 70 grams.Include at least one food rich in protein in each major meal.


Good sources of protein are lean meat, beans, shellfish, eggs, milk, cheese, yogurt and tofu.

, Another reason why you might have muscle soreness during pregnancy is because of dehydration. You may not feel thirsty, but your muscles may need more water to function properly; therefore, make it a habit to drink lots of water during your entire pregnancy.


Try setting up an alarm every hour and drinking a glass of water.

Be aware of the source of sore abdominal muscles.,
Realize the source of sore thigh muscles.",How to Get Rid of Sore Muscles During Pregnancy3," As your uterus expands, aches and pains occur due to overworked muscles in the back, abdomen and thighs. The reason these muscles get sore while pregnant is that you are carrying more weight in the front of your body than normal. As a result, muscles that are not normally used are activated and become sore.


Lactic acid, the by-product of muscle metabolism, accumulates in the muscles when muscles more than normal. Lactic acid can irritate the muscles and lead to discomfort and soreness., Often during pregnancy women have back pain that can be aching and sharp. Somewhere between one half and three quarters of all pregnant women have back pain at some point during their pregnancy.

, Lower abdominal cramping is normal as a baby is growing inside your belly. The uterus gets bigger every day along with the baby, stretching out the ligaments and muscles that support it in order to accommodate the changes. This stretching process makes the muscles sore, especially when you change positions, if you are particularly active, or when you cough.

, Thigh muscles are responsible for walking and maintaining your posture. These activities can become a challenge during pregnancy and can cause stress to the muscles because of the additional weight. The more weight you gain, the greater the pull of gravity on your body.


The additional work your legs must do to walk and stand can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid in the legs and irritate your muscles.

Good prenatal care is extremely important throughout your pregnancy, and you want to choose a doctor or a midwife that you feel comfortable with.;
, It is important to schedule an appointment soon after you discover you are pregnant. Studies show that women who do not receive good prenatal care are at a higher risk for having low birth-weight babies and babies with poor health than women who regularly see a physician during pregnancy., In addition to confirming that you are pregnant, the first prenatal visit includes a variety of tests and examinations to assess your health, as well as the health of the fetus. It also helps establish the relationship between you and your health care provider. A typical first prenatal visit includes:Questions about your current and past medical history, including medications you take, smoking history, current health and previous illnesses, procedures, pregnancies, and family history, including any genetic conditions that run in your family.
Dating your last period to determine a due date.
A physical examination, including a pelvic examination and a Pap test.
Testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Taking your weight and measurements.
Blood pressure measurement.
Urine testing for proteins and sugar levels.
Ultrasound to hear the baby’s heartbeat, which oftentimes is not heard until at least 6 or 7 weeks., Even if your first prenatal visit went great, it is still important to continue seeing your doctor regularly throughout your pregnancy. Prenatal care typically consists of a visit with your doctor once a month for the first six months, twice per month during the 7th and 8th months, and then every week after that until you deliver., Towards the end of the first trimester, your doctor may talk to you about prenatal testing to further assess the health of the fetus. You can decide which tests you want to have done, but they will help determine things like genetic disorders, birth defects, or the potential for other disorders.These tests are encouraged so that you can make the best health care decisions before and after your child is born.

, The most important step for a healthy first trimester, and a healthy pregnancy in general, is changing lifestyle habits that are dangerous and damaging to the fetus. While there are many foods and behaviors that are discouraged during pregnancy, the most important to discontinue immediately are:Drinking all forms of alcohol, which can cause birth defects, miscarriage, stillbirth, and low birth weight.
Smoking tobacco products, which can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and low birth weight.
Using even small amounts of street drugs like cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines can cause serious defects or be fatal to the baby. The effects of marijuana on a fetus are currently not fully understood, but it is recommended that you also discontinue use.
Limit caffeine intake to one cup of coffee per day.

, It is important to drink at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water each day to keep your body well hydrated. Pregnant women experience an increase in blood volume as the body prepares to support the mother and the fetus, and good hydration is needed for this. Drinking plenty of water will also help alleviate symptoms of fatigue, constipation, and preterm labor., It is important to follow a healthy diet throughout the entirety of your pregnancy because getting enough calories from healthy sources is important to keep you and the fetus healthy. Some healthy eating tips to ensure you get enough key nutrients during the first trimester include:Eat smaller nutritious meals more frequently instead of the typical “three meals a day” approach to keep your blood glucose stable and help keep your energy up.
Limit or completely avoid foods that are high in calories from sugar or fat.
Increase your fiber, folic acid, and iron intake by eating whole grains and fortified products.
Eat lean sources of protein like poultry and fish.
Eat foods that are high in calcium and iron, such as green, leafy vegetables.
Choose fresh fruits high in vitamin A, vitamin C and potassium, like citrus fruits and bananas.

, You may experience cravings in the first trimester, but just because you are pregnant doesn’t mean you should eat whatever you want whenever you want to! Monitoring your calorie intake is especially important because recent studies have shown that overweight mothers can negatively impact the health of a child throughout his or her life.While specifics may vary per person, general weight guidelines are:You should only be eating about 300 extra calories per day, and these should come from healthy sources.
Normal weight gain for a healthy woman is about 25 to 35 pounds total during the pregnancy.
Overweight women should only gain about 10 to 20 pounds total during the pregnancy.
Underweight women or women who are pregnant with multiples should only gain 35 to 45 pounds during the pregnancy.

, Even if you are eating healthily and getting good nutrition, it is important to guarantee you are getting enough pregnancy-specific nutrients. Taking a prenatal multivitamin with at least 0.4 to 0.8 milligrams of folic acid is recommended to help prevent birth defects like spina bifida and anencephaly., It is important to talk to your doctor about your exercise plans, but typically it is encouraged for women to continue a previous exercise program or to begin a moderate exercise program during pregnancy. Regular low-impact exercises like walking or swimming are usually encouraged. Some additional guidelines include:Avoid exercising in hot weather and avoid overheating in general.
Be sure to drink water before, during, and after exercising.
Be sure to do stretches and warm-up exercises to increase your breathing and heart rate slowly. Do the same at the end of your workout.
Only exercise at a moderate level (you should be able to comfortably talk during your workout) and stop if you feel tired.

, Most women feel extremely fatigued during their first trimester, and this is completely normal. This fatigue can even happen before you are showing or carrying any baby weight. Your body is going through a lot of physical and hormonal changes, and it takes a lot of energy to keep up. To help you deal with first trimester exhaustion, try some of these tips:Adjust your sleep schedule, and be strict about your bedtime. If your body is telling you to go to bed earlier than usual, listen to it. Cut out unnecessary commitments, and have people help you with housework.
Take 15-minute power naps when you can. If you work full time, close your office door and put your head down for a little bit. If you are a homemaker, ask someone to watch the kids for an hour a few times a week.
Keep hydrated throughout the day and cut back on water intake a few hours before bedtime to help reduce nighttime trips to the bathroom.
Avoid heavy meals or spicy food in the evening to reduce heartburn and indigestion keeping you up at night. Also, avoid drinking too many fluids in the evening, so you are not getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.

, Feeling nauseous during your first trimester is called “morning sickness,” but these symptoms can actually last all day. About 75% of women experience pregnancy-related nausea during the first trimester in varying degrees of severity.Morning sickness usually disappears by the end of the first trimester, but until then try some of these remedies:


Try eating small meals throughout the day that consist of bland foods, preferably carbohydrates, such as dry toast or saltine crackers. You always want to avoid being too full or too hungry.
Avoid rich, spicy, or fatty foods, and any foods whose smells bother you.
Try using acupressure wristbands to see if they help you.
Talk to your doctor about taking a vitamin B6 supplement combined with a 1/2 tablet of Unisom at night, which some studies find can help with nausea.
Ginger also helps reduce nausea. You can take ginger as a tea, candy, or even as a supplement.

, It is normal to worry about what you’re eating, the health of the baby, how your life is changing, and a million other things while you’re pregnant. However, if you feel like your stress and anxiety is consuming you or interfering with your daily life, it is very important that you take action to deal with it. A high-level of stress during pregnancy can increase the odds of preterm labor or a low birth-weight baby.To help manage your stress levels at work and at home, try some of the following stress relievers:


Make slowing down a priority, and start asking your friends, your family, and your partner to help you more. Stop trying to do everything yourself and start saying “no” to unnecessary activities.
Practice relaxation techniques like deep-breathing exercises, yoga, or stretching.
If you’re feeling especially stressed about a certain aspect of pregnancy or delivery, try enrolling in a class or joining a support group on the topic. Learning more about it and hearing from other moms will help ease your anxiety.

, Diagnosing mood disorders in pregnant women can be difficult because pregnancy causes so many similar symptoms, like fatigue, changes in appetite, and trouble sleeping. However, research shows that up to 33% of women experience clinical depression or an anxiety disorder during pregnancy, with only 20% seeking treatment.If you ignore these symptoms and don’t seek treatment, you are putting yourself and your baby at risk. Seek out a therapist who will help you using one of these treatment options:


Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, where a skilled therapist will teach you new ways to manage your thoughts and emotions.
Adding more omega-3 essential fatty acids to your diet. These nutrients are found in foods like oily fish and nuts, and they can act as a natural mood-booster.
Light therapy, where patients are exposed to artificial sunlight at specific times of the day to help relieve depression symptoms
Acupuncture, an ancient Chinese practice that involves placing tiny needles into areas of the body to influence your mood.
Antidepressant medication.

Schedule the ultrasound for the right time in pregnancy.,
Plan around your baby's sleep schedule, if possible.,
Drink lots of water one to two weeks before your appointment.,
Snack on natural sugars right before your appointment.,
Wear proper clothing.,
Take a break and stretch.,
Relax and stay comfortable.,
Familiarize yourself with the setbacks.,
Prepare for hefty fees.,
Talk to your OB/GYN before scheduling the ultrasound.",How to Get the Best Pictures on a 3D Ultrasound," You want to make sure you get your ultrasound in during a time in pregnancy where good pictures are more likely. It's recommended that you wait until after 26 weeks, as this is when fat begins to form in a baby's face. You should get the ultrasound done before 30 weeks. After 30 weeks, your baby will move deeper into your pelvis and this can make it harder to find the baby's face.Ask your doctor about the position of your baby's placenta. If it's at the front of your womb, known as an anterior placenta, it's best to get an ultrasound done around 28 weeks.
Even with proper planning, your baby may be turned away from the camera at the time of the ultrasound. Even if you do not get an image of your baby's face, you'll still have some 3D images of your child prior to birth.;
, If your baby is awake, you may end up getting better 3D ultrasounds. It can be hard to gauge when a baby is sleeping, but you may notice your baby tends to move more during certain hours of the day. If your baby is usually kicking around 3 in the afternoon, for example, try to schedule an ultrasound around then.

, Many doctors who administer 3D ultrasounds report that increased fluid intake can help with 3D ultrasound images. This can help clear up the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby, resulting in clearer photographs.Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water that contain 8 ounces each day in the weeks leading up to the ultrasound.
As your appointment gets closer, make an effort to drink more water than normal. Carry a water bottle with you to work or around the house. Have a glass of water nearby at all times.
If you're not a big water drinker, consider trying flavored water or adding slices of fruit or veggies to a glass of water to make it tastier.

, You want to make sure your baby is awake for the ultrasound, if at all possible. Some doctors think eating natural sugars may wake a baby up, causing the baby to move around more during the scan. Before going in for your ultrasound, try eating a couple servings of fruit.Bananas, dates, cherries, figs, and pomegranates tend to have high sugar content. Try eating some of these fruits just before your ultrasound.
Fruits like berries, watermelon, and cantaloupe have a somewhat low sugar content. While they won't hurt to eat before an ultrasound, they may not have as big an impact on the results.

, Talk to your doctor before the appointment about how to dress. If you're having a transvaginal probe, you may want to wear clothing that fits loosely around the abdomen.This can make the exam easier for you and your doctor, increasing the likelihood of your doctor finding good images.

, You may find, during the appointment, you are not getting the best images of the baby. If this is the case, ask your doctor if you can take a break. Walking around and stretches may stir your baby, causing him or her to shift positions. You may get a better look of your baby's face after walking around for a bit.If you cannot wake your baby up, try not to be too disappointed. While it can be a let down to not get photos of your baby smiling and moving, sleeping pictures can also provide you a good look at your infant.

, It's important to relax during an ultrasound. Some doctors believe babies can sense when their mothers are tense, which could lead to less movement during photos.


Bring your partner or trusted friend with you. Choose someone who's good at keeping you calm, especially during times of stress.
Try engaging in deep, calming breaths if you feel yourself getting tense. It can help to focus on the rhythm of your breathing to try and stay calm.
If you're uncomfortable, ask the technician or doctor if you can shift slightly. You'll be more calm if you're in a position where you feel at ease.

, The American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against 3D ultrasounds. Such procedures are not medically necessary. There are currently no known risks, but the technology is fairly new and risks could be discovered in the future.A 3D ultrasound is meant only to obtain a picture of the baby. Therefore, those conducting exams may miss abnormalities. Conversely, a minor issue with the baby may be misdiagnosed as a major abnormality. This can cause unnecessary stress during a pregnancy.
If you choose to have a 3D ultrasound, have a regular ultrasound conducted by your regular OB/GYN as well. You want to make sure you catch any abnormalities with your baby. A 3D ultrasound is not a substitute for proper medical care.

, As they are not medically necessary, your insurance may not pay for a 3D ultrasound. The ultrasound can be expensive. If you choose to get an ultrasound done, make sure you're prepared for a large bill. Weigh the costs of medical care during pregnancy, as well as the coming costs of childcare and preparing your home for a new baby. Make sure a 3D ultrasound is within your budget., A 3D ultrasound is not usually harmful to a developing fetus. However, talk to your regular OB/GYN before scheduling a 3D ultrasound. You want to make sure your regular doctor thinks the procedure is safe for you and your baby. You also want to make sure you're getting medical ultrasounds throughout your pregnancy to assure your baby is healthy.

Use a moisturizer.,
Use Retin-A.,
Use glycolic acid.,
Combine glycolic acid and Retin-A.,
Try Vitamin E oil.,
Try egg oil.,
Use essential oils.,
Increase your Vitamin C intake.,
For fresh stretch marks, use a pulsed dye laser (aka vascular laser).,
For older stretch marks, try a fractional laser treatment (aka laser resurfacing).,
Get an abdominoplasty (aka tummy tuck).,
Consider a ""mommy makeover,"" or a combination deal.,
Cocoa butter has not been proven to reduce stretch marks.,
Peptide-containing products also haven't been proven to work.",How to Get Rid of Stretch Marks," A study comparing herbal moisturizers found that people who lotioned-up daily showed significant improvement in skin appearance and elasticity . Think of it this way: if your skin has a lot of stretching to do, it's less likely to tear and create stretch marks if it's hydrated.


Use lotion on new stretch marks, or on areas where you're worried about getting them in the future. Though using lotion on old stretch marks may still improve their appearance, it's probably not as effective as using them on fresh ones.
If you're worried about the chemicals in over-the-counter moisturizers, make your own out of equal parts wheat germ oil, olive oil and aloe vera. The same study showed that this combination created the best DIY moisturizer .;
, A study from the University of Michigan suggests that people who use Retin-A (or a retinoic acid cream) on new stretch marks saw huge improvements. Retin-A is thought to boost collagen production, helping skin stretch out and avoid tears.



Note that you should not use any products containing retinoic acid if you are pregnant or nursing. It can potentially cause birth defects in humans .
Retin-A won't be as effective on old stretch marks.
You'll probably need a prescription to get products such as Retin-A, Renova, Tazorac, and Differin (which all contain retinoic acid).
Limit sun exposure of skin that you're treating with Retin-A. It could be more susceptible to burning.

, Glycolic acid used on stretch marks can increase collagen production, as making your skin more elastic overall. As an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA), it's in the same family of compounds often used in chemical skin peels.


Glycolic acid is safe to put on your skin during pregnancy.
Take extra care to keep skin that you're treating with glycolic acid out of the sun.
Glycolic acid can be bought in over-the-counter. For a more intense treatment, you can get a stronger dose from a licensed dermatologist.

, When used together, glycolic acid and Retin-A can dramatically improve the appearance of stretch marks . If you choose to do this, you might want to ""prep"" your skin with Retin-A before using a glycolic acid .



Do not use Retin-A if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. It can cause severe birth defects..
If you need to see a doctor for a Retin-A prescription anyway, ask how he or she would suggest incorporating glycolic acid.

, Vitamin E oil is often said to be the miracle cure for stretch marks, though one study shows that it's most effective on women who have already been pregnant before, and has not been effective in general use . Still, it can't hurt in moderate doses.


Try mixing your Vitamin E oil with a carrier lotion, such as a regular unscented moisturizer, for better coverage.

, Egg oil if used regularly from the first trimester, can prevent pregnancy related stretch marks from appearing. Gently massage egg oil over the entire abdomen including sides and lower abdomen until the pubic area, twice a day starting from the 8th week of pregnancy until 6 months after delivery.

, Though there hasn't yet been a peer-reviewed study on how essential oils can heal stretch marks, they are currently used as a home remedy. You can apply them directly onto the skin, or use a carrier (such as coconut oil or an unscented moisturizer) to make application easier. Here are some oils commonly promoted for stretch marks:


Lavender
Rose
Frankincense
Geranium
Helichrysum
Myrrh

, One dermatologist suggests that 500 mg of Vitamin C, taken as an oral supplement, can help reduce the appearance of stretch marks.


For even better results, try using a topical glycolic acid along with Vitamin C.

, A pulsed dye laser set at 585-nm was shown to reduce stretch marks in post-partum Korean women . This sort of treatment can take down the initial redness, and is best used on early marks (that have not yet turned silver).


Be prepared to hand over a chunk of money for vascular laser treatments. Three to six sessions are required, priced around $450 each.
Vascular laser treatments won't be effective for women with darker skin. Much like laser hair removal, the process works best when there's a large contrast between the target (in this case, the red stretch marks) and the pigment of the skin.

, For stretch marks that are no longer discolored but are still indented, you can use resurfacing with a ""fractional"" laser that focuses on small areas. The laser is aimed at the edges of stretch marks, smoothing over the surface of the skin .


You could need up to three fractional laser treatments; each treatment could cost around $1000.
Hyperpigmentation and scarring are potential side effects of fractional laser treatments.

, The only certain way to get rid of stretch marks is to — you guessed it — cut them out. If you've tried everything else and can't stand the tiger stripes, a tummy tuck might be the ticket.


Be prepared for the cost. In the United States, an abdominoplasty can run between $4000 and $20,000.
Be aware of the risks. As with any major surgery, there are life-threatening complications that can arise from a tummy tuck.
Plan on a long recovery. You can expect to take 2 to 4 weeks off work, and spend 3 to 6 months before you're fully healed.

, Some post-partum women get a tummy tuck, a breast lift, and liposuction all in one procedure.

, In a double-blind study, cocoa butter was not shown to have any discernible effect on stretch marks . Be wary of marketing schemes that claim otherwise.

, ""Repair"" creams or serums that claim to contain peptides or proteins have not been proven to restore skin damaged by stretch marks .

Eat foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids.,
Consume foods containing vitamin D. The active form of vitamin D (calcitriol) plays an important role in female reproduction.,
Increase your vitamin B6 intake.,
Boost your Vitamin C intake.,
Increase your zinc intake.,
Stop smoking.",How to Get Pregnant with Ulcerative Colitis1," Omega 3s are helpful in increasing fertility by regulating reproductive hormones, increasing the cervical mucus of egg white which is vital to help the sperm reach the egg, reduces the body’s sensitivity to the hormone prolactin, which can suppress ovulation, and boosts blood flow to the uterus which can aid with the development of uterine lining.Also, omega 3 has an anti-inflammatory effect which can be helpful in ulcerative colitis. It lowers the production of one of the body’s inflammatory chemicals known as cytokines. If inflammation is reduced, then abdominal pain associated with ulcerative colitis can also be reduced.
Foods rich in omega 3 are cod liver oil, canola oil, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, cashews, avocado, sunflower seeds, almonds, sesame seeds, olive oil, corn oil and safflower oil. You can include at least one of the foods mentioned in each major meal.;
, Calcitriol has the ability to control the genes involved in the production of estrogen and embryo implantation. The uterine lining is able to produce calcitriol in response to the embryo as it passes through the uterine cavity before implantation.Also, vitamin D is helpful in ulcerative colitis. As we all know, in this disease, the harmless bacteria in the intestines are mistaken to be dangerous in the body so the immune system triggers a response causing an inflammation of the intestines. Vitamin D balances the immune system response and prevents overreaction in the form of inflammation.
Foods rich in vitamin D are cod liver oil, fish, fortified cereals, oysters, caviar, tofu, soy milk, salami, ham, sausages, dairy products, eggs and mushrooms.
The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 35 (international units) IUs per pound of body weight (articles.mercola.com). 1 IU is equal to 0.025 micrograms and 1 milligram is equal to 1000 micrograms. So, 1 IU is equal to 0.000025 mg (that’s 0.025 divided by 1000 micrograms).

, This vitamin aids in restoring the luteal phase defects in women experiencing problems with ovulation. The luteal phase which is the time from ovulation to menstruation, should be more than 10 days long (the average is 11 to 16 days) in order for ovulation to occur. If it is lesser than 10 days, then it is called as luteal phase defect.Also, vitamin b6 has been proven to lower the levels of prolactin in the body. Prolactin can disrupt the ovulation process and cause a woman's monthly cycle to become irregular.
Also, vitamin B6 is helpful in ulcerative colitis. This vitamin is a muscle relaxant. This can help relieve abdominal cramping in ulcerative colitis by relaxing the tight intestinal muscles.
The recommended daily intake of this vitamin is 100 mg.Whole grains, walnuts, lean red meat, seafood, bananas, potatoes, beans, spinach and fortified cereals are foods rich in vitamin B6.

, Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is responsible for collagen formation in the cartilage, bones, muscle and blood vessels. It supports ovulation by stabilizing the hormone levels in the body needed for the process and causes the body to create more water needed to increase the cervical mucus . Cervical mucus of egg white is vital to help the sperm reach the egg.


Vitamin C is also helpful in ulcerative colitis because it stimulates the production of collagen, which is the framework where new tissues are built in case of wounds such as ulceration in the intestinal linings.
Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C are blackberries, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, grapefruit, lemon, mango, orange, melon, papaya, pineapple, potato, spinach, strawberries, tangerine and tomato.
Eat at least one of vitamin C-rich foods in each major meal. The recommended daily intake of this vitamin is 65mg., Zinc is a mineral that signals the pituitary gland to release follicle stimulating hormones that promote ovulation and production of adequate levels of estrogen and progesterone.In ulcerative colitis, if its cause is infection, vitamin D can help combat the infection by maintaining the normal function of neutrophils and lymphocytes which helps fight foreign bodies by ingesting them.
The daily recommended intake of zinc should not exceed 25 mg. Foods rich in zinc are shellfish, crabs, veal liver, dark chocolate, wheat germ, watermelon, lean red meats, chickpeas, pumpkin and squash seeds. Include at least one of these zinc-rich foods in each major meal.

, Cigarette smoking specifically affects the intraovarian processes and control mechanism which are responsible for the normal luteal function.The nicotine in cigarettes inhibit the production of progesterone which is necessary for the thickening of the endometrial lining of the uterus in preparation for receiving and nourishing the fertilized egg.
Also, nicotine is a potent vasoconstrictor (constricts blood vessels) which can aggravate the pain associated with ulcerative colitis. So, it is best stop smoking for the rest of your life.

Understand the importance of monitoring your fertility.,
Use the calendar or rhythm method.,
Try the basal body temperature method.,
Consider the cervical mucus method.,
Buy an ovulation prediction test kit.,
Identify the presence of Mittelschmerz.",How to Get Pregnant with Ulcerative Colitis2," A woman should determine first whether she is fertile or not before engaging in sexual intercourse through the following methods :

, This is applicable for women with 26 to 32 days of menstrual cycle. If a woman has 2 longer or shorter cycles within a year, then it will be ineffective or she may want to choose another method.In this method, a woman will count the first day of vaginal bleeding as day 1. Then days 8 to 19 are considered as fertile days or the woman is ovulating.
This is the perfect time for a woman to engage in sexual intercourse.

, You need a special thermometer called basal body thermometer for this method. The baseline body temperature of a woman is the baseline reading you obtain when you get up first thing in the morning.The basal body temperature changes throughout a woman’s cycle because hormone levels fluctuate. During the first half of the cycle, estrogen dominates. In the second half (once ovulation has occurred), there is a surge in the level of progesterone. This hormone leads to a sudden increase in the body temperature as it gets the uterus ready for a fertilized and implantable egg.
The bottom line is the basal body temperature is in its lowest point at ovulation and will dramatically rise (about half a degree) as soon as ovulation happens. You can chart your basal body temperature for about a month or two.
Notice the days wherein there are sudden rise in your body temperature, for this could be the perfect time for you to engage in sex and increase your chance of getting pregnant.

, As a woman gets closer to ovulation, the cervical mucus becomes more copious in amount, but it is now thinner, clearer and slippery in consistency that is similar to an egg white. Women normally discharges cervical mucus which may get into contact with their underwear.To test this method, get the cervical mucus and try to stretch it between your fingers. If you are able to pull it into a string about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) before it breaks, then this is a sign of impeding ovulation.
Once ovulation happens, the woman may either become dry again or may develop thicker discharge. You can chart the days where you are most likely to ovulate for you to pinpoint the days to engage in sex.

, This can be purchased at a drugstore near you and perhaps considered as the most comfortable of all methods. The test detects a sudden rise in luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine which means that the ovary is ready to release the egg.


Ovulation prediction test kits usually has 5 to 7 sticks. Several days of testing (one week will do) is needed to detect a surge in luteinizing hormone. The specific time of month to start testing depends how on the menstrual cycle’s length. For example, for most women, the normal cycle is 28 days.
You will need to begin the test on day 11, the 11th day after the start of the period. To do this, you will need to urinate on the test stick. This can also be done by soaking the test stick into the urine collected into a sterile container.
The test stick will display a plus or positive sign (some may change color; this depends on the ovulation kit’s manufacturer instructions). A positive result indicates that a woman should ovulate in the next 24 to 36 hours, which is the right time for you to engage in sex.

, This is a German word for middle pain. The body will send a twinge of sharp pain or a series of cramps to one side of the lower abdominal area (this is the side that a woman is ovulating).This shows that the egg is already matured and it is now released by the ovary. If this happens, you can engage in sexual intercourse.

Drink warm water.",How to Get Pregnant Using Instead Cups," In order to determine when sexual intercourse will most likely result in pregnancy, it is useful to know when you are most fertile. Fertility is highest during ovulation, and charting your cycle can help determine when ovulation usually occurs within your cycle.


The first day of your period, mark the number ""1"" on the calendar for that day.
The first day of your next period, mark a ""1"" on the calendar that day, and mark the number of days in your last cycle on the day prior.
Ovulation (releasing an egg from the ovary) typically occurs during the midpoint of your cycle. For example, in a typical 28 day cycle, ovulation tends to occur on day 14. In a 30 day cycle, ovulation should be expected on day 15. You can begin attempts to get pregnant before the end of your first cycle of course. Obviously, you should quit birth control before you try to get pregnant.
Have sex more frequently within a few days of this midpoint to increase chances of pregnancy.;
, Ovulation predictor kits (OPK sticks) are a commonly-used device that can determine when a woman is ovulating to help time sex.


Start using OPK sticks two days before the midpoint of your cycle, and continue using them until you either have a positive result or start your next cycle. Use them once per day.
Cheap, generic sticks are usually adequate. They look like pregnancy tests and you can either pee on the wick at the end or immerse it in pee in a cup (read the actual instructions).
Try to use the OPK sticks at the same time each day. Ovulation can vary widely between cycles and different women.
Mark your OPK test results on the calendar for each day. It's important to know that they detect something called the LH surge (luteinizing hormone) from the pituitary gland in your brain that tells your ovaries it is time to ovulate. It doesn't happen immediately however, the LH surge precedes actual ovulation by 24 to 36 hours.
Have sex after a positive OPK test. Because the OPK test will register as positive prior to actual ovulation, you can wait up to 12 hours before having sex. However, having sex early will not decrease your chances of pregnancy, as long as you continue having sex regularly during ovulation.

, The cervix produces several kinds of mucous, which can be good indicators of fertility. To determine if ovulation is occurring, examine your cervical mucous by inserting clean hands into your vagina, and observing the qualities of the mucous.


Sticky or scant findings indicate you are probably not ovulating yet.
Creamy consistency indicates you may ovulate soon.
Wet, watery, or stretchy mucous indicates ovulation is likely very close.
Very wet mucous that can stretch between your fingers for an inch or more indicates ovulation is right around the corner or in progress. This is the ideal time for intercourse.

This type of mucous is like a superhighway for sperm to cruise up into the cervix and reproductive tract. At the cervix, sperm is chemically changed, or capacitized, to enable it to fertilize the egg. This process takes about 12 hours, so in order to co-ordinate actual ovulation with capacitized sperm, wait 12 hours after your positive OPK test before you have sex again. This will time your actual ovulation with the maximum number of live capacitized sperm in your system.



, Basal body temperature is the lowest body temperature a healthy person has during the day. Increases in basal body temperature can indicate the beginning of ovulation.


In order to measure your basal body temperature, you must take your temperature with a basal thermometer (a thermometer with a very fine scale) right after awakening in the morning.
During ovulation, basal body temperature increases by 0.1 or 0.2 degrees, and is sustained at this level until the next cycle begins.
By regularly charting your temperature, you will be able to predict when you are likely to next ovulate.

, Instead Cups are intended for use as menstrual cups, worn to collect menstrual fluid. Because their primary design is not for aiding pregnancy, this method is not as reliable as more studied and traditional methods for achieving pregnancy.

, Do not ""scoop up"" semen in the Instead Cup. Rather, ask your partner to pull out and deposit the semen directly into a ready Instead Cup. Have one within arms reach and open it at the appropriate time.

, Cover the inside of the lip with semen, taking care to cover the thermoplastic membrane.

, Squeeze the sides of the Cup together and insert the Instead Cup as recommended by the manufacturer (all the way to the back of the vagina, covering the cervix near the back, with the front lip behind the pubic bone).


Fertile cervical mucous will flow from your cervix into the Instead Cup covered in a film of semen. This will maximize the effectiveness of both your cervical mucous and your partners semen, which will liquify after about an hour when sperm will enter the cervical mucous and into your reproductive tract.

, Allow the Cup to sit inside your vagina for 6+ hours, but never for more than 12.

, After 6 hours, carefully remove the cup from your vagina. Removing the instead cup can be tricky and even a little frightening, but keep your cool and remember that it will come out with a little coaxing.


If hooking your finger under the bottom lip and pulling doesn't work for you, break the seal at the top by poking it with a finger and pull it down and out. Putting your legs up to your chest and bearing down may help also.

, Is it full of clear liquid with some swirls of white? It should contain liquified semen and fertile cervical mucous.

, Give yourself a longer window until testing for pregnancy, at least until after your next period would have normally come. It takes 7-10 days for a fertilized egg to reach the uterus and implant, so testing too early can be demoralizing and is not useful.

, Eating healthy foods that support fertility can be a good way to increase chances of pregnancy. For example, opting for a diet that is lower in animal proteins, and higher in vegetable intake can increase fertility. , Regular moderate-intensity exercise can benefit women of all body types who are trying to conceive. In order to reap the benefits of exercise, light or moderate exercise should be engage in a few times per week. However, vigorous exercise more than five hours per week may reduce fertility, and should be avoided. , Even if your diet includes a healthy amount of vitamins and minerals, pre-natal vitamins supply more folic acid and iron than do standard adult vitamins, both of which aid fertility. Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects and iron supports the baby's growth and development.

, Studies have shown that stress can contribute to infertility. Relieving stress may help with conception, although the exact links between stress and fertility are not yet fully understood. , Fertility medication usually works by causing the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to release hormones that will stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs. These medications can be a useful resource for women who have not been able to achieve pregnancy otherwise. , In-vitro fertilization can allow for pregnancy when other methods of conception have failed. IVF allows for an egg to fertilized by sperm outside the body, and then replaced into the mother's uterus in order to establish a successful pregnancy. , Some folk remedies point to a variety of herbs said to increase fertility. These include chasteberry leaves, red clover, evening primrose oil, stinging nettle, and red raspberry leaves. These herbs are often consumed as an infusion, made from steeping them in hot water. These herbal remedies are often referenced in traditional folk medicine, but are often not researched and do not have any proven effect on fertility. , Warm water has been said to have a positive effect on reproductive organs, as well as on blood flow. Hydration also assists with the production of cervical mucous, necessary for conception. "

Eat small, frequent meals.,
Drink lots of fluid.,
Snack on crackers.,
Stick to bland food.,
Avoid foods and smells that trigger your nausea.,
Listen to your cravings.,
Eat carbohydrates.,
Eat high-protein foods.,
Eat cold food.,
Avoid fatty foods.,
Brush your teeth.,
Avoid lying down after eating.",How to Get Over Morning Sickness1," If you're suffering from morning sickness, sometimes the last thing you feel like doing is eating. However, it is important that your body gets the vitamins and nutrients it needs to keep you and your growing baby healthy.


Try to avoid an empty stomach by eating small, frequent meals throughout the day.
You should also try to eat at a slower pace than you normally would to avoid overeating, which may make you feel even worse.;
, It's extremely important that you stay hydrated, especially if you're getting sick frequently. If you let yourself become dehydrated, you will feel even more nauseated. Sip fluids throughout the day, using a straw if it helps. Try to refrain from drinking 30 minutes before or after eating, however.


You should try to drink about 6 to 8 glasses of water each day. However, if you've been getting sick a lot, you can try replacing some of the water with a sports drink containing glucose, salt, or potassium to help restore lost electrolytes.Alternatively, you can try drinking cold, carbonated beverages, as some women find these easier on the stomach. Other women also find sour drinks, like lemonade, easier to keep down.
Avoid drinking too many fluids, though. Liquids can give you a false sense of fullness which may cause you to feel less hungry throughout the day., Many women insist that crackers are a necessity when dealing with morning sickness. They make a great snack as they are portable, inexpensive and easy to digest. Keep a stash of dry crackers beside your bed and eat a few before getting up in the morning, then continue to nibble on them throughout the day.If you need to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, try eating a cracker or two then as well. They'll help stave off hunger and settle your stomach before the morning.It doesn't matter what kind of crackers you eat, saltines, wheat thins, rice cakes - it's a matter of personal preference. If you're not a cracker fan, try eating dry cereal instead.
Avoid coating your crackers in greasy butter or fatty spreads, they may make you feel more unwell and are harder to digest. Eat the crackers dry, if possible.

, Stick to bland foods as much as possible when dealing with morning sickness. They smell less strongly and are easy to digest.


Do your best to avoid spicy, acidic, and fried foods, as these are more likely to upset your stomach.
Try the BRAT diet, which consists of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods are bland and low in fiber and thus gentle on your digestive track. They are also very inexpensive.You can also add tea and yogurt to the list to go on the BRATTY diet.

, After a while, you will start to notice that certain foods or smells will trigger your nausea. It may be pizza, bacon or anything at all. Once you know your triggers, you can take steps to avoid them.Try making a note of when and why you feel queasy every day, in order to identify your food triggers.

, Indulge your cravings, especially if it helps you to feel better. If you have a craving for a particular food, your body may be trying to tell you something. If you are craving dairy, perhaps you need calcium. If you are craving peanut butter, perhaps you need protein or more calories., A lot of women find carbohydrate-filled foods the most appealing when feeling nauseated. Stock up your cupboards with carbohydrate-rich pasta, bread, pretzels and granola bars., Some women find that high protein foods help to ease their morning sickness. Whether it's scrambled eggs, peanut butter, or a lean piece of meat, try to find a protein-rich food that works for you., Try to eat your food either cold or at room temperature, because food tends to have a more pervasive smell when heated, and strong aromas can be major triggers for morning sickness.Stick to sandwiches, fruit and raw vegetables, and salad (when it's properly prepared to prevent listeria).

, Fatty foods take longer to digest and can be rough on your digestive system, which can worsen feelings of nausea.They are also less healthy, providing fewer nutrients than other types of foods and have a tendency to smell quite strongly, which isn't good. Avoid!

, Brush your teeth thoroughly and swirl some mouthwash after you eat. This will prevent odors and tastes from hanging around your mouth after eating. Get your partner to brush his teeth too, while you're at it. Nothing like a pepperoni pizza breath kiss to trigger your gag reflex.

, You should avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after eating, as the horizontal position can interfere with digestion and lead to queasiness."

Learn to avoid triggers.,
Move slowly.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Adjust your computer.,
Get some fresh air.,
Distract yourself.,
Carry a survival kit.,
See a doctor.",How to Get Over Morning Sickness2," It's not just the smell of food that can trigger your nausea, you need to watch out for non-food triggers as well. According to babycenter.com, ""a warm or stuffy room, the smell of heavy perfume, a car ride, or even certain visual stimuli, like flickering lights, might trigger your nausea.""Make a mental note every time your nausea is triggered, then you can make a conscious effort to avoid that trigger moving forward.

, Sudden movements can jolt your stomach and bring on a fresh wave of nausea, so try to move as slowly and carefully as possible. Take your time getting up in the morning - nibble a cracker while still lying down, move gently into a sitting position, then stay seated for a few minutes before standing up. Pace yourself throughout the day, don't overexert yourself.


Set your alarm clock a half hour earlier than usual to give yourself plenty of time in the mornings.
Try putting a little stool or seat in the shower, so you can avoid feeling light-headed.

, Sometimes the easiest and simplest solution is just to stop and give your body a break for a while. Try lying down, closing your eyes, taking a few deep breaths, and just getting some rest. Many women find that sleep is a great way to escape morning sickness - and it might be just what your body needs!If you already have a kids, bring a babysitter in, even if it's just for an hour or two, so you can catch up on some long overdue R&R.
Having trouble nodding off during the day? Try wearing a sleep mask or putting on a pair of dark sunglasses to block out bright light.

, You may think that surfing the web will help take your mind off morning sickness, but the computer's bright screen and undetectable strobe effect may make you more nauseated. To combat that, try adjusting your screen to reduce eye strain.


Try changing the font size to make it bolder and larger, and change the desktop background to a soft pink or tan.
You should also take short breaks from the computer as frequently as possible -- you can do this by getting up and moving around or simply by closing your eyes., Escape from the stuffy indoors and head outside for some fresh air and light exercise. Breathe deeply through the nose, then exhale through the mouth. Clean, country or seaside air is best, but your garden or a nearby park will also do nicely.


If you're stuck indoors, try opening a window to let the stale air out and the fresh air circulate.

, Nausea can be difficult to ignore, but finding something to take your mind off it - even for a little while - can help. Read a magazine, call a friend, or go for a short walk. Light exercise, such as yoga or gentle swimming may also help to ease nausea, but you should get any exercise plans approved by your doctor first. It's also important to listen to your body -- if you start feeling tired or more queasy, it's time to stop., It's a smart idea to put together a little survival kit for yourself for those emergency situations when you're not at home. Pack a toothbrush and toothpaste, some mints and a clean blouse. You could also include a snack such as crackers or pretzels, and a plastic bag for when you just can't make it to a restroom on time., If you just can't seem to find any relief from your morning sickness, go to see your doctor. Ask about anti-nausea medications, which can help ease or eliminate your suffering. A small percentage of women may also develop a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum, which is an extreme form of morning sickness which causes extreme dehydration and weight loss. If you think you may be at risk, contact your health care provider immediately.Some anti-nausea medications may not be covered under insurance plans and can be costly - so consider the expense before getting a prescription.

Other citrus fruits, such as grapefruit, orange and tangerine may also help.

, Ginger has been used to relieve nausea for centuries. Try drinking ginger ale (made with real ginger) or make ginger tea by adding a thin slice of fresh ginger into hot water. If that doesn't float your boat, snack on some ginger cookies or gingerbread, or grab a handful of crystallized ginger candy., Peppermint relieves feelings of nausea and reduces the stomach's gag reflex. Make a peppermint tea by adding a few fresh leaves to some boiling water and leaving to infuse for a few minutes before drinking. You can also try sucking on some peppermint candies., Brew yourself a cup of red raspberry-leaf tea. This herb is popular for a number of pregnancy problems, including morning sickness, and has been shown to relax the smooth muscles of the uterus. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of the dried herb to a cup of hot water before drinking.


However, you should check with your doctor before taking this remedy as there is some evidence that raspberry leaf can cause uterine contractions., Battle unpleasant odors by arming yourself with a small satchel stuffed with dried herbs.

Pilates and yoga can also help you to relax and take your mind off things, while allowing you to get some gentle exercise as well., Acupressure wristbands are said to help relieve symptoms of nausea and vomiting and are often used to ward off seasickness. They work by stimulating an acupuncture spot located on the underside of the wrist. Some women claim that acupressure wristbands have helped to relieve their morning sickness, though there is no medical evidence to support this claim.Acupressure bands are relatively inexpensive and can be found at most drugstores., Experiment with the soothing scents of essential oils to help you overcome odor-induced nausea. Some women find scents such as lemon, mint, or orange to be particularly soothing. Simply add a drop or two of your chosen essential oil into a diffuser to disperse throughout the air, or you can add a drop to a tissue or piece of cloth and take a little sniff whenever you feel any queasiness coming on. It's usually only necessary to use a drop or two of essential oil, as the fragrance is very concentrated.

, Studies have shown that acupuncture can help to significantly relieve morning sickness. Just do some research to ensure that your chosen acupuncturist has experience treating nausea in pregnant women., An acustimulation device stimulates the acupuncture point on the underside of your wrist with a mild electric current. Although they are not very commonly used, some research suggests that they may help with the relief of morning sickness. These acustimulation devices are completely safe to use, but can be cost prohibitive., Hypnosis has been shown to help with symptoms of nausea resulting from chemotherapy, so it may be something that's worth a try if nothing else seems to be working."

Understand the importance of the ultrasound exam.,
Schedule the appointment per your health care provider's instructions.,
Drink 4 to 6 glasses of water before the exam.,
Wear loose-fitting clothing.,
Relax and lie still during the exam.,
Readjust your clothing at the conclusion of the exam.,
Discuss the results of the ultrasound with your health care professional.",How to Get an Ultrasound for Pregnancy," The ultrasound exam is used to evaluate the fetus' growth and development, and to determine how the pregnancy is progressing. Two ultrasound exams are performed over the course of your pregnancy - one in the first trimester and one in the second.


The first trimester ultrasound is used by health care providers to confirm and date the pregnancy, so you will get a fairly accurate idea of your due date. This ultrasound can also be used to check for the presence of more than one fetus.
The second trimester ultrasound scans for fetal malformations and, in some cases, is able to confirm the sex of the baby. It can also be used to check the position of the baby and the placenta, the baby's expected weight and the amount of amniotic fluid present.;
, Your first ultrasound will usually be scheduled about 20 weeks into your pregnancy. Check with your health insurance provider to ensure the procedure will be covered and to determine where the exam must be performed. Some insurers require testing to be done at a medical lab, while others approve in-office ultrasounds.

, A full bladder can change the position of the uterus by taking the flexion (bending movement) out of it and pushing it up so it is easier to scan. Also, the fluid in the bladder serves as a good medium for sound conduction. You will be asked to refrain from urinating until the exam is complete.

, You will not need to disrobe for a standard ultrasound, but will need to lift your shirt to fully expose your belly and lower abdomen.

, The technician will apply special gel to your abdomen and will glide a transducer on top of the gel.


The sound waves reflected off of your bones and other tissues will be converted into black-and-white or gray images on a monitor for measurement by the technician.
You may be asked to hold your breath for just a few seconds several times during the exam, which should take about 30 minutes in total.
When complete, the technician will assist you with wiping away the conductive gel.

, You will now be able to urinate if necessary and await the results of the ultrasound. Most technicians will provide you with a printout of some of the more recognizable images, which can be saved as a memento of the pregnancy.

, Do not attempt to decipher the ultrasound images on your own, as they are nearly impossible to read by the untrained eye.


According to the National Library of Medicine, normal results would show that the developing baby, placenta, amniotic fluid, and surrounding structures are normal in appearance and appropriate for the gestational age. You may see this section attached with the ultrasound image written in a separate paper.

Eat red meat.,
Incorporate other sources of meat.,
Choose iron-fortified foods.,
Add more beans.,
Eat leafy greens and dried fruit.",How to Get Enough Iron During Pregnancy1," Red meat is one of the best sources of iron. Red meat contains heme iron, which is only found in animal products. This type of iron is easier for your body to absorb. Add lean sources of red meat to your diet to increase your iron.Three ounces of red meat, such as lean beef chuck or tenderloin, has around 3 mg of iron.
Avoid liver while you are pregnant, though it contains one of the highest concentrations of iron. Liver also contains high amounts of Vitamin A, which can be dangerous while pregnant.;
, Red meat is not the only meat that contains iron. White meats, such as chicken and turkey, also contain heme iron. They just contain less iron than red meat.Three ounces of dark meat turkey has around 2 mg of iron, while three ounces of turkey breast or chicken contain between 1.1 to 1.4 mg of iron.
Three ounces of pork loin or white fish has just under 1 mg of iron.

, Many foods are fortified with iron. Foods fortified with iron contain non-heme iron, which is more difficult for your body to absorb. Look on labels of cereals, breads, pastas, and grains to see if they are fortified with iron.


For example, a cup of cereal fortified with iron can have 24 mg of iron, while a cup of instant oatmeal fortified with iron can have 10 mg.

, Beans and legumes have a good amount of iron.You can eat these foods as side dishes, in soups or casseroles, or on salads. A half of cup of most beans have more iron than three ounces of red meat. However, these foods contain non-heme iron, so it is harder for your body to absorb.The following lists the iron content in common cooked beans:


One cup of edamame: 8.8 mg
One cup lentils: 6.6 mg
One cup kidney beans: 5.2 mg
One cup black or pinto beans: 3.6 mg
One cup lima beans: 4.5 mg
One cup chickpeas (garbanzo beans): 4.8 mg

, Leafy greens and dried fruit are a good source of plant-based iron. Spinach, kale, and parsley are good choices, as are dried apricots, figs, and prunes.For example, half a cup of cooked spinach has 3.2 g of iron. Five halves of dried apricots and half a cup of raisins have around 1.5 to 2 mg of iron."
"
Include one serving of meat with each meal.,
Add vitamin C-rich foods.,
Eat an iron-enhancer when you eat an iron inhibiting food.,
Limit your coffee and tea.",How to Get Enough Iron During Pregnancy2," You don’t have to eat large servings of red meat with each meal. If you include meat with each meal, which contains heme iron that is easily absorbed, your body can better absorb the iron found in non-heme sources of your meal.For example, you may have a piece of chicken or white fish, half a cup of spinach, and half a cup of kidney beans, and a piece of iron-fortified wheat bread. The meat will help your body absorb the iron in the non-meat sources.

, In addition to eating iron-rich foods, you should incorporate more foods containing vitamin C with your meals. Vitamin C can help significantly increase the iron absorption of your non-heme iron plant-based foods.Vitamin C can be found in citrus fruits and citrus fruit juices, apples, pineapple, kiwi, strawberries, asparagus, leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, bell peppers, and broccoli.

, Many healthy, nutritious foods contain compounds that reduce the absorption of iron. Some foods that contain significant levels of iron, like spinach, tofu, and edamame, also contain iron inhibitors. When you eat these foods, make sure to eat vitamin C foods or meats along with these foods.Legumes, whole grains, soy products, spinach, and calcium all reduce the absorption of iron.

, You may already be limiting your coffee and tea when you are pregnant because of the caffeine. However, you should also stay away from coffee and tea because they contain compounds that can reduce your body’s absorption of iron.Find alternate beverages to drink, especially with your meals.

Talk to your doctor before taking an iron supplement.,
Determine the amount of iron you need.,
Be aware of the risks of too much iron.,
Recognize the symptoms of anemia.",How to Get Enough Iron During Pregnancy3," Your doctor will more than likely put you on a prenatal vitamin when you first get pregnant. These generally contain around 30 mg of iron. As long as you eat iron-rich foods and take your prenatal vitamin, you will not need to take an extra iron supplement. Always talk to your doctor before taking an iron supplement.


You will probably not be advised to take an iron supplement unless you develop anemia.

, Pregnant women need more iron than women who are not pregnant. When you are pregnant, you need around 27 mg of iron per day. This amount can be averaged out over a few days or week instead of trying to hit 27 mg each day.For non-pregnant women, the recommended daily amount is 18 mg.

, You can get too much iron. This generally occurs from your prenatal vitamin or if you take an extra iron supplement. Too much iron can cause problems for you and your baby, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or even miscarriage.Make sure to only take iron supplements if you are told to by a doctor. Iron supplements can cause negative side effects during pregnancy, such as constipation or nausea.

, Not getting enough iron during pregnancy can lead to anemia. Severe anemia during pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby, and lead to your baby being premature or having a low weight at birth. Symptoms of anemia include:Fatigue
Weakness
Cold hands and feet
Rapid heartbeat
Trouble concentrating
Shortness of breath or feeling lightheaded

Understand that the ""second trimester ultrasound"" is more detailed.,
Be aware that third trimester ultrasounds are rare.",How to Get a Baby to Move for an Ultrasound," The juices typically don't take too long to absorb into your bloodstream. The sugar in the juices tends to wake up your baby while in utero.


Also, if you didn't give up caffeine after finding out you're pregnant, you can opt for a cup of coffee or can of soda. The caffeine enters your bloodstream and might stimulate your baby to move around.;
, This could help if you feel as though your baby isn't moving and may be asleep. While walking can usually soothe and rock a baby to sleep from an awake state, it might also be able to wake up your baby from its in utero nap.

, Coughing and laughing can jostle your baby awake, which can increase your odds of the baby changing positions.


It can also help to engage in conversation with the ultrasound technician; however, you don't want to distract them as they are in the midst of important aspects of the ultrasound examination, so ask for permission prior to engaging them in conversation.

, The ultrasound tech can use the probe to gently shake your baby and try to get the baby to move to a better position. You can also try using your own hands to jiggle or poke at your baby gently.

, It is used as a method to confirm a pregnancy, or it is also used as a ""dating ultrasound"" for those women who cannot remember when their last menstrual period was and are unsure of how far along their pregnancy is. What your doctor will look for during this first-trimester ultrasound is a heartbeat, as well as the presence of your baby inside the uterus (checking to make sure there are no pregnancy abnormalities. Your doctor can also use measuring tools on their computer (where the ultrasound is being recorded) to assess what is called the ""crown-to-rump length"" which is used to date the pregnancy.
Not everyone receives a first-trimester ultrasound; rather, it is reserved for those patients whose doctors have early concerns about the pregnancy's success or uncertainty around dates. In general, everyone receives the second-trimester ultrasound which is a much more detailed assessment of their baby and occurs done between 18 and 20 weeks. External sex organs have not developed at this point so the doctor won't be able to determine sex during this ultrasound.

, It is usually done between 18 and 20 weeks, and is able to assess for a variety of things including the baby's sex (in most cases), as well as overall growth and development. It is this second-trimester ultrasound where you will be interested in strategies in getting your baby to move. One particular reason couples are interested in this is that with more movement there is a greater chance the ultrasound technician can determine the sex of the baby (which is of interest to many people).
The baby's sex (male or female) can be determined on second-trimester ultrasound by the presence or absence of a penis, which is usually observable with sufficient fetal movement (or if the baby happens to be in a position where this can be seen from the outset).

, They are only done in more complicated cases where your doctor wants to check on the baby (for instance checking fluid levels, getting measurements, or monitoring in special cases such as with gestational diabetes)."

Design an exercise regimen that you can do while pregnant.,
Opt for a diet that promotes sleep while pregnant.,
Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated.,
Invest in a maternity pillow that supports you while you sleep.,
Wear comfortable sleepwear.,
Establish a consistent pregnancy sleep routine that allows you to go to bed at the same time every night.",How to Get Better Sleep During Pregnancy," Make sure that it is not too strenuous and that you cut back on repetitions and overactive sessions as your pregnancy progresses. Exercise will help exhaust you so that you can sleep deeper at night. Additionally, exercise will help reduce the risk of leg cramps that often occur at night when pregnant. Opt for Yoga or Tai Chi as your exercise choice, as they are both meditative and will allow you some time to relax and be calm while pregnant.;
, Foods that are too heavy, acidic, fatty and spicy will often cause heartburn and indigestion on a regular basis; but when pregnant, these side effects are typically worse. Try to cut these types of food out of your diet. Another option is to avoid eating within 2 hours of bedtime so you can get better pregnancy sleep.

, Pregnancy side effects include swollen legs and ankles. The more fluids you drink, the less fluid your body will feel the need to retain. Additionally, remaining hydrated will help avoid headaches. Just make sure that you drink most of your fluids during the day so that you are not up all night going to the bathroom.

, As your pregnancy progresses, you may find that it is getting more difficult to get comfortable in bed. You cannot sleep on your back in the third trimester, it's impossible to sleep on your stomach and it's uncomfortable for your back and pregnant stomach when you sleep on your side. A maternity pillow can solve all these concerns because it is long enough for you to hug, lay under your stomach for support, and extend down to between your knees. Consider a pillow wedge to support your back also.

, As your stomach expands, you should consider wearing pajama bottoms with tie waists so that you can adjust them to over or under the stomach. Sleep shirts are also a comfortable option.

Buy an ovulation prediction kit.,
Reduce stress in your life.",How to Get a Girl Pregnant," Although some people think a “biological clock” explains a women’s window to get pregnant, men have a harder time getting women pregnant after 40.


After 50, a man’s sperm count can be extremely reduced, depending upon genetics and other factors.;
, Doctors suggest 5 to 7 drinks a week is the most you can consume without affecting sperm count.

, Nicotine reduces sperm count and lowers sperm quality, just like alcohol., Elevated temperatures over your body heat reduce sperm count. The testicles are designed to hang down and stay cool.


Don’t spend a lot of time hot tubbing. Also, avoid the sauna and steam room.
Don’t sit with your laptop or other electronics on your groin. The hard drive will heat up, so invest in a laptop desk that keeps air between your legs and the computer.

, Avoid long cycling sessions. Bike shorts and pressure from the bicycle seat can overheat your sperm and break veins. Pick a type of exercise that doesn’t put too much pressure on the testicles.
Wear a cup if you fear contact to the groin.
Choose exercise clothing that allows your sexual organs to hang down and stay cool.
Exercise usually has a positive effect on sperm count. Men who are overweight are less likely to conceive.

, Anti-depressants and drugs for hair loss have been shown to adversely affect sperm count.


However, other drugs may also have this side effect. Read the literature describing the medication and ask your doctor, if you are trying to get a woman pregnant.

,


Ideally, she should stop taking the pills 1 to 2 months before she wants to conceive. Different women will process the hormones differently.
If a woman is using an intrauterine device (IUD), she will need to get it surgically removed several months before trying to conceive a child.







,


Avoid using over the counter lubes, since they can decrease the chances of conception.







, You should learn both the beginning and ending dates of her period.


Period lengths vary greatly.
Some women are irregular, having their period at different times each month.

, Ovulation usually occurs approximately 14 days after the first full day of bleeding of the woman’s last period.


If a woman has a longer cycle, then it can be 20 days after the first day of her last period., Approximately 1 week after her menstrual cycle, you should increase unprotected sexual activity.Sperm can stay alive inside the woman’s body for up to 6 days.
The more you have intercourse during this period, the more likely there will be viable sperm during the conception window.
The egg is viable for conception in the time between being released and traveling from the fallopian tubes into the uterus.
Starting to have sex after the egg is released will reduce your chances of conception. The egg will die approximately 1 day after ovulation.

,, You and your partner may want to get tested.

, Seek the help of a relationship counselor, if you or your partner has a sex drive that is too low to conceive a child.

, Get your partner to test herself to find out when she is ovulating over several months. The more you know about their body, the more you can plan intercourse during the 6 days before the egg drops.

, Both men and women find it harder to conceive in high stress situations. If you have put a lot of stress on yourself to have a baby, it may be working against you.


Seek a counselor, try meditation or get involved with another of your favorite activities.

Cut out common heartburn causing foods.,
Eat less fatty and spicy foods.,
Reduce beverages that can trigger heartburn.,
Eat an apple or banana.,
Determine which foods cause you heartburn.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Eat slowly.,
Refrain from eating before bedtime.",How to Get Rid of Heartburn when Pregnant1," Eating foods that you may have a sensitivity to can cause heartburn. Common heartburn causing foods include:


Citrus fruit
Chocolate
Tomatoes
Garlic and onions;
, Fatty foods can cause the sphincter separating your esophagus and stomach to stay open, which can cause heartburn.You should avoid fatty foods if you are struggling with heartburn. Spicy foods can also cause heartburn in a lot of individuals. Lay off the spices to help get rid of your heartburn.

, Food is not the only substance that can cause heartburn. Certain beverages can give you heartburn. Try to reduce the number of caffeinated beverages you drink to help alleviate heartburn., The pectin in the apple skin acts as a natural antacid. Bananas contain natural antacids. Try eating an apple or a ripe banana to help with heartburn., Since pregnancy causes many changes to your body, things that normally don’t bother you may cause you heartburn now. If you have heartburn a lot, try to figure out what foods are causing it. First, start with the common heartburn trigger foods. Then, start to look at the foods you eat just before a case of heartburn.


This may involve keeping track of foods that cause problems. Write down the foods you eat and see how you feel about one hour after eating. If the food you ate an hour ago is bothering you, you should eliminate that from your diet.For example, if you have spaghetti and meatballs with tomato sauce for dinner and have heartburn within an hour, your trigger could be the spaghetti, the meatballs, or the tomato sauce. Next time, eliminate the tomato sauce. If you have no heartburn, you know that the tomato sauce is the trigger. If you still have heartburn, it could be the pasta or the meatballs. Next day, have some leftover pasta alone with no meatballs and no sauce. If you have heartburn, the pasta should be eliminated from your diet.

, Large meals can lead to heartburn. To prevent this from happening, eat smaller amounts of food at any one time. This reduces the stress pressure on your stomach., Slowing down when you eat may help get rid of your heartburn. Eating more slowly allows the food to be digested more easily and quickly, leaving less food in the stomach to wash back up into the esophagus., As you try to fall asleep, you can put pressure on your esophagus and cause heartburn. To help eliminate this, don’t eat two to three hours before bedtime.Don’t lie down after eating, even to take a nap. If you are tired, then try reclining in a chair or use some pillows to elevate your head and upper body.

You can take antacids containing calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide, but make sure to read the label to ensure they do not contain aluminum.


Liquid antacids may work a bit faster than tablets, and both are effective.
Antacids that contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or sodium citrate may cause water retention and they can also be toxic to your baby. You should avoid them.
If you are going to take antacids, make sure you take your prenatal vitamins at least 1 hour away from them., H2 blockers appear to be safe during pregnancy.This includes over-the-counter medicines like Tagamet, Pepcid, and Zantac. The pills you can buy in the store are contain lower doses. If you want a higher dose, see your physician so he can prescribe a higher dosage. When using H2 blockers, make sure to follow manufacturer’s instructions. You should discuss taking H2 blockers with your doctor.


Side effects of H2 can include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hives, nausea or vomiting, and problems with urination.If you experience any of these side effects, stop using the H2 blockers and call your physician right away.

, If your heartburn is bad enough, you may consider proton-pump inhibitors, such as Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec, Protonix, Aciphex, and Dexilant. They are thought to be safe during pregnancy.However, before taking PPIs, make sure to consult your doctor.


Some PPIs, like omeprazole (Zegerid) may cause fetal toxicity, and therefore shouldn’t be taken while pregnant. This is why it’s important to discuss your options with your doctor before taking them.

Drink ginger tea.",How to Get Rid of Heartburn when Pregnant3," Wearing comfortable clothing that doesn’t constrict your stomach or abdomen may help reduce your heartburn. It may put less stress on your stomach and lower the risk of pushing food or acid into your esophagus., One of the most common reasons for heartburn is being overweight. While pregnant, you should make sure you are not gaining too much weight, especially if you are having problems with heartburn.Maintaining a healthy weight will help reduce pressure on the esophagus.

, Try raising the head of your bed to allow gravity to help keep the acid in your stomach. Place blocks under the head of your bed and raise it about six inches.Don’t pile pillows beneath your head. This won’t help your heartburn, and only bend your neck and body and possibly make the heartburn worse.

Figure out whether you have postpartum depression or just the “baby blues.” Although you should seek the evaluation of a health professional, you may be able to determine whether your symptoms are a passing phase or a more permanent state of mind.,
Discuss your feelings and worries with family and friends.,
Enquire within your community.,
Make sure you like the group you have found; if not, continue the search until you find a support group that makes you feel comfortable and safe.",How to Find Postpartum Depression Support Groups,"


If your feelings of anxiety, sadness, guilt, or ambivalence last more than a week or two after your baby is born, you should consult a therapist or health professional to see if you have postpartum depression.
Postpartum depression may involve more worrying symptoms, such as thoughts of self-harm or fearing you may harm your baby, than the “baby blues” typically do. If you feel the need for a support group or therapy, keep in mind that you can attend even without an official diagnosis of postpartum depression.;
,


Acknowledge that your best support group could be closer than you think; family and friends may be able to offer necessary support and a sympathetic ear. Because postpartum depression is so common, it is possible that a friend or relative may have even experienced postpartum depression as well.
Alerting your family and friends to the fact that you have postpartum depression may help ease your concerns about caring for the baby, taking care of yourself, and getting things done around the house. Assistance with babysitting and housework can give you extra time and space to work through your feelings and seek the care you need.

, Ask a health services center, depression hotline, or counseling agency whether they know of any postpartum depression support groups that meet on a regular basis.


In-person support groups may offer significant benefits for your mental health, as they let you connect on a personal basis. They allow visible and physical connections that can have a positive impact on your depression, and getting to know local women with the same struggles can help build a support network for outside activities and connections.
If you are unable to get information from a therapist or health professional, many websites keep track of permanent groups. Take advantage of online databases that maintain lists of local postpartum depression support groups or group therapy events that appeal to you.
If there are no local groups available or if you prefer to start with online support, consider using Internet chat groups. In some cases, the anonymity of online support groups may help you share your feelings without fear of judgment or the constraints of local support group meeting times. These online chat groups may also be able to offer suggestions for alternate local support groups, such as general depression or mental illness support groups that can substitute for postpartum depression groups if necessary.

,


A good support group will validate your feelings and help you work through them. Knowing you are not alone may go a long way toward helping you heal.
Talk therapy in support groups should also be beneficial to you in other ways, introducing you to women with similar experiences who can serve as supportive friends even after you recover from your postpartum depression.
Not all support groups are the same. Some will be lead by a therapist or counselor, while others will be dominated by member discussion. Still others may just be small groups of women who do different activities while offering emotional support to each other. Find the type of group you prefer and stick with it for as long as you feel it helps you.

Know the appropriate weight gain during pregnancy for your size and height.,
Understand why it is important to pay attention to weight gain during pregnancy.,
Recognize how much weight you should gain during each trimester of your pregnancy.,
Realize that weight gain during pregnancy is a necessary part of the experience and not all of the weight gain is being stored as fat.,
Understand the recommended dietary breakdown for women during pregnancy.",How to Gain the Appropriate Weight in Pregnancy1,"


You should gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy if you were of a healthy weight before pregnancy, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 24.9.You may gain more if you were underweight before pregnancy, with a BMI of less than 18.5. It's not unusual for women in this category to add 28 to 40 pounds during pregnancy.A woman who is overweight before becoming pregnant with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 should gain 15 to 25 pounds.A woman considered obese with a BMI over 30 should gain 11 to 20 pounds.Your doctor may recommend you gain more or less weight during pregnancy depending on your particular health situation.
Note that, on average, most women have trouble gaining too much weight during pregnancy as opposed to too little. However, both problems do exist, and this article will provide suggestions both for gaining more weight as well as gaining less weight, depending upon which scenario applies to you.;
, It is not only for the baby's best interest, but for yours as well in navigating the postpartum (post-pregnancy) period.While it is important for your baby to have adequate nutrition to grow and thrive, too much weight can also be harmful for the baby. This can lead to large infants and complications that can arise later in the baby's life due to elevated birth weight, such as a higher likelihood of childhood obesity and a greater chance of developing diabetes.Similarly, while the mother needs to ensure adequate calories to fuel the growth of the baby, gaining too much excess weight in pregnancy can make it challenging to lose the weight after the pregnancy is over. It can also increase the mother's chances of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity among other long-term health consequences.Note that you should not lose weight in pregnancy. If you notice weight loss, see your physician immediately for assessment, as this may indicate complications for the pregnancy or trouble in your baby's ability to grow. However, it can be common to lose a little weight in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

,


You should gain a total of two to four pounds in the first trimester. After that, you should gain about one pound per week.
Your caloric requirements increase as each trimester goes along. In the second trimester it is recommended to eat approximately 340 calories above your normal amount (pre-pregnancy), and in the third trimester 452 calories above your normal amount (pre-pregnancy).Know, however, that these values are averages and there will be slight differences from woman to woman, depending on her pre-pregnancy weight as well as her general health and metabolism.

,


About seven to eight pounds of your pregnancy weight gain will be the baby. In addition, one to two pounds will make up the placenta, one to two pounds will be amniotic fluid, one or so pounds will be breast tissue, two or so pounds will be due to a larger uterus, two to three pounds in extra fluid stored in your body, and two to three extra pounds will be from a larger blood supply.By the end of pregnancy, the average woman is 27 or 28 pounds heavier than she was prior to pregnancy., On average, women need to consume 300 more calories per day during pregnancy than they did prior to becoming pregnant.It is important to have the proper proportions of various nutrients in order to optimize your baby's growth. The current medical guidelines suggest a diet comprised of 20% protein, 30% fat, and 50% carbohydrates.To break it down based on the food pyramid, an example of a healthy diet during pregnancy would look as follows: 6-11 servings of grains, 3-5 servings of vegetables, 2-4 servings of fruit, 3-4 servings of dairy, and 2-3 servings of meats, beans, or nuts.Note that whole grains (and non-refined sources of carbohydrates) are a better choice, especially when it comes to keeping your blood sugars in a healthy range.

"
"
Know that food choices are extremely important.,
Eat more frequently.,
Choose full-fat cheese and crackers, ice cream and yogurt, dried fruit or nuts for quick snacks to assist you in gaining weight while pregnant.,
Include more fat in your meals by using condiments such as sour cream, cheese or butter.",How to Gain the Appropriate Weight in Pregnancy2," If you are needing to gain additional weight to support your baby's growth, it is key that the foods you select are nutrient-rich.It is easy to gain weight by eating more junk food or empty calories, but the purpose here is to provide the nutrients needed to sustain your baby's growth, and to optimize your baby's ability to thrive. As previously mentioned, a balance of 20% protein, 30% fat, and 50% carbohydrates is recommended, focusing on nutrient-rich foods whenever possible.
Sodas and juices should be avoided, as they are a major source of empty calories in the form of sugar. Most fluids consumed during pregnancy should be water.

, It is common for women who are trying to gain weight to have five or six small meals every day when pregnant. For many people struggling to gain adequate weight during pregnancy, this approach can make it more manageable and easier to get those extra (nutrient-rich) calories in.


When choosing meals, be sure to include more carbohydrates to help with weight gain. These include foods such as pastas, rice, potatoes, breads, cereals, and other grain products.
In addition to carbohydrates, which help with weight gain, also be sure to eat balanced meals with sources of protein (meats, nuts, eggs, fish, etc) and a variety of vegetables and fruits.

, This preserves the nutrient value of your food, while enhancing the calorie count of what you consume.

, Again, this will enhance your calorie consumption without requiring you to ""eat more,"" per se.

"
"
Choose healthier, lower fat options, avoiding condiments and regular dressings, to help you with appropriate weight gain during pregnancy.,
Cut out any ""excess calories"" that are not needed.,
Limit your salt intake.,
Change your cooking method to help you put on healthy weight during pregnancy.,
Ask your doctor about what kind of exercise you can perform at your stage of pregnancy.",How to Gain the Appropriate Weight in Pregnancy3,"


One example would be switching to skim or 1% milk instead of whole milk and low-fat or fat-free cheese instead of the full-fat version. Continue to consume three to four servings of dairy each day.

, If you write out your daily diet, you may notice things that provide unwanted calories (without adding nutritional value) that can be removed from your diet.


For example, choosing water to drink over soft drinks, juices and other sugar-laced beverages that can ratchet up your caloric intake and cause you to gain unhealthy weight during pregnancy.
It is also helpful to avoid high-calorie snacks such as cake, cookies, candy and chips. These don't add any valued nutrition for your baby.
It can be of great help to cut back on carbohydrate consumption – foods such as pastas, rice, potatoes, breads, cereals, and other grain products. These have high calorie counts and often contribute to unwanted weight gain.

, Salt causes your body to retain fluid.

, Switch from frying foods in oil to baking, grilling, boiling or broiling.

, Moderate exercise such as swimming and walking can be a benefit to you and the baby, and can help burn extra calories.


Exercise has actually been shown to reduce potential complications of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia and/or gestational diabetes (problems with your blood pressure and/or your blood sugars).Exercise, in addition to preventing excess weight gain during pregnancy, also helps you to lose weight faster after pregnancy because you will have stayed in better shape, making it easier to resume an exercise routine after your baby is born.Types of exercise to avoid include ones with high risks of falls or accidents (such as skiing, diving, horse-riding, or gymnastics), or ones where you could get hit with a ball (such as baseball or tennis), all of which pose a risk to the baby's safety."

Perform a DNA test after the child has been born.,
Obtain your results.,
Know the cost of paternity testing.",How to Find out if the Child Is Really His," If you're pregnant and you're unsure about who the father is, it is possible to determine paternity before the child is born. Several tests can obtain a DNA sample from the baby while it's in utero. Note, however, that with these methods, you will need the father to provide a DNA sample (usually via cheek swab or blood sample.) Of all the prenatal options for paternity testing, Non-Invasive Prenatal Paternity (NIPP) Testing is the least stressful for the baby. This test doesn't take a DNA sample directly from the unborn baby. Rather, it takes a blood sample from the mother. The baby's DNA, which can be found in the mother's bloodstream, is analyzed and compared to the potential father's., Other options for determining a baby's paternity besides NIPP Testing exist. However, because some of these procedures require a doctor to enter the uterus with medical devices, they carry small but real risks up to and including miscarriage. Because of this, deciding to undergo an invasive paternity test is a serious decision that shouldn't be made lightly. Talk to your doctor before deciding on an invasive paternity testing procedure - even the smallest risks should be taken into account for the sake of the baby's health.


Amniocentesis. This test is usually performed in the second trimester, between the 14th and 20th week of pregnancy. The doctor uses an ultrasound device to guide a thin needle into the uterus through the abdomen. The needle draws a small amount of amniotic fluid, which is tested.

According to the American Pregnancy Association, side effects of this procedure include cramping, amniotic fluid leak, and vaginal bleeding. There is a small risk of miscarriage (about 1 in 300-500). A doctor's consent is needed to do this procedure.


Chorionic Villus Sampling. This test is similar to Amniocentesis in that a needle is inserted into the vagina guided by ultrasound to obtain a sample of a chorionic villi. The chorionic villi are finger like structures attached at the wall of the uterus which comes from the same fertilized egg as the fetus hence will have the same genetic make up. This test can be done earlier in pregnancy (from 10-13 weeks on).

Like with Amniocentesis, a doctor's consent is needed to do this procedure. Similarly, there is also a very small (but real) risk of miscarriage.



, If the baby is about to be born, you may not want to perform a prenatal test. In this case, know that it's possible to obtain a DNA sample from a recently-born baby. Usually, this means taking a blood sample from the umbilical cord just after the baby is born. This doesn't hurt the baby - the cord has no feeling.


Generally, umbilical cord tests are less expensive than prenatal tests, but more expensive than postnatal tests (tests performed after birth from a cheek swab, blood sample, etc.)., DNA tests can be performed on people of any age. If your child has already been born, there are a wide variety of accredited labs which, for a fee, can perform a paternity test with a high level of accuracy using a DNA sample from the child, the father, and, occasionally, the mother. Search online for paternity testing agencies to learn more. Before you make a decision, make sure that the DNA Diagnostic center you use is properly accredited by the AABB, the American Association of Blood Banks.


If the DNA samples are taken in a clinical setting, they will most likely be in the form of a cheek swab or with a blood sample.
Paternity tests don't necessarily need a clinical cheek swab or blood sample from the father - it's possible (but not usually guaranteed) that a usable DNA sample can be obtained from such things as a strand of hair, a piece of chewing gum, a cigarette butt, and other discarded items.

, After DNA samples have been taken, they must be sent to a lab and analyzed by technicians to determine the child's paternity. Allow several days to about weeks for your results. Talk to your test provider - the results may be mailed to you, or you may have to go back to the testing location to receive them.

, Understand that, in most circumstances, paternity testing is considered an elective (non-necessary) procedure, so it's not covered by most insurance plans.Tests can range anywhere from less than $100 (for the cheapest options) to $1000 to $2,000 for the most accurate, extensive testing. Prenatal tests are almost always more expensive than postnatal tests. For accurate results, you should expect to pay at least several hundred dollars.Note that if you want the results of a DNA test to be admissible in court, the price will likely be higher. If you just want the result for personal knowledge, however, the price will likely be lower, and the test can be self-administered at home.Sometimes, there is a separate fee for DNA sample collection.

Reduce your sugar.,
Replace coffee with decaf coffee or herbal tea.,
Eat fruit in the morning.,
Have a glass of water.,
Have energizing foods.",How to Wake Up Without Caffeine1," Reduce the amount of sugar in your diet throughout the day. Refined sugar can actually sap your energy and make you more tired. You can get the fuel your body needs by sticking with complex carbohydrates rather than the refined sugar. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole grains, legumes, beans and vegetables, especially starchy vegetables such as potatoes, winter squash, yams, and sweet potatoes.Sugar is a main source of fuel for the body. If you overdo it, you put yourself at risk for diseases such as obesity and diabetes. You can crash after a sugar rush, and those crashes are bad for your body and bad for your brain. It sets you up for needing more sugar to get yourself going again. That vicious cycle can cause fatigue and tire you out.;
, Simply replacing your morning cup of caffeinated coffee with a cup of decaf coffee or herbal tea can help you to wake up. Try to wake up with a hot cup of herbal tea instead of coffee. For some extra wake up help, add some lemon. Sweeten the tea with honey to avoid refined sugar. Try the following flavors:


Peppermint tea is a great drink to use to wake up. The scent and taste help energize you. Use peppermint tea bags or use a heaping teaspoon of dried herb per cup of tea.Ginger tea is used in many cultures instead of coffee for that first cup in the morning. Ginger is a mild stimulant and can help energize you.You can use ginger tea bags or use a heaping teaspoon of finely chopped fresh ginger per cup of tea.

Keep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator so it’s cold in the morning.


For some extra wake up power, add some slices of fresh lemon, orange, lime, or grapefruit.
Your body is made up of 60% water and replenishing your body’s water is important for increasing mental focus and fatigue. It can also help you to move more by increasing your trips to the bathroom, which can help you to wake up.

, There are certain foods that you can eat in the morning to give you more energy. Carbohydrates and protein are great sources of energy first thing in the morning. You can pick on of these or a combination of all of these to help boost your energy when you wake up.


Carbohydrates work well because they convert quickly to glucose, which gives you energy.
If you want to make your carbohydrate energy last longer, you can add some protein in with your carbs. Protein helps slow down the rate your body absorbs the energy, which helps the energy last longer.
Avoid eating foods high in fat. These will cause you to be sluggish."

Caffeine is a mild stimulant and has been linked to a number of benefits, including decreasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Moderate coffee drinking (about two to five cups a day) has also been linked to reducing the risk of gallstones, colon cancer, and Parkinson’s disease.Moderate coffee drinking can also help with cognitive and memory issues.

, Caffeine can interfere with sleep, which can cause insomnia or exacerbate pre-existing sleep problems. In addition, for some, caffeine can increase anxiety, nervousness, irritability, and depression.Espresso can increase the blood level of cholesterol. In some people, coffee can slightly increase the risk of heart disease and increase the heart rate.
These negative effects tend to occur in people who have excessive amounts of caffeine, such as more than five or six cups of coffee a day a day.

Pick an alarm device.,
Choose alarm type.,
Set more than one device.,
Test the settings.,
Locate the device away from the bed.,
Set the device(s) to the desired wake time(s).

",How to Wake Up With an Alarm Clock," Wind-up type alarm clocks with bells, clock radios, and even many cell phones and pagers can be set to play an alert that can wake even the deepest sleepers.;
, Based on the device chosen above, it may be possible to select from 2 or more types of alarm signal. Many clock radios offer choice of a wake alarm consisting of a radio station broadcast (of the user's choice) or a simple buzzer. There may be two volume controls; one for the ""sleep"" mode and another for the ""wake alarm"" mode. Setting the wrong one could result in not hearing the wake alarm. It may also be possible to set two or more wake times.

, If the device used for a wake alarm will only allow for a single alarm time, consider using a second device in the list above as a back up alarm source. This is a good practice should the first device fail to operate (due to power outage, defect, etc.). The device(s) should be self powered (as would be the case for a pager or cell phone) or have a battery back up to keep time in the event of a power failure. Set the second device to alert a minute or two before or after the main device.

, Set the alarm type, volume, etc. as desired, but set the alarm time to alert a minute or two in the future, instead of the wake time. Wait for the alarm time to start the alarm. Adjust volume, tuning, etc. settings as needed on all devices. Make sure those devices with multiple alarms are fully functional (make sure the second alarm alerts).

, If afraid of shutting of the alarm and going back to sleep, try locating the device where it will be required to actually get out of bed to reset the alarm. Of course, this won't prevent climbing back into bed, but may help lessen the chances of that happening.

Pick at least one device to set your alarms on.,
Decide how many devices you need.,
Consider a custom alarm clock.,
Buy an alarm clock designed around you.",How to Wake up with the Use of Multiple Alarms1," You probably are already using a device, whether it be a traditional alarm clock, your phone, or your radio. Think about whether this device is working for you. If there is something about it that doesn't do the job, buy a different device.Consider whether this device is loud enough when it goes off. Everyone has different levels of noise tolerance. If your alarm is not loud enough, consider purchasing or using a different one.
Does the device have a snooze button? If your problem is that you turn the alarm off and go straight back to sleep, you may want to use an alarm that has a snooze button function. The snooze button allows you to sleep for a few extra minutes before the alarm goes off again, which is a way of easing you awake.;
, You may want to use more than one device to set your alarms on. If you are relying on a traditional alarm clock that can only set one alarm at a time, you will need to have at least one other device to set an alarm on.


Many phones have the function of setting multiple alarms. If your phone is able to do this, you may not need to use any other devices to set the alarm.
The upside of using multiple different devices is that each device is a bit different to turn off. Having to think about this might get your brain start to work in the morning, which will make it harder for you to fall back asleep , There are thousands of alarm clocks out there. If you have a really hard time getting up or have a chronic problem of oversleeping, think about buying a specialized alarm clock. Do some research to find out what custom alarm clock would work best for you.


Light alarms are alarms that use light to wake you up. They are shown to make you more alert when you wake up and even can improve cognitive function. If you are an extremely heavy sleeper, think about buying an alarm that is louder than average. There are many industrial-strength alarms on the market that might give you that jolt you need to get up. If you want full control of your alarm noise, look into alarm systems that hook up to your phone or music player. This way you can pick your favorite song to wake up in the morning. There are also incentivizing alarm clocks, including one that shreds money if you sleep in. , Some alarm clock technology takes custom alarms even further by making clocks that are connected to your sleeping habits. These clocks track your sleeping pattern and can can tell when you are in deep sleep. They wake you up specifically when it is the most optimal time in your sleep cycle. Using this kind of personalized alarm clock will make you feel more refreshed and ready to get up in the morning. Many of these custom sleep monitors come in watch form. You wear the watch to sleep and it tracks your body as you sleep.
There are also apps you can download for your phone that monitor your sleep by sensing your movement as you're sleeping, but these are less accurate than the watches.

Set your first alarm.,
Set your last alarm.,
Set your other alarm times.",How to Wake up with the Use of Multiple Alarms2," Figure out the earliest time you want for your alarm. Go to the screen or app on your device where you input settings for the alarm. If you are using a Smartphone or a device that can set multiple alarms, you will need to add an alarm. If you already have a set alarm stored in your device and don't mind changing it, click on the set alarm. Clicking on it will allow you to change the time of the alarm.


To figure out the earliest time, think about what a logical time would be for the first alarm to go off. Keep in mind that you want to get at least 7 hours of sleep at night, or 8 for teenagers aged 14-17.
Also keep in mind that after your first alarm goes off, you are not getting sleep that is as rest full as deep sleep. Try not to make the first alarm go off too early. For instance, it's better for your restfulness if your first alarm goes off twenty minutes before your last alarm as opposed to an hour before your last alarm.
There is no exact science as how early your first alarm should be. However, there is agreement that deep sleep is more valuable than sleep interrupted by alarms. Therefore, you should make sure that your first alarm is set for a time when you could actually imagine getting up at, as opposed to two hours before you usually get up. , Figure out the latest time you want for your alarm. Your last alarm should leave you enough time to get ready for work or school. If it takes you at minimum forty minutes to get ready for work and you have to leave for work at 8, then you should set your final alarm for 7:20.


Don't cut it too close. Don't set an alarm that gives you an unrealistic amount of time to get ready in. It might seem like you're doing yourself a favor to let yourself sleep in, but skipping breakfast, looking sloppy at work or being late is not fun., Ideally, your alarms should be in 10-15 minute increments. Either using one device or your multiple devices, input alarm times that are 10-15 minutes apart. If you have several alarms, you may want to space the first two 10 or 15 minutes apart, and then closer together as you get to your final alarm. For example, if you are using your phone to set multiple alarms and you have to wake up at 7:15, you may choose to make the first alarm at 6:45, one at 7:00, one at 7:10 and one at 7:15.
If you are using multiple devices, you can set one device at 6:45, one at 7:00, etc.

Pick your alarm tones.,
Put in different tones for each alarm.,
Turn on the alarms.,
Place the alarms.,
Hide your alarm.",How to Wake up with the Use of Multiple Alarms3," After you have put in the times of the alarms, you will want to change the tone of the alarm. Listen to the tones that your device offers. Some devices like phones may have a variety of different tones. Others like a radio or an alarm clock might only have a few options. The best tones for you depend on what is the best way for you to wake up.If you like to wake up gradually, you way want to put soft, pleasant tones for the first couple alarms, and louder more urgent tones for the last ones.
If you are a heavy sleeper and need big loud noises to wake you, choose the noisier tones for your alarms.

, Using different tones for each alarm will stimulate you in the morning more than just using the same tone for each. No matter how you like to wake up, make sure that your tone on your last alarm is loud and distinctive. You want to be sure that it wakes you up and also that you can recognize it as the last warning that it's time to get up.

, Make sure that after you have put the time and tone of each alarm you activate it. How to do this depends on which device you are using, but many devices are intuitive. When you turn the alarm on, also make sure that the alarm is set at the right time of day. Having an alarm set for 6:00 PM rather than 6:00 AM will cause you to oversleep. , Now that the alarms are on, you will want to place them. Don't put all the alarms in the same place, such as on the bedside table. Putting the alarms in different places is an effective way of making you physically exert yourself to turn them off, which will make you more awake. Even if your first alarm is on your bedside table, make your last alarm go off far enough from your bed that you have to get up to turn it off.
If you are only using one device, such as your phone, make sure that the device is not directly next to you. Every time it goes off, turn off the alarm but leave it in the same place so that you have to get back up again to turn it off.

, If just placing your alarms in different places isn't doing the trick, consider hiding one of your alarms or placing it in a hard to reach spot. The thirty seconds that you take to find it or retrieve it will do the job of waking you up. If you hide your alarm, make sure you can still hear it. Turn your clock up to the highest setting if you are covering it. Also make sure to test it on a day you don't have to be up at a certain time.
A good way of hiding your alarm clock is to place it out of reach on a high shelf. The effort of using a stool to reach it will wake you up so you won't want to snooze any more.
There are alarm clocks specifically designed to roll away from you. When you hit the snooze button, these alarm clocks roll of the bedside table and away across the floor."

Get excited about your plans for the day.Remember when you were a little kid, and you'd hop up as soon as your eyes opened in the morning?,

Have a schedule.",How to Wake Up When You Are Tired," Back then you were carefree and happy to get up and begin all the fun activities the day held in store. It's harder to get out of bed when you aren't looking forward to going to work or school, but if you focus on the good things that will happen that day, you'll be able to wake yourself up faster. So,always look forward for a bright day. Try it tomorrow: as soon as you wake up, think about the best thing about the day, and let your heart race a bit in anticipation.


This is easy to do on your birthday and fun holidays, but you'll have to get creative to wake up with a smile on rainy gray Mondays. Even if you don't have a big event to anticipate, think about the little things that make you happy on a daily basis: walking your dog. Drinking that first cup of coffee. An alternative to coffee is chocolate, (flavonoids) especially 70% cocoa and darker, but if eaten too late in the day sleep deprivation may occur. Talking on the phone with your best friend after a hard day's work. Getting your favorite takeout on the way home. Whatever it is, think about it first thing when you wake up.;
, Does your room get natural light in the morning? If not, you're missing out on nature's most effective wake-up call. When the sun streams through your windows in the morning, your brain naturally knows it's time to start moving. But if you have blackout curtains and don't get decent light in the AM, you're going to feel groggy until you go outside.If you have thick curtains to block out lights from the street, try getting shades in neutral colors that effectively block most artificial light, but still let your room brighten up when the sun rises.

, Going 8 hours without drinking water (while you're asleep) is enough time for your body to get a little dehydrated, which can make you feel sleepy. Wake up to a big glass of cool water to start your day off right. You'll feel more alert within minutes.


If you want to be able to drink water while you're still in bed, fill up a small thermos with ice the night before and keep it on your bedside table. In the morning the ice will be mostly melted and you'll have a cup of cool water ready to drink.
Drink water before you grab coffee or tea.
Wash your face with cool water, too. It helps lower your body temperature, lifting you out of your warm, sleepy state.

, Brushing your teeth with peppermint toothpaste first thing is a great way to perk up. Do it before you have anything to eat, since brushing immediately after eating isn't very good for your teeth.


If you don't like peppermint toothpaste, keep a bottle of peppermint essential oil or a few peppermints on hand and inhale the the scent deeply. This will have the exact same effect as using peppermint toothpaste.

, Engaging your mind is another good way to start your motor running in the morning. Read a few interesting stories or watch some videos. You'll be so busy learning something new that you won't have time to think about how sleepy you are.


Reading email or a book - as long as the content is interesting - has the same effect.
You could also listen to the radio or turn on the TV.

, Going from the prone position to an active one will certain help you rise and shine. You know how cartoon characters always stretch when they get out of bed? That's actually a really helpful way to aid your circulation and make you feel more awake. If you're not into stretching, here are a few other things to try:


Take a short walk outside.
Do last night's dishes.

Make your bed and straighten your room.
Do jumping jacks.
Jog around the block.
Better yet, do 30 minutes of cardio exercise, like running, swimming or biking.

, They call it the most important meal of the day for good reason; the protein, carbohydrates and fats you eat in the morning keep your body healthy and get you off to a good start. On those days when you just don't want to wake up, let yourself indulge a bit. Let yourself take the time to have coffee, a grapefruit, and an omelet instead of stuffing down a piece of dry toast as you rush out the door.

, Even if it's just a 10-minute walk around your office building, putting yourself in a different environment for a bit helps your brain stay active and engaged. When you find yourself getting drowsy, you'll be a lot more productive if you go ahead and take that break.


If you can go outside, do it - even if its raining or freezing outside. The change in temperature will shock your body out of it's afternoon lull.
Get up and walk around frequently. When you sit in one place for too long, your circulation is impacted - and that has a big effect on your state of mind.

, The smell of citrus boosts serotonin, the hormone that puts you in a positive, uplifted mood.Having some orange or grapefruit wedges - or any other type of citrus - is a great way to overcome your mid-afternoon slump. Even squeezing a lemon into your glass of water can help.

, Ginseng is a natural stimulant that improves brain function. Having a cup of ginseng tea or taking 100 milligrams of ginseng extract can help improve your focus. Also, It will help your brain to feel refreshed.


Ask your doctor before taking supplements. Ginseng should be avoided if you have high blood pressure., You might crave a latte and a cookie when 4:00 rolls around, but caffeine and sugar will only cause you to crash after a temporary high. For sustained energy and alertness, drink water or tea instead of coffee, and heat a high-protein snack like almonds.

, Maybe you don't think you're in the mood, but it can't hurt to give it a try! Put on the kind of music you usually dance to come Friday night. Soon your feet will be tapping and your head will be nodding - you won't be able to help yourself. Your slightly elevated heart rate will help you perk back up in no time.

, Instead of resisting the urge to close your eyes, give in! Taking a 15 to 20 minute nap will go a long way toward helping you feel much more alert.An afternoon nap might be just what you need to get through the rest of the day, especially if you didn't sleep well the night before.

, Wearing yourself out during the day is the best way to make sure you sleep well at night and feel rested on a daily basis. If your lifestyle is primarily sedentary, this change can make a really big difference. Start small by incorporating 30 minutes of walking into your day, either before or after work or school. If you find you enjoy the exercise, try jogging, biking or swimming to amp things up a bit. You can also wear yourself out gradually by adopting the following habits:


Take the stairs instead of riding the elevator to your floor.
Get off the subway a few stops short of your usual stop, and walk the rest of the way home.
Try the 7-minute method for working out all of your muscle groups every morning.

, Eating or drinking later at night can affect your sleep. Your body isn't able to rest as fully when it's trying to digest food. Try to eat earlier dinners and avoid snacking past 8:00 for a better night's sleep.


Drinking alcohol can also affect your sleep. It might make you sleepy at first, but it can prevent you from reaching the deepest stage of sleep. That's why you're likely to feel tired the morning after drinking, even if you crashed for more than 8 hours., Do you check your email and read news articles until the moment you turn out the lights? It's likely that your mind is buzzing with tomorrow's to-do list and controversial political topics when you should be winding down mentally and emotionally for the night. Help yourself feel calm and peaceful by keeping your electronics off before bedtime.


Leave your laptop in another room, or at least power it down instead of leaving it on and easily accessible.
If you have to leave in your room because it's your alarm, then put it across the room to still hear it.

Make your bedroom peaceful and inviting by filling it with soft pillows, candles, muted colors, and calming scents - nothing that makes beeping sounds or has wires.

, Going to sleep at the same time every night and getting up at the same time every morning can help you get better rest. If you stay up til 2 AM and sleep in on the weekends, then get up at 6 AM the following Monday, your body will be playing catch-up the whole day. Try to stick to a healthy schedule that won't confuse your internal clock.


Try to avoid having to have an alarm, if you can. Let your body's natural clock wake you up instead. Waking up naturally will help you be more alert throughout the day, since you aren't forcing your body into a state it isn't prepared for.

Open the curtains and let the light in as soon as you wake up.
During the winter months, when the sun rises later, consider getting an alarm clock that uses light to stimulate those important bodily processes.;
, There are various ways you can do this.


Set the alarm clock to the loudest setting. Loud noise, while unpleasant, stimulates adrenaline production, making you feel temporarily more alert.
Place your alarm far away so that you physically have to get out of bed to turn it off. Even better, hide your alarm somewhere in your bedroom so that you have to get out of bed and find it before you can turn it off.

, Though it can be tempting to keep hitting that snooze button, don't. Remind yourself that it is a counter-productive habit and that the sleep you get after hitting snooze is not good quality. Consider these points:


When we use the snooze button and drift off for a short period, our bodies are re-entering a new phase of the sleep cycle.
The normal snooze length is around 10 minutes and this is insufficient to reach the deepest phase of REM sleep, which is the kind of sleep that makes you feel rested.
Each time you hit that snooze button it gets harder to wake up., There are lots of alarm clocks apps that you can download to your phone to help you wake up quickly and avoid the snooze trap.


Use an app that tracks your sleep cycle. Many of these apps come with inbuilt alarms that wake you in the lightest phase of sleep. The sleep cycle typically lasts 90 minutes and if we are woken up in the deepest phase of REM sleep, we are more likely to feel groggy and find it difficult to get out of bed.Download an alarm app that makes you solve a math problem or complete a task before the alarm shuts off. This requires concentration and focus, after you've spent the time completing the task you'll find you feel wide awake.
Download or buy an alarm that requires you to vigorously shake it before it turns off.
Keep in mind that light from electronics like cell phones, tablets, and computers may interfere with your sleep. Shut off these devices about one to two hours before you go to bed., Don’t be tempted to settle back down under the covers when your alarm goes off. As soon as you wake up, swing your feet onto the floor and get out of bed. Here's what you can do to get moving.


Get the blood flowing. Exercising stimulates the production of endorphins, which reduce stress and anxiety, and improves blood circulation, making you feel more awake.Try high-intensity full body exercises like jumping jacks, push-ups or squats, which can be done in your bedroom as soon as you wake up.
Experts also suggest getting outdoors and taking a morning walk or a morning run to wake up., Concentrating on taking a few deep breaths when you wake can improve focus and make you feel energized. Try some diaphragmatic breathing exercises or yogic breathing exercises, both can boost blood oxygen and energy.

, After sleeping all night the body is often dehydrated, so you may feel tired and low on energy. As soon as you wake, drink a glass of water. Some experts believe that drinking water first thing kick-starts the body’s metabolism and can even help you lose weight., The most important meal of the day, eating a healthy and nutritious breakfast in the morning can combat tiredness and improve your energy levels throughout the morning.


Pick something with protein and fiber. Experts suggest a breakfast with a good combination of fiber and protein to boost your energy. For example, nuts are a particularly good breakfast item because they contain both fiber and protein.Avoid too much sugar. A sugary breakfast may give you immediate results, helping you feel awake, but it causes your blood sugar to spike rapidly and will ultimately leave you feeling more tired for the rest of the day.
Complex carbohydrates. Although carbohydrates supply our bodies with much-needed energy, simple carbohydrates found in many breakfast foods such as donuts and pastries are quickly used up by the body and can leave us feeling fatigued. Opt for complex carbohydrates (found in whole grains and fruits) instead, as these release energy slowly, preventing that mid-morning slump. A breakfast of complex carbohydrates combined with protein will also make you feel fuller for longer., Use your senses of smell and touch to feel revitalized and energetic in the mornings.


Smell the coffee. Scientists have found that just the aroma of coffee can reduce the effects of sleep deprivation.Essential oils. It’s not just the smell of coffee that can wake us up, research suggests that essential oils like peppermint, eucalyptus and rosemary can also improve subjective feelings of alertness.Take a cold shower. Taking a cold shower improves circulation and can make you feel wide awake.

, It sounds obvious, but after a full night's sleep you are much less likely to find it hard to wake up in the morning. Aim for 8 hours sleep per night. Prioritize getting good rest the night before.

, Caffeine is known to affect both quality and quantity of sleep. Likewise alcohol, while sometimes used as a sleep aid, also has a negative impact on sleep quality as you experience less REM sleep even though it may be initially easier to fall asleep.Lower your consumption of both caffeine and alcohol to improve the overall quality of your sleep, which will in turn make it easier to get up and go the morning.


Be careful to avoid caffeinated beverages about six hours prior to your bedtime. Drinking caffeine too close to bedtime may interfere with your sleep, while avoiding caffeine in the six hours before your bedtime may make it easier for you to fall and stay asleep., Spend some time the night before on organizational tasks in order to minimize the number of decisions you have to make in the morning. This will stop you from feeling overwhelmed and allow you to focus on waking up and feeling alert. Some things you can do include:


Prepare your breakfast the night before.
Pack your bag for work or school in the evening so that you are ready to pick up and go in the morning.
Select your outfit the night before and leave it out somewhere easily accessible.

, If you consistently find it difficult to wake up, rather than focus on short-term fixes it may simply be better to recognize this and adjust your routine accordingly. Try to give yourself enough time in the morning to wake up properly. This might entail setting your alarm a few hours early before an important meeting or event so that you can wake up fully without stress and anxiety.

Clinical trials in Japan have showed that people who are slowly woken up by the light of the sun feel better in the morning.",How to Wake Up Peacefully," Use two different alarms; one with a loud beep, and one with peaceful music. Set a radio, MP3 player, or other device to gradually wake you up first, 15-30 minutes prior to your regular alarm. It will help to remind you that the loud beeping alarm will soon follow.;
, They determine the optimum moment to wake you based upon your sleep rhythms. Waking at the wrong time according to your body's natural sleep cycle can make you feel groggy and irritable.

, If you can, set up some system of lighting that slowly turns on at the desired time, using a dimmer. The light should increase in strength over about half an hour before you wake up.

Stay on schedule.",How to Wake Up Easily," Put yourself in the right frame of mind the night before. Make a note of good things that will happen to you the next day – things to look forward to. If you have an alarm clock or a bedside table, get a sticky note and write down something good or exciting that will happen after you wake up.Visualize your day. If you imagine yourself alert and energetic, you will fire up the same parts of your brain you use when you actually are alert and energetic;
, Design your bed and bedroom so that getting up in the morning comes more easily. How? There are a few things that you can do, including color schemes, temperature, and décor.


Some people think that colors can have an effect on how restful our sleep is. For example, yellow and soft blues seem to promote relaxation, while reds and purples are stimulating.Find colors that suit you and use them in your bedroom, on throws, blankets, or pillows.
Make your bedroom cooler. Your body will have trouble staying asleep if the surrounding temperature is too cold. The ideal room temperature for sleep is between 65 and 70 degrees F, so lower your thermostat below that range.Increase the sunlight in your room in the morning. Natural light makes you feel more awake, and signals your biological clock to stop making melatonin, which makes you sleepy. If waking up is a problem for you, keep the window shades and curtains open to allow in the morning sun.
If you wake up before the sun comes out, and you can't have sunlight, you can buy a dawn simulator and set it so that it hits maximum brightness when your alarm goes off.

, What could be inviting first thing in the morning than a shower? A good hot shower will open your eyes, give you time to collect your thoughts, and get you fresh and ready for the day.


If you are bold, try to take a cold shower. Some people find cold water very invigorating. Once finished with your cleaning, make the water as cold as you can for about thirty seconds. Then, return it to normal. The alternation of cold and hot water opens capillaries and will increase blood flow in your body.You might also consider using an invigorating herbal body wash, some of which are designed to help you wake up. Find one that you like.Give yourself a quick massage, too, while showering. This will boost your circulation and wake you up even more. Rub your temples, massage your shoulders, and drum your fingertips on your face.

, One great way to wake up in the morning is to raise your heart rate and breathing. Not only will exercise wake you up, but it will give you energy and a mental boost for several hours. The natural light and fresh air will help, as wellPick an exercise that you enjoy and that will motivate you to get out of bed. Try biking, running, swimming, or even just walking.
Aim for at least 20 to 30 minutes of exercise per day.

, During the night, our glucose levels drop, which affects how we perform mentally and physically. Breakfast is critical to raise glucose levels and get you the energy to start your day. Make sure that you eat fairly soon after you wake up, ideally within one hour and no later than 10am.Choose foods that are nutritious and will boost your energy levels. For instance, eggs, yogurt, some nuts like almonds, and chicken have chemicals called dopamine and norepinephrine. These stimulate your brain and body.Drinking water can help, too. When you wake up, you’re most likely a bit dehydrated, and even a 2% drop in water stores can make you more tired. Drinking cold water will trigger your heart rate and increase blood flow to the brain., A little bit of caffeine won’t hurt – seriously, most studies show that caffeine from coffee and tea is perfectly healthy in moderate doses. Have a cup or two. Just don’t overdo it, as more than that might make you jittery and anxious.Plain coffee and tea (i.e. without milk and sugar) are low in calories and also contain beneficial antioxidants. You can also look to sodas and energy drinks for a quick pick-me-up, but these contain a lot more additives, particularly sugars, which might cause your energy to crash later on.

, The best thing that you can do in the long run to make waking up in the morning easier is to retrain your body, especially by sticking to a regular sleep schedule. Set a routine. Get to bed on time and be strict about getting up in the morning at the same hour.To feel refreshed you’ll need to get enough deep sleep. Try to get between 8 to 10 hours of sleep nightly.Don’t stay up late in the evening. Aim to be in bed by 10 pm or 11 pm and to get up at the same time each and every day. After a week or two, and if you stick to it, your body will adjust to waking up earlier.
Try easing yourself slowly into the new schedule by setting your alarm clock two minutes earlier per day. By the end of the week, you’ll be up almost a quarter hour sooner.

, Just like having a sleep routine, it’s important to establish a pre-sleep routine so that your body can anticipate bedtime. This routine will slowly power you down and prepare you for rest. Start it one or two hours before your normal bedtime.


For instance, slowly darken your room. Just as natural light wakens you, dim light signals your body to shut down for sleep. Turn off one light at a time or use the dimmer switch until your body is ready. Read a book. Taking out a good book can be relaxing and also taxing enough to tire you out. It doesn’t need to be a potboiler, just anything that is easy to read. Your eyelids will soon get heavy.When you sleep, sleep in darkness. Exposure to light stops your body from releasing chemicals that you need to sleep well, especially melatonin, while at the same time signaling you to wake up. Turn out all the lights for the best quality sleep., Remove or turn off any electronics in the bedroom, like your phone, iPad, computer, or television. Seeing these distracts the brain, keeping it alert and awake, and will damage the quality of your sleep and make you more tired in the morning.Electronics usually have back-lit screens, which suppress the body’s production of melatonin, which we need to sleep. Resist the urge to use such devices in the one or two hours before your bed. It may keep you from sleeping., You can easily undermine your rest by eating or drinking the wrong thing before bed, and end up tired and haggard the next morning. Stay away from heavy meals in the one or two hours before your bedtime, for example, as they can affect your sleep quality.Also avoid alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine stays in your system for anywhere up to 8 hours, so restrict your use of it to the morning or early afternoon. Likewise, alcohol before bed can keep you from getting the most restful, restorative kinds of sleep.Instead, try a beverage with sleep-inducing or soporific qualities, like camomile tea. You might also try other varieties of herbal tea, like peppermint, ginger, or valerian tea.

, Whatever you do, avoid pressing your snooze button. Sinking back into sleep can feel delightful, but it’s actually working against you. You won’t get any restorative sleep and, in the long run, it will push you off schedule and make you feel groggy. You will have an easier time getting up if you hold out.


The snooze button essentially tricks your body into thinking that it is still time to sleep. This is called “sleep inertia,” as it deceives your body. It will make you groggy and confused and disrupt your normal sleep routine.Instead, if you have a hard time resisting the snooze button, try placing your clock strategically across the room so you have to walk to it, waking you up along the way.

, Once you have reset your body to a new sleep routine, you should try to stick to it. By resisting temptations, going to bed and waking up on time, and practicing self-discipline, you should be to wake up more easily in the morning.


Naps can help refresh you during the day, but don’t sleep too long and try not to nap within a few hours of your bedtime. The first will make you groggy, while the second can disrupt your sleep.
Don’t sleep in too often or too long. You can get away with an extra hour or two on the weekends and holidays, but going much beyond that will push you off schedule."

Have a drink.",How to Wake Up On Time," It can be hard to get out of bed if you don’t sleep correctly. Before making drastic changes, you should take on board a few simple rules. Some things to keep in mind for a good night’s sleep include:


Avoid caffeine and alcohol at least a few hours before going to sleep. Both are proven to have detrimental effects on sleep.Avoid greasy, spicy, or fatty food in the evening. These foods can cause stomach upset, which may interfere with your sleep.Don’t read from a phone or a tablet before sleeping. Research shows that their lights and radiations can wreak your sleep and cause headaches.;
, It's important to prepare for the night. Reading a book or doing a puzzle is far more likely to prepare you for sleeping than playing violent computer games. Your body will produce the sleep hormone and make you tired more quickly.Don't work or study just before going to bed. Any activity involving stress or planning is likely to keep you awake.
TV is also a source of excitement and should be avoided just before sleeping.
Try to read a book or chat with your partner. You could also listen to relaxing or classical music.
You can also try mental exercises before sleeping. Thinking about cities beginning with a certain letter will exhaust you quickly!
Focus on positive thoughts and memories.
Breath deeply to get your body relaxed.

, If your rhythm is set properly, you may be able to regularly wake up refreshed without an alarm. Make an effort to get to bed and to get up at about the same times every day. If you work changing shifts or otherwise have to adjust your schedule, your rhythm will be thrown off for a while, but you can reset it over a few days.


You should sleep at least eight hours a day. Some need less sleep than others but make sure to find what’s right for you.Don’t change entirely your sleeping schedule in a day. Try to change your sleeping pattern over a long period of time. For example, go to sleep fifteen minutes earlier every day.

, The quality of your bed or the layout of your bedroom might be the reason for which you can’t wake up in the morning. If you had a bad night, your body might just need to catch up on sleep. Check the following points:You should sleep on a good mattress. Look for one that give good back support and doesn’t store germs and bacteria.Think about the temperature of the room. You shouldn’t sleep in a warm room.
Reduce external noises by closing windows, turning off the TV, or using a device that generates ‘white noises’.Protect against mosquitoes and other external nuisances. You can either buy a net or use anti-mosquito perfumes.
Consider getting a larger bed or sleeping in separated beds if your spouse or partner wakes you up with his or her tossing and turning. Better yet, get a mattress that absorbs motion and will not be felt by your partner.
Darken the room. Bright lights will keep you awake.

, Some people need a very loud, harsh alarm, some can’t wake up to the radio, and some find that gradual waking works best. There are even many varieties of alarms to stick near you that will vibrate to awaken you, including a vibrating pillow, wrist band, and devices that clip on to your pillow or go between your mattresses.


Consider what types of features you want the alarm clock to have, such as sounds, brightness, etc.Experiment and decide what’s best for you. Ask your friends and try to borrow a device before spending too much.
Don’t forget your neighbours. Some alarm clocks are really loud and might not be suited for a flat.
Discuss the alarm with your partner. You don’t want to pick something that he or she hates.
Make sure the alarm clock is set before going to sleep. Set it in advance for the whole week if possible.

, It is quite common for heavy sleepers to turn the alarm off in their sleep. If you need to get out of bed to turn it off, you will already increase your chances of staying awake.


You can also set multiple alarm clocks in the room. Set them five to ten minutes apart to be sure to be unable to take them off in one round.
Set your alarm earlier than necessary. For example say you want to get up at 7:00 a.m., so you set your alarm about 10-15 minutes earlier, like 6:45 a.m.

, If your spouse or partner, or just a roommate, doesn’t have trouble waking up on time, ask him or her to help you wake up and to make sure you stay awake.


You could also ask a friend to call you in the morning and talk to you for a minute or so until you become fully awake. Wake up calls to your home or cell phone are now available by subscription or for one-time calls.
Pick someone reliable. You don’t want to miss your job interview because your roommate found it funny to let you sleep until noon.
Give him precise instructions and write the time at which he should wake you up on a post-it.

, Because of nightly hormonal changes to natural sleep cycles, many people find that they wake up a few minutes before their alarm goes off. If this occurs, consider it a sign that you’re ready to get up.


If you go back to sleep and wait for the alarm, you’ll likely feel more drowsy.

, The body naturally wakes up faster when it’s light outside.Keep your curtains open and use the sun to help you awake.


If you need to wake up when it’s dark, or if you live in a dreary, cloudy place, consider using a timer on your bedroom lamp or getting a light box or a bedside dawn simulator.

, When you wake up, get out of bed immediately and get moving. A few exercises will have a positive impact on your whole day.Do some calisthenics or quickly go about your morning routine.


Stretching is really important in the morning. Your muscles will be oxygenated and warmed for the day., Alternate the temperatures between hot and cold to get your circulation going.


Use shower gels with ingredients such as lemon or peppermint essential oils to help make you more alert.
Splash cold water on your face as soon as you wake up. Low temperatures should quickly wake you up.
If a shower is not possible, try putting a couple of drops of essential oils onto a tissue and inhaling their fragrance. Some alarm clocks now have aromatherapy components built in, as well.

, Drinking some water as soon as you wake up stimulates the body and will help you stay awake. If you need something stronger, try coffee or tea.If you have trouble making it out of your bedroom without coffee, consider putting your coffeemaker in your room and setting the timer so that a cup of Joe will be waiting for you when you wake up.

Though it may be tempting to snack late at night, doing so will disrupt your sleep as your body will be attempting to digest what you’ve consumed.If you are extremely hungry or don’t want to give up your late night grazing all together, choose light, healthy foods. For example, eating fresh fruit will satisfy you without taking too much energy to digest.;
, A hot drink can do wonders in relaxing your body and mind and preparing for a good night’s sleep. Try drinking warm milk or a cup of herbal tea.


Avoid alcohol and caffeine, both of which will disrupt your sleep cycle and also likely make you groggy in the morning.
Certain herbal teas, such as chamomile and valerian, have been shown to be great relaxants so if you struggle to unwind at night, try incorporating some of these into your nighttime ritual.

, Don’t do anything stressful (such as homework or work-related things) at least an hour or so before bedtime. Stress leads to impaired sleep.


If possible, get all of your chores done during the day. If you head to bed in a calm, relaxed state, you’re more likely to sleep better and wake up in the same calm mood. Being plagued by tasks you need to do or recurring problems is going to make it more difficult to wake up in a good mood.
Reading, crafts (such as drawing or knitting), or just chatting with your friends or family are all great ways to unwind in the evening. Watching TV or a movie can also be a good idea as long as it’s done relatively early in the evening.

, Try to cut down on the chores that may stress you out by doing them ahead of time. That way you won’t go to sleep and wake up dreading the tasks ahead of you as you’ll have already gotten them out of the way.


For example, get in the habit of picking out your work clothes and setting them out the night before.
If you usually throw a lunch together before heading to the office or school, try to prepare it the night before so you can just grab it on your way out. Such practices will allow you to clear parts of your morning for mood-boosting activities.

, How you end your day can often influence how you feel the next morning so do your best to clear your head of negative or stressful thoughts and go to sleep in a relaxed manner.If you find yourself going through all of the things you have to do the next day or dwelling on stressful events, try setting some positive intentions (such as “I will do something kind for someone tomorrow for no reason”) or make a mental list of what you are grateful for in life.

, Too many people are chronically sleep deprived and then wonder why they’re grumpy upon waking up. Adults should get about seven to nine hours of sleep every night so do your best to get enough shut-eye., You want to get a deep, good night’s rest so avoid screens such as your phone, computer, and television for an hour or two before heading to bed. The light that comes from these screens actually fools our bodies into thinking that it is still daylight, which can disrupt the natural winding down process and makes it difficult to get a deep sleep., If you typically sleep in late whenever you can, try getting in the habit of waking up earlier. Research suggests that waking up earlier is better for your mental health as those who wake up late in the day have higher incidences of various psychological conditions.Try waking up between 6-8:30 am, which is when the body is most responsive to sunlight.

If it is impossible or unrealistic to wake up at this time, do your best to wake up at the same time every day. Waking up at the same time every day trains your body to be more alert upon waking up, which will help you feel refreshed and happier.



, As tempting as it is to get just a few more minutes of sleep in, studies have shown that hitting snooze on your alarm can actually be extremely detrimental to your overall mood. Hitting snooze and going in and out of sleep confuses the body and makes it more difficult over time to wake up properly., Just as it’s important to turn off the screens and rest in a darkened room, it’s important to wake up to light. Our internal body clocks are influenced by these factors so when we are exposed to light, our bodies begin to naturally wake up.Keep the shades open in your room so that as the sun rises, your body will respond to the natural light.
If your room doesn’t have windows or much sunlight access, consider investing in a lamp that turns on at a set time.
Once you begin waking up in a well lit room at the same time every day, you may find that your body eventually develops that pattern and you’ll be able to skip the annoying alarm clock altogether.

, Upon waking up, try doing some stretches. You don’t even have to get out of bed for this, just stretch and flex your limbs in whatever ways feel good to you. Doing so will get the blood flowing throughout your body and also release endorphins.If you have time, you can even practice do some short yoga sequences each morning as that will certainly lift your spirits and help you feel physically and psychologically better.

, Music has the ability to powerfully influence the mood of the listener, so try incorporating it into your morning routine. Choose music that is cheery, upbeat, and easy on the ears for maximum mood boosting impact. An example of an uplifting song is ""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams! , We all know it but too many of us forget that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and helps keep you fueled and happy throughout.


Choose healthy, unprocessed foods that are easy to digest and give you lots of energy. Fresh fruit, protein (such as eggs or peanut butter), and whole grains (such as whole wheat toast or oatmeal) are all great options.
If you don’t have time to prepare breakfast every morning, just grab some fruit and nuts on your way out. These foods require no preparation yet have all the fuel and nutrients you need to start your day right.

, Studies have shown that positive thinking helps with stress management which comes with many health benefits, including generally being in a better mood.If you tend to focus on the negative in life, work to create a more positive outlook and you will be a happier person.


One helpful practice can be to make regular lists of good things that happen to you or things that you are grateful for. After a while, you will start to notice these aspects of life more and eventually thinking positively will become second nature to you.

, Regardless of when or how long you meditate for, regular meditation can help a great deal in improving your mood. Many people are intimidated by meditation, but carving out just five to ten minutes each day to sit and focus on your breath can have a powerful impact on your mood, not only helping you sleep better but also improving your everyday mood., Many people sleep poorly or wake up in a bad mood because there’s an underlying problem that they haven’t addressed. Resolving these issues in your life, whether they are work or family problems, will help you sleep better and wake up looking forward to the day, rather than dreading it. Resolving problems also helps reduce anxiety.

, Studies have shown that, regardless of how you feel, just the physical act of smiling releases dopamine and serotonin in the brain which makes you happier.So try even faking a smile until you do feel better.

, There are many benefits to exercise, including improved physical health and steady release of endorphins, but a study has also shown that people who exercise have better sleep quality, fall asleep more easily, and report being less tired during the day.You don’t have to exercise a great deal to see these benefits. In one study, participants exercised at least two and a half hours a week to get the benefits of better sleep.
There are many kinds of exercise that you can do to achieve this. Sports, dance, even brisk walking are all great options so find a physical activity that you genuinely enjoy doing and see how it influences your sleep and your mood upon waking up.

, Research has shown that keeping flowers in one’s house can decrease anxiety and depression and improve one’s mood.They don’t have to be fancy bouquets. Even just picking a bunch of wildflowers or a few daffodils from your garden can brighten up your living space and your mood.

Throw a sprinkle of cold water on the person.",How to Wake Someone Up," Come to their room with the cup in hand. Sit on the edge of their bed and let the smell and your weight on the bed rouse them awake in a peaceful transition to the world of the conscious. The smell makes waking up more pleasant and stimulates their senses.


You could also come in, set the coffee on the table (out of reach so that they don't accidentally knock it off when waking), and walk out, closing the door behind you. The combination of the smell and the noise may wake them naturally.;
, Start brewing a pot of coffee, frying up some bacon, or even spraying a citrus-y scent in the room. Lemon is especially alerting, though any scent can rouse even a deep sleeper.Make sure you're using a scent they enjoy. If they're not a bacon person, it may not be alluring enough to get out of bed. If they're more of the chocolate-chip-cookie-for-breakfast type, that should be your go-to. What would get them excited?
If it's not enough that the scent is wafting through house, try bringing them breakfast in bed. Not only do you get them up, but they'll feel like you're doing them a favor, getting you in their good graces.

, Walk into the room where the person is sleeping and make just a little bit of noise. Be careful not to be too loud, or you'll shock them awake, which can make the sleeping person wake up on the ""wrong side of bed."" Try swishing your jeans or pants as you walk, and make a little noise around the room. A quiet click of the heels on your shoes will probably be enough.


This can be as simple as opening the door to ""check on them,"" and closing it after you. You could also run some water in the nearest bathroom or have a conversation outside of their door.

, Beyond our noses waking us up, another natural way is with light. Throw open the curtains, blinds, or door if there aren't any windows. The light seeping in cues the body that the sun is up and it's time to be productive – if the person isn't nocturnal, of course!


You can do this the polite way or you can not. The polite way is to light up the room by carefully opening the curtains and manipulating the sun's path to indirectly fill the room. The impolite way is to throw the sun right on their sleeping face so their retinas get shocked into submission and they have no choice but to wake up from their slumber.

, If you can spare a bit of time, you could rely on the house waking this person up for you. Adjust the temperature so their room gets noticeably hotter or colder. They may become slightly uncomfortable, which will cause them to awaken.


However, this can take time and it can be uncomfortable for you if you're adjusting the entire house. Rely on this tactic if you can steer the warmth or cold in their direction only. Otherwise it'll take too long – and it's also a waste of electricity.

, Try walking in and pretending that you're looking for something – open some drawers, move stuff around. Play with the sheets and pretend that you're looking under the covers. If it's a weekend, you can pretend you're doing the laundry. Or if you're a kid and it's a school day, say you're looking for your backpack.


If you're not sneaky, the person will probably realize what you're up to. Make sure you come up with something convincing that would actually be in their room if you don't want to get caught being the morning alarm.

, If these steps haven't worked, try pretending that you got a phone call in or near the person's room – just play your ringtone or start a text conversation with your friend (so long as your phone isn't on silent). Or you could leave your phone in their room and call it from a different device. Totally not your fault. Wink wink.


When they get up irritated that your phone awoke them, you might want to apologize and say you didn't know they were asleep. You won't let it happen again.

, You can try pressing the panic alarm on you car to wake the person up – when the person does wakes up, stop it and they'll think someone else's car alarm went off outside. How could they possibly blame this on you?


If your car has a loud engine, you can try starting it up near the room where the person is sleeping. Any outside noise could do the trick.

, If they're still out like a light, try gently pulling the covers off of them. The stark change in temperature (and the sudden lack of comfort) will likely jar their mind awake. This is a bit direct though and it'll be pretty clear what you're up to. If that's okay, this is a viable strategy to use.


...Just make sure they're wearing clothes first.

, If they have a phone or alarm clock near their bed, set it. They clearly didn't. Put it for a few minutes in the future so you can make your quick getaway. When it goes off, they'll probably think to themselves, ""Huh. I didn't realize I set my alarm. Weird.""


Alternatively, you could just set the alarm on your phone and leave it in there, if that's a plausible situation. When you hear it, you can come in realizing that you ""accidentally forgot your phone in the room."" Whoops.

, Shake the person's shoulder and say in a loud voice that (s)he should wake up. You can tell the person this in a louder and louder voice until (s)he wakes up. The day is new and there are things to do. So up and at 'em!


If they respond to you with a muffled, ""ughhhhhh,"" keep at it. They're awake – they just don't want to wake up. Remind them of what's going on that day and possibly tempt them with coffee or breakfast.

, Your mood will dictate what kind of revenge you seek. If you're feeling friendly, turn on some light, gentle music, like a pop ballad or an instrumental tune. If you're feeling a little irritated, heck, turn on the metal. Just be ready for the repercussions of them waking you up with something worse in the future.


This can be done with a stereo, iPad, computer, or TV in the room, or just with your phone. And don't forget you can always sing along, too.

, Don't say anything if you don't want (though you should've already tried that tactic) – the light and noise coming from the television should wake them. Turn it to a channel that's you think the person might enjoy if you want to put them in a better mood.


Wanna be friendly about it? Watch the TV yourself. They will eventually wake and start to watch along with you. Then, you can look over and say, ""Hey, when did you wake up?""
Don't turn it up so far that even you are uncomfortable in the room. Just turn it to a level that two normal, awake people would tolerate happily.

, If all fails, just use the tried-and-true method of cold water. Grab a handful from the nearest bathroom and before it all leaks out through your fingers, splash it on them. They won't be happy, but they'll probably wake up.


Be careful with this! It may seem like fun to you, but it will not be fun for them. They could become quite irritated. If you do choose this method, be ready for a backlash.
Only throw the equivalent of a couple tablespoons onto them. The last thing you want to do is throw a bucket of water on them and have them wake themselves up through choking. This is dangerous when done incorrectly.The water may cause them to urinate themselves as well.

Pick your goal wake-up time.,
Set your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier than normal.,
Give yourself enough time for a good night's rest.,
Get excited.,
Get ready for the benefits.,
Mentally prepare yourself to wake up early.",How to Wake Up Early1," If you'd like to get good at being ready and raring to go by 6 AM, great! There's your goal. This will be the goal you're working toward every day of the week. You're going to do it gradually, though, as to avoid shocking your system.


That's right, every day of the week, including weekends. Until you're completely reprogrammed, there won't be any sleeping in whatsoever. But once you get it down, you won't need to!;
, If you're normally sleeping till 9, going cold turkey and aiming for 6:30 just isn't going to happen. Well, it could happen once, but then you spend the entire day drinking coffee and regretting your life decisions. For the next day, set it for 8:45. The next day? 8:30. And even when you hit that glorious Saturday, chuck off 15 minutes until you hit your goal wake-up time.


If mornings are a serious issue for you, stay at one level for two days. Monday and Tuesday can be spent at 8:00 and then on Wednesday bring it down to 7:45.

, If you're used to sleeping from 12 to 9, you can't still go to bed at midnight and expect that 6 AM wake-up call to be all trumpets and roses. As you get up earlier and earlier, go to bed earlier and earlier. The goal isn't to need less sleep (sleep, after all, is wonderful), the goal is just to wake up earlier easier. Science tells us that if you get the recommended amount of sleep during the night, it's easier to do just that.You can also try conditioning your body to need less sleep if passing on those night hours is like giving up your first born child. It's the same idea, but with maintaining a set bedtime.

, In order to hop out of bed in the morning with gusto, you may need something to hop out of bed for. So find something to get excited about! If nothing comes to mind, use this experiment as something to do full-force. After all, the path to new, more productive habits is certainly something to be proud of.


What do you have going on in the next day that you can't wait to get up for? Its size does not indicate its efficacy -- small things work just as well. Even getting excited for the morning's cup of joe works! Yum. Can you almost taste it?

, Waking up early is linked to a bunch of different, positive things. Research says that early risers get better grades, are generally more proactive, can anticipate problems and plan better than their late-rising counterparts.Hope you can handle your own impending awesomeness.


It's sort of a chicken before the egg thing. Early risers have more time for exercise, family, and more quiet time at the office (and an easier commute).Is sleep making their lives better or do they sleep better because they have good lives? Try it out for yourself!

, Run through your morning routine in your head so that you have a game plan for the early hours. If you have a plan, you won't need to think about it--just move.


If you need to be out the door and on your way at a certain time, think about how much time you'll need for each step of your morning routine. Consider what, if anything, you can cut out of your routine to streamline the process: do you need that shower, or that cup of coffee?
As you lay in bed, drifting off to sleep, tell yourself: ""I need to wake up early tomorrow. I need to wake up at 5 a.m., make a pot of coffee, shower, shave, and be out the door by 5:45. It'll take me twenty minutes to drive to the airport, ten more minutes to get set up in the long-term parking lot, and another fifteen minutes to walk to the security check. I can grab a quick breakfast in the terminal before my flight leaves.""

Avoid the problem in the future.",How to Stay Awake When Tired," The easiest way to stay awake is to stimulate your senses. There are a number of things you can do to make sure your ears, eyes, and even your nose are alert and active. The more parts of your body that are alert, the less likely it will be that you will fall asleep. Here are a few things to try:


Turn on as many lights as you can. If you're not a position to control the lights, then position yourself as close to a light source as possible.
Suck on a mint or chew gum to keep your mouth alert.
Sniff peppermint oil to wake up your sense of smell.
If you're in a place where you can listen to music, listen to jazz, hip-hop, rock, anything that makes you feel alert.
If your eyes are hurting, take a break and look at a wall or even out a window.
Splash cold or warm water on your face.;
, In addition to stimulating your senses, you can trick your body into being more alert than you really feel. Taking the time to move around, touch your earlobes, or rub your hands together can make you feel more awake and active. Here are a few things you can do to keep your body more alert:


Splash your face with cold water. Try to keep your eyes open as you splash water on your face without hurting them.
Gently pull down on your earlobes.
Pinch yourself on your forearm or under your knees.
Put your hands in fists and open them. Repeat ten times.
Tap your feet lightly on the floor.
Stretch your wrists, arms, and legs.
Roll your shoulders.
Step outside and fill your lungs with crisp fresh air.

, Just a little bit of physical activity can snap your body awake. There are ways to boost your activity level even if you're at school or work, and just a few minutes of exercise can have a dramatic impact on how awake your body is. Exercising is a way of telling your body that it's not time to go to bed yet. Here are a few things you can do:


Take the opportunity to walk whenever you can. If you're at work, take the long way to get to the break room, or walk across the street to get coffee. If you're at school, take the long way to your next class, or even take a lap around your cafeteria before you sit down to eat.
Take the stairs instead of the elevator when you can. Unless you're headed to the fiftieth floor, taking the stairs will give you more energy than standing around in the elevator. It will get your heart rate going and will keep you alert.
Make time for a ten-minute walk when you can.
While you may not be able to exercise right then and there, make a habit of exercising regularly, for at least thirty minutes a day. Daily exercise is proven to improve your energy level and to help you stay alert.

, Eat eggs, turkey, and a little bit of light toast. Or try some oatmeal and yogurt. Add greens to your breakfast, such as spinach, celery, or kale. If you don't feel right about eating so many vegetables for breakfast, make a smoothie, or pick up a smoothie on your way to school or work.

, The wrong foods can make you feel sluggish, bloated, and even more tired than you would feel if you barely ate anything. Here are some tips for eating well to boost your energy and to make you less tired:


Don't eat huge meals. Instead, eat a few measured meals a day, and graze lightly throughout the day when you're feeling hungry. Avoid eating heavy meals, starchy foods, high-fat meals, and alcohol. All of these will make you more tired and will wear on your digestive system.
Don't skip meals. Even if you're so tired that the thought of food doesn't appeal to you one bit, not eating will make you much more fatigued.

, Bring fruit with you wherever you go. Not only is this healthy, but it will keep you from indulging in a high-sugar snack in a pinch.


Snack on peanut butter and celery or yogurt.

, Caffeine will certainly help you stay awake, but if you overload on it or drink it too quickly, you will get a headache and will crash. Have a cup of tea or coffee when you need it, and drink it slowly or you will crash and/or get a stomach ache.


Avoid energy drinks. Though they will give you a quick fix for waking up, in the long run, they will make you feel tired while also disturbing your ability to sleep, which will make you more tired the next night.

, Lots of it. Staying hydrated will keep you awake.

, Keeping your body awake and alert won't take you very far if your mind is always drifting off. To keep your mind alert, you have to be actively engaged in thought, whether you're holding up a conversation or listening to your teacher speak. Here's what you can do to keep your mind alert:


If you're in class, make an extra point of paying attention. Write down everything your teacher says and even reread it to stay focused. Raise your hand and answer questions. If you're confused about a certain concept, ask a question. You'll be unlikely to fall asleep if you're in the middle of a conversation with your teacher.
If you're at work, talk to a colleague about a work-related task, or strike up a conversation about history or politics, or even your family, if you're on a break.
If you're struggling to stay awake at home, call a friend, write an email, or listen to an engaging radio talk show.
Switch tasks. To keep your mind active, try to switch tasks as often as you can. If you're in school, you can do this by writing with a new pen, using a highlighter, or getting up to get a drink of water. If you're at work, take a break from typing to make copies or file papers.

, If you're at home or at work, taking the time to take a quick power nap for 5-20 minutes can help you give your system the boost that it needs to keep going. Sleeping for longer than that will make you feel more tired for the rest of the day and will also make it harder for you to fall asleep at night. Here's how to do it:


Find a comfortable spot. If you're at home, a couch is ideal, and if you're at work, recline in your chair.
Minimize distractions. Turn off your phone, close your door, and do what you need to do to let others around you know you're sleeping.
When you wake up, take a deep breath, and have a glass of water and some caffeine to feel energized. Take a three-minute walk to get your body going.

, Download an app onto your smartphone that displays bright luminous colors. This can activate the receptors in your brain that alert you staying awake. This is also why using iPads, etc. before sleep-time can harm your chances of getting good sleep.

, Though these tricks can help you when you're in a bind, you'd be better off if you develop a lifestyle that will help you avoid having to force yourself to stay awake because you're so incredibly tired. Here are some ways to do it:


Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day to get your body in a healthy routine.
Start your day off strong with a great morning routine that will make you alert and ready for the rest of the day.
Be responsible. Don't stay up until three in the morning if you know you have to be up for work or school just a few hours later.
If you're tired because you had to stay up all night to study for an exam, try to set up a studying schedule that will keep you from staying up all night next time. Most people can't receive information when they are tired.
If you are regularly having trouble falling asleep and feel like you're always struggling to stay awake during the day, then you should see a doctor to see if you have a sleep disorder. "

Start a nighttime routine.,
Dim the lights about an hour before you go to sleep.,
Get a decent amount of shut-eye.,
Sleep with the curtains half-open.,
Try to fall back asleep if you wake up at night.,
Adjust the temperature.",How to Wake Up Early2," Our bodies need to program down, in a sense. The rush of the day has us into human-sized Energizer bunnies and we can't just go from 60 to 0 in a heartbeat. Your routine should be whatever appeals to you, but it should be daily (to serve as a cue to your body) and take at least 15 minutes.


The routine can consist of showering, drinking warm milk, listening to classical music, or doing relaxing exercises such as yoga or Pilates. If you read, make sure to read without any bright lights (more on that later). Designate your bedroom for sleeping only. Refrain from any strenuous activities right before, as this will inhibit comfortable sleep time.

, Bright lights can suppress the hormone melatonin, which can lead to sleeplessness and suppress the ""tired"" feeling.Try to turn off TV screens, laptop monitors and the like an hour before you want to go to sleep.


The science behind it is that all these bright lights are messing with our body's internal clocks. When you're sitting in front of a computer, TV, and phone until 2 AM, your body has zero ideas as to what's going on; it could be 2 AM or 2 PM for all it knows. Turning off the lights lets your body realize, ""Ahh, it's bedtime. Shutting down!""

, It's a simple truth, but that doesn't mean it's any less important: sleeping enough will help you wake up earlier. What are yours?


It's easier to wake up early if you've have the recommended amount of sleep during the night. Plan on getting:

7 to 9 hours of sleep for men.8 to 9 hours of sleep for women.9 to 10 hours of sleep for pregnant women.10 to 12 hours of sleep for children and the elderly., Sleeping with the curtains half-open could help your body to stop producing melatonin while simultaneously ramping up production of adrenaline.This could help your body be ready to embrace the day by the time your alarm clock goes off.


You know how we just said light keeps you awake? Well, if you're asleep it awakens you. Crazy stuff, huh? The natural sunlight will be perceived by your body, even when you're asleep.
Sunlight can also warm your bed, letting the temperature tell you to get up, too. If that's possible, consider placing your bed in the right position in your room to utilize this effect.

, Remain in bed to avoid awakening your body should you move around. However, if you're tossing and turning for over 20 minutes, get up. Do a relaxing activity (like reading or stretching) until you feel you can go back.


Getting up in the middle of the night could be the symptom of a larger problem. Evaluate your habits and your environment. If you're doing everything right (you'll know by the end of this page), consider seeing a doctor. You may have a sleep condition that he/she can help with.

, Most doctors will tell you to keep the room somewhere between 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 22°C).However, what's comfortable for one person may not be comfortable for another. If you have any trouble sleeping, consider messing with the temperature. You may find your sleeping woes to vanish at the click of a button.


If you're not sleeping alone, utilize layers or the lack thereof. Try to find a common ground where you're both negotiating. Worst comes to worst, there's always heating blankets!

Put your alarm clock away from your bed.,
Avoid snoozing your alarm clock.,
Wake up your senses.,
Try to wake up at the end of a sleep cycle to minimize grogginess.",How to Wake Up Early3," When it's out of reach, you're forced to get out of bed. Putting it next to your bed is just a temptation to hit the snooze button and fall back to sleep -- for 9 minutes. Not helpful at all.


Consider getting a new one. There are tons of alarms with different tones. Maybe yours isn't working for you, in which case, consider a new one. Be considerate of roommates and housemates. If you're sleeping in the same room as someone, tell them your plan to wake up early, and ask their permission to set an alarm. This way, they can prepare for the alarm--with earplugs, or opting to sleep somewhere else for the night--and they won't be startled awake in the morning.

, As soon as the alarm rings, get out of bed to start your morning. You will eventually awaken and feel better that you've persevered through morning drowsiness. Jump out of bed (as much as is feasible) and think about tackling your inevitably awesome day.


Snoozing won't make you feel more rested. Scientists have found that you don't get the more restful, REM sleep while snoozing, making this guilty pleasure especially wasteful for your wakefulness. In fact, you'll just feel worse., Once you've gotten out of bed, give yourself that much-deserved pick-me-up. It could be a cup of coffee or tea (that brewing smell will be sure to get you going), a cold glass of water, or a nice shower. Whatever it is, make sure it awakens one (or more) of your senses. When your body and mind are stimulated, you'll automatically wake up to take it in.


Light and sound work, too, in addition to taste, smell, and touch. Throw open the curtains, turn on some music, and get your day off on the right foot. The better the morning, the better the afternoon and evening!

,


When you sleep, you cycle between REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep comprises three stages: N1 (Transition to sleep), N2 (Light sleep), and N3 (Deep sleep). You usually slip into REM sleep 70 to 90 minutes after falling asleep, and this is when most of your dreams occur.Each sleep cycle lasts roughly 90 minutes, and repeats four to six times over the course of a night. If you are awoken in the midst of N3 deep sleep, you may feel groggy and disoriented. You want to wake during the lighter, more active stages of sleep, especially REM or N1.
Try setting a wake-up time that's a multiple of 90 minutes away from the current time.
Consider using a sleep-cycle calculator like to plan out the best time to wake.

Use their sense of smell.,
Use their sense of feeling.,
Get a trained hearing dog.",How to Wake a Deaf Person1," The sense of smell is very sensitive to the aromas of food and other fragrances. Make something sweet in the morning and the nose will arouse the body to discover what smells so delicious.


Prepare scented tea or strong coffee in the morning. A whiff is sure to motivate them to get out of bed and enjoy a tasty cup-o-Joe or herbal tea.
Fill the room with one of their favorite scents. Try citrus smells or one of a variety of popular aerosols used for refreshing the smell of a room.
Bake or fry a sweet or bitter dish. Few people can resist the smell of home cooked food.
Deliver breakfast in bed. They might not get out of bed, but they will certainly wake up.;
, Whether you need to gently shake the bed, body, pillow, or have natural sunlight hit their face, the sense of touch is another good way to help a deaf or hard of hearing person get up in the morning.


A spouse, parent, child, or roommate can carry out this task if they are reliable. They should take seriously waking up a deaf/hard of hearing friend or family member.
Try flashing the bedroom lights on and off quickly to get their attention.
Pull back the drapes to let sunlight hit them in the face or on their body.
If all else fails, give them a light tap on the arm or gently shake their shoulder until they wake up.
Remember, just because you are performing this task as a favor, don’t be rude, insulting, or impatient with your responsibility. Refrain from splashing cold water on their face, whipping off their covers, or pushing them out of the bed. It will only cause resentment.

, You might be busy getting ready in the morning or perhaps your schedules don’t match up and you are unavailable to help out in the morning. In this case, consider getting a trained hearing dog to perform the duty of wake-up call. Hearing dogs are trained to assist deaf or hard of hearing people by physically alerting their partner to common sounds like an alarm clock.When the alarm sounds, the hearing dog will nudge their body until they wake up and shut off the alarm.
Hearing dogs can also be used by people who are hard of hearing, use sign language, or are non-verbal.

Learn about the value of good quality sleep on your health and state of mind.,
Evaluate your sleep habits.,
Choose an effective alarm clock or phone alarm setting.,
Explore alarms that encourage gradual wakefulness rather than abrupt sleep interruption.,
Conduct a trial run on a weekend or a day with fewer morning responsibilities.,
Make a commitment to wake up at the same time every morning.",How to Teach Yourself to Get Up As Soon As Your Alarm Clock Goes Off1," Knowing more about how sleep can benefit your waking life can help you to make the extra effort to get enough sleep.


Getting enough high-quality sleep will make waking up less difficult.
Recognizing the importance of sleep may provide you a clear goal to work towards, which will help you establish the rhythm of sleep and waking with greater ease.
Read scientific research rather than advertisements for alarm clocks. Focus on getting healthy sleep for a better morning.;
, Make sure you get enough sleep. The suggested sleep duration for healthy adults is between 7-8 hours a night, and getting less sleep can lead to a “sleep deficit,” which makes waking up in the morning even more challenging.Use a smartphone or tablet app that tracks your sleep cycle to determine the duration and quality of your sleep.
Keep a sleep log to analyze your sleep patterns and ascertain if external factors are disrupting your sleep. , Sleep patterns are unique to each person, so you should investigate a number of options that might suit your habits. You may need to try several different types before determining the best choice for your needs.


Extremely loud alarm clocks can raise your blood pressure and jolt you more fully awake more quickly, although some experts recommend against this approach.Some alarms require mental exercises, such as solving a puzzle or answering questions, before you can turn off the alarm. Cognitive stimulation forces different regions of your brain to engage, thus combating sleep inertia., These alarms operate within a time frame set either by your average sleep cycle or your own choice, using either sound or dawn simulation, and can help with morning alertness.Research suggests that these alarms are better for your overall health.Dawn alarms use special lamps or light bulbs and are set to your selected wake-time. The lights gradually increase in brightness over a period of several minutes, activating your natural circadian rhythm, just as sunlight does.Smart alarms monitor your sleep and wake you gradually when you’re in a lighter stage of sleep. They also track the quality of your sleep over time and can help you determine the healthiest wake-up time for your body and your habits. As a result, you’ll feel less “sleep inertia” and more quickly become alert and ready to start your day.Smart alarms can be purchased as standalone clocks, wearable/fitness technology, or smartphone applications, while dawn simulators are usually standalone alarms or applications associated with smarthome technology.

, Make sure your alarm clock and wake-up plan is effective and manageable for both yourself and your partner or roommate, if applicable.


Make sure the volume, if applicable, is enough to wake you up.
Verify that all settings are appropriate for your situation and that they work as promised.

, Getting out of bed at the same time every day will help your body become accustomed to waking up at a particular time. Your circadian rhythm controls your sleep/wake cycle, and a consistent alarm clock setting can help you train your body to be ready to wake up at a particular time.Tell someone you trust about your commitment to better sleep and wake-up habits. Making a change in habits is challenging, so ask your loved ones for support in your efforts.
Remind yourself, every day, of the value of good sleep and the inherent rewards of starting your day on time, like a more relaxed morning and being on time to school or work.

, This means you have to wake up to disarm it to snooze, so you'll probably give up on snooze by the time you get to it (this however isn't enough for everyone).

If your family members are light sleepers, make sure that having your alarm on for a long time will not wake them up. Everyone will be annoyed if your alarm goes off for five minutes because you can't find it.
If you hide the alarm or put it in a hard to reach place, make sure the sound isn't muffled. You still need to be able to hear the alarm.

, When the light hits your retinas, it suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps you to sleep. It also helps you to get exposure to the light so you can wake up easier.


If you are an insomniac, it is recommended that you do not do this as melatonin is needed to help you sleep better.

, This ensures that you wake up quickly and prevents you from going back to sleep. In the dark, you are never more tempted to snuggle back up in you sheets.

, This ensures that your face is refreshed and this is yet another way to not fall right back asleep. Not to mention that this is also part of keeping good hygiene.

, In the morning, after sleeping for hours, your body gets dehydrated and makes you feel more tired.

, This will brighten your mood and you will tend to forget that it is 5 in the morning.

, Be sure you eat something or take something with you on the bus. One tends to be grouchy on an empty stomach. Eating breakfast has also been shown to help people lose weight.

Eat an apple. Apples provide natural sugars and help your stomach to digest.






Drink orange juice in a clear glass. Orange juice has natural sugars just like apples. The colour orange is found to be stimulating and may help you to perk up in the morning.






Drink coffee after 9:30 am if you are a coffee drinker. Your body naturally produces higher amounts of cortisol (a stress hormone that regulates energy) between 8 and 9am. If you drink coffee before that, your body will produce less cortisol, giving you less overall energy throughout the day.

Exercise early enough in the day.,
Avoid drinking caffeinated drinks at night.,
Get more sleep on days after you under-sleep.,
Avoid eating large meals before bedtime.",How to Wake Up Early4," Many doctors believe that getting in a moderately-intense cardiovascular workout during the afternoon helps people get to sleep at a reasonable time.So go to the gym, join a basketball team, or bust out the dusty treadmill you've been telling yourself you'd use. It'll help you get to sleep earlier.


Try not to exercise later on at night. Exercising late at night raises your body's core temperature. Since sleep is thought to be brought on by a drop in the body's temperature, late-night exercise may be detrimental to an early night's sleep.

, It will keep your body awake and ultimately cause insomnia. Limit your daily consumption to less than 500 mg per day.A grande brewed coffee from Starbucks has 330 mg of caffeine. Red Bull clocks in at a decent 80.Just for the record.

, People need more sleep the next day when they fail to get enough sleep the previous day(s).So if you got only 5 or 6 hours of sleep on Monday (which you shouldn't, usually), be diligent about getting 10 to 11 hours of sleep on Tuesday to compensate for your deprivation. Otherwise, you could be feeding a vicious cycle of sleepiness every morning.


Don't nap for long periods of time during the day to make up for it, however. The closer it gets to actual bedtime, the more devastating a nap can be. If you need to take a nap, try to make it before 3:00 PM, and limit it to under 45 minutes.That'll provide the most rest while still giving you a good chance of falling asleep quickly later at night.

, Not only does the rush of flavor wake you up, but once you do hit the sack, you may have a hard time staying there. Not only is it bad for your waistline, but it's bad for the next day's energy, too.Your digestion slows down when you sleep and eating a big meal beforehand makes you susceptible to heartburn (in addition to the trips to the bathroom). Going to bed in a near food coma makes it difficult to initially fall asleep, too. So it's best to just avoid it.

Throw a glass of cold water on your kids.,
Turn getting up and getting ready into a contest.,
Sing a good morning song to your kids.",How to Get Your Child out of Bed in the Morning1," Light is an awesome director of your body’s natural clock. Light naturally makes you wake up and dark naturally makes you tired. Because not all areas of the globe will actually have the sun at the times you want to get up and go to bed, using a natural light lamp can work just as well.Some of these lights also have built-in sounds that can be played while your kids are falling asleep.
If you live in an area where the sun itself can do this job, leave the blinds open in your kids’ bedroom so it wakes them up naturally (and gradually) in the morning.;
, If your kids won’t get out of bed when they're supposed to, have your dog or cat help! Allow your dog or cat into your kids’ rooms when the alarm goes off. They will want to play and jump and will most likely drive your kids crazy!Obviously this doesn’t work as well if you have a bird or a hamster. Cats and dogs work best for this trick.

, There are so many fancy new alarm clocks on the market specifically designed to help people get out of bed in the morning. The easiest (and cheapest) one would simply be to put the alarm clock somewhere in the room that can’t be reached from bed.You can also use the most annoying sound for the alarm to ensure they won’t want to sleep through the noise. Music is great but really easy to sleep through!

, Pick out the band or song you love, but your kids hate, and play it nice and loud in the morning! Annoy your kids out of bed if necessary. Don’t turn the music off until your kids are up AND dressed.Depending on the time of day, and how close your neighbours are, this may not work.

, The smell of bacon or coffee in the morning can help almost anyone get out of bed when they don’t want to, including your kids. Make their favourite smelling foods as part of breakfast to entice them to get up and come downstairs for breakfast.Coffee, of course, will only work if your kids are old enough to drink it.
Other options might be cinnamon buns, fresh baked bread, warm muffins, etc.

, It’s an oldie, but a goodie! If your kids won’t get out of bed, make it really uncomfortable for them to stay in bed. Pour a glass of cold water over their heads and watch how quickly they move.This will only work for kids who have a sense of humour. Don’t use this option just to be mean.

, If you have more than one kid around the same age, turn the morning routine into a contest. Whoever is able to get up and get ready to go first wins. The prize could be anything from being able to sit in the front seat of the car to picking what’s for dinner, to choosing what to watch on TV that night., For younger kids, pick a good morning song that everyone sings when it’s time to get up. You can pick any song, or just make one up on the fly. Make it positive and fun and your kids will wake up smiling."

Manufacturers also make “pillow vibrators,” which shakes the pillow when the alarm clock rings.

, If you want to help a deaf or hard of hearing person, get them a strobe light that they can attach to their alarm clock.When the alarm sounds, strong strobe lights will flash in the direction of the bed.
For safety, combine the vibrating accessory with the strobe light to better guarantee waking up on time.

, Before going to bed, have them set their cell phone to vibrate. Then, have them sleep with the phone either under their pillow or held in their hand. In the morning, call them and the phone will vibrate, waking them up.

Get into a rhythm.,
Use your senses.,
Set your mental alarm.",How to Wake a Deaf Person3," You will need to program your body to wake up the same time every day. Even on days that you don’t need to get up for work or send the kids to school.Starting out you will need somebody to wake you up at the same time every day for about one week to set your physiological process, which is called the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a natural 24-hour cycle that regulates the body.
Decide how many of hours of sleep your body generally needs. This is important, because, in order for this to work, you have to go bed and wake up at the same time every day.
You will have to wean yourself away from having somebody else wake you up every day. Try to keep your schedule consistent so that you wake up at the same time. A good practice is to wake up every other day at the same time successfully before letting the other person go.

, Since the loss of one sense makes the other senses stronger, use them to your advantage for waking up every morning. Letting your mind wake up by responding to your other senses is a natural way to wake up.Sleep near an open window so that sunlight hits your face in the morning. You will have to position your bed so that the light hits your face around the time you want to wake up. This will require the periodic movement of your bed throughout the year.
The sleeping body is sensitive to temperature change so set the timer for your thermostat to turn on about an hour before wake-up time. The dramatic change in early morning temperature will arouse your body to awaken. Try to coordinate this with sunlight hitting your face.
If you drink coffee, let your nose wake you up. Set the coffee maker’s timer to begin making coffee a few minutes prior to wake-up time. The strong smell of coffee will wake you up.
You can always use the sensation of having to urinate to wake up naturally. Drink lots of water before going to bed and you will be sure to wake up punctually.

, Motivate or give yourself a reason to wake up in the morning. If you know you have to wake up for school at six o’clock in the morning, your body will release adrenocorticotropin in high concentrations to get your body awake. The body’s internal clock can be relatively accurate with some patience and practice.Being healthy is essential to accomplishing your goal of waking up. Your body will respond better to mental and physical cues when healthy as compared to a diet that makes you sleepy or groggy from lots of sugar and fat. Drinking too much caffeine can also disrupt the sleep cycle.
The sleep cycle repeats itself in ninety-minute intervals. Calculate how many hours and what time you want to wake up by using multiples of ninety. It is easier to wake up towards the end of the cycle than in the middle of it.
Another experimental method to try is visualizing your wake up time. Thinking to yourself “I will wake up at…” has shown that people were able to relative wake up around the time they visualized.

Find a dependable alarm clock.You want something that will go off at the right time every day.,
Place your alarm clock in an optimal position.If its too easy to snooze the alarm right beside you move it.,
Set your alarm clock in advance.,
Go to bed at the same time every day.,
Get out of bed when you wake up.",How to Wake Up1," Something with enough volume to knock you out of a deep sleep. Make sure it has a battery backup. That way if the power goes out it will still wake you up.


You don't have to spend a lot of money to find a dependable alarm clock.Less sophisticated alarm clocks with rotating dials can be more reliable than ""smarter"" digital clocks you have trouble understanding the instructions for.
Be wary of alarm clocks that have an off button too close to the snooze button. If you hit off instead of snooze you could be in big trouble later.
If you use your phone as your alarm clock, make sure to set it up so the alarm volume is loud every time you need it. You may want to establish a policy of never turning your alarm volume down.;
, Find a place that it will still be loud enough to wake you up but will force you to get up to turn it off. You still want to be able to see what time it is though. Keep it in a location you can see but have to get up to turn the alarm off.

, If you are getting up on a regular schedule then you need to train yourself to wake up at the same time everyday. You can start by setting your alarm clock to go off at the same time everyday. Your body will gradually remember this time. So much so that you may eventually start waking up a few minutes early in anticipation of your alarm going off.If you know it takes some time for the alarm to wake you up then set your alarm fifteen minutes before you need to be up.

, Just as important as setting your alarm for the same time every day is going to bed at the same time. This means you will get the same amount of sleep each night. Preferably in the 7-8 hour range. Your body will adjust to get tired at the same time each night. With the proper amount of rest, your body will not resist waking up so much.

, Although you may be tempted to hit the snooze, you need to actually stand up. Stand up. Walk around the room. Turn lights on so you don't run into anything. This gets you moving even if you don't feel awake yet. Your body will wake up a little more each moment you force it to stay vertical.


As soon as you get up you may opt to take a shower or walk outside. Any sort of routine that gets you up and moving helps.

Make healthy food choices.,
Exercise every day at a moderately intense level for at least 20 minutes.,
Set your alarm clock.,
Have a good night's sleep.",How to Teach Yourself to Get Up As Soon As Your Alarm Clock Goes Off2," Eat nutritious foods throughout the day to keep your blood sugars balanced and your digestive system working smoothly.


Avoid simple sugars, caffeine, and high-fat foods, and instead focus on complex carbs, lean proteins, good fats, and fresh herbs to stimulate the hormone serotonin, which promotes sleep.Stop eating at least three hours before you plan to go to bed. Eating too close to bedtime may cause acid reflux or other gastrointestinal issues, which will negatively affect your sleep quality and make it harder to wake up., Exercise burns calories and strengthens your cardiovascular system to help ease the stress that might keep you awake, and it will also expend any excess energy so that your body can relax.Afternoon exercise sessions may be best, as the workout raises your body temperature, which then falls back to normal, which may lead to better sleep.Adjust your planned wake-up time, if necessary, to add an exercise routine in the morning.

, Verify that you’ve set the time to the correct period of the day (AM or PM) and that your volume, snooze actions, and power supply are in place.


If you’re using a sound-based alarm, consider placing your clock at some distance from your bed so that you have to get up to turn it off.
If your alarm requires mental exercises, such as puzzles, place your clock near a light source so that you can see it more clearly, if necessary.

, Using your sleep evaluation, choose a bedtime that’s appropriate for the sleep you need, and take the time to prepare your body for rest.


Consider relaxing or stress-relief habits before sleep, such as meditation, prayer, or relaxation techniques.Make sure your mattress, pillows, and blankets are comfortable, and go through any before-bed rituals, like brushing your teeth and washing your face. Make your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet (or have some sort of white noise). "

Sit up immediately.,
Use your environment to help you continue to wake up.,
Begin your morning routine immediately.,
Start your day with physical activity.,
Make and eat a healthy breakfast.",How to Teach Yourself to Get Up As Soon As Your Alarm Clock Goes Off3," Push the covers to one side, and sit on the edge of your bed with your feet planted firmly on the ground. The cool air on your extremeties may more rapidly decrease your feeling of sleepiness, or “sleep inertia.”If your alarm clock is next to your bed, on a night stand, stand fully upright before turning it off.
If your clock is situated at a distance from your bed, walk over to it and turn it off.

, If you are alone, or if your partner or roommate must also wake up at this time, turn on all the lights and open your curtains and blinds.


The light will stimulate the photoreceptors in your retinas.and send a “wake-up” signal to your brain.Open the windows, if possible, to help cool your hands and feet and encourage wakefulness., Waiting too long might tempt you to lie back down for “just a few more minutes.”


Try brushing your teeth first, then showering or washing your face. The cool water and lights in the bathroom will stimulate your senses and help to diminish your sense of sleepiness.

, Getting moving will stimulate your nervous and cardiovascular systems.


Yoga stretches encourage deep breathing, which helps with wakefulness first thing in the morning, and will help you feel more peaceful and alert for the rest of the day.Aerobic exercise may help you become more alert as your heart rate increases and improves oxygen flow to your brain. Additionally, ""fasted excercise,"" before breakfast, will improve the way your body stores fats and burns calories, which will improve your health and energy (and sleep)., Having the time to prepare a delicious meal as a reward for waking up on time might be just the right encouragement you need to get out of bed.


Fresh fruits can provide a boost of energy, along with delicious flavor, to get your day started on a positive note.Lean proteins, such as eggs, will provide more long-term energy and a sense of fullness, to help you avoid eating too much at lunch due to hunger.Complex carbohydrates also offer long-term energy, as your body digests them more slowly, as well as a nice burst of energy immediately after eating them."

Prepare for the new school year.,
Explain why sleep is good.,
Make sure the family schedule aligns with your kids’ sleep routine.,
Avoid over-scheduling your kids.,
Provide incentives for good behaviour.,
Praise your kids for a job well done.",How to Get Your Child out of Bed in the Morning2," Most ‘getting up’ problems happen to school age kids who have a specific schedule. Because that schedule is going to change quite drastically between August and September, consider preparing your kids for the new school year before it actually begins.One week before school starts, have your kids practice getting up at whatever time they need to for school.
Have your kids go to bed at the same time they would on a school night.
Begin other school-time rituals the week before school to get them in the groove (e.g. picking out the next day’s clothes, making and packing a lunch, etc.).

, Kids who are simply told to do something because you (the parent) say they should do it are more likely to fight back. Instead of just implementing a set of bedtime rules, explain to your kids why it’s important that they go to bed at a certain time and why it’s important they get a certain amount of sleep every night.Lack of sleep can cause both physical and mental problems.
Being sleep deprived can increase your kids’ chances of developing anxiety and depression.
School and sports performance will decrease if your kids don’t get enough sleep.

, If you and your kids develop a sleep routine, but you schedule family events (e.g. dinner, sports, etc.) at times that don’t align with that sleep routine, you’re setting your kids up for failure.Once a sleep routine is developed, re-align your family schedule as best you can to allow your kids to successfully follow their sleep routine.

, Kids often participate in more than one activity during the same time of year. On the one hand, this is a great opportunity for them to learn new skills and talents. On the other hand, it doesn’t give them a chance to simply sit back and relax. If their lives are always on the go, the lack of relaxation may make sleeping really difficult.If need be, ask your kids to prioritize which extra-curricular activities they want to participate in, and limit them to a certain number. They can always switch activities in the future.

, This is especially helpful at the end of the summer when you’re trying to get your kids back into a school routine. You probably already have to buy them new school supplies and clothes, so add an extra item as incentive to do a good job with their routine.An incentive can also be built into your kids’ routine. For example, if they get all their morning tasks completed on time, allow them to play a video game or go on the internet before they leave for school.

, Sometimes it can be easier to be critical of bad behaviour that it is to praise good behaviour. Good behaviour, however, needs to be praised and reinforced in order for it to continue. If you don’t tell your kids they’re doing a good job, how will they know?Praise doesn’t have to come with prizes or presents, it can simply be a verbal comment.

"
"
Have your kids help develop their own sleep routines.,
Ensure bedtime is the same time every night.,
Develop a specific bedtime routine that is always followed.,
Ask your kids to lay out their clothes the night before.,
Avoid technology and caffeine after a specific time.,
Ensure bedtime allows your kids the proper amount of sleep before they have to get up the next morning.,
Keep bedrooms dark, cool, and quiet.,
Allow younger kids to fall asleep on their own.,
Give your kids a bedtime pass.,
Create a regular morning routine.,
Teach your kids about the consequences.",How to Get Your Child out of Bed in the Morning3," Kids should have the same sleep routine every day. This would include what time they go to bed, what time they get up, and when they start to wind down at night. In order to get your kids’ full participation in the routine, allow them to help make the plan.Sometime in August, before school begins and before you want your kids to change their routine, sit down at the table with your kids and explain that you want to create a sleep routine for them and that you need their help.
If you have kids of different ages, and need different routines, you may want to create each routine separately with only the relevant kids present. These routines might include quite different activities (e.g. some kids may be too old for bedtime stories, etc.) so it might be helpful to plan them separately.
With the help of your kids, come up with a list of activities your kids need to do each night before they go to bed. Ask your kids to help you put these activities in the order they need to be completed.
Again with the help of your kids, go through each activity and plan how long it normally takes to complete. Add that time up so you know how far in advance of bedtime your kids need to start preparing for bed.
Also work with your kids to reorganize their bedroom to be more conducive to sleeping. For example, have them decide where the alarm clock should be placed, what lights will stay on and which ones will be turned off, check if the blinds/curtains are dark enough, etc.

, Whether it is a school night or not, bedtime should always be at the same time. Keeping your kids’ body clocks on the same schedule every day will help them be more successful with their routine., A bedtime routine might include activities like having a bedtime snack, taking a bath or having a shower, putting on PJs, brushing teeth, reading a story, and saying goodnight to everyone.Bedtime routines should include only non-stimulating and relaxing activities.
The bedtime routine should also include turning off lights so the room is darker during the wind-down period.

, Have you ever experienced that problem where you get up in the morning, and for the life of you, you can’t pick out what you want to wear!? Kids have the same problem. Unfortunately, if they can’t decide what to wear, it’ll slow down their morning routine and could cause them to be late.Instead, ask your kids to pick out the clothes they want to wear before they go to bed.
You may even want them to put their shoes, boots, and/or jackets by the front door before bed, so they don’t have to search for them in the morning.

, Both technology and caffeinated beverages can make it difficult for kids to fall asleep and stay asleep. Kids should avoid caffeinated beverages after a certain time of the day — probably late afternoon — in order to ensure it doesn’t affect their ability to fall asleep. Technology should be avoided about an hour before bedtime in order to allow your kids to relax and unwind before bed.Remember that your kids having a cell phone, tablet, computer, etc., isn’t a right, it’s a privilege.
Because you want to encourage your kids not to have their cell phones in bed, make sure they have an actual alarm clock to use for waking up in the morning.

, If your kids need 9 hours of sleep, and they need to get up at 8am, bedtime needs to be around 11pm. If you allow your kids to stay up later, there is almost no doubt they’ll have a problem getting up in the morning.Work with your kids to develop the right bedtime. If possible, don’t simply dictate the time.
Allow your older kids to learn on their own how easy it is to get up if they get the proper amount of sleep. The fact that they aren’t groggy and can jump out of bed may encourage them to go to bed at the right time all on their own.

, All bedrooms in the house should be dark, cool, and quiet at night. If you have kids and adults going to bed at different times, you may need to adjust for this. For example, you may need to turn the furnace down before the first person goes to bed.Install light blocking curtains on the windows if needed, especially if your kids have to go to bed before it’s dark outside.
Use a white noise machine, aquarium, nature sounds, or even relaxing music as a way to block other noises while your kids are trying to fall asleep.

, Kids need to learn and be encouraged to fall asleep on their own, in their own beds. Sitting or sleeping with them, or allowing them to sleep in your room/bed, will not help your kids develop a good sleep routine.Falling asleep also needs to be a positive experience for your kids. If they associate falling asleep with bad experiences, it may cause them to want you to stay with them, or for them to crawl into your bed.
This step includes NOT running into your child’s bedroom every time they wake up during the night.

, Every night give your kids a bedtime pass in the form of an actually notecard or index card. Allow this pass to be good for one, and only one, chance to get out of bed after bedtime. The reason could be that they need to pee, that they want a drink of water, or that they want to hug you one more time. Once they’ve used the pass, your kids aren’t allowed out of the bedroom again that night.The pass allows your kids to decide when they want to use it. It should eventually teach them to only use it for real problems and not simply to get up and out of bed.

, Just like bedtime, each morning should have the same routine that is always followed. The morning routine could include: physically getting out of bed, going to the bathroom, brushing teeth, making the bed, dressing for the day, styling hair, making or having breakfast, etc. Unlike bedtime activities, morning activities should include more active and upbeat activities to help wake your kids up.The morning routine should also be one that can be followed no matter how tired your kids are. Brain power shouldn’t really be required!

, Once your kids are old enough, most likely when they’re teenagers, you may need to simply allow them to fend for themselves and learn the consequences on their own. Don’t waste your precious time in the morning screaming for them to get out of bed. Just let them get up on their own.This may mean they’re late for school and may get detention, but don’t give them a note that they had your permission. Enough afternoons spent in detention might teach your teen that getting up on time is well worth it.
This may seem a little on the cruel side, but remember they’re not going to have you around forever. Chances are they’re going to be on their own for college. It’s better for them to learn the consequences now rather than later.

Establish a proper sleeping environment.,
Find an alarm clock with multiple alarms.Find an alarm clock that has alarms for different days and multiple times.,
Set up your alarm clock to meet your needs.,
Have a backup plan in place.,
Get out of bed as soon as you wake.",How to Wake Up2," However you normally sleep, that's what you want to establish with your odd schedule pattern. If you usually sleep when its dark outside, find a dark room. If you like to sleep with the tv on, make sure there's a tv where you sleep. Try to create a place that effectively mimics your normal sleeping place.

, If you are on an odd schedule, you may need more than one alarm clock to wake you up. Some alarm clocks have different settings for each day. Some alarm clocks (especially those on a cell phone) can be set to go off multiple times a morning--even if you turn an alarm off, the next one will come on.


If you have a cell phone you may be able to find very sophisticated alarm clocks in your cell phone's store. Some cell phone alarm clocks make you answer math problems or scan a bar code in your bathroom before it turns off., Waking up on an odd schedule robs you of establishing a daily circadian rhythm. If you can't get up at the same time everyday your body may resist an alarm clock more readily. Set your alarm clock based on your needs.


Try to wake up at as close to the same time everyday as possible unless your needs vary greatly. For example, if you can establish a regular sleep schedule--even if that means waking up hours before you need to be somewhere--you should do try to go to bed and wake up at the same time.

, This usually takes the form of another person. You may ask your partner to wake you up. Maybe a parent or child could call you on the phone to make sure you wake up. If you know you need to be up and in the car for a long trip you may simply sleep in the car. You may still be asleep halfway through the trip.

, Getting up and moving will make a big difference. Turning lights on or moving into rooms with already-awake people. You may think about taking a shower to wake yourself up a little more. Don't stay in bed though. Its too comfortable and sleep will draw you back. Get out of bed and get moving so your body will force itself to wake up so you don't hurt yourself walking around.


Be careful of ideas like ""If I don't turn the alarm off I won't fall back to sleep."" If you are tired enough you might fall asleep with the alarm blaring. Do this enough and your alarm may not wake you up at all.

"

Find a quiet place.,
Decide on the length of your nap.,
Set an alarm.When you are napping you may or may not have your usual alarm clock.,
Have a backup plan for waking up.,
Stand up as soon as you are woken up.",How to Wake Up3," Somewhere nobody will interrupt you. Probably somewhere away from your desk, phone, or computer. That way you can rest in peace. You only have a short amount of time for a power nap so you want to make the best of it. If you have a secretary, you may ask them to hold all calls and stop anyone from coming in.


Be careful that your quiet place is not too secluded or remote. Make sure someone knows where you are at in case they need you.

, Some naps last 15 minutes while others last several hours. Decide how long you want to sleep and limit yourself to that. If you have a limited amount of time for your nap, adjust to ensure you have some time to wake up before your next task.


You may want to vary your nap times based on your own sleep cycle rhythms. Some naps may also be better for achieving different results. A 20 minute nap is good for improving your motor skills while a 60-90 minute nap improves decision making., If you are using your usual alarm clock, set it as you usually do. You may use a wake-up call at a hotel or the alarm on your phone. Travel alarms work well in these situations. If you are at your desk you may try setting up an alarm on your computer.


Even if your usual alarm clock is available you may want to use a different alarm clock instead. If you alter your regular alarm clock you may forget to reset it later. This could cause you to be late in the morning.

, Anything will do here. Hotel wake-up calls. Friends, family, colleagues, and co-workers will often help too. Setting multiple alarms on multiple devices can be helpful too. That way you don't give in and sleep for too long in the middle of the day.

, Although you may want to turn the alarm off and fall back to sleep, don't. Stand up instead. Get moving to get your mind going. You may even want to set your alarm across the room so you have to get up to turn it off. Turn some lights on or stare out a window if it is sunny.

Do not press the snooze button.,
Seek light immediately.,
Have a moderate amount of coffee.",How to Get Up When You Want with Only a Few Hours of Sleep1," Wake up as soon as your alarm goes off. Reaching for the snooze button might seem like a great way to get an extra few minutes of sleep; however, hitting snooze actually results in your feeling more exhausted upon waking.


If you're waking up to an alarm clock, you'll often end up jerked awake in the middle of REM sleep. This is the deepest stage of your sleep cycle. It can be jarring to be woken suddenly from REM sleep (this is known as sleep inertia).If you press the snooze button, your body begins a new sleep cycle, only to be once again suddenly roused from deep sleep. The cycle of falling asleep and waking up leaves you more exhausted when you finally get out of bed.
While it might be tempting to hit snooze for those few extra minutes, try to force yourself to get up as soon as your alarm goes off. To motivate yourself to forgo the snooze button, try reminding yourself that this will be better for you long term.
If you have trouble resisting the temptation to hit the snooze button, consider placing the alarm across the room. That way, you'll have to get up to turn it off. This can help wake you up.;
, Human brains are wired to respond to light as a cue to awaken from sleep. As soon as you wake up, try to expose yourself to bright lights and sunlight. This will send a signal to your mind and body that it's time to be awake.Natural sunlight is best. Try opening your blinds as soon as you get up or stepping out on the porch for a few minutes in the morning.
If you wake up before the sun rises, turn on all the lights when you wake up. Artificial light can provide a decent substitute for sunlight. There are alarm clocks that provide an artificial sunrise by way of alarm to help coax you out of bed in the morning., Caffeine is a powerful stimulant. When used in moderation (200 – 400 mg of caffeine, or about one 8-oz cup of coffee), having a caffeinated beverage in the morning can help you feel refreshed throughout the day.Studies show overall cognitive function on low sleep improves with use of caffeine. Have a cup of coffee within your first hour of waking up. This will help you feel energized throughout the day.Don't overdo it. Many people feel drinking loads of coffee, or an energy drink packed with sugar and high levels of caffeine will help them wake up. But too much caffeine can cause dehydration which results in fatigue. You could also experience other physical symptoms, such as anxiety and difficulty concentrating.Avoid caffeine at least six hours before going to bed, as it has been shown interfere with sleep.

Eliminate the source of your tiredness.",How to Wake Up4," Walk around a little if you can. Resist the urge to sit or lay down. Also avoid leaning up against anything. If your eyes are heavy, you may doze off. As long as you are standing up and moving you should be able to avoid falling asleep.

, Cold water works best. The colder the better. Something to sort of shock you into waking up. You can easily excuse yourself to the bathroom to do this. The goal here is to make yourself uncomfortable. If your face is cold you will be less likely to fall asleep. If you have short, combed-over hair you could put cold water on your scalp too.

, Take off that jacket or scarf. Roll up your long sleeves. Grab a glass of ice cold water. Take a few gulps, refill, and keep it at your desk. If you have a space heater at your desk, turn it off. You may even want to turn a fan on to keep you cooler.

, You may opt to start doing things more quickly. Stand and march in place while at your desk. If you can take a quick break, do jumping jacks or run in place. This will get your heart rate up. More blood will be moving to your brain and your lungs will start working harder to provide oxygen to the blood. As your heart rate rises you will be more awake and alert.


Taking a shower will also influence your cardiovascular system by raising your blood pressure.

, If you are tired, a monotonous task will prompt your eyes to become very heavy. If you can switch tasks and do something different, try that instead. If it involves paying close attention to something or someone else that's even better. When our minds are engaged we become more awake and alert.


If you can listen to something on the radio or on your phone do so. If you have a favorite radio station or upbeat playlist or music album listen to that and sing. Try listening to a book on tape. If you like keeping up with current events, news radio may also keep your mind engaged.

, If you are unable to shake your midday sleepiness you may not be getting enough rest in general. Consider establishing a regular sleep routine and avoiding snacks and beverages that can make you sleepy.Consult a physician if you have a regular sleep schedule and still feel tired during midday.

Stay hydrated.,
Get some exercise.,
Eat breakfast.",How to Get Up When You Want with Only a Few Hours of Sleep2," Hydration can help prevent fatigue, especially when you're running on little sleep. Make sure you stay hydrated throughout the morning to help yourself wake up.Start off the day with one to two 8-oz glasses of water. Keep up with your water intake throughout the day. Sip on water throughout the day for a total of nine to 13 8-oz. glasses (2.2 to 3 liters), which is the generally recommended amount. Remember, everyone is different, so you may require a bit more or less.Bring a water bottle to work or school and periodically take sips.Eat foods that have a high water content as well, such as iceberg lettuce, cucumber, green peppers, watermelon, and baby carrots., Stay moving throughout the morning. Exercise promotes blood circulation, which helps you feel energetic throughout the day.


If you have time to get in a morning workout, do so. Just doing some light aerobics at home, something like jumping jacks, for 20 to 30 minutes can help you wake up.However, if you don't have time for a vigorous work out just light walking can help. Consider walking to work or school instead of driving, if possible. Take a quick 15-minute walk around the block before hopping in the shower. This has the added benefit of exposing you to natural sunlight, which can be stimulating., If you're trying to wake up on little sleep, breakfast is vital. Your body needs all the fuel it can get to run smoothly despite lacking rest.


Try to eat breakfast within one hour of waking up. Research suggests this will boost your overall alertness later in the day.When sleepy, you tend to crave simple sugar and carbs; however, exercise willpower. Go for a healthy breakfast like oatmeal, yogurt and fruit, or hard boiled eggs. Processed foods and junk foods will make you crash later on, leaving you more tired."

Take steps to improve your sleep hygiene.",How to Get Up When You Want with Only a Few Hours of Sleep3," Later in the day, try to lie low and not engage in activities that require a lot of mental processing. If you have work or school, this may be difficult. Try to reschedule meetings or phone calls at work if possible. Limit interaction with others as people running on low sleep tend to not pick up on non-verbal social cues. Go easy on yourself for the day. Keep in mind everyone has off days. If you're not functioning your best for one class period or one work day, you can always do better tomorrow., Your memory is impaired if you're running on little sleep. Multitasking at work and school is a bad idea. Try to stick to one task at a time if you're running on little sleep., If you periodically have mornings when you're running on low sleep, look for long-term solutions. Try to improve your sleep hygiene so you'll fall asleep easier and have a high-quality rest each night.


Go to sleep and wake up at roughly the same time each day. Your body functions on a natural circadian rhythm. If you go to sleep at 11 PM and wake up at 8 AM each night, your body will naturally adjust. You'll feel tired before bedtime and energetic in the morning.Keep your sleeping and waking life separate. Do not keep electronics in your bedroom and do not engage in activities other than sleeping (or sex) in your bed. You want your body to associate your bedroom with sleep time so your mind will be geared for rest when you get in bed.Have a relaxing bedtime ritual. Before bed, engage in a calming activity like meditation, reading, or taking a warm bath. Having nightly rituals you engage in before bed helps signal your body that it's time for sleep."

Have some coffee.",How to Wake Up in the Middle of the Night," Nerves in your brain control your body’s clock, known as your circadian rhythm. This rhythm is established by following a predictable routine, which is why you are able to wake up at the same time on the weekend as you are during the week if all factors are equal. So the best way to adjust your sleep cycle is to be consistent and make it a routine.Take care not to deprive yourself of sleep. There are many studies about the dangers of sleep deprivation so talk to your medical professional before attempting to change your sleep schedule for a long period of time.More sleep isn't always healthier than less sleep. Scientists don’t know whether sleeping longer is a symptom of poor health or the cause of it. Consult your health professional to see if there is a deeper concern as to why you are staying in bed longer such as sleep apnea or depression.;
, If you stay up later than normal because you don’t feel tired, don’t force yourself to sleep but rather let your body adjust naturally. Eventually, you'll be tired earlier and will be able to easily fall asleep at an earlier time.Your body will naturally regulate your sleep schedule.


Don’t feel frustrated if you can’t fall asleep because you might develop insomnia from becoming anxious at the thought of not being able to fall asleep. Trust that your new cycle with set itself., Each of us have different capacities at which we can function with little to no sleep. Some of us can be fully alert with just 4 hours of sleep while others need more than 8.Calculate how much time you will need to get enough sleep to perform the task you want and set your night’s schedule accordingly. For example, if you want to wake up to catch a meteor shower at 3am and know you are able to function with only 4 hours of sleep, get into bed around 10:30pm.


If you're just waking up in the middle of the night for a specific one-time event, planning exactly when you should go to bed is smart. But if you're trying to adjust your sleep cycle for a longer period of time, let your new cycle come naturally, and don't try to force it., Whether you already have one or need to buy a new one, an alarm clock is usually a necessity. If it is a digital alarm clock, go to the settings menu for personal preferences on volume, alarm type, and length.

, With their size and convenience, mobile/cell phones are a great option to use as all come with an alarm function. Set the alarm close to you to ensure adequate volume. Test the alarm several times until you’re satisfied it’s loud enough to wake you and will work at the correct time.


Make sure not to make it too loud if you don’t want to wake up others within earshot, but don't make it too quiet so as to render it useless.

, If you don't have an alarm clock and the default alarm on your mobile phone doesn’t meet your needs, there are a number of apps to help you wake up. Read user feedback and customer reviews to get a sense of how each app has served other people and install into your phone, tablet, or desktop.


Make sure to check whether the app is free or if it requires a payment.
Know what operating system you are using. Some apps may only be compatible with certain versions of an operating system. Make sure to read the entire product description to ensure it works with your computer or tablet.

, Be cautious of these functions because they can usually be activated when you are half-conscious and instinctively reaching to shut off your alarm. Activating the snooze button too many times can result in either you becoming late or you becoming even more tired. When you hear the first alarm, adrenaline and cortisol trigger a stress response to wake you up immediately so pressing the snooze button suppresses your body’s natural functions, leaving you feeling disoriented and groggy., Another important bodily function is urination. Water can wake you up in the middle of the night; however, the amount of water needed for you to do so can only be known through trial and error based on a number of factors including weight and age.


Err on the side of caution and either drink enough water that you feel full or test yourself on another night to see what works. Water is great because you are still able to get some sleep unlike if you drank stimulants such as beverages with caffeine or sugar.
Even though drinking a lot of water will wake you up, there is no set calculation to determine when you will be getting up. Do not use this method for its precision but rather for its effectiveness.

, Including everyone will give them a chance to help you get up if they happen to be up too. Moreover, people in your household may hear your alarm if you’ve overslept and get you up to tend to your responsibility.

, Whether your friend is a fellow shift worker or joining you in a late-night adventure, a phone call in the middle of the night is very jarring. Keep your phone in close proximity where you know you’ll hear it and make sure your ringer is turned on. Test the ringer volume before going to bed to make sure it’s adequate and check in with your friend to make sure the plan is still in effect.


This method can be rather unreliable depending on the friend you choose.
You may also want to offer your friend an incentive to ensure they follow through or pay a calling service instead.

, There is research that suggest our sleep cycles in 90 minute intervals. Each 90 minute cycle includes two doses of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and one non-REM sleep. REM is the deepest cycle of sleep so optimize your sleep by keeping it in intervals of 90 minutes. Waking up at the end of a 90 minute REM cycle will leave you much more alert and awake than waking up in the middle of non-REM sleep.Train your body to sleep less by cutting down incrementally. Cut down your sleep 30 minutes at a time. For example, cut down your sleep from 8 to 7 ½ hours in one week then reduce it to 7 the next until you’re down to your ideal sleep schedule.

, Drinking a glass of cold water in the morning will jump start your metabolism.You can also jump into a cold shower or splash cold water onto your face. The sudden drop in temperature will be very jarring to your body and will immediately get you alert.


Going outside with damp hair or moisture on your skin will further wake you up as the fresh air continues to drop your temperature.

, Caffeine has long been known to help people wake up. If you have already established a solid coffee routine and feel like it no longer works, reduce the amount of sugar and milk or the type of coffee that you are drinking. Some brands have a higher caffeine content.


Caffeine is a stimulant that triggers a short-term rise in blood pressure and heart rate so don’t depend on coffee as a permanent solution as your body will quickly build an immunity. People with poor heart health should consult their medical professional before developing a regular caffeine routine.Find a diner or late night establishment that serves the type of coffee that’s right for you. Forcing yourself to go somewhere and talk to strangers rather than staying at home helps to get you alert.

, On any of the above devices, you have the option of selecting a ""normal"" or ""sensitive"" sleep setting. If you want a more basic idea of your general sleep patterns, select normal. The sensitive sleep setting will cause your device to track nearly all your movements as time ""spent awake"" and can give you a great understanding of how active you are in your sleep. , The different sleep states indicate your activity level while sleeping. These can be useful for people with sleep disorders and to understand how restful your sleep is. The frequency of your movement will also be used to calculate your ""Sleep efficiency"" which is calculated using the formula: 100* time asleep (time asleep + time restless + time awoken during sleep). A restful position would mean your movement is minimal and your tracker will indicate your body was fully asleep.
A restless state sleep will show up on your graph to indicate small movements common in tossing and turning.
If you move too much, your tracker may show you were awake, even if you weren't fully conscious and aware. This will show up in your sleep efficiency calculation as awake.

, All Fitbit devices except the Zip have a silent alarm option. This will gently wake up with a light buzzing on your wrist. This is great if you dread the blaring sound of alarms.

Sleep long and hard.,
Sleep in a dark and quiet room.,
Keep your temperature down.,
Exercise during the day.,
Eat and drink responsibly.,
Avoid alcohol, medication, and drugs.,
Avoid naps.",How to Get up in the Morning Feeling Fresh1," Adults should sleep 7-8 hours a night. Children and teenagers need closer to 9-11 hours of sleep. Getting more or less sleep than you need can cause you to wake up feeling sleepy. Your sleep should be consistent: avoid waking up at night if possible. You might need to get a little extra sleep if you have been sleep deprived, but try to generally keep the same bedtime and same waking up time.All adults need 7-8 hours of sleep, but older adults may need to spend more time in bed, and may need to take naps. As you grow older you will sleep more lightly, and wake up more frequently.
Infants and toddlers need 9-10 hours, plus roughly 3 hours of naptime.;
, Close the curtains if you live in a neighborhood with lots of streetlamps. Turn LED clocks away, computers and televisions off, and skip the nightlight. Avoid exposure to bright light in the hours before you sleep. Try reading a book instead of watching TV or using your computer before bed.Consider earplugs if your room is always noisy. Ask your neighbors and everyone who lives in your house to respect your bedtime and keep the volume down.Avoid looking at your phone before bed, as it exposes you to light and is likely to contain distractions that can keep you up.
Wear a sleep mask if you cannot keep your room dark enough in the morning.
Consider hanging blackout curtains for a deep dark effect.

, You will sleep more soundly if your body is cool and temperate. Being too warm or hot can disturb your sleep. Sleep in the nude if you can, as this will help your body naturally regulate its temperature.Keep a few layers of sheets and blankets on your bed, so you can adjust for warmth.


Regulate temperature with heat or air conditioning, but consider lowering the power. Your house may cool down naturally at night during the summer, and doesn't need to be as warm at night during the winter.
Your body does not need as much heat at night, as its core temperature lowers in your sleep., Dance, walk, ride a bike, or take yourself to the gym. Getting your daily exercise in will help your body rest at night. Do not, however, exercise in the two hours before you sleep, as your body will be too excited to rest. Gentle stretching is acceptable.


Being fit and healthy is a key part of sleeping well. Quit smoking, and avoid smoking before bedtime., Eat your final meal a few hours before you lie down, or earlier, if you are prone to stomach acid. Go to bed sated. Being hungry will disrupt your sleep. Drink plenty of water during the day, but do not try to compensate for a dry day right before bed. Drinking a lot before sleeping might make you wake up in the night for bathroom visits.


If you drink caffeine, avoid drinking it in the six hours before you sleep. Dark chocolate should also be avoided as an after-dinner dessert. Caffeine stays in your body for up to 12 hours, and can make it hard for you to sleep.Opt for herbal tea, warm milk, and other relaxing beverages in the evening.

, Try not to drink before bed. Alcohol at night can help you feel sleepy, but it actually interferes with the depth of your sleep.Many drugs will make it hard for you to sleep, including uppers and hallucinogens.


Sleep medication can interfere with your healthy sleeping patterns. Keep it to a minimum.If you do drink alcohol at night, drink plenty of water, at least a cup for every boozy drink you have. It's better to wake up in the night to visit the bathroom than to wake up in the morning with a hangover.

, Naps can interfere with your sleep routine. Long naps can make it especially difficult for you to settle down at night. When you do nap, during the day, try to keep it under 30 minutes. Mid afternoon is the time least likely to mess up your sleep schedule."

Alarm clocks raise stress and make you wake up stressed, not fresh.If you don't need to get up at a certain time, turn off your alarm.


If you have a week off of work, go the whole time without your alarm clock. Write down the times you wake up.
If you find that your natural sleep patterns are different than you had suspected, try adjusting your schedule to match it.
Avoid pressing the snooze button. Your body will not relax entirely into deep sleep when you press snooze, and you might wake up feeling more tired, not less.

, Sun and sunlight let your body know it's time to wake up. As soon as you wake up, open your curtains. Eat breakfast on your porch, if you have one, or by a window that lets in light. During the winter, try using a full-spectrum UV light on dark mornings., As soon as you wake up, drink a glass of water. Take a shower, put on clean clothing that you really enjoy, and eat a tasty, nutritious breakfast. Drink coffee if you are a coffee drinker. Massage your face to kickstart your circulation.Some studies suggest that waking up to bright colors or fresh flowers can boost your mood and energy.

Get to know your body’s internal clock.,
Try melatonin supplements.,
Wake up one minute earlier every day.Instead of making a drastic change overnight, this method will ease you into being a morning person.,
Stick to your new sleep/wake schedule on the weekends.If you want waking up earlier to become habitual for you, maintaining the same schedule on the weekend that you do during the week is a must!",How to Get up Earlier1," Set a specific bedtime for yourself that is eight hours before your alarm normally goes off. Continue this bedtime ritual for several weeks (including weekends). Over time you will start getting a good understanding of your body’s natural sleep requirements.


Keep a notebook next to the bed where you can log each day when you fell asleep, how easily you fell asleep, whether you woke up before your alarm went off or not - notate any and all information about your sleep/wake cycle.
After establishing your natural sleep patterns, you can start training your body to wake up earlier, since you'll know how much sleep your body naturally wants.;
, Our bodies make and secrete into our bloodstream a hormone called melatonin, which stimulates sleep and controls sleep/wake cycles.Melatonin supplements are available to buy over the counter at almost all pharmacies and grocery stores (look in the vitamins and supplements section). To help reset your body’s clock, try taking a low dose of melatonin (0.5 to 1.0 milligrams) approximately five hours before bedtime for several days in a row.


After a few days of this, your body will reset its internal clock, allowing you to get to sleep earlier and also wake up earlier the next day.
Melatonin supplements are generally considered safe for everyone, but always consult your physician before adding a new supplement to your daily intake, especially if you have any serious health conditions or take other medications., Determine what your new wake up time will be and set that as your goal. Keep your current wake up time, and start waking up earlier by one minute each day. Your body’s internal clock will begin to naturally reset itself.


For some, this method might seem too slow. However, keep in mind that the least jarring and most successful sleep schedule changes happen slowly and gradually., The continued repetition of a consistent sleep schedule will ensure that the habit of waking up earlier is established within your body’s internal clock.


Studies show that having a specific sleep schedule during the week and sleeping later on the weekend to recover can actually cause a person to feel tired and jet-lagged once the new week begins.This throws off all of the progress you made during the week!

That can make it harder for you to get up, especially if you hit snooze multiple times.Do your best to get out of bed as soon as possible after you wake up the first time.;
, If your alarms go off within several minutes of each other, you are more likely to wake up gradually. Waking up gradually is much healthier and more natural than waking up suddenly., By forcing yourself to get up and walk across the room to turn off the alarm clock, you will reduce the likelihood of going back to sleep afterwards. Being on your feet will increase your desire to get your day started.

, If your spouse or partner has to get up at the same time that you do, have them help you wake up. If you live alone, ask a friend or relative to call you to make sure that you're awake. This will help you avoid sleeping through your alarms.

, This will help you get your blood moving and provide an extra jolt to start your day.

, A short nap can help you feel refreshed and improve your mood if you’re sleep-deprived. Don’t nap for more than 10-30 minutes. Any longer than that can make you feel groggy afterward, and may also interfere with your nighttime sleep. Napping in the afternoon, around the midday dip, can help lower your blood pressure.Don’t take more than one power nap per day, as doing so can also interfere with your nighttime sleep.

, Since your internal clock is sensitive to light, you'll want to maximize the amount of light your body receives during the day to make sure you don't get drowsy. Sunlight is best, but any light is better than none.


Go outside periodically if possible to get fresh air and sunlight. Don't stay outside too long, though, especially on hot days, since overexposure to direct sunlight might make you tired.

, Too much heat can make even well-rested people feel drowsy. Keeping your office cold during the day can help you stay awake by stimulating your senses.

, Keep your body and mind active by engaging with others as much as possible. Talk to co-workers about work projects or topics you find mutually interesting. Take regular breaks to walk around your office or your house.

, You’ll sleep better over the long term if your brain associates a particular time of day with going to bed and waking up.Do this gradually by setting your bedtime back or forward 20 minutes every day until you hit your target. So if you typically go to bed between 11pm and midnight, but you want to go to bed at 10:30, try going to bed at 11:30pm the first night, then 11:10 the second night, and so on until you reach your goal.


If your job involves a lot of travel, try to go to bed at the same time for every time zone you’re in. So if you normally go to bed at 10:30 pm Eastern Standard Time but you travel to California, stay up until 10:30 pm Pacific Standard Time., This will help you calm down and get ready for bed. If you go to bed with a lot on your mind, you will likely sleep poorly.Avoid using your TV, computer, tablet, and phone for at least 1 hour before going to bed. These devices all produce a form of light that inhibits production of melatonin, which is the hormone that causes you to fall asleep.
You can find melatonin supplements in most drugstores. These are generally safe for short- and long-term use, but you should still talk with your doctor before using them., While drinking alcohol can make you feel sleepy, you will not sleep well as a result of drinking. That’s because alcohol reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is the part of sleep in which dreams occur and a critical part of the sleep cycle.This disturbance usually happens in the second half of the sleep cycle. As a result, you are not aware of it until you wake up tired.

, Caffeine can harm sleep patterns if consumed within 10-12 hours of going to bed.Even decaffeinated coffee and tea can still include small amounts of caffeine. Therefore, if you are particularly sensitive to caffeine, avoid all forms of coffee and tea after lunch.


If you smoke tobacco, don’t smoke within several hours of bedtime. Like caffeine, nicotine is also a stimulant.

, Light from nighttime sources like the moon or streetlights can keep you awake, especially if you are a light sleeper.


Hang blackout curtains over your windows.
Better yet, put your bed in a windowless room.

, If your brain associates your bedroom with non-sleep related activities like watching TV, doing work, or exercising, it will be harder for you to establish healthy sleep patterns.A good way to accomplish this goal is to put your bed in the smallest room you can.

, If decent sleep proves especially elusive over the long term, you may need to find out if you suffer from a sleep disorder.


Don’t use sleeping pills unless under strict medical supervision.

, Not only will this give you time to mend a hole in your favorite pants or iron a shirt, but it will give you time to decide if it's the right outfit for the day's events. The kids can even pick out their clothes before bed, giving them a sense of accomplishment when they get ready faster in the morning, and giving you time to approve of their dress.

, If an item needs to be kept cold, you can still get it ready; just stick it in the fridge overnight and pop it into the appropriate bag in the morning. Get duplicates of items (like bottles or formula for diaper bags) so you have enough for the house and the bag.

, If your coffee machine has a timer, use it; otherwise, all you will have to do is press the ""on"" button. You can make a pitcher of iced coffee ahead of time. Keep a to-go cup near the coffee pot so you can fill it and go.

Avoid caffeine and alcohol the night before.,
Get enough sleep.,
Learn your personalized sleep cycle.,
Adjust your sleep cycle with lighting cues.,
Keep your sleep patterns consistent on weekends.,
Prepare your morning the night before.",How to Get out of Bed when You Really Can't1," Substances like coffee and liquor stay in our bodies for a long time-- anywhere from 3-8 hours. This can profoundly affect your ability to fall asleep and to enter deep sleep, which will make you groggy in the morning. Avoid caffeine in the afternoons and evenings to make sure it is out of your system when you go to sleep.
Drink alcohol in moderation and with plenty of water, as getting out of bed is doubly hard when you have a hangover.;
, Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep every night, children 8-9 hours, and toddlers and infants much more. If you are not getting enough sleep the night before then you will always feel tired when you try to wake up. Refer to the graph, but know that not everyone is the same... , Waking up in the middle of your REM cycle will leave you exhausted, and it is tough to get yourself out of bed when you were just in a deep sleep. Luckily, your body naturally begins to wake up several hours before you actually get out of bed, and if you can sync this process up with your alarm clock you will find getting out of bed much easier. To learn your sleep pattern:


Set a time to go to sleep every night for two weeks. Use a time, like vacation, when you do not need to get up at a specific time in the morning.
Go to sleep at the same time every single night, including weekends.
Make a note of the moment you wake up, even if it is before your alarm goes off.
Continue going to bed at the exact same time until you begin waking up at a consistent time.
Count the hours between this time and your bedtime, and you'll know how long your body's natural sleep cycle is. Start timing your alarm so you wake up when your body wants to. , While our sleep patterns are largely genetic, we can do several small things to make our body adapt to a new sleep pattern. The number one trigger for sleep is light. As light fades at night, our body produces melatonin, which naturally makes us sleepy. And when we see or feel sunlight in the morning our body is triggered to wake-up naturally and stop melatonin production.


At night, work with dimmed lights and try not to use bright smartphone or laptop screens before going to sleep, as bright light stops melatonin production.
Crack your curtains open or step outside quickly when you wake up. The sunlight tells your body to get started with the day.

, Resist the urge to sleep in on the weekends, as it disrupts your body's natural cycle and makes it much harder to get up on Monday. Your body expects to get up at certain hours, but if you change those hours frequently it can lead to sleep issues and difficulty getting out of the covers on work days.


The more consistent your can keep your sleep schedule, the easier it will be to get up.
Most humans can only adjust their sleep schedules an hour or so a day, so try to avoid rapidly changing bedtimes., Keep a pair of slippers and a warm robe by your bed, grind coffee, and organize your bag the night before so that you can focus on waking up, not on the chores you have to do. Just knowing that coffee is only a button press away can make a big difference on your desire to get out of bed.

"
"
Avoid stimulants 4 to 6 hours before bed.,
Go to sleep earlier.Set a specific bed time – and stick to it!,
Set your alarm clock.,
Manipulate your environment.Try buying a coffee machine with a timer so that you can set it to have your coffee ready when you wake up.Keeping a warm fuzzy bathrobe right next to the bed can be helpful on a chilly morning - you can slip it on as soon as you get up, increasing your chances of actually staying up rather than crawling back under those warm blankets.

,
Create an urgency.",How to Get up Earlier2," This may seem like a no-brainer, but some of us use stimulants like coffee so often that we don’t even think twice about having that afternoon cup of joe. If you consume caffeine within 4 to 6 hours before going to bed, it will still be in your system when you’re trying to fall asleep that night.It can keep you awake much later than you intended, and therefore make waking up on time very difficult.


Alcohol should also be avoided prior to bedtime. It is classified as a depressant, but it actually depends on the amount of alcohol consumed and how quickly it was consumed. If you drink beyond what your body can handle and become drunk, the alcohol acts as a depressant on your system. However, if you only have a drink or two, alcohol acts as a stimulant on your system – this is the “buzzed” feeling people talk about., If you’re a night owl and have trouble falling asleep early, try exercising during the day – this can help you fall asleep more easily at night, especially when you are trying to get to sleep earlier than your usual bedtime. However, don’t exercise an hour or less before bed, or you’ll be pumped up!


If you’re still having trouble getting to sleep, try winding down before bed by taking a warm bath or shower before hitting the sack.If you know you are trying to get to bed early that night, definitely avoid taking naps during the day.Stop using televisions, laptops and cell phones one hour before bed. Not only can these devices distract you and keep you up, they can also affect the quality of your sleep if used immediately before bed. Shut them off and power them down to avoid temptation.

, Make sure you set your alarm clock for the correct wake up time and double check it right before you get in bed. Instead of putting it right next to you on the night stand, place it on your dresser across the room or somewhere else out of your immediate reach.This forces you to wake up and get out of bed to turn it off.


If you are a heavy sleeper and have trouble waking up with a single alarm, get multiple alarms! Place them in different parts of your room, and stagger the alarm times to go off a few minutes apart from one another.
Make good alarm sound choices.If you are hard to wake, make sure your alarm sound is loud and repetitive. If shrill alarm sounds tend to make you pound your fist into the snooze button and fall immediately back to sleep, try getting an alarm that starts off quietly and gradually gets louder.

,, Schedule a very important task for the next morning that forces you to wake up on time. This can be an appointment or any other kind of scheduled task that requires you to be on time. This will motivate you to get up early the next morning, whether you feel like it or not!


A simpler approach to creating an urgency is to drink a full glass of water right before you go to sleep. When your alarm goes off the next morning, your bladder will compel you to jump right out of bed!

"
"
Avoid hitting the snooze button.Disable the button if your clock has the capability.,
Jump out of bed – literally!Even if you don’t feel like it, give it a try.,
Take strong deep breaths immediately upon waking.When we wake up in the morning, we experience a feeling of brain sluggishness before our brains return to full functionality.,
Expose yourself to bright light immediately.Whether you throw open your curtains to let the sunlight in or turn on artificial indoor lighting, bright lights will instantly make you feel more awake.,
Drink a large glass of water.When you wake up, you are dehydrated from not drinking any water all night long.,
Reward yourself.When we are trying to establish a new habit, rewarding successes along the way can really help make that habit stick.",How to Get up Earlier3," Habitually hitting snooze will create a habit that can be very difficult to break. Set your alarm somewhere across the room, out of your immediate reach, so that you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off.

, Leap out of bed enthusiastically and spread your arms wide as if to say, “I am so ready for today! Bring it on!” It sounds silly, but it really does work (even if it just makes you giggle).

, During sleep we breathe very slowly, resulting in a lower amount of oxygen hitting our system than what our fully awake bodies are used to running on. Getting our brains back up to full speed depends on the time it takes for the body to inhale enough oxygen to get all of our processes going. Taking some big, deep breaths will get oxygen flowing faster, allowing your brain to fully wake up and reboot before you fall back asleep!

, Doing this consistently can also help you to reset your internal clock to accept your new earlier wake up time.

, Dehydration can make you feel very tired. As soon as you wake up, drink a tall glass of water. You’ll rehydrate your body and feel instantly more awake., Every time you successfully wake up early, reward yourself! It doesn’t have to be a big deal, but do choose something that is genuinely rewarding to you, whether that’s coffee, your favorite breakfast, or putting on your favorite music.

Move your alarm clock away from the bed.,
Drink a glass of water.,
Stretch your muscles.,
Make yourself cold.,
Splash your face with water.,
Plan your morning.,
Start doing something immediately.",How to Get out of Bed when You Really Can't2," Make yourself get up and out of bed to turn off your alarm. This gives you no choice but to wake up and turn off the noise, and once you are out of bed it is much easier to stay out of it.


Set your alarm to go off with upbeat music. Most phones can use any song as an alarm, and many alarm clocks can use the radio to wake you up.
If you are still having trouble, try buying a natural light alarm clock, which wakes you up with light instead of sound. , Drinking a glass of water replenishes the water you lost from sweating and exhaling during the night and is proven to kickstart your metabolism, making it much easier to get your body moving in the morning. Put a full cup of water by your bed before you go to sleep so that it is ready in the morning.
Chewing mint or citrus flavored gum may also lead to faster feelings of alertness. , This needs to be more than just arching your back and yawning. Sit up and touch your toes, pull your knees to your chest, and do some light yoga if you are really struggling. Stretching forces blood to move throughout your body and into your brain, waking you up quickly but gradually.


Find the exercises and stretches that work for you and do them every morning. , One of the most common reasons why we feel groggy or drowsy is because we are too warm. Warmth, like sleep, slows down our metabolism and our mind, so throw the covers off, remove a layer of clothes, or open a window when you need to get up. Do this when you wake up, not when you sleep, as feeling cold can prevent you from having a good night's rest.

, Abrupt but certainly effective, splashing cold water on your face is a surefire way to make you alert and ready to tackle the day. Just remember that it may not be very pleasant.

, Think about what you need to do that morning and make a mental list of your tasks. More importantly, recognize why these tasks are important and why waking up to do them is important. , The longer you lay in bed, trying to muster up the ability to get out of bed, the harder it will be. But if you begin a task you are forced to begin your day, and the temptation to stay in bed will melt away. Make your bed, do some exercises, or start cooking breakfast right away to get your mind kickstarted and ready for the morning.


If you are still struggling, start with an activity you can do in bed, like reading a book or responding to emails.

Start the night before.,
Get up and get moving.,
Exercise before breakfast.,
Eat a healthy breakfast.",How to Begin the Day1," The first step to beginning the day the right way is ending the previous night the right way. Without sufficient restful sleep and some night-before planning for the morning ahead, your chances of getting your day off to a great start are much reduced.


Do as much of your morning preparation as possible the night before. Lay out your clothes, prepare your breakfast and lunch, or at least set your menu. Pack your bag and keep your coat, keys, etc. in the same place so you don’t need to hunt for them. Save your morning time for preparing your body and mind for the day ahead, instead of hunting for your wallet in the couch cushions.For more detailed information on night-before preparation, including determining the right bedtime, reducing screen time, and putting your body into sleep mode, visit How to Be a Morning Person.;
, Your day can’t really begin until you manage to get out of bed. It is typically best to get out of bed as soon as possible after waking up, and set up roadblocks against the urge to climb back under the covers.


Actually rising from bed properly, by stretching your spine, then each arm and leg, all while breathing slowly and deeply before sitting then standing, can get you off to a good start.Simple steps like locating your alarm clock so that you have to walk across the room to shut it off, splashing water on your face, or making the bed can help get and keep you up and moving. Again, you can consult How to Be a Morning Person for more details.
Leaving the room to drink a glass of water can prove doubly effective, as it gets you away from the bed and helps counteract nighttime dehydration, which can cause a lethargic body and mind., We all intend to exercise more frequently, but the later in the day you plan your exercise time, the more likely it will be bumped aside by a backlog of work or plain old exhaustion. Take care of it first, before your daily responsibilities start piling up.


Exercising first thing after waking up (and before eating) not only shakes off any grogginess, it also kick-starts your metabolism for the day.Even if an early morning jog, bike ride, or kickboxing session isn’t in the cards for you, taking 10 to 15 minutes doing some simple yoga poses offers health benefits and helps prepare both body and mind for the day ahead., Your mother always said it was the most important meal of the day, and your food choices in the morning can indeed shape your eating habits (and how you feel) throughout the day. A good breakfast gives you more energy and focus, as opposed to when your stomach feels like an empty pit or is stuffed to the gills with unhealthy junk.Smart breakfast choices can include Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and flax seeds, oatmeal with dried fruit, or a vegetable omelet, among many others. Good, nutritious, quick breakfast recipes can be found easily online.
Some people advocate for eating the same healthy breakfast (like that veggie omelet) every day, which cuts down on the time spent thinking about what to have for breakfast and then making it.
If the notion of having the same breakfast every morning can’t pass muster with you, cycling through several healthy options each day may be a beneficial compromise.

Move your alarm clock so you have to get out of bed to turn it off, the first time you hear it.;
, Our brain expects us to get up in the early morning, bathed in bright, bluish light. If this is roughly the time you wake up, keep the curtains open so your body doesn't think it's night. Otherwise, consider purchasing a dawn-simulating alarm clock. This will gradually increase the light levels in the room before your alarm goes off, which helps you wake up alert and happy.""Full spectrum"" fluorescent lights are a cheaper option, but do not mimic morning light all that well.It might still be worth replacing incandescent or regular fluorescent light bulbs in your bedroom, especially if you can set it to turn on about thirty minutes before you wake up.

, Drink a glass of water to rehydrate yourself after a dry night.

, Not only will brushing your teeth keep them clean, the minty flavor in your mouth will wake you up. To make the most of this, brush your teeth for at least 2 minutes, floss, then rinse with mouthwash. You should start feeling a little bit more awake by now.


Chewing gum may keep you alert for similar reasons, plus the physical activity of keeping your jaws moving.Mouthwash that contains alcohol may dry out your mouth, and potentially increases risk of cancer.Stick to alcohol-free mouthwash instead.

, Washing the sleep out of your eyes and all the sweat off of your face will help refresh you and wake you up. If you tend to feel alert after a shower, make that part of your morning routine.

, Exercising will get your blood flowing and loosen stiff muscles. There's no need to run a mile; one study found that low-intensity exercise actually made people more alert than a moderate workout, at least if they weren't used to a fitness routine already.Spend twenty minutes on a gentle walk or yoga, or fit in five minutes if you're pressed for time.


Exercising outdoors may wake you up more quickly, due to the cold, fresh air. Open the windows or stand in a cold fan to get this effect indoors.

, If most of your breakfast is coffee or sugary cereal, you're setting yourself up for a crash. Ramp yourself up to lasting energy with a breakfast of protein, carbohydrates, and fruit or vegetables. Here are some examples:


Steel-cut oatmeal topped with fruit and nuts
Yogurt, low-sugar bran cereal, and a glass of orange juice

Omelette or scrambled eggs with veggies, wrapped in a hot tortilla
If you're in a rush or don't enjoy eating breakfast, make a smoothie the night before and store it in the fridge. Include fruit, yogurt, and green vegetables (or vegetable powder).

, Music or an audiobook stimulates your brain. Turn it on as you go about your morning routine.You can even use a radio alarm or online ""podcast alarm"" to wake up to something less obnoxious than beeping.

, Nothing makes your pillow more enticing than a morning spent reading emails or traffic reports. Make yourself happy to be awake by listening to a favorite podcast or radio station. If that's too passive for you, solve a crossword or sudoku, or play a video game.

, Get enough sleep tonight so you're ready to go tomorrow. Most people need at least eight hours of sleep a night, and many children and teenagers need nine to eleven hours to stay alert.This is time spent actually sleeping, not fighting insomnia. Learn how to sleep comfortably to make your nights and mornings easier.
Sticking to a consistent sleep schedule will help you sleep deeply and wake up fresh. To catch up on your sleep debt on the weekend, try going to bed earlier instead of sleeping in.

, Caffeine increases alertness and brain activity, but individuals have major differences in tolerance levels. Generally, starting your morning with 75–100mg of caffeine (about one mug of coffee) is a good starting point. Drink less (or none) if you experience unpleasant jittery sensations, muscle tremors, or a major crash after the caffeine wears out. Drink more if you don't notice an effect.


Caffeine helps you function faster and push through relatively easy tasks. It won't make difficult tasks easier or help you find solutions to complex problems.Teenagers and young adults should stick to 100mg of caffeine a day, while most adults can handle up to 400mg spaced throughout the day.Note that these are recommended maximum limits, and that a lower dose may have better effects on your mood and energy level.

, Most people who regularly drink coffee or tea feel an oncoming mood boost within minutes of starting their beverage. The full energy boost, however, usually takes 45–60 minutes to reach its maximum, then peters out over the next 3–6 hours.This varies a great deal between individuals, but it's a good estimate to keep in mind. If you don't drink coffee until you show up to work, you may still be groggy for that morning meeting.


In theory, a small hourly dose (e.g. 20mg or 1/5 a mug of coffee) may give a more steady boost and less extreme crash. One study suggests this increase brain function but not a feeling of alertness, at least in sleep-deprived people., Many other substances affect how your body processes caffeine. Know what these are so you can maximize the energy you receive, or reduce it to a more mellow buzz:


Sugar might increase the effects of caffeine.However, too much sugar (including sweet coffee drinks) leads to a severe crash in energy levels once it runs out.
Grapefruit juice may prolong the effects of caffeine, although this isn't certain.Note that grapefruit juice can have dangerous effects on many other medications, so check those warning labels.
If you take echinacea, theophylline (found in bronchodilators), or some antibiotic medication, caffeine may have a more extreme effect. This includes the unpleasant symptoms such as nausea and jitteriness, so keep caffeine consumption low.Nicotine speeds up caffeine metabolism, getting it out of your system sooner.Consider replacing smoking with caffeine for a longer-lasting energy boost, with less dangerous side effects.

, Some people can drink caffeine in the evening with no ill effects, while others can't fall asleep if they had a cup of tea six hours before.If you sleep restlessly, try limiting all your caffeine intake to before lunchtime. Withdrawal is another symptom that only occurs in some people, but is worth watching out for. If you experience headaches or drowsiness at some point in the12–48 hours after you've last had caffeine, decrease the amount of caffeine you take each day. After a few days, you should be back at the point where you can use caffeine as an alertness booster, instead of a necessity for reaching normal function., The healthy routine described above is vital if you want to reap the benefits every day. Relying on caffeine to replace sleep or a healthy breakfast leaves you groggy and irritable. At best, you'll end up functional for a few hours, then exhausted for the afternoon and evening. Make caffeine one of several allies to get you through the morning, not your master.

Open the curtains.,
Turn on the lights.,
Use aromatherapy.,
Organize your space.,
Play music.",How to Feel More Awake Without Coffee1," The environment around us often plays a big role in how alert we are. Natural sunlight can improve your mood even when you suffer from seasonal mood changes. We are ingrained so that natural light makes us feel like we should be awake. Try to change your workspace or environment to incorporate natural light. , If you don't have access to natural light, even turning on the lights can make you feel more awake. Dim lighting promotes fatigue and signals to our body that it is time to go to sleep. By turning on the lights, you can make yourself more alert and awake.

, It's probably not the first thing you think of, but engaging your senses with aromatherapy is a proven way to become more awake. Certain scents such as peppermint, rosemary, eucalyptus or citrus-y scents can make you feel re energized and focused. Buy a candle or air freshener of these particular scents to rev up your environment.
You can also buy essential oils from a health food store and dab a few drops underneath your nose.
Stay away from lavender, vanilla and jasmine. These are all very soothing scents that promote sleepiness and relaxation. , A messy or disorganized space can really drag you down. Having a clean space can make you feel proactive and less tired.Try clearing out your space and see how that affects your tiredness level. , Having music in the background of whatever you are doing is a great way to stimulate your brain. Studies have found that music can make you feel happier and increase your productivity. If you are not distracted by music, try putting on some energetic tracks. If words distract you too much, play instrumental music or nature sounds. Tap your feet. Following along with the music, even just a little bit, engages your body and will help you feel more alert and in the moment.
Nature sounds can act as white noise that will stop you from getting distracted by what is going on around you. Because you will be more focused, you will also feel more present and awake.

Try a breathing relaxation exercise.,
Do a focused mindfulness exercise.,

Focus on your breath.,
Go to sleep at the same time every night.,
Take a warm bath before bed.,
Turn the lights down an hour before bedtime.,
Avoid looking at interactive screens before bed.",How to Unwind for Bed1," As you lie in bed, draw your attention to your inhales and your exhales. Breathe in through your nose, and feel the air entering your body. Don’t worry about relaxation while you breathe in.Try visualizing your body relaxing as you breathe out. Notice anywhere you feel yourself holding tension.
Breathe in again, and only pay attention to your breath. You don’t have to worry about relaxing during inhalations.
As you exhale, feel yourself relaxing again. If you’ve found tension in any part of your body, intentionally allow that area to relax.
Repeat the process for as long as you need to.;
, As you lie in bed, imagine the outline of your body. Slowly trace your body’s outline in your head. Feel the way your body feels against the bed. Feel the way your head feels against the pillow. Then move your attention down your body, one body part at a time.Move your attention down one arm, all the way to your hand, finishing at the end of your fingers. Then repeat the same attention, moving down your other arm.
Notice anyplace in your body that feels active, and try to relax any tightness that you’re holding there.
Don’t worry about falling asleep before you finish this exercise.

, Sipping a hot cup of herbal tea can be a good way to unwind, both for its relaxing herbal properties and the routine of enjoying a warm beverage. An hour or so before bedtime, bring fresh cold water to a rolling boil. Pour the hot water over your herbal tea bag, and allow it to steep for 5-10 minutes.Passionflower and chamomile teas have relaxation properties.
Valerian root tea helps the symptoms of anxiety. You may still have worried thoughts, but the valerian tea may help calm the physical symptoms of anxiety such as tense muscles or rapid breathing.
Be careful to avoid any caffeine before bedtime, which could interfere with your rest. If your tea is clearly labeled as “herbal” it’s unlikely to contain caffeine.

, Deep breathing slows the heart rate and calms your body as you lay in bed. Start by breathing in through your nose, drawing your complete attention to the feeling of the air as it enters your nostrils. Keep paying attention as your breath enters your lungs.When your breath has found the very base of your lungs, pause. Notice the pause, and then start to release your breath.
Release your breath slowly, paying close attention to the air as it leaves your body.
You can choose to mentally count each breath, starting at 1 and ending at 10. When you reach 10, start again (if you’re still awake!)

, Your body will come to expect the routine of relaxing in bed at the same time every night. If you get up at the same time, this will help you be sleepy at bedtime. If you sleep later, you’re unlikely to be tired in the evening.If you’re struggling with insomnia, stay awake later so that you’re more likely to go to sleep when you go to bed.
You can understand this if you think about the way you’re probably hungry at about the same time every day. You’ve trained your body to expect meals in the morning, noon-ish, and again in the evening. Sleep can work in the same way

, A warm bath raises your core body temperature, which aids sleep. A bath helps your muscles relax. Your body will expect to go to sleep.Add bubbles or bath oils if they help you relax.
Showers tend to wake you up. If you’re working on unwinding before bed, take baths at night and showers in the morning.

, Keeping your lights low will help trigger the release of melatonin, a body chemical associated with sleep. When you’re in brighter room light, your body will suppress the production of melatonin to keep you awake and alert.One reason that candlelight is relaxing is because of the dim light.
To unwind, turn down your lights. Turn off unnecessary lights, and try to use traditional incandescent bulbs rather than fluorescent or LED bulbs.

, Scrolling through social media sites only keeps your body alert. In addition, exposure to the light from a screen affects your body’s ability to produce melatonin, a hormone associated with sleep.Computers, tablets, and phones all produce more blue light than other colors.
Evening and nighttime exposure to blue lights have strong association with the development of cancer, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.
Using dim red lights for night lights will help your body stay calm. Red light has the least ability to interfere with your body’s production of melatonin, a hormone associated with sleep.

Review your medications.",How to Feel Awake in the Morning," That old saying, “you snooze, you lose,” has some basis of truth when it comes to understanding the difficulty you have waking up when relying on that snooze button.You are likely putting yourself back into a deeper stage of sleep that is even more difficult to wake up from, even though you are only trying to get a few extras minutes of sleep.
The best stage to wake from is stage 1. This is the stage of sleep when you are sleeping less deeply than the other stages, and is the easiest stage to wake from with a greater feeling of alertness.
Stage 1 sleep usually occurs at the beginning of a sleep cycle and is sometimes referred to as relaxed wakefulness. Often people that are awakened during stage 1 sleep will think they have not yet fallen asleep.
By hitting the snooze button, you are starting your sleep cycle over. The stage 1 part passes in just a few minutes at which point you are entering stages of sleep that are harder to wake from.;
, Just because your feet are on the floor and your eyes are open, does not mean that your brain is awake.Everybody has a foggy, draggy, feeling for a few minutes to several hours after getting up in the morning. This is the time it takes for your brain to wake up.
This is called sleep inertia and it is perfectly normal.
Your brainstem wakes up as your eyes open and your feet hit the floor. This is the part of the brain that regulates basic physiological functions.
Your cortical regions, including your prefrontal cortex, take a little longer to get going. These areas of your brain are responsible for decision making, planning, reaction time, mental performance, subjective alertness, attentiveness, self-control, and overall executive functions.
Research studies have documented the time range for sleep inertia to be from one or two minutes to four hours, depending on the person and the variables regarding their sleep.

, Sleep inertia can be manipulated so that you have shorter episodes every day.You can shorten the amount of time that you stay in a state of sleep inertia by manipulating some of your sleep variables.
The most important variable to reduce your sleep inertia is to take steps to manipulate your body so that you consistently wake up in stage 1 sleep.
Another critical variable is getting the right amount of sleep for your body.
Research shows that using a standard alarm clock to wake up increases your odds of being awakened in a stage of deeper sleep thus contributing to longer periods of sleep inertia.

, Zeitgebers are cues that your brain responds to specifically to regulate your natural circadian rhythm.The best zeitgeber, or cue, to help adjust your circadian and sleep rhythm, reduce sleep inertia, and wake up feeling more alert in the morning, is timely exposure to natural light.
When it starts to get dark, your brain releases a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin helps your body relax and prepare for sleep.
In the morning when your eyes are exposed to natural light, the natural release of melatonin is stopped and your body and your brain wake up.
Improve your sleep quality and waking ability by increasing your exposure to more natural light throughout the day, but especially around dawn if at all possible.
Your circadian rhythm and other biological clocks or natural schedules are regulated from one primary source in your brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The main nerves that connect to the suprachiasmatic nucleus are located just above the optic nerve., Avoid substituting artificial light sources. Artificial light does not produce the same critical signals to the brain to help reduce your sleep inertia and reset your circadian rhythms.One researcher reviewed melatonin levels in a small study group that were having trouble with lengthy sleep inertia. Melatonin levels were measured and were found to begin the initial increase around 10:30 pm, about two hours before bedtime. The study subjects would experience a reduction in melatonin the following morning around 8 am.
The study subjects were then exposed to an outdoor camping situation for 7 days. At the end of the camping trip, the melatonin levels were measured again and found to be increasing just after dusk, and were reducing just prior to dawn.
The researcher concluded that the exposure to natural light, and the absence of artificial light and alarm clocks, allowed the subjects’ brains and bodies to naturally reset their circadian rhythms. The sleep inertia problems were completely resolved by the end of the 7 days.

, Believe it or not, “there’s an app for that.” Smartphones have several different apps that you can use to help wake you up while you are in stage 1 sleep.Some apps work by attempting to determine the stage of sleep you are in by monitoring your body movements. This requires placing the phone a certain way on the mattress and provides for a target wake-up time which varies based on the readings from the app.
Other available technologies use headbands to determine brainwave activity and wakes you when you are in the lighter stages of sleep.

, To balance the melatonin response in your body, some alarms have been designed in the form of lamps.The alarm lamps use wavelengths of light that mimic natural daylight. Prior to your designated alarm time, the lamp begins by emitting low levels of light which gradually increase as your alarm time approaches. This helps to make your brain think it is daytime.
Many available lamps use blue wavelengths of light which more naturally mimic natural light sources. Regular artificial lighting does not work. Artificial lighting does not send the same messages to your brain to wake up or help with regulating your sleep-wake cycle.

, In addition to the non-traditional methods available as morning alarms, you may also want to calculate the time to go to sleep and to set your alarm based on standard sleep cycles.The standard sleep cycle is 90 minutes in length. Setting your alarm device, whatever you select, with 90-minute sleep intervals in mind, can help to minimize the amount of sleep inertia you experience.
Once you fall asleep, your first 90-minute cycle begins. It may take some effort to determine the number of hours of sleep your body needs each night, but once you know that number you can use the amount of sleep you need in combination with the 90 minute sleep cycle time frame to optimize your sleep quality.
Figure out your best bedtime by doing the math in reverse. Start with the time you need to get up each morning and calculate in reverse using 90-minute sleep cycles to determine your best bedtime.
Be sure you allow yourself time to fall asleep. Use your knowledge regarding the number of hours of sleep your body needs to optimize the quality of your sleep, minimize sleep inertia and get up in the mornings feeling more awake, alert, and ready to face the day.

, Every person’s needs are different.There are published guidelines available based on age, which is a great place to start, but you may need to take additional steps to determine your exact needs.
Perform a simple sleep test. It will likely take more than one night to determine the results of this test. The next opportunity that you have to sleep in for a few days — a long weekend or a vacation — is your chance to perform this test. You may need several nights in a row to get the best results.
Go to bed at a time you would like to be your normal bedtime. Resist staying up late even though you can sleep in the next day. Get accurate results from the test by sticking with a routine bedtime each night.
Do not set an alarm clock. Sleep until you wake up naturally. The first night you will probably sleep for a very long time, maybe even 16 hours or more. This is because you are likely experiencing ""sleep debt.""
Once your sleep debt is taken care of, continue to go to bed at the same time each night, never setting an alarm. After a few days, you will naturally wake up at about the same time each morning. By calculating how long you slept (if you fall asleep at 10 pm and wake up at 7 am, then you slept for eight hours), you know how much sleep you need each night.

, Sleep debt occurs when you fail to get the amount of sleep your body needs (going to bed early and waking up early, etc.). It accumulates over time, putting you deeper and deeper into debt.You are adding minutes or hours to your sleep debt every time you cut your night’s sleep a little short. This can occur in both the short term and over months.
You can repay your short-term sleep debt by adding an hour or so to each night’s sleep (going to bed early or sleeping later if possible) or by taking a nap.
This means that you need to keep track of the hours of sleep you lost, therefore you need to know how much sleep you need.

, Longer term sleep debt accumulations may take several weeks, or even longer to pay back and get back on track.Take a vacation with nothing on your schedule, then go to bed at the same time every night and sleep every morning until you wake up naturally.
Don’t beat yourself up for sleeping a lot during this vacation. Just pay back your sleep debt and get back on a regular schedule.
Once you have repaid your debt and you stick to a regular bedtime, you will reach a point where you no longer need that alarm clock in the mornings. This is provided that your bedtime is early enough to allow your body to get the exact amount of sleep it requires.
Not everyone fits in the standard eight hours of sleep. Your body may require a little more sleep or a little less.
If you have caught up on your sleep debt and you still feel fatigued during the day and have trouble waking up and getting out of bed, then you may have an underlying medical problem or medication that is contributing to the problem. Make an appointment with your doctor to figure out what is causing your fatigue.

, Keep your room at a cool temperature and make sure you are able to make it dark at night, either with blackout curtains or a sleeping mask. Use earplugs or a fan to block out external noises Use your bed for sleep and sex only. Don't use your bed for things like studying, reading, playing video games, using any device with a screen (laptop, smartphone, tablet, etc.), and watching television.
Be sure your mattress is supportive and comfortable. If you share the bed, make sure there is room for both people to sleep comfortably. Try not to let children or pets sleep in your bed as they can be disruptive.

, Eating a healthy diet helps your body to function more efficiently in all areas including a healthy sleep cycle, but there are some specific things you can do to help improve your sleep quality.Avoid heavy meals late at night and just before bedtime, and avoid going to bed hungry.
Don't drink too many fluids before bed or you may have to get up in the night to use the bathroom, disrupting your sleep.
Limit your intake of caffeine. Don't drink caffeinated beverages after 2 pm.
Stop smoking or avoid smoking close to bedtime. Nicotine acts like a stimulant and can prevent you from falling asleep.
Avoid consuming alcohol close to bedtime. Even if you ""pass out"" from alcohol, you won't actually be getting quality sleep.

, Exercising, exposure to sunlight, and napping can all contribute to how well you sleep at night.Exercise according to recommended guidelines. This includes at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. Exercise routines during the daytime or early evening and avoid exercising right before bed. Exercising first thing in the morning can help you feel energized and awake.
The link between proper exercise and sleep is well-documented. Studies have shown that moderate aerobic exercise, such as walking, can significantly reduce the amount of time that individuals with insomnia take to fall asleep compared to no exercise at all.Take advantage of daytime natural light exposure. Sunlight stimulates your body to produce vitamin D and helps to regulate your sleep-wake cycle. Try to get sunlight during the day and avoid it in the later hours.
If you need a nap, try to limit the nap to 20 to 30 minutes in the mid-afternoon.

, The light from television and the screens of smartphones and other devices can stimulate you and keep you awake, so instead find other activities that relax you, like reading, meditating, journaling, or knitting.


Consider taking a warm bath or shower, or listening to soothing music or nature sounds. Whatever works for you is great. If possible, try to lower the lights during your relaxation time.
Develop healthy ways to relieve stress. Give yourself permission to take breaks throughout the day to relax, talk about something fun, and enjoy a laugh with friends. By managing your stress during the day, you are helping to relieve that build-up of things to worry about just before bed.

, Go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, including weekends and holidays. Don't give in to the temptation to stay up late and sleep in the next day.Even if you do not feel tired or sleepy, try maintaining your scheduled bedtime. If you have difficulty falling asleep quickly for several nights then you may need to adjust your bedtime.
There are different ideas about when you should go to sleep — some guidelines suggest you go to sleep only when you start feeling sleepy, while others say stick to your schedule. However, it is possible that you won't feel tired at first, but climbing into bed at the same time each night will trigger your body to feel sleepy.
If it takes you longer than 15 minutes to fall asleep, get up and do something relaxing for a few minutes, like reading, then try again. If you continue to lay in bed, you may begin stressing about not being able to fall asleep, which will just keep you awake.
Avoid watching the clock. Try not to think about going to sleep or when you have to get up. Meditate, think positive thoughts, or use visual imagery to picture yourself somewhere relaxing.

, There are practical things you can do once you are awake to help you feel more positive about the day and more refreshed.One of the best ways to get going in the morning is to have a good laugh. Enjoy your favorite early morning radio shows that incorporate fun into their morning shows.
You can also listen to upbeat music, get some fresh air, take a shower, or enjoy the smell of breakfast cooking, even if you have to cook it yourself.
Coffee and energy drinks can also help, although those beverages contain caffeine. Check with your doctor to be sure you are not overdoing the caffeine each morning and throughout the day.

, There may be an underlying medical reason that is making it difficult for you to fall asleep or get restful sleep. You may have an illness or medical condition, or it may be related to medications you are taking.Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to difficult sleeping or waking up feeling unrefreshed. Examples of problems that may need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist include depression, insomnia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic sleep disorder, and problems with nightmares or other emotionally disturbing sleep problems.
Other medical conditions that are commonly related to sleep problems include sleep apnea, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, chronic pain, restless leg syndrome, COPD and other breathing related disorders, allergies, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, GERD, and multiple sclerosis.
Some sleep problems are caused by disorders directly related to sleep. Examples of these disorders include circadian rhythm sleep disorders, delayed phase sleep problems, narcolepsy, cataplexy, sleep walking, sleep talking, REM sleep disorders, and shift work sleep disorder.

, Some symptoms of sleep disorders include excessive sleepiness during the day, lingering fatigue, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep, difficulty sleeping when you are tired and it is time for sleep, and abnormal sleep behaviors, which can include things like sleep talking and walking in your sleep.Talk with your doctor as soon as you notice you are having trouble sleeping. Your doctor will help you understand why you aren't sleeping well and can help treat the cause of your sleep problems.

, Many medications can cause either excessive sleepiness, fatigue, problems waking up refreshed, and problems with getting enough sleep.Do not adjust your medications on your own. If you think a medication is causing or contributing to your problem, talk to your doctor. In many cases, the dose can be adjusted or another drug can be prescribed in place of the medication that is causing the problem.
Hundreds of medications have excessive sleepiness as a listed side effect. That list is too lengthy to reproduce here. Everything from antihistamines, to blood pressure medication, to pain meds can cause problems with alertness and sleepiness. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you think one of your medications may be interfering with your sleep.
Talk to your doctor if you feel any medication you are taking is preventing you from sleeping or interfering with your ability to wake up feeling alert and refreshed.

Awaken your senses.,
Focus inward, not outward.,
Pick up a pen and paper.,
Do something uplifting that you enjoy.",How to Begin the Day2," Does your routine involve lurching awake to a blaring alarm clock, jolting yourself into consciousness by dunking your face in a sink full of cold water, and scalding your throat by chugging down some coffee? If so, trying to engage each of your senses in a more pleasant, uplifting manner may help set a better tone for your new day.Natural sunlight signals the body to transition from sleeping to waking modes, so try to start each day by opening the shades. Better yet, open up the window or go outside. Breathe in the fresh air, listen to the birds chirping, and welcome the new day (if you are lucky enough to have that as your outdoor environment).
Filling your room with warm, welcoming colors like reds and blues, having the color and fragrance of fresh flowers at the ready, and cueing up some uplifting music can all help engage your senses in a positive manner first thing in the morning.

, With many people using their smartphones as their alarm clock, a natural first move once awakened is to check emails, texts, social media updates, news feeds, etc. Fight this urge, and make the first part of your new day all about you.If you can give yourself fifteen minutes, great. If you can only manage five, take it. Start your day by practicing “mindfulness” — meditation, prayer, reflection, whatever it is that allows you to focus inward and prepare yourself for the day ahead.
Many people find it beneficial to spend at least some of this “me” time focusing on gratitude. Meditate on all the things you have to be grateful for, starting perhaps with the fact that you have risen to see another day. Focusing on your reasons to be thankful before getting into the day’s obstacles can make them seem less overwhelming or insurmountable., It may seem quaint in today’s digital world, but taking the time to actually write down your thoughts can be a refreshing exercise. It helps you visualize your thoughts and establish them as a guide for your day.


Some people find writing down the previous night’s dreams to be helpful, even if they don’t make much sense at the time. If that’s not appealing to you, why not go completely “retro” and write daily entries in a journal or diary?If you tend to wake up already stressed out by all you need to do that day, you may benefit from jotting down a daily “to ignore” list (as opposed to the more common “to do” variety). List things that need not be addressed today — non-essential emails, cleaning the bathroom, whatever they may be — and pledge to set them aside for the coming day. Focus your energies on what you can do, not what you could do.Some people find that doing an early morning “brain dump” helps set their focus and energizes their creativity. Jot down whatever ideas, schemes, or plans that come to mind first thing in the morning, no matter how strange or impractical they are. Think of it as “clearing the decks” for your creative mind at worst, and at best as a source of inspiration., Make each morning something to look forward to by budgeting in some time to do something enjoyable just for you. Starting off your day with a smile makes it much more likely that you’ll go through the day with one.Take some time to read from an uplifting religious, spiritual, or just plain enjoyable book. Do some knitting or model-building. Call an old friend, or meet up for coffee. Read a story to your kids. Make love to your partner. Make some “happy time” a part of how you begin the day."
"
Start with a clean slate.,
Take time to strategize.,
Take advantage of your morning focus.",How to Begin the Day3," Today is a new day, and you should treat it as such when you begin your productive tasks. If you have unfinished work from the previous day, set it aside for the first hour or so (it's not going anywhere!).If you've begun your day the right way to this point, you should have a burst of energy and focus when you start your workday. Circling back to yesterday's unfinished business may sap that energy more quickly than starting fresh. If you have to complete yesterday's work first, try to treat it as a new task for a new day.
Organize your workspace so that it is ready to go first thing in the morning. This probably means you need to take a few minutes at the end of the previous workday to clean up and organize the space. You may just want to get out of there at that point, but the time is well-spent if it enables you to be more productive at the start of the next day.

, If you have the early morning burst of energy, you may want to jump right in to work before it runs out. It will be worth your while to use a few minutes of this energy to plan out your day and beyond, though.Before your focus becomes clouded by all the little things that come up during a workday, plot out what you want to accomplish that day and how you will do so. Prioritize your tasks, and budget your time accordingly.
Don't just focus on the short-term, however. Think about how your daily plan fits into your larger monthly, yearly, and even career goals. Are you budgeting your time in the best way to get that promotion, or to graduate a semester early?

, Once you've taken a few minutes to plot your strategy, the time has arrived to maximize the burst of workday energy you are hopefully experiencing. Even if you aren't feeling overly energetic during your first hour or so of work, your mind is still likely to be less cluttered than it will become as the day goes on.Use this time for a task that requires more intensive focus, such as writing. You will almost certainly be more productive and efficient now than at 4:00 pm (or 11:00 pm, for that matter).
When possible, put off meetings, scrolling through emails, and dealing with ""people conflicts"" until later in the morning. Direct your focus inward as much as possible until your burst of morning energy begins to wane, then let the outside world in. Once again, don't worry, these things will be waiting for you!

Get away from the screen.,
Take a stretch break.,
Go outside.,
Take a power nap.,
Take time to breathe.,
Take a cold shower.",How to Feel More Awake Without Coffee2," If you have a desk job or are a student, you probably spend a lot of time in front of the computer screen. Give your eyes a break by taking time to do something else away from your screen. If you are watching TV, take a break and do something else.


If you can't leave, look at a spot in the distance every 20 minutes or so. Doing this helps your eye muscles relax and will make your eyes feel less tired and strained. , If you are sitting down for extended periods of time, either at work or at class, you should get up every now and then to stretch. Stretching increases blood flow and can give you a quick boost of energy. Even just stretching for thirty seconds at your desk can increase your alertness and energy level. One stretch you can do is to clasp both of your hands behind your back, and raise your arms up as far as you can with your hands still clasped together. This stretches you upper back.
To stretch your neck, tilt your head to the side so that your ear almost touches your shoulder. Alternate with the other side.
Touching your toes is another good stretch to get your blood flowing.

, If you've been inside all day, take a break when appropriate and go outside. A brisk walk gets your blood flowing and sunlight and fresh air are great natural ways to reenergize. Even just a few minutes is enough to give you a boost. , If you're just plain sleepy, consider taking a quick nap. A 20-minute nap is recommended by many to help you become more alert. A 30-60 minute nap is shown to improve memorization and recollection, but longer naps can take you into deeper sleep and leave you feeling more groggy when you wake up. Consider the amount of time you have and nap accordingly. Remember to set your alarm! If you don't you could oversleep.
Try to nap either in the morning or in the early afternoon after lunch. Napping in the late afternoon could leave you feeling more tired and could affect your sleep at night. , Breathing deeply increases blood oxygen levels, which makes you more alert. Focusing on breathing also makes you more present and aware. Sit up straight in your chair or stand. This gives your abdomen enough room to hold deep breaths.
Inhale deeply through your nose with your mouth closed. Hold the breath for a few seconds.
Breathe out with your lips pursed so the breath comes out slowly.
You can also inhale and exhale rapidly, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your nose, keeping your mouth closed. This is a yoga technique called stimulating breath. , Taking a cold shower can give you an instant energy bolt. If you have time in your day and access to a shower, hop in the water for at least three minutes. While a warm shower is soothing, a cold shower can be a shock to the system and will bring you out of your drowsiness. If you don't want to get your hair wet, put on a shower cap.
If you can't take the time off to shower, go to the bathroom and splash some cold water on your face. It has a similar effect of making you more alert.

Don't skip breakfast.,
Drink enough water.,
Eat fruit, not candy.,
Eat complex carbs.,
Don't overeat.",How to Feel More Awake Without Coffee3," This is a mistake that many make, and it can seriously impact your wakefulness throughout the day. Think of your body like a car that needs fuel. Starting off the day by eating breakfast gives you the energy you need to start your day. Stay away from sugary breakfast items like donuts or muffins. Instead, eat breakfast items like eggs, oatmeal or yogurt for a breakfast that is high in protein.

, Many doctors recommend drinking 8 glasses of water a day. Water has countless benefits, but they include making you more refreshed and awake. Make sure to drink water before or after eating salty or dehydrating foods.


You can also use water as a quick fix whenever you are feeling tired. Tiredness is a side effect of being dehydrated, so when you are feeling tired try drinking a glass of water.

, It's tempting to eat a piece of candy to give you that energy spurt. However, candy will give you an energy crash that may make you feel even worse. Instead of candy, eat an apple or banana. The sugar from fruit boosts your blood sugar but does not give you a sugar crash like candy does.

, Complex carbs like whole grains give you a long dose of energy. They are better than simple carbohydrates like sugar and soft drinks because they give you long-lasting energy with no crash. Some examples of complex carbohydrates are green vegetables, potatoes, beans, corn and lentils.

, Food comas are real. Eating too much can make you feel unproductive and lethargic. It's natural to have a little lull in energy after lunch, but you can manage it by eating healthily and not overdoing it with portion size. Monitor your portion size by bringing food from home. This way you will know how exactly how much you are eating and you won't make any impulsive food decisions. It also can save you money!

Keep physically active during the day.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Stay away from stimulants in the evening.,
Write your list of worries during the day.,
Get exposure to sunlight early in the day.,
Manage your stress.",How to Unwind for Bed2," Doing strenuous activity, such as brisk walking, swimming, or jogging) in the late afternoon is associated with a more restful sleep. People who don’t get enough exercise often have more trouble with insomnia.If you have a hard time exercising during the day, try doing some gentle exercises at night. Stretching, yoga, or other movement routines can help you unwind before bed.
Avoid overly strenuous exercise in the 2 hours before bedtime.
The more active your body is earlier in the day, the more likely you’ll be able to unwind in the evening before bed.

, Avoid eating food that’s likely to cause you stomach upset as you try to unwind from the day. Some experts suggest eating your largest meal at dinnertime if you have trouble sleeping, but don’t eat so much that you’re uncomfortable when you’re trying to sleep. Ideally, you’ll be neither hungry nor full as you try to get to sleep.Avoid late-night snacking on high-sugar, high-fat foods.
If you feel the need to snack at night, stick to high-protein, low-sugar options. For example, a glass of milk, a protein bar, or a spoonful of peanut butter can satisfy your craving while not interfering with your sleep.

, Most people are aware of the hazards of drinking caffeinated beverages such as coffee late in the day, but caffeine can also be found in many sodas, energy drinks, and non-herbal tea. Even decaffeinated coffee contains a small amount of caffeine and can interfere with your sleep.In addition to other health hazards, smoking before bed stimulates your nervous system and may keep you from being able to relax. The stimulating effects of nicotine take hours to wear off.
While one glass of wine can help you relax, drinking more than this is likely to keep you awake longer, and results in sleep disturbances that interfere with your ability to relax.

, If you have a hard time with anxious thoughts before bed, it can be helpful to develop a routine of writing a list of things “to do” or worries at another time during the day. When you’re lying in bed, you can remind yourself that you’ve created a list, and you don’t need to worry about those things now.


This is a cognitive behavioral strategy, a technique developed to help someone redirect her thoughts from a negative to a positive direction.
If you find yourself unable to “turn off” your thoughts, try listening to guided relaxation audio.

, If you’re able to get outside earlier in the day, your melatonin will be able to kick in during the evening hours. Early morning exposure to sunlight has been shown to be clinically effective against insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD).Ways to get exposure to sunlight in the early morning hours include walking or jogging.
If you can’t get outside, you can achieve the same benefits by getting exposure to very bright artificial lights.

, Practical strategies to manage your stress levels include getting organized, setting priorities, and managing the amount of work you have to do. If you’re having trouble with these things, consider asking for help. Sometimes talking to a friend, a parent, or a counselor can help you come up with more effective management strategies.Having a long talk with a good friend can also be an effective stress management tool.
Make time in your schedule to practice stress-management tools, such as organizing your schedule and planning your work for the week.

Understand how stomach sleeping affects you.,
Use positive affirmations before bedtime.,
Use an orthopedic pillow.,
Ask your partner for assistance.,
Try hypnotherapy.,
Consider your physical limitations first.,
Sleep on your side.,
Sleep on your back.",How to Stop Sleeping on Your Stomach," The main problem with stomach sleeping is that is creates an unnatural position for your spine.It causes too much extension in the low back, potentially irritating the small facet joints of the spine, and too much twisting in the neck because you need to rotate your head to one side in order to breath. Neck rotation for long periods of time leads to muscle strains and mild joint sprains, which can trigger headaches and dizziness. Laying face-down also puts more pressure on your jaw and tends to promote facial wrinkles. Furthermore, because most people raise their arms above their heads while stomach sleeping, shoulder joints are put under more stress. If any of these issues apply to you, then it's time to stop stomach sleeping.


A study of women between the ages of 20-44 found that 48% sleep primarily on their back (supine), 41% on their sides (fetal position) and 11% on their stomach (prone).Stomach sleeping for babies is discouraged because it's linked to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Sleeping on your back or side is better for your posture.;
, Changing a habitual sleeping position is difficult because you're not conscious (awake) during the night to constantly monitor it. However, once you start to associate some negativity (such as back pain) to stomach sleeping, then your desire to change positions may start to sink into the subconscious part of your mind, which is active during sleep. To help this process along, use positive affirmations just before bedtime. Positive affirmations are positive directions or self-statements (spoken aloud or thought) repeated many times over.The idea is to drive your conscious desires into your unconscious mind.


Start by saying or thinking, ""I will sleep on my side (or back) tonight because it's best for my body"" at least 10 times.
With positive affirmations meant to affect the subconscious mind, it's best not to use negative language, as in ""I won't sleep on my stomach tonight."" Keep all language directive and in the positive form.
Affirmations have helped many people make significant changes, but they don't always work for everyone or all conditions.
Each time you wake up on your stomach, correct your sleeping position instead of falling back asleep.

, An orthopedic pillow is meant to maintain the natural curves of your neck and is typically made of contoured foam.Orthopedic pillows make your neck and head feel good when you sleep on them while on your back or side, but may feel awkward or uncomfortable during stomach sleeping. As such, an orthopedic pillow might act as a deterrent to stomach sleeping, while encouraging a different, more physiologically beneficial position at the same time.


Orthopedic pillows can be purchased at medical supply and rehabilitation stores, as well at the offices of some chiropractors and physiotherapists.
Buy a pillow with obvious supportive contours and not the flat ones merely made from memory form. Remember, you're trying to make it uncomfortable to use while on your stomach.

, If you're married or sleep with a significant other, ask them for assistance during the night if they happen to be awake and notice you're sleeping on your stomach. Ask them to give you a gentle nudge, so you roll onto your side or back. Ironically, your partner may sleep better while you're on your stomach because the position helps to ease or prevent snoring, which is about its only benefit.People (especially infants) who sleep on their stomachs tend to be less reactive to noise, experience less movement and have higher arousal thresholds.Stomach sleeping helps prevent heat dissipation from your internal organs, so the position retains more heat during the night. In contrast, sleeping on your back allows you to cool down easier.

, Hypnotherapy uses suggestive commands to impact a person's behaviors while they are in an altered state of consciousness, also known as a trance.People in deeply relaxed and focused states are unusually responsive to suggestion and imagery. As such, if you're having great difficulty changing your sleeping habits, then find a reputable and well-established hypnotherapist in your area and schedule a few sessions. Hypnotherapy has a good track record for stopping other negative behaviors, such as smoking and alcoholism, so using it for stomach sleeping isn't so far fetched.


If you're feeling a little nervous or vulnerable about being hypnotized, then get the hypnotist to video record your sessions. They may also make you subliminal audio MP3s / CDs to take home and listen to.
Alternatively, ask a friend to join you and keep an eye on things while you're hypnotized.

, Before deciding what new sleeping position you want to habituate to, consider any physical ailments you might have. For example, if you've had back surgery, sleeping on your side in the fetal position may be the most comfortable. Furthermore, sleeping on your side may also be better if you have a history of snoring or sleep apnea.On the other hand, if you have chronic shoulder pain from an old sports injury, then sleeping on your back might be the best position.


Most people find that firm mattresses offer the most support and cause the least amount of musculoskeletal issues. In contrast, only a minority of people do well with soft mattresses or waterbeds. Consider investing in a high-quality, firm mattress.
Pregnant women do best on their sides, with research suggesting that sleeping on the left side increases blood flow levels to the developing baby., From a musculoskeletal (functional) perspective, sleeping on your side provides the most benefit because it keeps your spine in normal alignment. It can alleviate neck pain (assuming your pillow is an appropriate size) and low back pain, reduce the incidence of acid reflux (heartburn), prevent snoring and ease the burdens of pregnancy.However, from an aesthetic perspective, side sleeping can promote facial wrinkles and saggy breasts, as they get a little squished.


If side sleeping, select a pillow that fits between the tip of you shoulder and the side of your head. Thus, thick pillows are best for broad-shouldered people and thin pillows for the narrow shouldered — a pillow of the appropriate thickness will keep your neck aligned and help prevent tension or cervicogenic headaches.
To promote sleeping on your side, get a body pillow to hug, which might replace the sense of security and warmth you were getting from stomach sleeping.
Everyone who sleeps on their side should use a pillow between their legs to promote hip alignment., Sleeping on your back (supine) is generally better for your spine compared to stomach sleeping, especially for your neck, but care must be taken if you have a history of lower back pain. As such, consider putting a small pillow underneath your knees for elevation, which will take pressure off your lower lumbar spine. Sleeping on your back is also good for reducing acid reflux, minimizing facial wrinkles (nothing is pushing against and creasing your face) and maintaining perky breasts, as their weight is fully supported.On the other hand, being supine promotes snoring because it can cause the soft tissues in your throat to collapse, which constricts the airways.


If your back feels stiff after sleeping supine, put a small pillow (wedge-shaped ones work well) or rolled-up towel under the small of your back (lumbar area) and keep it there during the night.While your head is elevated above the level of your stomach, heartburn is minimized because stomach acid has a much harder time coming up against the effects of gravity.

During your day, take a break to go for a walk outdoors or go sit by a window for lunch.Sunlight helps to calibrate your mind to the new time change.
The lack of sunlight may reduce the amount of Vitamin D you receive from the sun. This may increase your risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and depression.

Drink energy drinks.,
Drink natural energy drinks.,
Take caffeine pills.",How to Feel More Awake Without Coffee5," Tea is an alternate source of caffeine that is generally healthier than coffee. It does however have less caffeine than coffee, depending on the type. Black tea has the most caffeine per cup: about 65 mg as opposed to the 150 mg in coffee. If you wish to have the same level of caffeine as coffee, drink a couple cups of black tea in the morning and throughout the day as needed. Tea is less dehydrating than coffee, and dehydration can lead to tiredness. Other health benefits include reducing the risk of heart disease, some cancers and type 1 diabetes among other diseases. Stick to teas with no added sugar as opposed to sugary bottled teas. Sugar temporarily increases your energy level, but it also creates sugar crashes about 20 minutes after you consume it that can make you feel seriously tired. , There are countless energy drinks out there on the market that are formulated to make you feel more alert.

They also offer a different taste alternative if you don't like the taste of most commercial energy drinks.


Try drinks that use the ingredient guayusa, a natural source of caffeine that also contains antioxidants, which stop you from getting the caffeine jitters. Look for these products at Whole Foods or Vitamin Shoppe. Try drinks made with Yerba Mate. Mate is traditionally a South American tea, but there are several energy drinks that are made using an infusion of Yerba Mate. These drinks can average up to whopping 140 mg of caffeine per serving. , If you want a quick and convenient caffeine fix, consider trying caffeine pills.

Get at least 7 hours of sleep.,
Make sure the sleep you are getting is uninterrupted.,
Don't set your alarm too early.,
Get up when your alarm goes off.,
Have a consistent sleep schedule.",How to Feel More Awake Without Coffee6," If you are looking at less of a quick fix and more of a lifestyle change, make sure that you are getting enough sleep at night. Adults aged 18 and up need at least 7 hours of sleep. Teenagers 14-17 need 8-10 hours, while children 6-13 need 9-11 hours. , Interrupted sleep is bad sleep, and it will affect you the next day. Make sure that you put your phone on a setting that won't wake you throughout the night. If you chronically wake up multiple times a night, consult your doctor.

, Many people set multiple alarms or hit the snooze button several times before they actually wake up. Don't set an alarm at a time that is too early for you to get up just because you are counting on hitting the snooze button. Once you wake up that first time, you will no longer be getting restful sleep. Consider that before you set your alarm at night. , Even if you don't get out of bed for a few minutes, do your best to keep your eyes open. Hitting the snooze button actually hurts more than it helps. Every time you fall asleep after you hit the snooze button, you start a new sleep cycle that you will be woken up from. This makes you feel more groggy once you actually get out of bed and can affect you the rest of the day. , Try to wake up and go to sleep the same time every day.

Exercise regularly.,
Watch your diet.",How to Stop Insomnia1," Going to bed at the same time each night and waking up at the same time each morning can help you get more restful sleep.

If you know you function best early in the morning, try getting up early and going to bed early.
Try to get 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Life gets hectic and this can be difficult, but you'll see positive benefits for your overall health.
Avoid sleeping in, even on weekends. While it's tempting to grab some extra zzz's on Sunday mornings, you're actually doing yourself harm. Instead of trying to sleep later, choose a relaxing activity for weekend mornings. Have brunch with friends or go for a leisurely walk.
Try not to fall asleep on the couch. Many people are prone to dozing after dinner. This can disrupt your sleep schedule and keep you from falling asleep later. If you need a pick-me-up after your nighttime meal, do something mildly active, such as doing the dishes or phoning a friend.;
, Where you sleep has a big impact on how well you sleep. It's important to create an atmosphere that is conducive to restful sleep. This means you want the temperature and the sounds that are right for you.Research shows that a cool bedroom is most conducive to sleep. Try to make sure that your room is a comfortable 65 degrees.
Your mattress, pillows, and bedding all affect your ability to fall asleep. Find a mattress that offers plenty of support. Your pillow should also support your head and neck. Sheets and blankets should not be scratchy. They should feel smooth and cool against your skin.
Turn off the electronics. Watching television as you fall asleep can keep your mind racing. You should also avoid taking your laptop to bed or looking at your phone while you try to fall asleep. The light from the screen can cause you to stay awake.
Find the right noises. White noise can be soothing and help stop insomnia. Try sleeping with a fan on or consider investing in a sound machine.

, Many people who suffer from insomnia are also suffering from some type of anxiety. Maybe you are worried about money or you have a big project coming up at work. Try quieting your mind before heading to bed. It's difficult, but if you stop worrying, you can sleep better.Try making a list. Write down all of the things you need to do tomorrow. Then set the list aside. Your brain will feel more settled that you have acknowledged your tasks and will be more likely to stop racing.
Try not to stress if you are wide awake when you should be sleeping. Instead of staring at the clock and worrying about lack of sleep, give yourself permission to get up. Do something relaxing, such as a few yoga poses. You could also read for a little bit. You'll be more likely to become sleepy if you stop worrying about it.

, Regular physical activity may help you sleep better. Research shows that moderate exercise each day will help you feel less stress. When you are less anxious, you will sleep more soundly.Try to be active for at least 60 minutes each day, with about 30 minutes of moderate exertion. You could do a low impact activity such as swimming or walking.

Use pillows to elevate the sleeper's head.,
Keep the bedroom moist with a humidifier.,
Consider a separate bedrooms if the snoring is too loud.",How to Stop Someone from Snoring1," Raising the head four inches with one to two pillows can make it easier to breath and encourage the tongue and jaw to move forward. You can buy specially designed pillows to keep the neck muscles relaxed and open, leading to a reduction or elimination of snoring when sleeping.Keep in mind it can be difficult for someone who snores to not move or shift throughout the night, which could lead to moving off the pillows or falling back into a position that could lead to snoring. You can counter this by having the snorer put tennis balls in the back of their night clothes. This will cause mild discomfort when rolling over or moving around at night and can prevent the snorer from shifting in their sleep.;
, Dry air can irritate your nose and throat and lead to congestion and snoring at night. If the person who snores has issues with swollen nasal tissues, it can help to sleep with a humidifier on. Keeping the air moist throughout the night can help ensure better, snore free sleep., Some couple, families, roommates etc, decide it might be best to have separate bedrooms for sleeping, especially if the snorers snoring is a chronic issue. It can be difficult, especially for couples to sleep in separate rooms, especially if one person feels guilty or resentful due to interrupted sleep, so take the time to talk to the snorer about this possibility.Explain that your sleep is lacking sleep due to the person's snoring and you feel it would be best for your sleep routine and your relationship if you slept in separate rooms. Snoring is a physical issue that is the result of other physical issues or ailments. It is in the hands of any adult who snores to find a solution, medical or otherwise, for their snoring. However, if none of the solutions seem to work, separate bedrooms may be your only option if the issue is with an adult. If you're a parent with a child who snores, they will need your help to stop snoring.

Establish a healthy sleep routine.,
Get up at the same time each day.,
Avoid caffeine and alcohol the day before.,
Prepare for contingencies.",How to Feel Alert when You Wake up in the Mornings1," To be alert in the morning, you need, for one thing, to get deep and restorative sleep. Try to set a routine. Go to bed early and get up at a reasonable hour. Aim for between 8 to 10 hours of sleep every day.To accustom your mind to the routine, do things that calm you and tell your body to become tired. Make your bedroom an inviting place, with comfortable blankets and pillows. Limit the amount of natural and artificial light, as well.
Don’t take naps too close to your bedtime. Catnaps might be causing you to feel energetic until a late hour, disrupting your night’s sleep.;
, If going to bed at the same time is important, so is waking up at a regular hour. Your body will soon get used to rising at 6am or 7am, though you may not feel like it at first. Stick to your schedule. While it’s fine to sleep in some on the weekends, try to keep it within one or two hours of your normal wake-up time., Coffee or other beverages can disrupt your sleep, making you feel groggy the next day. You may not realize it, but a cup of coffee at 4pm might be what’s keep you up at midnight. This is because caffeine remains in your system for up to eight hours. Avoid caffeine beyond 2 or 3 in the afternoon.Alcohol can also disrupt your normal sleep patterns. While you may find that a beer or two help you to fall asleep, the alcohol in those drinks actually makes it harder to get quality sleep. Alcohol-affected sleep is lighter, with fewer Rapid Eye Movement (REM) periods – the body’s most important restorative sleep. You will also wake up more frequently., Make sure you sort everything out for the morning the night before. If you tend to get hungry or thirsty at night – and this wakes you up – eat a light meal or snack or have some herbal tea before going to bed.


At the same time, and as said, avoid caffeinated beverages. Also limit your portion sizes. High-fat meals and large servings prolong the work your digestive system needs to do, and all the gas production and rumblings may keep you awake. "

Use sleep trackers as a guide, not a diagnostic tool.,
Consider a professional sleep analysis by polysomnography.",How to Use a Sleep Tracker," A simple search of your phone’s app store will reveal dozens of sleep tracker options, some free and some for sale. Nearly all of them, however, rely on your phone’s existing accelerometer, which detects movement.Basically, you open the app and keep your phone in your pocket when you go to bed. If you are moving little or not at all, the app records this as sleep. Some use algorithms to assign amounts of movement over periods of time as evidence of particular phases of sleep (such as REM sleep). In the morning, they record and report the results, often with a graph and statistics.
Some more advanced apps offer additional features, such as flexible alarms that supposedly will wake you up at just the right time in your sleep cycle — that is, not jolting you awake with an alarm right in the middle of one of your REM cycles. The ability of these devices to do so, and the utility of doing so regardless, are debatable, however.;
, Some people have taken to wearing fitness tracking devices — often bands, watches, or clip-on devices — to record their daily physical activity and monitor some of their vital signs. If you keep the device on at night, most all of them can also track your sleep as well.Like phone apps, most wearable trackers utilize an accelerometer to detect movement. They use this movement data to determine the amount and quality of your sleep.
For people that find it uncomfortable to wear a wristband during sleep, there are also versions that utilize a thin band that stretches across the bedspread and underneath you.
Visit the websites affiliated with the various brands of popular fitness trackers and/or smart watches (FitBit, Apple Watch, Pebble Smartwatch, Garmin Vivo, etc.) for detailed operation instructions.

, By utilizing technology that already exists in virtually all smartphones, accelerometer-based sleep trackers provide a simple, easy, cheap way to analyze a night’s sleep. For all its convenience, though, actigraphy (measurement of movement) has its limits in tracking sleep.


Remember, on an essential level, that these devices track movement, not sleep. The device can’t actually tell if you are asleep, or how you are sleeping; it makes assumptions based on your movement patterns. If the way in which you sleep does not fit the supposed “standard” profile, the accuracy of the device will suffer accordingly.If, for instance, you were to try out multiple sleep trackers at once, the results would almost certainly be different, and perhaps widely disparate.
Thus, while devices that rely on actigraphy have their place in tracking sleep, most sleep experts strongly favor polysomnography, which records a range of vital signs and movements (from eyes to feet) at once. Of course, such devices still exist almost exclusively in clinical settings., As interest in consumer fitness tracking technology increases, new sleep tracking options will likely become widely available. Some devices, which can combine wearable monitors with components that sit on your nightstand, already incorporate elements of polysomnography into the home setting.Five years ago, few people used or had even heard of sleep tracking devices; five years from now, the range of sleep tracking devices available may be vastly different from today.

, While everyone experiences sleep differently, in general terms it occurs in repeating stages of lighter and deeper sleep. Experts delineate four stages of sleep, three non-REM (NREM — N1, N2, N3) and REM sleep. The stages usually repeat every 90 minutes or so (with individual variations).REM sleep (referring to “rapid eye movement”) is the deepest stage of the sleep cycle, and often considered the most essential. In reality, however, making it through the entire cycle multiple times (ideally 4-5 times for most people) is important for adequate rest and good health.
The standard recommendation that adults should strive for 7-9 uninterrupted hours of sleep per night is based upon this need to complete several full sleep cycles.

, Consumer sleep trackers try to provide detailed information about how well you navigated the sleep cycle the night before, but the results are by necessity limited by their reliance on movement. They can provide educated guesses on the quality of your sleep, but cannot provide definitive information.If using a sleep tracker gets you more focused on how much and how well you sleep, it provides a valuable service. Consider the results it provides as a starting point toward determining if you should seek a professional opinion about your sleep patterns.Trust your body at least as much as the tracker, though. If you keep waking up groggy and tired but it says you’ve been sleeping like a baby, don’t use this as an excuse to avoid getting a professional opinion.

, Regardless of what your sleep tracker is telling you, if you lie awake at night consistently or wake up tired and groggy despite what should be sufficient sleep time, you should seek a supervised sleep examination. Conditions like insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea can have severe health consequences.First, consult your physician about your concerns and determine whether a professional sleep study is right for you.
If a sleep study is advised, you will spend the night at a clinic and have a series of about 20 wired sensors attached to various parts of your body. Polysomnography sensors track body movement, eye movement, heart rate, breathing, and several other factors in order to derive a complete analysis of your sleep pattern. This information can be used by medical professionals to diagnose a range of sleep disorders.Polysomnography in a clinical setting isn’t perfect, of course. You have to spend the night away from home with a bunch of wires attached to you, which can not surprisingly make it difficult to get a typical night’s sleep. However, at present, this is the “gold standard” for sleep analysis.

Hold the breath for a count of five. Then slowly exhale as you could to five. Do this five to 10 times.;
, Progressive muscle relaxation is an effective way to calm your body and your mind. To do this exercise, you will need to find a quiet comfortable place to lie down, such as in your bed. Then, you will tense and release each of your muscle groups moving from your toes to the top of your head.Start by tightening the muscles in your toes, such as by clenching your toes. Hold this for about 15 to 30 seconds and then release. Relax for about 15 to 30 seconds before moving on to the next muscle group.
Keep tensing and releasing your muscles until you reach the top of your head. By the time you finish, you should feel more relaxed.

, Your thoughts may be racing because your mind is excited and hasn’t relaxed or started winding down yet. If your body is stressed or tense, this may cause your mind to stay active. To help your mind and body start winding down at night, do something boring or mundane. This helps keep your mind from getting overexcited.The boring task will vary from person to person. You may try going for a slow, quiet walk, reading a newspaper or nonfiction book, doing math problems, rearranging your shelves, or watching a documentary.
The task that you do shouldn’t excite the mind or the body. Choose a task that relaxes you and helps your brain shut off.

, Half an hour before you want to lay down, shut down all your electronics, including a television. Turn off the lights or turn them very low. This helps your body start producing melatonin, which promotes sleep. Listen to soothing music, read, or lay in bed relaxing your body.

You focus on the noise instead of the thoughts.For example, you may want to put on a fan, the dishwasher, or the dryer. You can find apps or sound clips on the internet of white noise, such as ocean waves, rain drops, or crickets chirping.
The white noise should be soothing enough that you can focus on it. Make sure it’s not too loud to keep you awake.

, Body awareness can help you distract yourself from racing thoughts. When you focus on your body using your senses, this helps give your brain something to think about instead of your worries or stress. Close your eyes and try to use the five senses to get a sense of how your body is feeling.Think about what you hear and smell. Open your eyes and focus on what you see around you. Decide if you taste anything. Focus on how your body feels. Are you cold? Sore? Think about how the clothing and blankets feel on your skin.

Suggest they speak to their dentist about anti-snoring mouth appliances.,
Recommend the snorer have a consultation with their doctor about surgical options for snoring.",How to Stop Someone from Snoring2," If the person who snores struggles with stuffed up nasal passages, they may want to try a saline rinse before they go to bed to help them breathe easily while sleeping. To clean and rinse the nose, a Neti pot or nasal decongestant can be used.Nasal strips can help to reduce the volume of snoring, as they can adjust the nasal passages. They do not always help to eliminate snoring and are not as effective as a nasal rinse in the opinion of some., Shifting sleep position to laying on one side, rather than laying flat on one's back or stomach, will reduce the amount of pressure on the throat and help to prevent snoring. If there's difficulty maintaining a side sleeping position, you can sew a sock or a tennis ball into the back of their night wear. This will cause mild discomfort when rolling over on the back during the night and help to keep the snorer on one side.After a few weeks of sleeping on one side, it should become a habit and you can remove the tennis balls or socks in the pajamas.

, People with a snoring problem can see their dentist and get a custom mouthguard to help open the airway and bring the lower jaw and tongue forward during sleep.However, dentist-made appliances can be expensive, especially if healthcare does not cover it. Suggest they have a consultation with their dentist and discuss cheaper options, if necessary.

, If the snorer continues to snore despite adjustments to the sleeping environment and sleep habits, they may want to consider scheduling a consultation with a doctor to discuss a medical device or a surgical procedure to help with the snoring. A doctor may recommend the following options, including:Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP): This is a machine that blows pressurized air into a mask worn over the nose, or nose and mouth or whole face. A CPAP machine can help to keep airways open while sleeping
Traditional surgery for snoring: These surgical procedures will help to increase the size of your person's airways by removing tissues or correcting any abnormalities in the nose.
Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP): This procedure uses lasers to shorten the uvula, which is the hanging soft tissue at the back of the throat, and makes small cuts in the soft palate. As the cuts heal, the surrounding tissue will stiffen and prevent the vibrations in the throat that cause snoring.

Try to read a paper book rather than reading on an electronic device. The screens on these devices can affect your ability to fall asleep., A mantra is a stress-relieving technique that can help calm your mind and body. It is a word or phrase that you repeat over and over again. You focus your mind on the word or phrase instead of your racing thoughts. If your mind tries to wander away from your mantra, pull it back only to your mantra until that is the only thought in your head.You can use a mantra anywhere at anytime, not just at night.
For example, you may be worried that your partner is mad at you, so you can’t sleep. You can close your eyes or stare at the wall as you repeat, “I am okay” or “This moment is good” or any other word or phrase you choose.

, Another way that you might be able to calm racing thoughts is by writing down those thoughts into a journal. This allows you to express the thoughts, but to let them go until a later time. Writing is an activity that helps you redirect your thoughts to the task instead of the worry.Write for a few minutes. See if your mind feels calmer. If you don’t feel calmer, try writing for five to 10 more minutes.

Come up with an alternative scenario.,
Think about the present moment.,
Refrain from fighting the thoughts.,
Try visualizing the thoughts away.,
Seek help for anxiety.",How to Stop Racing Thoughts in the Middle of Night3," Many times, racing thoughts include a worst-case scenario. You may be obsessing about how something bad is going to happen, or have nothing but negative thoughts running through your head. One way to help stop these racing thoughts is to actively turn the negative thoughts into something positive or more neutral.For example, if you have racing thoughts about a mistake you made at work, you may think that you are going to get fired. Instead, tell yourself, “Everyone makes mistakes. I will not lose my job. If asked, I will explain my mistake and move on.”

, Racing thoughts are generally worries about something you have done in the past, or something that may or may not happen in the future. To help calm your mind at night, think only about the present moment. As you lay in your bed, you can only control that moment. Reminding yourself that you can’t change the past or future can help calm your mind.Ask yourself, “How do I physically feel right now? How do I emotionally feel right now?” And focus on how you feel in that moment, not on the worries about the past or future.
Tell yourself, “I am in control of the present. I cannot control the past or future. The present moment is causing me no anxiety or stress.”

, Sometimes when you have racing thoughts, you may lie in bed and try to stop the thoughts. When the thoughts don’t stop, this might cause you to feel upset or frustrated, which can feed more thoughts into your head to be anxious or upset about. Instead of fighting them, try accepting them.This means you may say, “My thoughts are racing right now. I am not going to fight them.” By doing this, you take some of the control away from the thoughts, which can help them start to slow down or go away.

, Try stopping racing thoughts by visualizing them going away. Think of each thought as something separate. Then, come up with a way you can get rid of the thought. This might be like a leaf on a stream, letting go of a balloon into the sky, or a cloud floating by in the sky.For example, when a thought comes into your mind, imagine putting it on a balloon. In your mind, let go of that balloon with the thought and let that thought drift off into the sky. Do this to each thought as you let go of them.

, Racing thoughts are a common symptom of anxiety disorders and other mental illnesses. If you are suffering from racing thoughts that don't get any better, consider seeing a doctor or mental health professional to treat the underlying problem. Receiving proper treatment should help your racing thoughts.Treatments for anxiety disorders and other mental illnesses include medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.

If you want to know the exact time right away, digital displays could be a better option for you.;
, Some clocks will run on batteries alone, while others plug into the wall. Plug-in models can reset in a power surge or blackout, so an alarm with a built-in backup power source will be more reliable.

, You may respond better and wake more easily by stimulating your brain with words or music rather than the traditional beep. In this case, try a clock radio which you can set to your favorite radio station or morning talk show., Find an alarm clock which brightens the room and creates the illusion of a sunrise to initiate your body’s wake up system. Light triggers the body to create hormones like cortisol, which help your body wake up.

The gentle shake can accompany an alarm sound or work on its own. This can be especially useful for the hearing impaired, or those who have trouble waking to the sound of the alarm.Smart Shaker from iLuv works with the alarm on your smart phone, by attaching via bluetooth to activate the shake. Sound is optional.
The Silent alarm clock avoids noises altogether and wakes you with a gentle shake. You strap a rubber band on your finger or thumb, which is wirelessly activated to shake when you want to wake up. You can snooze by shaking your hand, but will have to shake it more vigorously with each snooze., Some people can sleep right through an alarm clock and others can’t stand the loud blast. While you sleep, your brain is still processing auditory signals. The deeper you are in your sleep cycle, though, the more noise you may need to draw you out of it. If you are waking at odd hours or tend to sleep through your alarm, try an alarm with increased volume.The Sonic Alert Loud Dual alarm clock allows you to adjust the volume up to 113 decibels. You can also make the alarm entirely silent and opt for the shaker option if you have company over and don’t want to wake them.
The Screaming Meanie can be set to loud, louder, or loudest (which reaches the volume of an ambulance siren). This is a great, small travel option which can also serve as a timer.

, This clock is a carpet you place next to your bed. It comes with an LCD display that reads the time and does not stop sounding until you get out of bed and stand on it., You don’t have to settle for one way of waking up. Choose an alarm clock which utilizes several tactics to get you up and out of bed.Clarity Wake Assure Super Bright alarm clock sounds at 85 decibels, shakes the bed and attaches to your beside lamp to flash your lights.
For even more volume, try the Sonic Boom Super Shaker. Its display lights flash while it shakes your bed and alarms at 113 decibels, which is equivalent to the sound of a jackhammer."

Get some exercise.",How to Get Up in the Morning," You should eat a healthy meal, accompanied by a glass of milk with honey, to ease into a night of good sleep. If you want to make sure you're not tossing and turning throughout the night, then avoid the following foods:


Alcoholic beverages. Though you may think a glass of whiskey or wine helps lull you to sleep, it can actually have the opposite effect. Though alcohol can help you fall asleep faster, it will keep you from falling into a deep sleep and is more likely to make you wake up throughout the night, or wake up earlier than you intended without being able to go back to bed.
Spicy foods or foods that are high in fat.
Coffee. Though some people can't live without it, try not to make coffee a part of your everyday routine. You can allow yourself a cup in the morning now and then when you really need it, like times when you have to get up much earlier than you normally do, or after nights when you went to bed much later than your normal routine.
Chocolate or sugary snacks. This can spike your blood sugar and can make it harder for you to fall asleep or stay asleep.

Try to eat dinner several hours before you go to bed. If you shove a bunch of food into your stomach and pass out right after that, you won't have time to digest your food and will feel unpleasant throughout the night. Just a little light snack before bed, such as a banana or a handful of almonds, can help you fall asleep faster.

;
, This may sound silly, but if you're really desperate to get up in the morning, this is a great trick. That's right — you should actually put on your pajamas, set your room to sleeping conditions, and turn on your alarm. Lie in bed for a minute before it goes off, and visualize what you'll do when the alarm goes off. Then, when it goes off, shut it off and get up immediately and act like you're going to start your day.


If you do this 10 times or so, your body will slowly begin to be trained to get up as soon as your alarm goes off.
If you think this is too extreme of a measure, then you should just visualize getting up instead. For a few minutes before you fall asleep, try to hear your alarm clock in your mind, and visualize how you would turn it off and go about beginning your day. Imagine how great it would feel if you just started your day without being groggy and taking forever to get going.

, Your alarm may be the most important part of your plan to get up in the morning. You should set your alarm to go off more than once just in case you're worried you'll sleep through it. If you really need extra motivation, you can even set multiple alarms to make it even more difficult for you to stay asleep. Here are some other things you can do:


Put your alarm across the room. That way, you'll have to get up to turn it off, which will make it harder for you to fall back asleep.
Put the alarm in another hard-to-reach spot. You could place it high on a bookshelf or even under your bed. Just make sure it's close enough that you can still hear it and that it's not dangerous for you to turn it off.
If you're really committed to your new game plan, you should get a new alarm with a new sound. Your mind may already be programmed to sleep through your old alarm, and a new sound will give your system the shock it may need.
If you have an iPhone or another phone that lets you set a message with your alarm, write yourself a little motivational note to go along with it. Something as simple as, ""Get up for your morning jog! I know you can do it!"" can help motivate you and may even make you smile.

, This is an easy one. There are just three or four things you can do to make the idea of getting up not so painful for you the next day. This will also give you some shortcuts for getting up the next day, and the whole process will be easier and will take less time. Here are a few things you can do:


Lay out your clothes for the next day. Instead of having to rummage around for a clean pair of underwear in the dark, you'll be set and ready to go.
If you like to wake up and feel comfortable, place a nice robe out for yourself as a reward for getting up.
Set up your coffee maker in advance. If you're a tea drinker, make sure your kettle is full of water. You can even place a tea bag in an empty cup.
Place a glass of water next to your bedside. You should drink the water right when you get up, and this will make it easier to do than having to go to the kitchen to pour it. Also, if you wake up in the middle of the night feeling dehydrated, this will make you less likely to fully wake up by having to go to the kitchen to pour a glass.
Leave yourself a small reward for getting up. If you wanted to watch the last fifteen minutes of your favorite show, have it ready on the DVR. If you were excited to read your favorite journal, set it up in your breakfast nook.

, You should go to bed feeling free of worry, happy with yourself and the people around you, and excited about what the next day will bring you. This may sound like a heroic task, but there are just a few things you can do to help yourself fall asleep in a peaceful way.


Don't go to bed mad. This will make it harder for you to fall asleep, and may wake you up in the middle of the night. If you had a fight with your friend or your spouse, try to resolve it as best as you can before you rest your head on the pillow.
Wind down in the hour before bed. That means no texting, no loud TV, no Internet browsing, and no intense conversations. Read a relaxing book and listen to a little classical music. Meditate. Do what you need to do to decompress.
Tell yourself why you're excited to wake up in the morning. Are you really looking forward to that homemade blueberry muffin? Are you excited to catch up with an old friend during lunch? Are you just pumped for an invigorating day of work? Try to think of at least three reasons why you really want to wake up. Write a creative list of those activities so that your anticipated game plan can be reviewed at a glance when you do awake.
Create a game plan. Even if you have a relatively leisurely day ahead of you, make a plan that would be difficult to execute if you woke up too late. This will make you feel more confident, more productive, and excited about the tasks ahead.

, Consistency is key. Sleeping well does not mean sleeping for eight hours whenever you can. In fact, sleeping for eight hours is too much for some people and can even make them groggy. Figure out how much sleep you actually need, which should be somewhere between six and eight hours. Make sure you get that same amount of sleep almost every night.


You should also go to bed and wake up at almost the same time every night. It's okay to sleep in a little and go to bed later on weekends, but if there's a regular dramatic difference between when you get up and go to bed every day, your body will be confused and won't be able to fall into a routine.
Go to bed when you're tired. If you're used to going to bed an hour later but are falling on your feet, make an exception and just go to bed. You will feel much better for it the next day.

, You should do whatever works best for you after you hit that alarm. Still, there are a few tricks that would benefit absolutely everybody and would make it easier for even the soundest sleeper to feel more alert. Here's what you do:


Hit your alarm.
Take a deep breath and fill your lungs with air.
Stretch deeply to wake up your limbs.
Stand up.
Smile. Smiling to yourself will make you feel more positive about starting your day. Even if you feel absolutely silly for doing this, it will make you feel better.
If you feel like your system is still not alert, step outside on your balcony or front porch and take a few deep breaths of crisp morning air.

, Going to the bathroom will help you feel refreshed and can help you get in your morning routine. Brushing your teeth and hair will make you feel more fresh, and the bright lights in the bathroom will slowly wake you up.


Splash cold water on your face.
If you have a hard time waking up, then you should really shower in the morning. This will wake up your system. Keep the water on the colder side. Nothing will make you want to go back to bed faster than a warm bath.
If it helps you wake up, have a radio in the bathroom that plays your favorite music or talk show.

, The wrong breakfast can make you feel sluggish, bloated, and too tired to do anything. Here are some foods you should eat:


Oatmeal or whole grain bread.
Fruit, yogurt, and granola.
Greens like spinach or kale. If eating greens in the morning doesn't feel right, you can blend them into a delicious smoothie.
Eggs. Eggs are full of protein.
Ham or turkey. Just make sure it's on the leaner side.
Avoid foods that are soaked in grease, butter, or maple syrup.

, Exercise is a great way to get your body moving, to improve your energy levels, and to make you feel invigorated. If you don't have time for a full workout, there are still a few small things you can do to wake up your body and get pumped for the day.


Go for a jog around your neighborhood. Your lungs will feel healthier and you will feel more alert when you realize how many people are also waking up.
Take a morning yoga class. This will clear your mind and will get you ready for the day. If you don't have time to go to class, take some time to hit a few poses or meditate in your own home.
Just take a ten-minute walk. Maybe you need to drop something off at the post office or you want to pick up a cup of gourmet coffee. Taking a walk to get there will clear your head.

Maintain a regular sleep schedule.,
Shift your wake up time gradually.,
Avoid consuming caffeine four to six hours before your bedtime.,
Turn off all electronics and distractions a few hours before bed.,
Set an alarm to remind you it’s time for bed.,
Do a relaxing activity before bed.,
Put your clothes out for the next day right before bed.,
Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.,
Wake up with the sun.",How to Become an Early Riser1," Create a sleep schedule where you wake up and go to sleep at the same time everyday, even on weekends or days off. Sleep requirements vary from person to person, but on average, you should be getting between seven to nine hours of sleep to function at your best during your waking hours.Some people think getting just one less hour of sleep won’t affect their daily functioning or that they can make up for lack of sleep on the weekend or a day off. But any changes or shifts to your regular sleep schedule will only have a negative effect on your sleeping habits and lead to oversleeping or being overly tired when you wake up.Keep in mind extra sleep at night cannot cure you of your daytime fatigue. The quantity of sleep you get every night is important, but the quality of your sleep is more important. You may get eight or nine hours of sleep a night but you will not feel well rested if the quality of your sleep was poor.;
, Rather than set your alarm to one hour earlier and hope that you will avoid the snooze button, shift your wake time in increments over a period of time. This will help your body adjust to a new sleep schedule and ensure that your sleep habits adapt long term to your new wake up time.Start with adjusting your alarm so it is set five minutes earlier than usual. Go to bed five minutes earlier than normal and try to wake up with your alarm. Do this for several days to a week and then push back your wake up time by five more minutes. Try to wake up for several days to a week with the new wake up time. Repeat this process until you reach the wake up time you desire.

, About half the caffeine you consume at 7 pm is still in your body at 11 pm.A known stimulant, caffeine can be found in coffee, chocolate, soft drinks, non-herbal teas, diet drugs, and some pain relievers. Limit how many cups of coffee you have several hours before bed, or try to eliminate caffeine in your diet all together.Alcohol also prevents deep sleep and REM sleep. It will keep you in the lighter stages of sleep, causing you to possibly wake up easily and have a harder time falling back asleep. Avoid consuming alcohol 1-2 hours before bed to ensure you get a good night’s sleep and don’t oversleep in the morning., Switch off your television, smartphone, iPad, and computer or keep all electronics out of your bedroom completely. The type of light these screens emit can stimulate your brain, suppress the production of melatonin (which helps you sleep), and interfere with your body’s internal clock.Another option is to shut down your computer on a schedule. This will automatically sleep your machine and prevent you from working on your computer too late or too close to your bedtime. There are sleep features on both PCs and Macs that you can activate. As well, if you want your computer to be ready to go in the morning, once you wake up, you can schedule a startup time too.

, If you tend to get wrapped up in evening activities or conversations and forget to stick to your sleep schedule, you can set an alarm on your phone or computer to alert you 1 hour or 30 minutes before bedtime.


If you prefer to shut down all electronics a few hours before bed, you can use an alarm on your watch or ask someone you live with to remind you of bedtime 1 hour before it’s time.

, This could be a warm bath, reading a good book, or having a quiet conversation with your partner. Doing a restful activity will help to trigger your brain to start relaxing and shutting down.If you find yourself tossing and turning in bed in the dark, don’t lie there and stare up at the ceiling. Instead, do a relaxing activity in bed to calm down and get your mind off your inability to sleep. Doing a restful activity may in fact end up causing you to fall asleep., To save you time in the morning and help you feel less stressed when you wake up, spend time the night before coordinating your outfit. Lay out your clothing on a chair in your closet or by your bed so you can wake up in the morning and not waste time trying to figure out what to wear for the day., Put up heavy curtains or shades to block the light from windows. Cover any electronic displays, like tvs or computers so the light does not glow in the room. You can also use a sleep mask to cover your eyes to help you sleep.If you have difficulty sleeping due to loud noises outside your window or a loud sleep partner, consider investing in good earplugs, or a noise machine.

, You can also set a timer so bright lights come on in your room in the morning at the same time every day. If you are trying to wake up earlier in the morning, adjust your timer so bright lights come on earlier in your room. Sunlight helps your body’s internal clock to reset itself each day. This will also help you avoid oversleeping in the morning, as the sun will cause you to wake up.Sleep experts recommend exposure to an hour of morning sunlight for people who have trouble falling asleep."

Get ready for relaxing sleep.",How to Get up Early," If you snooze, then you really lose. Your snooze alarm won't be long enough for you to actually get any more rest, and hitting snooze will only make you fall back into a restless sleep and to waste so much of your precious time. If you have a solid morning routine, it shouldn't be hard for you to hit your alarm once and to get up and start your day. Okay, who are we kidding — of course it'll be hard at first, but you can build your way towards making it easy.One thing you can do to motivate yourself to not hit the snooze button is to come up with something you're looking forward to doing that you can only accomplish if you have enough time. Maybe you can tell yourself that, if you wake up without hitting snooze, you can watch ten minutes of your favorite morning show, that you can read that article you've been meaning to read, or that you can take a quick refreshing walk around the block. If you tell yourself that you can only do this thing if you get up right away, then you'll be much more motivated to do so.;
, Drinking a refreshing glass of water will start to wake you up and to get your body in order. Stand tall as you're drinking this glass and you'll feel your body and senses slowly come alive. If the water is nice and cold, that can jar you awake even more easily. You can even have a bottle of water waiting for you at your bedside to motivate you to get up early.

, This will also help you stay alert and awake as you go about your morning routine. Get those crusties out of your eyes, gently slap your cheeks, and shake your head from side to side as you start to wake yourself up. If you don't feel the effects at first, splash some more water on that beautiful face of yours!

, Step out on your front porch or balcony and get a few lungfuls of fresh air. This will help you feel awake, alert, and ready to start your day. Changing up your environment like this can also motivate you to wake up. If there are people outside, watch them starting their school and work days and know that you're not alone in your struggle to get up early. This can help you feel more connected and more motivated to get up.

, Having a healthy and nutritious breakfast can give you the energy you need to really wake up your mind and body without weighing you down. Don't eat anything too greasy or fattening, such as a cheese-filled omelet or greasy bacon, and opt for healthier options that can make you stay more alert for longer. Here are some great options you can try:


Lean proteins, such as turkey bacon, lean ham, or egg whites
Veggies such as kale, celery, or spinach
Whole grains such as oatmeal or cereal
A small yogurt

, A cup of coffee or tea can also help you get up early and start your day — some people swear that even the smell of coffee wakes them up! Just one cup of joe can help you feel more alert, but you should avoid having too many cups of coffee throughout your day, or it'll make it harder for you to fall asleep, and to wake up early. If you're a coffee addict, try to work yourself down to just one or two cups a day and avoid having caffeine after noon. This will help you start your day off on the right foot and will keep you from crashing later on in the day.


It goes without saying: avoid energy drinks! Though these sugary treats may help you cram for your calculus exam, they'll make your heart race and will make it much harder for you to fall asleep.

, A hot shower may make you more tired, but a nice cold or only lukewarm shower can help you feel more alert. Though most people like to shower at night, showering in the morning can help you wake up your entire body. Some people like to shower shortly after they wake up, while others like to eat breakfast first. You have to find whatever works for you — and stick to it.

, If you want to be able to go to bed easily and to wake up early, then you have to maintain healthy habits throughout the day. There are many different things you can do to stay alert as you go about your day, but here are a few ideas to make your days easier:


Take a power nap if you need one. Napping for just 20 or so minutes can help you feel refreshed. Napping for over an hour or more, however, can actually lead you to be more tired and can make it harder for you to fall asleep at night.
Exercise in the earlier part of the day. Exercise will help your body release some of its energy and will help you be ready for bed in the evenings. Just don't exercise after the early evening or your adrenaline will still be pumping and will make it harder for you to go to bed.
Spend some time outside. Get some fresh air, be in the sunlight, and don't spend all day cooped up indoors. Doing this will give you some energy during the day, and will help you be ready for sleep when the time comes.
Stay hydrated. Drinking at least 10 8 oz. glasses of water throughout the day will keep your energy up and will help you stay healthy.Eat healthy meals throughout the day. Eat at least three balanced meals that give you protein, fruits and veggies, and take the time to have small snacks, such as fruits, nuts, or yogurt throughout your day so your body never feels like it's running on empty. Find a balance between never feeling super hungry or uncomfortably full, and make healthy eating a part of your daily routine., If you want to wake up early, then you have to plan to go to bed early, or at least earlier than you expected to. One thing you have to do to make this happen is to avoid caffeine in the evenings — ideally, you should avoid it after noon. Even if you may be feeling tired, there are other ways to get that extra energy back, and caffeine should only be a last resort. If you want to go to bed and to wake up without a problem, then skip the caffeine in the afternoon and evening the next time you have a craving., Though a glass of wine or a beer may help you initially pass out after a long day, alcohol actually makes it harder for you to fall into a deep sleep, which is why you can pass out for 8 hours after drinking alcohol and still wake up feeling tired and achy. You can have a glass of wine with dinner, but make sure you don't have anything to drink for at least 2-3 hours before you go to bed, or it'll be harder for you to get to bed, and therefore, harder to get up early., If you eat your dinner late and pass out an hour later, it'll be harder for you to fall asleep because your body will still be digesting the food. Eat a healthy mix of veggies, a protein such as fish or chicken, and healthy carbs, such as brown rice or whole grain pasta. Make sure you get enough food that you don't wake up hungry in the middle of the night, but that you don't eat so much that you feel stuffed and can't fall asleep.


Avoid eating foods that are very spicy, heavy, or creamy, or your body will have a harder time digesting them and it'll be even harder for you to fall asleep.
While staying hydrated throughout your day is important, you should limit the amount of water you drink after 7 pm, or around 3-4 hours before bed. You don't want to have to keep waking up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.

, If you want to make it as easy as possible for yourself to fall asleep, then you should use your bed for sleep and sleep only. If you do work in your bed, watch TV in bed, or even fight with your best friend over the phone in bed, then you'll confuse your bed with a place to be awake instead of a place where you should rest. Make sure not to multitask this vital piece of furniture if you want a restful sleep.


You can also read in your bed a little bit before bed. Just make sure that the material is relaxing — or escapist — and that it doesn't cause you stress.

, Though you may think that watching TV or reading celebrity gossip online helps you fall asleep, it may actually be hurting you when it comes time to get some shut eye. You want your mind to feel as calm and relaxed as possible when you get ready to sleep, so you should shut off your phone, television, and computer at least an hour before bed so your body has time to settle into sleep mode.You can play some light, relaxing music, such as jazz or classical music as you get ready for bed. But don't play any of your favorite pump-up jams, or they will get your mind spinning.

, If you want to be able to easily fall asleep, then you have to find a routine that works for you. Every person is different, but you should play around until you find exactly what it is that makes you fall asleep as easily as possible. This could mean having a cup of chamomile tea, reading some poetry, doing some stretches, or listening to classical music. It can also mean a combination of these things. Maybe you like brushing your hair before bed, or putting on silk pajamas. Find whatever works for you, and do it every night, so your mind knows when you are trying to turn it off.Though some people love to take a warm bath right before bed, you should only do this if you have a few hours remaining before bed. Taking a warm bath actually turns up your body temperature and will keep it up for a little while, which will make it harder to fall asleep.

, This is absolutely crucial if you want to be able to get up early. Though it's important to get between 7-9 hours of sleep a night, it's equally important to go to bed around the same time and to wake up at around the same time every morning so that your body settles into a routine. Find a half-hour window in which you like to go to bed and to wake up and stick to it. You'll be amazed by how much easier it is to wake up early once you stick to it for a while.


If you know you have to wake up early and try going to bed three hours earlier that day, it probably won't work. You'll have to gradually build to waking up and going to bed earlier so your body gets used to it. Waking up super early after you usually wake up pretty late will be quite painful, so it's better to ease into it.
Some people like to use the weekends to catch up on their sleep. You can definitely get a bit more sleep over the weekend — about an hour or so will be fine — but if you dramatically raise the amount of sleep you get over the weekend, it'll be harder for you to settle back in to your weekday routine when the time comes.

, Place your alarm clock on the other side of your room, on your dresser, or just far enough away that you have to get up to turn it off. If it's so close to you that you can reflexively reach out and turn it off, then there won't be anything stopping you from hitting snooze. You should place it out of your reach, but close enough that you can actually hear it, of course.


If you want to really force yourself to get up, you can place a second alarm in a different room. That way, you'll be forced to get up to turn it off, but you won't have to worry about not hearing it.

, Before you go to bed, just as you feel yourself drifting off, imagine what your next day will be like. Imagine hearing your alarm and opening your eyes as you reach for it. Imagine smiling, stretching your arms over your head, yawning, and quickly getting yourself up. Picture yourself having a drink of water, going to the bathroom and starting your day nice and early. If you can visualize this happening, then the next morning, it'll be much easier to make this image a reality.


As you struggle to get up, remind yourself about how easy it was to get up when you imagined it, and try to make it happen.

, Once you've gotten your night-time routine down, all that's left is crawling into bed and closing your eyes. But there are a few small things you should take into account before you do that. Here's what you can do to ensure that your sleep is completely relaxing:


Don't do anything stressful in the evenings. Avoid fighting with your spouse, answering work emails, or having a stressful phone conversation. If something stressful can wait until the next day, put it off so you don't go to bed feeling all frazzled.
Turn down the temperature. Your body will rest more easily if the temperature is 72 degrees or lower. You can even crack open a window if there's a breeze outside.
Say goodbye to your beloved kitty. Though owners love sleeping with their cats, this has been proven to make it harder for them to fall sleep.

Create peaceful and comfortable sleeping conditions.",How to Wake Up Without an Alarm Clock," Your circadian rhythms are 24 hour cycles that influence your physical and mental behaviors. In addition to controlling your natural sleep cycle, they also influence your body's hormone production, body temperature and feelings of hunger. When you wake up feeling groggy in the morning or when you wake up in the middle of the night, you have most likely disrupted your natural circadian rhythm.The different, interacting circadian rhythms in your body are ultimately all controlled by a ""master clock"" know as the the suprachiasmatic nucleus; is located in the hypothalamus of the brain.;
, Before you abandon your alarm clock, you need to fully understand your current sleep patterns. For at least one week, note the time when you go to sleep and the time when you wake up. Studies have shown that, as the work week progresses, many people will go to sleep at a later hour while still having to wake up at the same time, resulting in a chronic loss of sleep. You should aim to correct this naturally by always going to sleep and waking up at the same time.


Disruptions in circadian rhythms occur when your biological clock does not align with your social clock; sleep specialists have called this phenomenon social jet lag. It can lead to serious health problems such as obesity and inflammatory diseases.The CDC recommends that adults receive 7-8 hours of sleep each night and teens receive 9-10 hours of sleep., Your circadian rhythms are partly determined by your exposure to light and darkness. If you leave for work very early in the morning before sunrise and don't see the sun again for the rest of the day, this might be disrupting your body's natural tempo for sleep.


If your work schedule forces you to leave for work and return home in the dark, try to take a brief walk outside during the day so you can be exposed to daylight.If you cannot take a walk during work, try to work near a bright window, or spend your breaks by a window so you can get exposure to daylight.

, If you have a strict work schedule, you might not want to risk suddenly waking up without any assistance, especially if you are not getting the recommended 7-10 hours of sleep a night. Instead, try waking up without an alarm clock on the weekends.


You might have to sacrifice sleeping in later on the weekends. If you have an extended period of time off for a vacation or a holiday, this is also an ideal time to adjust to life without an alarm clock.

, You might currently wake up with a loud, clanging alarm that sounds like a jarring buzzer. Instead, consider an alarm that sounds more natural, such as the sounds of a forest or a rainstorm. If you live on a busy street, you might also want to find an alarm that mimics the sounds of the environment around you, like passing traffic.

, By looking at your phone's screen just before you got to sleep, you are delaying your body's release of melatonin, a hormone necessary for keeping your circadian rhythms on schedule.


Put any phones or tablets away and keep them out of reach should you wake up in the middle of the night.If you have to rely on your phone or tablet for your alarm, set the alarm a few hours before your bedtime so you are not tempted to look at the screen in bed.

, If you currently are using the snooze button when you wake up, you should stop. When you use the snooze button to continually stop and start your sleep cycle, you are fragmenting your circadian rhythms.


When your sleep cycle is frequently disrupted, this creates a condition called sleep inertia. Sleep inertia can have very negative effects on the body and leave you at risk for developing conditions like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease., Once you have practiced waking up without an alarm clock and after you have set an established sleep pattern, you can try waking up without an alarm on a more regular basis. Arranging your bedroom to work with your circadian rhythms is a key step in this process. You should keep your curtains slightly open so your body will adjust to the light of morning; avoid using black out curtains.


Remember that the sun rises in the east; in the northern hemisphere, a south-facing orientation will receive more sunlight, and in the southern hemisphere a north-facing orientation will get more, but unless you are trying to wake up when the sun is high in the sky, you will still want to face to the east to catch the sun when it rises.
If you need to get up before the sun rises, putting the lights in your room on a timer can also help, as this may not seem as disruptive as an alarm clock.

, If you have been using a white noise machine to block out the sounds of trains or street traffic, then you should stop using this (or use one that has a timer, so it stops before morning). If the weather permits, keep your window slightly open so you will hear sounds in the morning that will help wake you up.

, Multiple studies have show that regular exercise can improve the quality of your sleep, especially for people struggling with insomnia or other sleep disorders. You should aim for 30-40 minutes of aerobic exercise, 3-4 times per week.Aerobic exercise includes activities such as going for a walk, a hike, running, swimming or playing a game of soccer or basketball.

, Avoid foods that are high in sugar, fat, and highly processed grains. Instead, consume a diet primarily made of lean proteins, vegetables, fruit, whole grains and minimal fat. Eating a heavy, rich meal close to bedtime might also disrupt your sleep because it will take more energy to digest.


Consider consuming foods rich in tryptophan, like milk, eggs, bananas or nuts. Tryptophan has been shown to help induce sleep., You probably already know that drinking a large cup of coffee before bedtime will likely lead to delayed and disrupted sleep. But many over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers and cold medicines also contain caffeine. Make sure to check the ingredients in your medicine before you take them when you go to sleep., If you are struggling with stress or anxiety, consider taking a few minutes to meditate to clear your mind for sleep. You might consider playing some soft, relaxing music while you practice guided breathing to lull you into sleep. You can learn more at our guide to meditating for sleep here:Maintain a comfortable temperature while you sleep. You might be tempted to pile on many blankets during the winter, or blast the air conditioning in the dead of summer, but consider at which temperature you normally fall asleep. If you turn your heat down at night and have a timer on your thermostat, you can set the heat to come back on about an hour before you want to wake up. Assuming you were at a comfortable sleeping temperature all night, this should prompt you to awaken. You can also use temperature in conjunction with light, since sunlight hitting your bed directly will warm you up.

Avoid hitting the snooze button on your alarm.,
Make your morning routine positive and consistent.,
Try waking up without your alarm.",How to Become an Early Riser2," Though you may be tempted to sleep for just five more minutes in the morning for some extra sleep, hitting the “snooze” button on your alarm will in fact make you more tired. When you hit snooze, your brain goes even deeper into your sleep cycle. By the time you hit “snooze” several more times, and finally wake up, you will feel groggy and even more tired than if you got up with your alarm.If possible, get an alarm without a snooze button. Or disable the snooze option on your existing alarm.

, Stretch and get up, open the curtains of your room and let the morning light in. Treat the morning like a positive experience and commit to looking forward to your day.You may also start a routine of getting dressed and eating breakfast within a certain time. As you get ready, plan out your schedule and your tasks or commitments for the day.

, If you stick to a consistent sleep schedule and maintaining a regular sleeping pattern, you likely will be able to get up on your own at an earlier time, without an alarm.Going to bed at the same time every night and waking up at the same time every night will program your body to get used to a regular sleep schedule. Over time, your body will act as its own alarm clock, and you should be able to wake up on your own at the same time, every day.

Don’t nap after 3 pm.,
Use sleeping pills only when necessary.,
Be aware of over-the-counter medications that can lead to insomnia and sleep issues.,
Start a sleep journal.",How to Become an Early Riser3," The best time for a nap is usually mid afternoon, before 3 pm. This is the time of day you will likely experience afternoon sleepiness or a lower level of alertness. Naps taken before 3 pm should not interfere with your nighttime sleep.Keep your naps short, between 10 to 30 minutes. This will prevent sleep inertia, which is when you feel groggy and disoriented after a nap that goes on for longer than 30 minutes.This will also prevent you from oversleeping the following morning, as naps under 30 minutes should not interfere with your sleep schedule.

, When you take sleeping pills for a brief period of time, and based on your doctor’s recommendations, they can help you fall asleep. But they are just a temporary solution. In fact, sleeping pills can often make insomnia and other sleep issues worse in the long term.Use sleeping pills and medications sparingly for short term situations, like traveling across several time zones or when recovering from a medical procedure.
Using sleeping pills only when necessary, rather than on a daily basis, will also prevent you from being dependent on them to help you sleep every night.

, Many of the side effects of these drugs can have adverse effects on your sleep patterns and daytime alertness. Common medications that can disturb your sleep include:Nasal decongestants.
Aspirin and other headache medications.
Pain relievers that contain caffeine.
Cold and allergy medications containing an antihistamine.
If you are taking any of these medications, try to reduce your dosage. Or research alternative methods to treat these issues so you can stop taking these over-the-counter medications.

, A sleep journal or diary can be a useful tool to help you identify any habits that may be keeping you awake at night and causing you to sleep in. You may also be able to also pinpoint if you are displaying symptoms of a sleep disorder. Update your sleep journal with notes on:What time you went to bed and woke up.
The total sleep hours and quality of your sleep.
The amount of time you spent awake and what you did. For example: “stayed in bed with eyes closed” “counted sheep” “read a book”.
The food and liquids you consumed before bed and the amount of food and liquids you consumed.
Your feelings and moods before bed, such as “happy” “stressed” “anxious”.
How long it took you to get up the morning, and how often you hit the “snooze” button on your alarm.
Any drugs or medication you took, such as sleeping pills, including the dose and time of consumption.
Notice any triggers that start to repeat themselves in your sleep journal and see if there are ways you can prevent or limit these triggers. For example, maybe you often get a bad night’s sleep on a Friday after drinking two beers, or you tend to sleep in after watching tv past midnight. Try not to drink at all the following Friday or skip your late night television routine and see if this improves your sleep.

Find the issue.,
Look at your workload.,
Check to see if you're being challenged.,
Take a look at your relationships.,
Bring the fun with you.",How to Beat the Monday Morning Blues1," If you're feeling down on Monday morning, it's likely because you're not a fan of your work. Maybe it's the job itself, or maybe it's the people you work with. Take some time to think about what really bothers you about your job by brainstorming for a period. Write down the issues that are really bothering you.Of course, this principle applies no matter what situation you're in. Maybe you dread Monday because you're a student, and you don't like the degree you're pursuing. Maybe you're a stay-at-home parent who needs to make a few changes to make your life a little better.
You could write things such as, ""I don't feel challenged,"" ""I don't like it when my ideas aren't heard,"" or ""I feel overwhelmed."";
, If you dread Monday morning because of the workload you have facing you, you may need to talk to your boss. Maybe your workload has increased to a point where you can't keep your usual standards. If your boss is reasonable, he or she may be able to adjust what you are doing, or at the very least, adjust the quality that he or she expects.Before going in, understand how your boss operates. Maybe she plays it by the numbers, or maybe he's more driven by emotional appeals. Whatever the case, know what works best before walking in, and have your appeal planned out. If your boss is more interested in numbers, maybe you can compare the number of cases or emails you're dealing with now to a year ago to show the increase. For someone more emotional, talk about the effect it's having on your family.If you're a student, consider dropping a class if it won't affect your financial aid. If you're continually stressed out, you're coursework will suffer. Dropping a class will allow you to focus more time on your other classes.
As a stay-at-home parent, maybe you can schedule more time for yourself by picking a once-a-week daycare. In fact, many churches and other organizations have parent's day out programs to give parents a break.

, If you're doing the same thing over and over, you may find you've settled into a routine where you're bored out of your mind. To help get you over the hump, ask your boss if you can have some more challenging work. Your boss will be impressed, and you'll find your job more satisfying.Try asking in this way: ""I've been feeling like much of my work is the same lately. I was wondering if I could try something a little different to spice things up.""
If you're a student, consider taking a class that is well outside your major, just to offer a different challenge.
If you're a stay-at-home parent, maybe you need to spice up your life a bit by taking a class at a community college or starting a book club with friends.

, If you aren't getting along with specific co-workers, ask yourself what the problem is. Trying being a little nicer to them to draw out their happier side. If you have a big issue co-worker, don't be afraid to have a calm, sit-down chat with him or her about the issue. If that still doesn't work, ask your boss for assistance.


Be as non-confrontational as possible when talking to co-workers. For instance, you wouldn't want to say, ""Why are you so hateful?"" However, you might say something along these lines: ""I've noticed that I sometimes seem to upset you. What can I do to help the situation?"" By turning it back on yourself, it will be less upsetting to the other person, but you're still putting it out there to start a dialogue.
Sometimes Monday morning blues may have nothing to do with what's happening on Monday, but rather, what's going on over the weekend to make you upset. Maybe your relationships are stalling or making you unhappy, and that unhappiness is lasting to Monday morning. Take some time to talk to the people you care about to make sure you are both ok.

, Surprise your co-workers with a freshly baked batch of cookies. Ask your boss if you can host a chili cook-off some Monday at lunch. Invite your co-workers out to lunch. Make your Mondays more enjoyable, and you'll look forward to them more."

Use air conditioning.,
Use fans.,
Keep the sun out.,
Sleep downstairs.",How to Stop Getting So Hot While Sleeping1," The simplest way to keep your room cool while you sleep is to use your air conditioner if you have one. Central air or a portable window unit will both do the trick. The ideal sleeping temperature for most people is between 60 and 70 °F (16 and 21 °C).If you have a programmable thermostat, don't forget to set it so that it automatically adjusts to a warmer temperature just before you wake up in the morning.;
, If you don't have air conditioning, a fan is the next best option. You can use a fan to increase circulation, create a cross breeze, and pull hot air away from you.If you have a ceiling fan, set it so that the blades are turning counter-clockwise. This should help pull the hot air up towards the ceiling and away from your bed.
If it's cooler outside than it is in your room, try putting a box fan in an open window facing outside.
Multiple fans can be used to create a nice cross breeze in your room, especially if you have two windows on opposite walls.
You can also try creating an old school air conditioner by placing a large block of ice or pile of ice cubes in front of a fan. Just make sure to use a large enough bowl or pan so that the water has somewhere to go when the ice melts!

, On really hot days, keep your bedroom cool by keeping your blinds closed all day. You will have to deal with a dark room, but it will be much cooler when it's time for bed.Thermal blinds or shades might be a good investment if the sun makes your room unbearably hot in the summer. They will also help prevent drafts in the winter.
If you own your home, you might want to consider planting trees near your bedroom windows to give yourself some shade.

, Heat rises, which means that the second floor of your home will typically be warmer than the first floor. If you live in a two story house and you can't get your second-floor bedroom cool enough on hot nights, consider setting up a temporary sleeping area on the main level."

Move your furniture.,
Cover your walls.,
Insulate the floor and ceiling.,
Sound-proof your windows.,
Use white noise.,
Play something distracting.,
Wear earplugs.,
Identify the source the noise.,
Talk to noisy neighbors.,
Address environmental noise.",How to Sleep with Lots of Noise," If you share a wall with a loud neighbor or a noisy street, rearranging your furniture could help quell some of the sound coming into your home. Adding additional furniture to your bedroom can help muffle sound, and rearranging existing furniture could help distance your bed from the source of the noise.Move your bed to the side of the room farthest from the noise source. If you share a wall in an apartment building, for example, and your bedroom wall is in your neighbor's living room, try pushing your bed to the far side of the room.Positioning large, thick pieces of furniture against a noisy wall can help absorb and muffle some of the sound. Try putting a bulky bookshelf against the wall and filling it with books to help block out noise.;
, To absorb noise effectively from a wall that lets a lot of sound through, try covering the wall with an absorbent material. Acoustic panels work best, and for added absorption you can opt for acoustic panels wrapped in thick fabric.Choose panels that have a noise reduction rating of 0.85 or higher.Try acoustical blankets. These specialty cloths are designed to be hung on the wall to muffle outside sound., If the noise in your home is coming from below, you can reduce noise by insulating the floor. You can do this by putting down carpets, or by actually insulating the floor below the baseboards.Cork works best for flooring materials. It insulates sound much better than most woods.If you can't put wall-to-wall carpeting down, opt for a thick, large area rug.If you own your own home and have an attic above your bedroom, you can also insulate the floor of the attic. Use R25 fiberglass at least eight inches thick to help insulate the space above your room.Use acoustically-rated ceiling tiles with a ceiling attenuation class (CAC) of at least 40 and an NRC of at least 55. This should help block most types of noise, as these ceiling tiles are designed for use on homes located near an airport., If noise keeps coming in from the street or from other noisy neighbors, you can try soundproofing your windows. Be sure to latch down your blinds because they may rattle. This option will require a bit of work and may get costly, but it should prove effective at blocking out the sound.


Install double or secondary glazing windows. Both types of windows are effective at insulating your home and blocking outside noise.Hang thick curtains in your bedroom windows to help block some noise.Check the windows for gaps. These tiny spaces between the window and the wall don't just let in a draft of air, they can also let outside noise slip in. Use a safe insulating foam sealant made for use on windows and doors to stop up these gaps and help seal your room off from the noise outside your home., Ambient sounds such as white noise are often helpful for blocking out louder, sharper sounds by ""masking"" those noises with a gentle, tolerable sound.That's because white noise delivers a uniform amount of sound at every audible frequency.White noise reduces the difference between typical background sound and sudden noises, like a door slamming or a car honking, that could potentially interrupt sleep.You can buy a specialty white noise machine, download white noise tracks online, or simply keep a fan blowing in your room while you sleep., If you don't have a white noise machine or fan handy, you can try using household items to distract you and drown out undesirable noise. A television or radio can help block outside sounds, but researchers caution that leaving a TV or radio on all night could disrupt your natural sleep patterns. For best results, researchers recommend using a timer to ensure that the radio or television will automatically turn off at a certain time., Earplugs are an effective way to help block outside noises while you sleep. They're even more effective if you combine earplugs with white noise in your room. You can buy earplugs at many pharmacies, or online.Earplugs may take some getting used to and be uncomfortable at first.


Always wash your hands before putting in ear plugs to minimize the risk of infection.To remove, twist the earplug while slowly pulling outwards.If an ear plug doesn't seem like a good fit, don't force it. Every brand shapes their product differently, and you may simply have to try a different brand.Familiarize yourself with the risks of earplugs before you use them. Removing them too quickly or pushing them in too far can lead to a ruptured eardrum. They can also introduce bacteria into the ear canal, which could cause an infection. In addition, the earplug may muffle important sounds, such as your alarm to wake up, a smoke alarm, or the sound of someone breaking in., The cause might be particularly obvious, but before you can address the problem you need to know its underlying cause. How you proceed will depend on the cause of your noise problem.


Oftentimes, unwanted noise is caused by neighbors. Do you have a neighbor who plays loud music or throws loud parties while you're trying to sleep? Do you live next door to a particularly noisy couple?
Depending on where you live, your noise problem may be caused by nearby bars, clubs, and restaurants, or traffic centers like airports, train tracks, and highways.

, Being honest and direct is the best approach, but it can be tricky. You don't want to upset your neighbors, but you also don't want to with perpetual noise, unable to sleep. Polite and friendly communication is generally considered the best way to address the noise problem when your neighbors are the cause.Don't come banging on the door while the noise is happening. That will only create tension and force your neighbor to feel defensive. Wait until things have died down, or approach your neighbor the next day.Likewise, don't call the police over noise complaints. The police generally have better things to do, and your neighbors will resent you. They may even try to retaliate or escalate the situation. No one likes having the police called on them, so be open and polite with your neighbors and leave the law out of it.Approach your neighbor with courtesy and kindness. Be honest about the problem and maintain an even temper and a friendly demeanor. Say something like, ""Hi neighbor. I was wondering if I could talk to you about something. Do you have a few minutes?""Then speak with them about the noise issue. It might be best to approach them with a reasonable plan. For instance, you might say, ""I hear you playing your guitar at night. That's cool, but do you think you could practice before 11pm? I have to get up early for work and it's difficult for me to get to sleep.""If all else fails, contact your landlord or try bringing in a professional mediator. These professionals are trained to work with both parties to arrive at a mutual understanding., If the noise is caused by things in your community, such as traffic or construction, you can raise those concerns with a municipal representative. Some communities have a noise code task force in place.Others have a municipal noise control officer in place to review complaints and determine a course of action.For other communities, you may have to simply bring the issue before your local city council, and a vote may be taken on how to proceed.


The process for filing a city complaint over urban noise pollution (i.e., noise not caused by a loud neighbor or other direct source) is vastly different from one community to the next. Search online to learn about the process in your community, or contact a representative at city hall to inquire about how to address noise pollution in your neighborhood.

Look ahead at the end of the week.,
Focus on what is good.,
Adjust your attitude.,
Have something to look forward to.",How to Beat the Monday Morning Blues2," On Friday afternoon, you want to get out of the office or school, and you might leave some loose ends undone. However, if you take some time on Friday to tie up what needs done for the week, you won't have it hanging over your head come Monday morning. Don't leave what you hate for Monday. Similarly, take a look at your schedule so you know what's ahead for the week.For instance, if you need to see financial aid about a problem, go ahead and get it done on Friday. Don't wait until Monday.
Similarly, if you have meet with a client you don't particularly like dealing with, go ahead and see him or her on Friday rather than leaving it to the next week.
As a parent, maybe you want to schedule a fun outing on Monday and finish up some of the housework on Fridays to be ready for the weekend.

, Don't just look at what you need to do that you hate. Look at what you enjoy doing, and focus on that. For instance, maybe you hate cold-calling people. Try to put that out of your mind, and focus on the fact that you get to design a new header this week, if that's something you love doing.Maybe you have a class that you just don't like. Focus instead on the classes you love, or try to find something you like in the class.

, Your problem with work may not be one that can be solved with any outside intervention. It may just take a change of heart on your end. If you look on your work as solely a chore to be pushed through, then you will continue to dread Mondays. You have to think of work as just another part of your life that has both its ups and downs like any other part.Of course you love staying home with your kid because you love your kid. However, maybe you're finding you just don't like it, and you're still stuck in that situation for awhile.

Get your exercise.",How to Beat the Monday Morning Blues3," Don't drag work home over the weekend if possible. The weekend should give you a break from work, not be a continuation of it. If you work over the weekend, your work weeks will run into each other, you'll start to experience burn out. Take a break to give yourself some time to regain your sanity., If you notice that you know more about your colleagues' lives than you do about your spouse's or friends' lives, you may be spending too much time at work. Take a step back, and commit to spending more time developing your relationships outside of work.One way to accomplish this goal is to ask if you can work from home one day a week. You'll at least cut down on your commuting time, giving you some more time with your family.
The same holds true for school or for stay-at-home parents. You don't want your whole life to become school or your kids. You need your own life and sense of self outside of those parts of your life, despite how important they are.

, That is, go to bed early on Sunday night and make sure you ready yourself for the week ahead. You don't want to start the week by feeling tired or drowsy., You know it's important to have a sleep schedule; it lets your body know when to be ready for bed and when to get up. You may be tempted to skip the schedule on the weekends, but that only throws your body clock off and makes you drowsy come Monday morning. Try to go to sleep and get up at about the same time on the weekends., Whether it's a new necktie or a sparkly pair of earrings, choose something to wear on Monday that makes you perk up., Exercise will naturally boost your mood and has the added benefit of helping you sleep better."

Breathe deeply.,
Rest your eyes.,
Avoid energy drinks.",How to Stay Up Late Without Feeling Tired Later1," If you anticipate staying up late, take a preparatory nap to better equip your body to deal with sleep deprivation. Set an alarm and aim to sleep for about 2 hours, which will improve your level of alertness for approximately 24 hours. A planned nap will do more to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation than a nap taken after you miss sleep., If you want to stay up late and feel alert later, keep yourself hydrated. Dehydration can cause fatigue, particularly if you’re operating on less sleep than usual. Drink as much water as possible and eat water-rich foods such as watermelon and cucumber.Steer clear of alcoholic and caffeinated drinks, which can be dehydrating.

, Your body needs fuel to stay awake longer, but choosing the right food is important. Foods high in carbohydrates release serotonin in the brain, which can cause lethargy in the short term. Opt instead for a high protein snack, which might include:Peanut butter on celery
Beef jerky
Almonds

, Deep breathing can improve your mental state and level of alertness, particularly when you are feeling drowsy or sleep-deprived. It works by slowing down your heart rate and lowering blood pressure, which in turn improves your circulation and overall energy. Practice deep breathing both when you are staying up late, and later on., Whether you’re watching TV, looking at a computer screen, or reading a book, resting your eyes is a good idea every hour or two. Eye strain can cause fatigue and will leave you feeling drained in the long run. To avoid falling asleep, set an alarm on your phone and allow yourself to close your eyes for 10 minutes, putting your head down if you wish., Steer clear of energy drinks, which may offer a quick energy boost but are only good for brief periods of alertness. These drinks are extremely high in caffeine, which can be dehydrating and may cause serious heart problems if consumed in large amounts. Energy drinks are also usually very high in sugar and may cause elevated blood pressure, heightened anxiety, and disrupted sleep patterns."

Adjust your covers.,
Change your sheets.,
Change your pillow.,
Bring something cold to bed.,
Try an alternative bed.",How to Stop Getting So Hot While Sleeping2," If you use the same quilt or comforter year-round, you might need to reevaluate. If you find yourself waking up hot when you sleep, your covers may be too heavy and trap heat in your bed. , Fabrics like flannel and satin don't breath and can trap heat in the bed with you, causing you to overheat. Switch out these materials for cotton sheets. They will allow better circulation, which will help cool you off throughout the night., Down pillows can trap heat around your head, which can cause your whole body to overheat. Replace your pillow with a different kind of pillow, such as a buckwheat pillow. This material is a little less comfortable, but it breaths more and allows more air to reach your head while you sleep., To make your bed nice and cool, try bringing something chilly, like a frozen water bottle or a cold compress, to bed with you. There are lots of different approaches you can take to cool your bed down.Try putting your sheets and pillowcase in the fridge or freezer a few hours before bed. Remove them when you are getting ready for bed, putting the chilled sheets on your bed right before you lay down. The material will be nice and cold and help keep you cool while you sleep.
Try placing a cold compress on your pulse points at your ankles, wrists, neck, elbow, groin, and behind the knees. You can use a frozen washcloth, and ice pack, or a bag of frozen vegetables. This will cool your core temperature down and help reduce your heart rate, which increases as you heat up.
If you need some cooling down, but don't want to be too chilly, consider going to bed with damp hair, or even placing a damp sheet on your bed. You can also mist your whole body with some water. This works best if you can open a window for a nice breeze.
There are also a variety of high-tech cooling devices on the market, including pillows and mattress pads that are designed to keep your bed at the ideal temperature for sleeping., If there is nothing you can do to make your regular bed cool enough on hot nights, you might want to try sleeping in a hammock or a cot. Both of these will increase the airflow to your skin, which will cool you down as you sleep. They are also typically lower to the ground than most beds, which will get you away from hot air."
"
Evaluate your sleeping clothes.,
Warm your skin.,
Drink cool water.,
Eat smaller meals at night.,
Avoid body contact.",How to Stop Getting So Hot While Sleeping3," It is important to consider not just the amount of clothing that you wear to bed, but the materials the clothing is made of as well. Some materials, such as cotton, breathe much better than other materials, such as polyester or Lycra. When your clothing doesn't breathe, it holds in the temperature and will continue to keep you warm throughout the night. Try loose-fitting cotton pajamas.Sleeping nude may keep you cool by allowing for optimal air flow, but some people believe that sleeping in clothes is actually more effective because the material wicks away the moisture that can accumulate on your skin as you sleep. Try both if you like and see what works best for you.

, It may seem counterintuitive, but warming your skin with a warm shower or sauna before bedtime may actually help you cool down. This is effective because it triggers your body's natural cooling response.If a warm shower or sauna will raise the temperature and/or humidity in your bedroom, you may not want to do this.You can try a cool shower also, but don't make it too frigid, or your body may compensate by raising its temperature., To help cool yourself down and keep yourself hydrated, drink plenty of cool water on warm days. You can also keep a glass or bottle of water next to you bed as you sleep. That way, if you wake up overheated, you can sip a little cool water and reduce your body temperature to help you get back to sleep.Try not to drink too much water before bed. You don't want to interrupt your sleep with bathroom breaks all night.

, When you eat large amounts of food later in the day, your metabolism has to work harder to digest the food. This can cause your body temperature to increase during the night goes because your body is still digesting the food. Try eating smaller meals so your body will have less to digest and your body will be cooler as you sleep.Raw fruits and vegetables require less metabolic energy to digest than proteins and fats, so these are great choices for evening snacks.

, Whether you sleep alone or with someone else, skin on skin contact causes your body heat to rise.If you sleep alone, try sleeping spread eagle, with your legs and arms spread apart. Your skin will have as much access to air on all sides as possible.
If you sleep with a partner, avoid cuddling or spooning while you sleep. This increases your body temperature, especially if you both run hot at night.

These symptoms are very common and will most often subside after menopause.You can take some simple steps to help control your symptoms at home, such as exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing stress, quitting smoking, and avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods.
If your hot flashes and night sweats become intolerable, your doctor may prescribe hormones, antidepressants, or other drugs to help control your symptoms.

, Many commonly prescribed medications, including antidepressants, hormonal therapy, and hypoglycemic agents, can cause night sweats. If you suspect that your symptoms may be caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about your options. You may be able to switch to another medication, or your doctor may prescribe additional medications to help you manage your symptoms.Never stop taking your medication or reduce your dosage without first talking to your doctor.

, Anxiety can cause you to experience hot flashes because your body is telling itself that it is in danger, which causes your blood vessels to constrict. If you believe you are suffering from anxiety, see a doctor right away. A combination of therapy, medication, and exercise may help you control your symptoms., If you're experiencing night sweats that are not caused by your environment, you may have an underlying medical condition, such as tuberculosis or another bacterial infection. Be sure to discuss all of your symptoms with your doctor for a proper diagnosis.You may also have Idiopathic hyperhidrosis, which is a condition that causes the body to produce too much sweat for no known reason."

Pick the most comfortable position for you.,
Use pillows to increase your comfort.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Limit your movement while you sleep.",How to Sleep with Broken Ribs1," You may find that sleeping on your back is the most comfortable position when you have broken ribs, or you may find it more comfortable to sleep on your side. Both of these sleep positions are okay to use when you have broken ribs. Sleeping on your side or on your back will also help to make breathing easier.Try out different positions to find the most comfortable position for you.



Try sleeping on the injured side. If your broken ribs are only on one side, some physicians recommend that you sleep on the injured side because it restricts the movement of your injured ribs and allows you to breathe more deeply on your uninjured side. However, if this position is painful for you, then do not try to sleep on your injured side.

Try sleeping in a recliner. For some people with broken ribs, sleeping in a recliner is more comfortable than sleeping in a bed.;
, Pillows and cushions can help to prevent you from rolling over in the night, which can be painful may even cause you to wake up in the night. If you are sleeping on your back, then try placing a pillow under each of your arms to keep you from rolling onto your sides. You can also place a couple of pillows under your knees to reduce some of the strain on your back., Broken ribs may cause you to take shallow breaths due to the pain associated with moving your chest too much. For this reason, it is a good idea to do some deep breathing throughout the day and right before bed as well. Practicing deep breathing can help you to relax and it will also ensure that you are getting plenty of oxygen.To practice deep breathing, lie on your back or recline in a chair and slowly take in a deep breath. Count to five as you take in the breath and then slowly exhale out as you count down from five. As you breathe, try to pull the air down into your belly with your diaphragm.

, During the first few days, you will need to limit coughing, twisting, turning, and stretching. This might be harder to remember or control at night. Just try to keep in mind that your ribs are connected to many parts of your upper body, so movement can increase your pain.


Try keeping an extra pillow handy so that you can brace it against your ribs when you need to cough during the night.Avoid wrapping your ribs to minimize movement. Wrapping your ribs increases your risk of collapsed lungs and lung infections."

Filter out light.,
Adjust the temperature.,
Remove distractions.",How to Stay Up Late Without Feeling Tired Later2," Make the most of your limited sleep after staying up late by blocking out LEDs and standby lights from your electronics, which may diminish your quality of sleep. Cover lights on your laptop, modem, and other gadgets by putting masking tape over them, or by placing other things in front of them (e.g. a large book). Alternatively, wear a sleep mask to block out all distracting light., For the best sleep that you can get, adjust the temperature of your bedroom to 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 15-20 degrees Celsius).

Acknowledge your fear.,
Keep a journal.,
Talk to a professional.,
Look for a solution.,
Shift your focus.",How to Sleep Without Worrying About House Fires or Other Disasters1," It can be frustrating and scary to lie awake at night worrying. Maybe your concern is that your house will catch fire. Or maybe you are worried about a devastating earthquake. Your first step in dealing with these fears is to acknowledge them.Think about the symptoms of your anxiety. Does it disrupt your sleep in physical ways? For example, does your heart race?
Even if your major problem is a worrying mind that won't quit, that can still really affect your quality of life. Acknowledging your fears means that you are one step closer to being able to successfully cope with those fears.
Try saying it out loud. For example, ""I worry that my house will burn down and it is keeping me from sleeping. I need to find a way to deal with this issue.""
You may need to consider professional help in facing these fears.;
, It can be helpful to look for patterns to help you figure out when your fears are at their worst. Try writing down instances when the fears are particularly intense. Keeping a journal can help you figure out if there are any instances that seem to trigger your fears.Make a habit of writing in your journal each morning or evening. Make a note of the things you did that day and rate your anxiety level.
Maybe you will notice patterns. For example, you might realize that every night you watch the news, there is a report of a natural disaster somewhere. This could cause your anxiety to spike.
If you find a pattern like this, you could take steps to avoid those triggers. Perhaps you could avoid watching the evening news.

, Talk therapy can be an incredibly effective way to deal with anxieties. A mental health professional can help you address your fears. In therapy, you can also work to find ways to cope with those fears.Maybe there is a definitive reason you are scared of fire. For example, if you were in a house fire as a child, you will obviously still have traumatic memories.
A counselor can help you find ways to acknowledge those fears. If the root cause is less clear, the counselor can help you explore your past and present to try to find reasons for your anxiety.
If you can find an explanation for your fear, it can be easier to find a solution that will work for you.
Ask your regular doctor to recommend a reputable therapist. You can also ask close friends or family for recommendations.

, Once you address your fear, you can look for ways to put your mind at ease. You might be able to sleep better if you know you have taken steps to ensure your safety. For example, you could create a fire safety plan.Hold regular fire drills. Make sure that each member of your family knows the best way to exit your home in the case of a fire.
Have the wiring in your home checked regularly by a professional. This will help ease worries about electrical fires.
If you are worried about a natural disaster, make a plan for that. For example, you could make an earthquake preparedness kit.
Prepare for a major earthquake by having a store of batteries, bottled water, and food.
When you feel yourself worrying, you can comfort yourself by knowing that you have taking all possible steps to prepare in case of the worst.

, Sometimes your mind just needs a break from worrying. If you find yourself having anxiety, ask yourself, ""Is this something I can control?"" If the answer is no, try to refocus your energy.For example, many people worry about a terror attack. This is a real fear. However, it is not one that many people have control over.
If you find yourself worrying about terrorists, take a break from the news. It's okay to go television-free for a few days.
Taking a break from the cause of your anxiety can reset your brain and allow you to relax and get some rest.
Try focusing your nervous energy on something you can control. Have you been meaning to clean out the garage? Spend your time doing that instead of worrying.

Try over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Apply ice to your ribs.",How to Sleep with Broken Ribs2," If your doctor has prescribed pain medications for you, then taking your medication about 30 minutes before you go to bed may help to control your pain. Make sure that you follow your doctor’s instructions for how to use your medication and ask your doctor as soon as possible if you have any questions or problems.Keep in mind that some pain medications may make it hard to stay asleep because they can cause sleep apnea. For example, opioid medications such as codeine and morphine can cause you to stop breathing and wake you up in the night., You can use over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen.If you do not have prescription pain medicine for your broken ribs, then you can take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Check with your physician for a specific recommendation of what or how much to take. Do not take more than the recommended dosage.If you have or have had heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, stomach ulcers or internal bleeding, ask your physician to see if you can safely take one of these medications.

, Ice will help to numb the pain a bit and it may also help to reduce the swelling. During the first two days after your injury, you may benefit from using a covered or wrapped ice pack for about 20 minutes every hour. After the first couple of days, you can use the ice pack for 10 to 20 minutes at least three times per day.Try applying an ice pack just before you go to bed to help with the pain.
Avoid using heat on broken ribs, especially if there is swelling. Heat increases blood flow to the area of application, which can make swelling worse."

Find a mask which blocks enough light.,
Choose a mask appropriate for your sleeping position.,
Select a comfortable fabric.,

Shift your mask up to your forehead.,
Relax in bed.,
Turn off the lights and pull down your mask.,
Focus on positive imagery and deep breathing.,
Respond to sleeplessness by getting up.",How to Sleep with an Eyemask on," If you are looking for a mask to help you sleep at night in a relatively dark bedroom, then the mask doesn't need to be particularly thick since there will be very little light. If you are looking for a mask to help you sleep on a plane, in a car, or during the day, then you will want to find a heavier-duty mask.It is best to shop for your eye mask in person, since many of the important qualities (amount of light blocked, fit, comfort, etc.) are very difficult to evaluate while shopping online.;
, Masks will typically tie or clasp closed at either the front or side of the head. Laying your head on the side where the mask closes can cause discomfort and make it difficult to sleep. Make sure that the mask you select closes in a location which will not interfere with your preferred sleeping position., Eye masks are made of many different materials, from natural materials like cotton and wool, to synthetic materials like polyester. Some masks (especially inexpensive varieties) may be made of materials which not everyone will find comfortable. Even a minor tickle or irritation on your face or head may make sleeping in the mask very difficult. Make sure to try the mask on before you buy it, if you can., An eye mask which is the wrong shape for your face may cause discomfort, and allow in excess light. Try different brands and sizes of mask until you find one that you can wear comfortably. When properly adjusted, your mask should be tight enough that it doesn't slide freely around on your face, but not so tight that the mask is pressed down directly on your eyes.
Pay attention to how well the mask fits around the bridge of your nose. If the fit is not correct, you may be able to see light entering through a gap between the mask and your nose. Masks are available with elastic patches covering the bridge of the nose, blocking out the excess light.

, A wide variety of mask options are available with additional features, such as comfortable gel filling, integral ear muffs to block sound, or pleasant scents. Take a look at what optional features are available, and decide if they suit your needs.


Some new sleep masks have interesting features like flashing lights that may help you fall asleep or have a lucid dream or help to monitor your sleep patterns. There's not a whole lot of research on whether these devices are effective, but they may be interesting to try.

, This should be done before you go to bed, or otherwise prepare for sleep. Trying to adjust your mask once you are ready to sleep can be irritating and distracting, especially in the dark.Having someone nearby to help you fasten and adjust your mask is a good idea, especially if your mask ties closed.
If you don't have your sleep mask with you, you can try covering your eyes with a pillow, blanket, or article of clothing. You can also use your arm as an improvised eye mask, draping your elbow over your face.

, Wearing your mask on your forehead means it will be very simple to access once you're ready to sleep. Once it is in position, you can forget about it and focus on your normal bedtime routine.

, Getting into bed and spending time performing a relaxing activity, such as reading, before donning your eye mask will relax you, and prepare you to go to sleep. Set aside an hour for relaxing in bed, if you can.Avoid using electronic devices or watching television right before bed. The light produced by electronic screens may make it more difficult for you to fall asleep.
It is best to relax in low light, such as the light of a small bedside lamp. This will allow your eyes and brain to begin to relax, and ready themselves for sleep. Best to use a light with low levels of blue light or use a dimmer on your lamp.If you are trying to sleep on an airplane, or in another public place, it may be helpful to put on headphones, or use earplugs to block out outside noise so that you can focus on relaxing.

, Having spent time relaxing, you should feel sleepy, and ready to close your eyes. Check to make sure your mask is still adjusted to a comfortable setting, then switch off the lights, pull the mask over your eyes and lay down your head.

, If you are troubled by anxious thoughts before sleeping, try turning your mind instead to happy or beautiful images or memories. Some find it helpful to simply count their breaths, which should be deep and slow. Let your mind drift with whatever positive thoughts come to mind. You should soon be asleep., If you find you are still unable to sleep after 20 minutes or so, you should lift up your eye mask, turn on a dim light, and get out of bed. It is best to go to another room, if you can. Spend a few minutes reading, listening to calming music, or enjoying another relaxing activity. Once you are ready, go back to bed, adjust your sleeping mask to a comfortable setting, turn out the lights, and lay down your head.Be sure to lift up or take off your mask before trying to get up or turn lights on to avoid knocking things over or tripping.

Get your adrenaline going before bed.,
Make yourself tired.,
Try visualization and other relaxation techniques.,
Tell yourself you're exhausted.,
Bore yourself to sleep.,
Soothe yourself.,
Take power naps when needed.,
Think positively.,
Focus on your body before sleep.,
Get your to-do list done every day.,
Do not lie down during the day just to rest.,
Establish a regular sleeping routine.,
Have evening and morning routines, too.,
Keep a sleep diary.,
Cut down on alcohol, caffeine, and other drugs.",How to Sleep with Bipolar Disorder," Before falling asleep, make your body go through an adrenaline rush. This doesn't have to physically drain you much, it just has to drain your mind. Use any method, be it your imagination or dancing and sweating it all out. After this adrenaline rush, your mind will feel tired and need to take a break, helping in putting you to sleep and lessening the effects of the mania.


This is the reason adrenaline junkies are comparatively much healthier than any drug addict; however, this does not justify an adrenaline addiction under any circumstances. Adrenaline can be helpful if done occasionally; don't make a habit of it.;
, During the day, work out, stay active, and don't lie down. Why? It is much easier to fall asleep when you have drained yourself to the point where you cannot stand to stay awake any longer. When the body is tired, it automatically send signals that it needs to take a break. Generally speaking, it's easier to get better, peaceful and uninterrupted sleep if you are tired. Consider it shutting down your whole system and letting it charge.


When the body is exhausted, there is no need to make an extra effort to shut the mind off or to try hard to fall asleep because all the strength that has been sucked out of your body does the work for you. Your mind finds it easier to come down from the manic episode, allowing your body to fall to sleep.

, It is important to figure out a way to fall asleep even when the last thing you feel is tired. A good way to do that is by using visualization and relaxation techniques. These can help you settle down and will prepare your mind for a restful night’s sleep.


Even though there are many visualization techniques you can use, a very popular one is to picture a situation when you were very tired and could not wait to go to bed – imagine the way you look, subtle music and a big, very comfortable bed. Use your imagination and make the visualization as vivid as possible – the more life-like and alluring it is the more likely you are to start feeling sleepy.

, Talking has always been a helpful part of treating any part of a psychological disorder and the same is true in reducing the tensions of bipolar disorder. While lying down on the bed, tell yourself that it’s late and that you need to sleep. More than that, tell yourself that you are sleepy and tired even if you are not. This may help your mind put away the mania and think that you are sleepy, putting you to sleep.


Just like confidence, happiness, and every other emotion is in your head, you can urge your brain to sleepiness, too. This is especially helpful if your self-talk is supported by other external cues your mind associates with oncoming sleep, like blankets, comfortable clothes, dim lighting, and white noise.

, A tried-and-true way to fall asleep is to do something that bores you. Even mania can't resist the lures of boredom. Here are a few ideas to get your mind so unstimulated that sleep is the inevitable result:


Lie down and count the stars in the sky
Imagine a herd of sheep and count them
Watch a documentary or a program that doesn't interest you
Read a textbook
Go through the newspaper

One thing to remember is that ""boring"" techniques differ from person to person based on their personal interests. Stick to what you know bores you the most.



, There are different techniques used for relaxing the body, which, if done right before the time you decide to sleep, might help you in sleeping better and getting rid of those turbulent thoughts. Here are some ideas:


Get a massage right before sleeping
Take a warm shower before sleeping.
Have a warm glass of milk
Rub your stomach and wiggle your toes
Do deep breathing exercises
Meditate for 30 minutes.
Do yoga for half an hour
Imagine things in green and blue
Listen to soothing music

, There will likely be times during a depressive episode when you have a strong urge to fall asleep no matter where you are and whom you are with. All you need at that time is to find yourself a comfortable place to succumb to this urge. These are the times when the body is demanding sleep the most and if used appropriately, can help you get the sleep you've been lacking at night.


A power nap of seven minutes when the body has fallen apart with tiredness can feel like a proper sleep of eight hours.Power naps are body boosters that re-energize you when you need it most.

, With the power of mind even a physical problem can sometimes be treated – all you need to do is to think in a positive way. When the mind is free from all the negative thoughts that have been keeping you from falling asleep, you'll be able to sleep peacefully, deeply, and regularly.


Take a break from all worries and tensions that have been daunting the peace of your mind and concentrate on thinking that things are going to be fine. This is just a bad phase and it will pass. Think that when you wake up tomorrow, there will be a new sun shining on your face.

, Another common relaxation technique you can use is to lie down in a comfortable and quiet place and concentrate on different parts of your body. Focus hard on one body part at a time, starting from your toes and ending at the top of your head. Concentrate on that body part for a few seconds and try to make it the only object of your thoughts. Afterwards you need to tense it up for a few seconds and then release. Repeat for each part of your body, no matter how small.


This technique will help you understand your body better and will help you relax your muscles. Even though those techniques are useful and can work wonders with your sleep, you should keep in mind that they won’t have much of an effect the first few times your try. However, if you apply visualization and relaxation techniques often, your will get used to them in a week or two and falling asleep will become much easier.

, Before falling on the bed to get some sleep make sure you have completed all the work that you had planned for the day and have done everything that is a part of your routine. Leaving something out might make you feel incomplete, making you restless when you need to sleep. It is better to lie down when you are done with all the work and when your mind is free from all tension and worry.


Make a to-do list every day that you can look at and check off as activities get completed. Then, when it's time for bed, you can look at this list and see that everything you needed to do is crossed off. This can serve as a signal to your mind to allow your body to sleep.
During a depressive episode, sometimes it's hard to get out of bed, even when you can't sleep. Having this list may help you see what you need to do that day and provide you the motivation to do it.

, Do your best not to give your body rest during the day if you don't actually intend on sleeping or taking a power nap. Even if you are not busy and free all day, do not lie down just to ease your body. You might have an urge to lie in bed just to relax but not sleep, and that is the time when you need to control yourself. Leave that need of rest in your body. Make your body crave the rest. When it is time to sleep, finally go to your bed and lie down.


This leads to tiredness and exhaustion, which, as stated above, helps your body go directly to sleep and stay asleep. You'll be more likely to sleep deeper, which is more relaxing and re-energizing for your body.

, Having a regular sleep schedule is important for everyone, but even more so for people with bipolar disorder. Going to sleep at approximately the same time and sleeping for the same amount of hours every night is very important for your brain, as this is what helps it rejuvenate and feel rested. This includes weekends, too!


Sleeping has a few cycles and all them are important if what you want is to function healthily. That is why it is best to get continuous, uninterrupted sleep whenever possible. Sleep is most rejuvenating when it’s in one long block because you go through all the cycles.A well-rested brain means that you will feel better and will not have such a difficult time during manic and depressive episodes.
Even though every person needs a different amount of sleep, the approximate amount of hours you should aim for is seven to nine.Having a sleep diary will help you establish the exact amount of hours you need, as you will find out how much sleep you need to feel refreshed and ready for the new day. After you have decided on an amount of hours try to always stick to it.
This will help you avoid tossing and turning for hours after you have gone to bed – your brain and body will get used to the sleeping schedule and you will get tired and sleepy when the time of night comes.

, Every routine helps your brain adjust better and makes everyday activities less challenging during both manic and depressive episodes. The right evening routine can help you fall asleep and the right morning routine can help you feel energized.


For your evening routine, pick something that relaxes you and makes you sleepy. Take a bath or listen to some soothing music. Any activity that doesn’t require much movement or concentration but makes you sleepy is good.
Your morning routine should be quite the opposite affair as you need to wake up, feel refreshed and energized. You could try drinking something with a high vitamin concentration, like a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. Afterwards you might find it useful to do some exercise, as movement releases feel-good chemicals in your body and raises your energy levels. You can pick any exercise you enjoy and only spend about 15-30 minutes doing it to achieve great results.
Keep in mind that having morning and evening routines can do wonders for your sleep, but only when your complete them every day, or at least as often as you can. If you don't, your brain will not be able to get used to the tasks and will not wake up or wind down as easily.

, In this diary, you'll write down how long it takes to go to sleep, how many times you wake up during the night, how many hours you sleep per night, and what happened on days when it was either difficult or easy to fall asleep, etc. Keeping a diary like this can help because it can uncover patterns that you never knew existed. Writing things down is much more useful than just thinking about them, because it can serve as a visual aid and thus is more likely to help you understand the effects of certain routine activities.


For instance, after writing in your sleep diary for a few weeks you might find that you sleep very well after an evening with friends or that you wake up a lot during the night after a stressful day at work. Even though uncovering your patterns is not a solution in itself, it will help you understand the reasons behind your lack of sleep or oversleeping. Once you have grasped what the reasons are you can focus on them in depth and achieve healthier sleep patterns.

, If you have been consuming any of these substances, try to reduce intake or use especially before you try to go to sleep. All these substances increase the level of serotonin in the body which brings it into a state of hyperactivity, eventually making you energetic, feeling that you don't need any rest.In case of heavy consumption, these things often trigger unpleasant memories and bring them to the present making you feel frustrated and sad. These negative feelings then become a hindrance in falling asleep.
Heavy alcohol consumption is very dangerous when done during a depressive episode. Alcohol is a depressant and can make your symptoms much worse. If you can't limit yourself to a glass or two, don't touch it.

Get plenty of exercise.,
Tense and relax your muscles.,
Cut out stimulants.,
Skip the alcohol.,
Avoid big meals before bed.",How to Sleep with Heavy Nerves2," Exercise can simultaneously tire you out while also reducing stress. Studies have shown that physical exercise can drastically improve both the quality and length of your sleep. Exercising outdoors is ideal, as it allows you to get more fresh air and sunlight (if exercising during the day), but if you can't get outdoors then working out inside is an acceptable alternative.Some people get more wakeful if they exercise at night, while others can work out at night and sleep fine. Everyone's body is different in this regard, so it's best to figure out what time of day works for you., Tensing your muscles may not sound like a good way to relax. But studies show that tensing your muscles and then immediately relaxing them can help relieve stress and calm the body from head to toe. Performing these tensing/relaxing exercises as you lie in bed may help alleviate anxiety and prepare your body for sleep.Start with your toes. Tense all the muscles in your feet, hold it for 10 seconds, then release all the tension at once. Continue this process and work your way up through every major muscle group in the body., If you're a smoker or a coffee drinker, either or both of these habits could be contributing towards a poor night's sleep. Nicotine and caffeine are both stimulants, which make it difficult to both fall asleep and stay asleep.Stimulants also exacerbate anxiety in some individuals.Because of this, stimulants could potentially affect your sleep and cause increased anxiety, further compounding your sleep loss problems.


Stimulants like caffeine can have lingering physical effects for five to six hours after consumption. If you must drink coffee in the morning or at work, make sure you stop drinking it early enough in the afternoon that you'll be able to sleep at night., Alcohol can make it difficult to remain asleep through the night by affecting the physical and psychological processes that typically take place while you sleep.But some health experts believe that alcohol use may also promote anxiety and increase the risk of panic attacks.If your sleeplessness is caused by anxiety, drinking any alcohol before bed could contribute to both anxiety and difficulty sleeping.

, Eating a large meal or a spicy meal before bed can cause indigestion, which in turn can make it difficult to sleep. Try to avoid eating large or spicy meals for two to three hours before going to sleep, if possible.If you really want something to eat, opt for a light snack no closer than 45 minutes before you intend to go to sleep. This will help fill you up without causing indigestion.Some good light snack options include:


deli slices of turkeywarm milktoast with peanut buttercrackers and cheesecereal or oatmealyogurt and fruit"

Maintain a regular sleep schedule.,
Avoid naps.,
Keep a dark, cool room.,
Avoid electronic devices.,
Try keeping a sleep log.",How to Sleep with Heavy Nerves3," It may be tempting to stay up late and sleep in on the weekends, but studies show that this can potentially wreck your whole week's sleep schedule.Instead, try to maintain your usual sleep schedule seven nights a week, going to bed around the same time and waking up at the same time every day., Napping feels great when you're really drained, and a short ""power nap"" may help you get through a busy day on little sleep. But even a short nap could reset your internal sleep schedule, causing you to lie awake and restless at night. Instead of napping to catch up on sleep, try going to bed a little earlier that night. You'll sleep more soundly and cut down on the risk of losing even more sleep at night., Your bedroom should be a room that makes it easy to relax and fall asleep. Bright lights upset your body's circadian rhythm, which is why it's important to sleep in as dark a room as possible.That may require thicker curtains or blinds to block out any outside light, and leaving a fan or air conditioner on (or a window open) to keep it cool.Optimal sleep temperatures range between 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 to 19.4 degrees Celsius). That's because your body temperature lowers slightly when you sleep, and being in a cool room may help initiate the process.Use curtains or blinds to block outside light, and turn off all artificial lighting in your room.If it's still to bright (say, if you work at night and sleep during the day), consider buying a sleep mask. They're fairly cheap and can be found online or at many retail stores.Try to block out as much outside sound as possible. If need be, you may have to sleep with some type of white noise, like a fan or white noise machine. Earplugs can also help, if you live in a particularly noisy neighborhood., It may be tempting to respond to texts while you're lying in bed, or to surf the internet from your mobile phone or tablet in bed. But studies show that the glow from electronic screens can reduce your ability to fall asleep. Using electronics can also cause additional stress. For example, checking a work email or reading about upsetting news events may make it difficult to fall asleep.Turn off or set aside all electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bed. This will help you avoid stimulation and get ready to sleep., Some days you may be unaware of your evening habits and how they could be contributing to sleeplessness. Try keeping a detailed log of all your evening habits, including anything you had to eat or drink, any activities you engaged in, and the precise time you did any of those things. This may help you realize that certain habits are interfering with your ability to sleep, or if nothing else it may make it easier for your doctor to diagnose what may be causing your sleep problems."

Stay hydrated.,
Take a hot shower.,
Do a nasal irrigation.,
Stay away from cigarette smoke.",How to Sleep Well with Sinus Troubles1," Getting lots of water helps keep your mucus thin and prevents sinus congestion. Try to drink a large glass of water just before bed. Place a water bottle or cup of water by your bedside so you can drink more if you wake up with more sinus trouble in the night., The steam produced by the shower will relieve the pressure and congestion in your sinuses. Once the mucus has been loosened and thinned, you can blow your nose more easily. This should keep you comfortable, at least temporarily. Head to bed as soon as possible after taking a hot shower., A nasal irrigation is similar to commercial saline sprays, but it uses a larger amount of saline and more effectively rinses mucus from the nose.It is easy and affordable to make your own nasal saline solution at home to relieve sinus pressure. Just mix ½ teaspoon of non-iodized salt, ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and two cups (473 milliliters) of lukewarm water.Fill a bulb syringe or neti pot with some of the solution.
Lean over your bathtub or sink and tilt your head. Place the tip of the bulb syringe in the upper nostril.
Squeeze the bulb of the bulb syringe or pour the solution from the Neti pot. The solution will run out of your lower nostril.
Repeat on the other side. Wash the bulb syringe and place it in a clean location. Do this several times a day — especially in the morning and evening — to relieve sinus troubles.

, If you smoke, quit smoking in order to reduce the irritation and inflammation of your sinuses. If your friends or family smoke, insist that they do not smoke around you or avoid spending time with them (especially in your house), as secondhand smoke can be just as detrimental to your sinus health as smoking a cigarette yourself can be.To quit smoking, choose a quit date between two and four weeks into the future.
Gradually reduce the amount you smoke between now and the quit date.
For instance, if you choose to quit in 15 days, immediately reduce your cigarette consumption by 25%. After five days, reduce it by half. After another five days, cut your cigarette consumption down to 25% of what it was before you decided to quit. Then on your final day, stop smoking altogether.
Use nicotine patches and gum to help you stay away from cigarettes if necessary.
Talk to your doctor about other strategies to help you quit smoking.

, Given how hectic teen lives can be, creating a sleep ritual is necessary to ensure a good night's sleep.Consider the following when designing a sleep ritual:


Turn down lighting. This reminds your body that it is night and triggers natural circadian rhythms that help you get sleepy.Wear sunglasses in the afternoons and evenings to decrease exposure to bright light.Have a snack. Going to bed hungry prevents sleep; however, eating too much keeps you awake via digestion. Have a glass of milk or a piece of toast. Ensure that feelings of hunger are suppressed, but don't eat to be full.
Dress seasonally. If it's winter, wear warm sleep attire; if it's summer, consider a t-shirt and cotton shorts. Don't dress in layers, as this can bind movement and require waking up to remove clothing.
Keep your room cool. It's better if your room is cooler rather than warmer, as this can help trigger the cooling cycle your body follows during normal sleep.
Avoid refined sugar before bed. Processed sugar causes a spike in blood sugar, followed by a drop that can wake you up in the middle of the night.
Avoid exercise within two hours of bedtime. This increases heart rate and metabolism, decreasing sleepiness.

, These depend on what time you start your day.


Aim for at least eight hours of sleep but no more than 10, as this can disrupt your sleep schedule and make you feel groggy.
Maintain your schedule even on weekends, making it easier to keep a sleep schedule on school days.

, Once in a sleep pattern, you may wake up without an alarm; however, at first, it's good to ensure you wake on time.


Deep sleepers can set multiple alarms or procure a very loud alarm; however, for the typical sleeper, a simple alarm clock works best - avoid cell phone alarm as it forces you to sleep close to your phone which may distract you from sleeping.

, Research shows that sleeping on your right side increases positive dreaming, decreasing mood dysfunction the following day.


Purchase a body pillow for your left side to shape your sleep posture and keep you on the right., How and when you start the day is the first step toward a healthy sleep pattern and promotes your reliance on natural circadian rhythms.


Don't press Snooze. When your body wakes, returns to sleep, then wakes again a few minutes later, dissonance is created (called ""sleep inertia""). This increases grogginess which lasts up to two 2 hours after waking. To avoid snoozing, put your alarm on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.Open the curtains. Morning light between the hours of 6 to 10 am triggers melatonin release and has an antidepressant effect. It also helps trigger natural circadian rhythms, contributing the wakefulness.Take a warm shower. Raising body temperature increases circulation, contributing to wakefulness. Still find yourself feeling groggy? End your shower with a cool rinse.
Have breakfast. Remember that your body has been without food for eight to 10 hours. Having breakfast increases alertness and prevents midday sleepiness that can lead to impaired sleep at night.

, Light given off by electronics like phones, computers and televisions increases wakefulness and prevents sleep. Give your brain a chance to wind down by powering down electronics at least an hour before bed.Do your best to keep all light-emitting devices out of your bedroom.

, Get some light blocking curtains or a sleep mask for your eyes. When we sleep or dream in mild to moderate light, we wake up feeling less rested and more depressed than we ordinarily would. , Turn off music before bed. If there are other noises keeping you awake, consider earplugs.

, Avoid reading, studying, writing, or drawing while in bed as these contribute to wakefulness and create an association with your bed other than sleep., If, in spite of getting the required amount of sleep, you are still tired, take a power nap for 15–30 minutes. It is important not to nap longer as it increases tiredness and prevents meeting evening bedtime goals., Caffeine, even in small doses, can prevent the body from sleeping, especially when taken after morning hours. If you notice that caffeine seems to have a negative impact your your sleep, cut it out of your diet, or only consume drinks that are ""caffeine-free.""

, Imagine a restful, pleasant place. It could be a museum, a park, or a hiking trail. Begin your walk by internally narrating the details of the place, paying attention to the color, light, shade, and tiny features of your surroundings. Remember what senses you feel when taking this walk. This activity distracts your conscious mind from the present and allows you to relax, encouraging sleep., This process relieves tension and calms your thinking. Starting with your toes and, moving through your calves, thighs, glutes, abdomen, shoulders, neck, and face, squeeze the muscle groups of your body one at a time for a count of 30. Relax after each set for another count of 30., Biofeedback is a type of therapy for insomniacs, teaching how to overcome anxiety responses in the body and substitute voluntary, relaxation activities.Lay on your back and close your eyes.
Create an inverted triangle with your hands, lightly touching your index fingers and thumbs. Place on your stomach, below your rib cage
Take a slow, deep breath. Count to 10 while taking the breath.
Hold the breath for a count of 10.
Exhale for a count of 10. Repeat. During each breath, focus on your breathing. Make it even, and slow as possible. Your body will relax as you do this activity, making it easier to fall asleep.

, Biological changes make teens and adolescents susceptible to the following sleep disordersSnoring and obstructive sleep apnea: caused by illness or allergies that enlarge adenoids and tonsils.
GERD: gastroesophageal reflux disease.Restless leg syndrome: Restless leg syndrome: a movement disorder, causing involuntary movement, preventing REM sleep.
Parasomnias: the most common are insomnia, somnambulism (sleep walking), and night terrors.
Bedwetting: Symptomatic of other developmental delays, it creates anxiety, preventing a child from sleeping.
Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome: a delay in biorhythms, meaning that even if a teen or adolescent goes to bed, it may not be possible to sleep.
During adolescence, the body's circadian rhythm (a kind of internal clock) is reset. This biological clock tells teens to fall asleep later at night, and then wake up later in the mornings. This change in the circadian rhythm seems to be due to the fact that the brain hormone melatonin is produced later at night in teens than it is for kids and adults. So, teenagers really do often have a harder time falling asleep — and there's nothing they can do to change that.

, In addition to grogginess and difficulty waking, there are physical and mental effects of sleep deprivations, such as:


Impaired memory and learning.Reduced mental health.Reduced academic outcomes.Shortened attention span.Impaired motor skills.Increased instances of acne.Decreased metabolism and obesity., Sleep deprivation has a profound impact on neurocognitive function, especially when this deficit occurs over the long term, and especially in adolescent and teen populations.The human brain develops faculties related to logical, systematic thinking between the years of 12 to 18. These skills don't just apply to completing school work.Problem-solving is a universal cognitive skill that affects all aspects of our lives.It is therefore necessary that teens develop and maintain healthy sleep habits to ensure they live up to their full potential as adults.

, If you are a teen struggling to get enough sleep, there are resources available to you that can help.


Talk to your parents. They can help you with the steps outlined in this article and help you get the assistance you need.Talk to your doctor. You may be a candidate for a sleep study to determine the presence of a sleep disorder.
Find online resources. The National Sleep Foundation provides resources that can help you locate sleep professionals in your area, while KidsHealth.org is written specifically for a teen audience to assist with health related concerns.

, Try to go to bed at the same time every night, and get up at the same time--even on weekends.

, You're more likely to sleep soundly if you are physically tired. Make sure you get in some good--preferably outdoor--activity every day.

, If something is on your mind that's bothering you, discuss it with a friend or grown-up. Unhappy feelings or anxieties usually don't just go away. They pop up again in different ways--like in your nightmares.

, Even just a crack. This will help you remember that you family is close by. If you are scared, get up and find someone for reassurance, or a hug.

, Sometimes, images from scary stories pop up in dreams--even two or three days after you've seen them.

, Relax and soak rather than doing something like playing a really exciting video game that will wind you up.

, Both these activities stimulate your system and make it tougher to get to sleep. Tossing and turning in a light doze might give you uneasy feelings that lead to nightmares.

You can relieve some of the pain of gout by icing the joint. Use an ice pack wrapped in a towel and apply to the affected area for 20-30 minutes every hour that you are awake.Keep the affected joint elevated as much as possible while you ice it. This will help to avoid the blood settling in the area that is being iced.;
, Your can take common pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (eg.Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen (eg.Aleve). Use any OTC NSAIDs for as short a time as possible. Long-term NSAID use can increase the chances of a heart attack or stroke and can also increase the risk of ulcers and bleeding. Make certain you follow manufacturer’s directions exactly.

However, avoid any aspirin or topical aspirin products (eg. Aspercreme or any topical cream with salicylates). Aspirin products can cause more uric acid to deposit in the joints.
Tylenol (acetaminophen) is not an anti-inflammatory medicine and is not likely to help.
You could also take colchicine, but you may need a prescription from a doctor for that medication.
For chronic control of gouty flares, you should take allopurinol, which decreases the amount of uric acid in the body., Topical analgesics have been shown to be very effective, especially for joints such as the toes, ankles, knees, elbows and hands.For example, Voltaren gel is a prescription topical NSAID that can greatly reduce gout pain. Talk to your doctor about the use of Voltaren gelOver-the-counter topical treatments that may be helpful include:


Capsaicin cream: Capsaicin is a substance derived from cayenne peppers that depletes Substance P — a pain signal. Make sure you wash your hands well after applying capsaicin — it can cause an intense burning sensation, especially if it gets near your eyes.
Homeopathic creams: These include Topricin, which contains a mixture of homeopathic pain remedies.
Gout relief ointment: Tanza Botanicals has a Gout Relief Ointment that is made of a number of pain-relieving herbs.

, Gout often flares up at night, at that point, the weight of a blanket on a gouty toe, for example, can be extremely painful. If you know this is the case for you, and you have been having flare ups, then avoid that discomfort by turning up the heat in your bedroom and keep the blankets off your affected area.


You may be more comfortable, at least the first night, sleeping in an armchair or a recliner where you can keep the joint elevated.
If the gouty pain is in your toe, ankle, or knee, it may be best not to use a blanket or to tent the area over the joint if you can.

, Gout is also associated with sleep conditions, such as sleep apnea. If you have been awakened at night by gout in the past, talk to your physician about possible treatments for a sleep condition.


Make sure you avoid any stimulants, such as caffeine or tobacco, in addition to avoiding any purine-rich food or beverage. Some purine-rich foods are red meats, anchovies, shellfish, fatty fish, asparagus, spinach, and most dry beans.Avoiding these foods will help you sleep more soundly.
Keep drinking plenty of water. While this won’t necessarily help you sleep in the immediate sense, but it will help flush out the uric acid that has built up.

, This gives the medicine some time to become effective. For example, if you are using topical pain relief, apply it about 20-30 minutes before you plan to sleep.


If you are taking NSAIDs, try to take them with food, such as yogurt or peanut butter crackers. Eating will help to coat your stomach and reduce the likelihood of your developing ulcers or a gastrointestinal bleed.

, Avoid loud noises or bright lights and play calming music or “white noise” to help you relax. If you can, take a warm shower or bath before bed. This can help you relax even more.


Try some deep breathing exercises, calming music, or meditation techniques to try and relax as much as possible.
Get up and go to bed at the same time every day. Don’t force sleep; if you can't fall asleep, do something else until you're tired. Resolve conflicts before you go to bed. Don't have any alcohol or tobacco before you go to bed. Try to exercise in the morning, and do not exercise fewer than four hours before you go to sleep.

, It is important to consult with a physician if you think you have gout. They can help to relieve your symptoms and make recommendations for treatment. Gout is usually diagnosed simply by reviewing the symptoms and medical history.


Your doctor may also take a sample of joint fluid to look for characteristic uric acid crystals, run a blood test to measure the amounts of uric acid, or get an X-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan, though the imaging tests are rarely used., The medical treatment of gout uses medications that block the production of uric acid (eg. allopurinol (Aloprim, Lopurin, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (Uloric), ) or increase the excretion of uric acid (eg Probenecid (Probalan)) As you might suspect, these medication can cause significant side effects:


Allopurinol can cause skin rashes, cause anemia, and can sometime increase joint pain. People of Asian and African heritage have a higher risk of skin rashes with allopurinol.
Allopurinol is used to treat only chronic gout. It does not treat acute gout. If you are suffering from acute gout, you should take colchicine to relieve your symptoms, as allopurinol will not be very effective.Febuxostat can significantly alter liver enzymes.This drug is also used only for chronic gout.Probenecid can cause headaches, joint pain, and rapid breathing.Other medications used include prescription NSAIDs such as indomethacin (Indocin) or celecoxib (Celebrex). Steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine (Colcrys, Mitigare) can also be prescribed. Colchicine is an older drug that is less frequently used because of significant side effects.

, In addition to medication, treating gout and the pain associated with gout requires changes to your diet and lifestyle. Your doctor should have some suggestions for these lifestyle changes so that you can limit pain and get some sleep.

, If this is your first attack or if you haven’t already made dietary changes, it's time to reduce your intake of purine-rich foods. Purines are broken down in your body to produce uric acid. Avoid these foods completely during a gout attack and for at least 1 month following the attack. After you recover, do not exceed more than 2-4 servings of any of these foods per week. They include:Alcohol
Sugary soft drinks
Fatty foods, such as fried foods, butter, margarine, and high-fat dairy products.
Organ meats (liver, kidneys, sweetbreads (brain)). These foods have the highest levels of purines.
Beef, chicken, pork,bacon, veal, venison.
Anchovies, sardines, herring, mussels, codfish, scallops, trout, haddock, crab, oyster, lobster, shrimp

, In addition to avoiding certain foods, you can also increase foods that can protect against high uric acid levels. These include:Phytate rich foods: Phytate is a substance that seems to prevent the formation of many types of kidney stones, including those with uric acid. Phytate rich foods include beans, legumes, and whole grains. You should include 2-3 servings of beans, legumes, and grains every day.
Green tea: Green tea decreases the risk of uric acid-containing kidney stones. Drink about 2-3 cups of green tea a day.
Calcium-rich foods: Calcium-rich foods to include in your diet are low-fat dairy products.
Tart cherry juice: Tart cherry juice has long been used in naturopathic medicine to treat gout and kidney stones. If you have an attack of gout, drink 3-4 8 ounce glasses or organic tart cherry juice every day. This should provide some relief within 12-24 hours.

, These supplements will not immediately help you sleep, but they will help longer-term to reduce the frequency and the duration of a gout attack. If you are already on prescription anti-gout medications, speak to your physician before taking any supplements. Also, follow manufacturer’s recommendations for dosing for any supplements. Helpful supplements include:Omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA.
Bromelain is an enzyme derived from pineapples. It is often used to help treat digestive issues, but in gout, it is used as an anti-inflammatory agent.
Folate, a B vitamin, inhibits the same enzyme (xanthine oxidase) that the anti-gout drug allopurinol inhibits, thus reducing uric acid levels.
Quercetin is a bioflavonoid that also inhibits xanthine oxidase.
Devil’s claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) has been traditionally used to treat gout by reducing uric acid levels.
Anyone with gout should avoid supplemental Vitamin C or niacin. Both these vitamins may increase uric acid levels.

, The symptoms of gout usually appear suddenly and often occur at night. The symptoms of gout include:Intense pain at joints. Most commonly at the base of the big toe. The joint involved can also be the feet, ankles, knees and wrists.
Gout usually only affects one joint at a time, but can affect many joints, especially if the underlying cause of gout is not addressed.
Joint discomfort after the initial attack.
Redness and other signs of inflammation, for example warmth, swelling and tenderness.
Decreased ability to move at the affected joint.

, A diet high in purine-rich foods and beverages with high levels of fructose (sodas and soft drinks) can put you at risk for gout. The foods that commonly act as triggers for gout include:Beer and liquor
Sugary soft drinks
Fatty foods (fried foods, butter, margarine, high-fat dairy products)
Organ meats (liver, kidneys, sweetbreads (brain))
Beef, chicken, pork,bacon, veal, venison
Anchovies, sardines, herring, mussels, codfish,scallops, trout, haddock, crab, oyster, lobster, shrimp

, Gout can occur in all ages, but most commonly in adult men and postmenopausal women. However, there are factors other than diet can have a big impact on whether you get gout or not. These include:


Obesity or being overweight
Untreated high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart and kidney disease
Medications, including thiazide diuretics (water pills), low dose aspirin, immunosuppressant drugs
Family history of gout
Recent surgery or trauma: If you control the amount of purines in your diet, but drop a heavy object on your toe, this could still trigger an acute attack.

Sleep with your head propped up.,
Turn the humidifier on.,
Avoid your triggers.",How to Sleep Well with Sinus Troubles2," If you place an extra pillow or two under your head while sleeping, it could help you drain mucus from your sinuses. If you toss and turn at night, you might consider investing in a remote-controlled elevated bed.Initially, you might angle your head at a 20-degree angle. If that doesn’t work, continue to increase the angle in 10-degree increments to see if you can benefit from sleeping with your head propped up in a different way.

, Dry environments can worsen your sinusitis. Turn on a cool mist humidifier in your bedroom to keep ambient humidity high.Adjust the humidity to a level that works for you. If you set your humidifier to a mid-range setting and aren’t experiencing and improvement in your ability to sleep well with sinus troubles, set it to a higher setting.

, If your sinus troubles are caused by allergies, find ways to limit or avoid your allergic triggers altogether. For instance, if ragweed causes you to develop sinus troubles, keep your windows closed and put an air purifier or filtration system in your bedroom. If you’re allergic to dust, regularly vacuum and dust your home, and wash your clothes and bedding. Installing an air filter or air purification unit may also help.If you’re allergic to your household pet, keep it out of your bedroom to allow you to sleep well with allergy-related sinus troubles.
In the case of plant or pollen-based allergies, you should also stay inside (especially on high pollen count days), ask friends or family to take care of your yardwork, and wear long sleeves when heading out during allergy season.

Avoid antihistamines unless your doctor recommends them.,
Take steroid pills.",How to Sleep Well with Sinus Troubles3," Typically, you won’t need to see a doctor, and your body will be able to fend off a sinus infection on its own within 7-10 days. But if you have lingering sinus trouble (more than 10 days of sinus congestion or pain), or if your symptoms are exceedingly severe, you should contact your doctor.Your doctor might be able to offer an antibiotic or prescription-strength pain reliever.
If you have lingering sinus trouble more than three times per year, you might have chronic sinusitis. Ask your doctor for a referral to a nose, ear, and throat specialist., Your sinus trouble might cause painful headaches or pain behind your cheeks.In this case, it might be hard to get to sleep. Purchase one of several pain-relieving medications over the counter to relieve your sinus headaches.Aspirin or ibuprofen (for instance, Advil or Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) are effective for mild pain.
More intense pain is best treated with drugs that combine acetaminophen, aspirin, and/or caffeine (such as Excedrin Migraine)
Watch for side effects — including nausea, vomiting, light-headedness, sweating, or general fatigue — and negative drug interactions. Always read the directions provided with your medicine to avoid potential negative interactions with other prescription and over-the-counter medications.

, Another way to relieve pain is to use a warm compress on your face. Simply heat the compress and place it on your face where the sinus pressure is greatest. You could also apply a hand towel rinsed with hot water, then wrung out until damp.Some sinus troubles are relieved by the application of cold compresses — that is, hand towels drenched in cold water, wrung out slightly, and applied to the area causing sinus pain.

, Nasal decongestants may help you treat congestion and sinus headaches. You can get nasal decongestants in a variety of forms, including as tablets, liquids, or chewable capsules. Consult the instructions that accompany your particular decongestant for more information regarding use.Popular decongestants include Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold and Sinus and Mapap Sinus Congestion and Pain.Avoid using nasal decongestants for more than a day or two. You risk a rebound effect, which causes increased swelling and congestion as the medication wears off.If you have high blood pressure, check with a doctor before using oral decongestants. They can increase blood pressure by narrowing blood vessels in other areas of the body. , Steroid nasal sprays can reduce inflammation caused by sinusitis, thereby reducing the size and number of nasal polyps that cause sleep apnea. They are also commonly prescribed for people suffering from allergies that affect the sinuses. Talk to your doctor about getting steroid sprays.To use the steroid spray, remove the cap and shake the bottle vigorously several times.
Squeeze the steroid spray bottle a few times to prime it.
Insert the uncapped end into one nostril using the hand on the corresponding side. For instance, if you spray the steroid into your right nostril first, use your right hand to do it.
Use your other hand — the one not holding the spray bottle — to close the nostril on the other side.
Squeeze the spray bottle by placing your thumb beneath it and pulling the “fins” on either side of the uncapped tube using your index and middle fingers. Breathe in while you squeeze.
Repeat on the other side. You may need to spray once, twice, or three times. Consult your prescription directions for more information.

, Antihistamines are a class of drug that blocks the production of histamine, a chemical that causes inflammation when you’re exposed to allergens. By blocking histamine production, you will prevent sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, a runny nose, and sinus troubles.Unfortunately, they work by making your mucus thicker and more difficult to drain.


Antihistamines are appropriate for people whose sinus troubles are triggered by allergies.Common over-the-counter antihistamines include Claritin (loratadine) and Zyrtec (cetirizine). Common prescription antihistamines include Clarinex (desloratadine), Allegra (fexofenadine), and Xyzal (levocetirizine).Talk to your doctor about obtaining these drugs.

, If you have chronic sinusitis, you probably have nasal polyps — a series of extremely inflamed sacs on the nasal tissue. Steroid pills can shrink the sinus polyps that cause sleep apnea. This will improve the depth and quality of your sleep. To take steroid pills, consult your doctor. Only your doctor is qualified to provide a prescription for steroid pills.Steroid pills tend to be temporary in effect, and your polyps will likely return even if you do not stop taking the steroid. Your doctor will probably recommend a supplementary treatment to eliminate the polyps completely.

Avoid having sex.,
Don’t use vaginal douching products.,
Stay away from scented soaps, bubble bath, and bath oils, as these may irritate your vagina, or alter the balance of healthy bacteria in your vaginal area.,
Avoid using strong detergents when washing your underwear.,
Use unscented tampons or pads.,
Learn more about bacterial vaginosis.,
Know the symptoms of BV.,
Know how it's diagnosed.",How to Prevent Bacterial Vaginosis from Coming Back," It is imperative you complete the prescribed regimen you received from your doctor, if you've sought treatment. Once you've had BV, it can happen again and again. However, if it was diagnosed and you've taken the medications as ordered by your doctor, there's a smaller chance of it coming back.If the doctor says take metronidazole or clindamycin for one week (the two often prescribed) then you should take it for the full course prescribed, exactly as directed.
Don't skip a day or stop taking the medication early.
Even if the symptoms are already gone in a matter of days, stopping or not completing the prescribed regimen will increase your risk in getting BV again.;
, Probiotics are known to have live and active cultures of microorganisms that help out the normal flora found in the stomach and vagina. They help in repopulating the good bacteria and fight against harmful bacteria. Some researchers have suggested that recurrence of BV may be the result of an inability to regenerate sufficient lactobacilli, the most common strain of normal flora found in the vagina.Consuming lactobacilli through food sources, such as yogurt (with the label of “live and active cultures”), soy milk, kefir, sauerkraut, milk, pickles, and olives encourages vaginal flora growth. You should eat 5 ounces of probiotic-containing food daily to help the vagina maintain its acid-base balance.
Taking probiotics in concentrated forms, such as Ecoflora tablets, has shown good results at helping prevent recurrence of BV.

, Avoid wearing tight jeans, panty hose, thongs, or underwear that prevent air circulation near the vaginal area. It is advised to wear cotton and avoid nylon underwear. This is because cotton is a breathable fabric and allows the air to circulate. Nylon traps moisture and heat, making you susceptible to having vaginal infections, including BV.Specialists believe that by wearing thongs there is a greater chance of transferring germs from the anus into the vagina and consequently causing BV.
Wearing loose-fitting, comfortable skirts and pants is part of what may help speed treatment and prevent recurrence of BV.
Remove any underwear or panties when you sleep to allow for more air circulation.

, This process can help prevent accumulation of harmful bacteria in the vagina. After urinating, stay seated, and tilt your body forward to allow your hand to reach beneath your buttocks. Wipe the area clean with toilet paper, starting from the front of vagina and ending at the back of the vagina.When you have wiped your vaginal area, you may repeat the steps of wiping by starting behind the vagina to wipe the anal area and between your buttocks.
By cleaning these two areas separately, you'll prevent introducing bacteria from the anus to the vagina.

, Although BV is not a sexually transmitted disease, and the link between sexual activity and BV is not well understood, sex is often associated with women who have new or multiple male or female sexual partners. Although there are few cases of men infecting women with BV, practicing safe sex by using condoms is still important to avoid transmission of various sexual diseases.Transmission of BV is more common in women having sexual intercourse with women because vaginal discharges and cervical mucus are exchanged when having sex.
There is no best way to circumvent this unless you let BV fully recover or you practice total abstinence.
Using a latex-free condom or dental dam during sex for the first month after completing the antibiotic treatment for BV has been shown to reduce the risks of BV recurring.
Thoroughly clean any sex toys to prevent spreading the infection or even reinfecting yourself.

, Douching is a procedure that washes the internal vagina using water and vinegar or other douching products sold in drugstores and actually gets rid of the good bacteria. It can cause more infections and may increase the harmful bacteria in your vagina which greatly affects the normal flora causing more odor and increasing your risk for infection. It's an old practice that isn't scientifically viable anymore.The vagina has its own self-cleaning behavior. The natural acidity in the vagina helps get rid of harmful bacteria.
Douching will not affect a vaginal infection, and will likely make it worse., Soap of any sort can alter the natural balance of healthy flora in your vagina. Instead wash your genitals well with water, using your hand.It's okay to use mild soap and water to wash the outer region of the vagina.
Using hot tubs and whirlpools may also have a negative effect on your vaginal health. It's a good idea to limit the use of hot tubs if you're trying to prevent BV from recurring.

, Strong detergents contain chemicals that come in direct contact with your vagina causing disruption of normal flora. It changes the acid-base balance in the vagina that will alter the normal pH level. Use milder detergents in washing your underwear and rinse them thoroughly.The best laundry soap for underwear will be free of fragrance and softeners.
If you get hot and sweaty, change out of your stale underwear promptly. Changing your underwear only once a day might not be enough if you live an active lifestyle.

, Scented tampons or pads may aggravate the vaginal area. In addition, you should change your tampon often. Keeping a tampon in longer than the recommended number of hours can result in increased risk of bacterial vaginosis.Alternate between wearing tampons and pads for the duration of your period.
Only wear pads and liners if you need to, as they can prevent entrance of air into the genitals making the area warm and moist. This becomes an inviting environment for bacteria to thrive in.

, There is no known cause for BV but certain factors are more common than others in women who are diagnosed with this condition. Most women who have BV are in their child-bearing years, between the ages of 15 – 44. BV is twice as common among African-American women as it is among women of other racial backgrounds. About 1 in 4 of women who are pregnant will develop BV, perhaps due to hormonal changes.Women who don't use condoms, but do use intrauterine devices (IUDs), are more likely to get BV than those who use condoms or who are not sexually active.
BV is not the result of bad hygiene.
You can get BV without having sex, but many women who are diagnosed with BV report having recent sexual activity with either male or female partners. Sexual activity includes vaginal, oral, and anal sex.
Men can not be diagnosed with BV.

, Many women with bacterial vaginosis do not show any symptoms at all. Signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis may differ from person to person but is chiefly characterized by:Grey, white or yellowish discharge. This is caused by an outgrowth of the bad bacteria that thrives in the vagina, thereby interrupting the normal vaginal flora.

Foul-smelling discharge. Most commonly described as a “fishy odor” and usually becomes worse after sexual intercourse.

No signs of soreness or itchiness. BV can sometimes be confused with a yeast infection, also known as thrush. This infection of the vaginal area results in a milky discharge, itchiness and soreness. If your genital area itches, it's unlikely to be BV.

Pain upon urination. Some women report a painful sensation of burning and sometimes stinging.

, If you suspect you have BV, you'll need to make a doctor's appointment to confirm and treat it. Your doctor will need to take a sample from your vaginal discharge. This will require you to lie down on your back, with your feet in stirrups, on the exam table. Your doctor will swab the inside of your vagina lightly with a cotton swab in order to gather the necessary sample.The acidity of the sample will be measured. If your sample is less acidic than it should be (less than 4.5 pH) you may have bacterial vaginosis.
Your medical provider may examine the sample under a microscope. If your lactobacilli count is low, but there is an abundance of ""clue"" cells (cells from the vaginal lining that are coated with bacteria), it's likely you have BV.

Consider cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).",How to Sleep Soundly," It's important that you go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or days off, in order to get sound sleep.Having a consistent schedule reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm) and helps promote deeper sleeps during the night. Avoid staying out really late on weekends and sleeping in the following morning because it will disrupt your schedule for the rest of the week.


Pick a time when you naturally start to feel tired (10:30 pm, for example) and set your alarm for at least eight hours later. However, some people get by okay on seven hours and others need nine hours, but very few people do well outside of the seven to nine hour range.
If you don't fall asleep within 15 to 20 minutes of going to bed, get up and do something relaxing. Worrying about falling asleep is counterproductive and can lead to insomnia.
Some people are naturally ""night owls"" and prefer to stay up later, but make sure your job / school schedule allows you to get enough sleep in the mornings. Late to bed and early to rise will leave you chronically tired.;
, It's also important to develop relaxing bedtime rituals to tell your body and mind it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.Relaxing night-time activities promote better and deeper sleeps by easing the transition between wakefulness and drowsiness. Conversely, avoiding stressful night-time activities is important to keep your mind from racing and your hormones (adrenaline) pumping.


Relaxing evening activities include taking a warm bath or shower, relaxing to soothing classical or jazz music, and reading a funny book.
Consider lighting some aromatherapy candles (such as lavender) to relax and wind down your evening.
Deep breathing techniques and meditation prior to bedtime can also help you relax and get to sleep.Avoid watching TV (especially scary movies) or using the computer just prior to bedtime. Don't think about finances either.
Limit your bedroom activities to sleeping and having sex — don't use it to eat in, study, play on the computer or pay bills.

, To trigger sleep quickly, it's important to make your bedroom or sleeping space as quiet, calm, cool and dark as you can make it.Loud noises, activity, higher temperatures and light all make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep, so minimize or eliminate each one. Consider using thick curtains or black-out shades, sleep mask, overhead fan, white noise machine and/or earplugs to create a comfortable environment that induces sleepiness.


Most people need a room to be cooler than 75°F to be comfortable enough to fall asleep, although changing to lighter bedding and using fans help also.
Don't use bright or noisy clocks near your bed. Choose a silent battery operated one, but don't place it within full view. Watching the time pass can increase anxiety and trigger sleeplessness.Make sure your mattress and pillow are comfortable. Most people do best with firm orthopedic mattresses, although some like soft beds. If you're always waking up sore, you need to change something.

, Consuming food and beverages in the evening often have a big impact on sleep. Eating before bedtime isn't ideal because it can cause an energy burst and increase your risk of painful bloating, indigestion or heartburn. On the other hand, not eating for many hours prior to bedtime can lead to hunger pains, a grumbling stomach and food fixation. The best plan of action is eating about 3 hours prior to bedtime and sticking with natural non-spicy foods such as whole grains (pastas and breads), lean meats / fish, cooked veggies, fresh fruit and low-fat dairy products.Some foods contain tryptophan and glutamine, amino acids which promote sleepiness. As such, consider having a turkey sandwich with cheese on whole grain bread for an evening snack.
Caffeinated beverages (coffee, black tea, hot chocolate, colas, energy drinks) should also be avoided in the evening because caffeine stimulates neurons in the brain and keeps you alert.Alcohol also disrupts sleep. Although it can make most people drowsy, it typically leads to restless sleep. Avoid alcohol in the evening if you want to sleep soundly and wake up rested.

, Regular physical activity during the day helps you to fall asleep faster and to enjoy deeper sleeps.However, the timing of your exercise is important: too soon to bedtime can leave you energized and alert. As such, exercise either in the mornings or before dinner when you can capitalize on the energy boost, but not within a few hours of bedtime — unless it's just a leisurely walk after dinner. If you don't have an exercise routine yet, start with at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity (walking, hiking, cycling) daily and mix in some weight training a few times per week.Exercise burns calories and promotes weight loss, which can improve the quality of your sleep. People who are overweight tend to experience more aches, pains, digestive problems and breathing issues, which can disrupt sleep.
Real vigorous exercise (weight training, boxing, martial arts, swimming) increases your body's production of adrenaline and testosterone (especially in men), which prevents sleep. Thus, avoid such activity at least five hours prior to bedtime., For people who get up early for work and/or exercise earlier in the day, a late afternoon or early evening nap is sometimes tempting, but they can interfere with nighttime sleep — especially if you're experiencing insomnia or restless sleeps already.The elderly also favor naps because they are often up in the night multiple times for health issues (typically genitourinary problems) and get out of bed early and sleep deprived. This cycle can prevent sound sleep at night when you it the most.


If you really need a nap during the day, limit yourself to less than 30 minutes (a ""power nap"") and take it well before dinner.
A short, well-timed nap can invigorate you and make a minimal impact on your sleep at night, but longer or multiple naps are always disruptive.
To avoid napping too long, set an alarm and don't sleep in your bed — choose a comfortable chair or sofa instead.
If you work night shifts, you'll need to do more than just nap during the day. You'll have to adjust your internal clock by making your bedroom as dark and quiet as possible and try for the seven to nine hours of deep sleep.

, Too much stress at a time or constant (chronic) low-levels of stress are very common sleep disturbers. To help restore some peace and tranquility in your life, you need to consider healthy ways to manage your stress. Start with getting organized, setting priorities and delegating tasks both at work and at home.Take more restful breaks and laugh more with coworkers, friends and family. Don't be afraid to make significant life changes to free yourself from high stress situations — reduce contact with overly negative and critical people


Be realistic with your obligations and responsibilities. Most people get stressed out because they over-commit or over-schedule. Don't promise people things that you can't reasonably deliver.
Manage your time better and quit showing up late. Plan ahead and leave more time to do things and get places.
Use your exercise routine to reduce stress instead of overeating on ""feel good"" food. Binge eating will lead to weight gain and make you feel worse in the long run.
Talk to friends and family about your stressful situations. A little bit of venting can really help. If you can't talk, write your feelings down in a journal instead.

, There are numerous plant-based herbal remedies that promote relaxation, but the one most used as an aid for getting better or deeper sleeps is valerian root.Valerian root has mildly sedating effects, which leads to sleepiness or drowsiness.It's usually taken as a tincture or capsule, but it can also be consumed as a herbal tea. Valerian is most effect for short-term use — for up to six weeks at a time.


Valerian likely works by increasing gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, which has calming effects that lead to drowsiness.
Drugs such as alprazolam (Xanax) and diazepam (Valium) also work by increasing GABA levels in the brain.
Take valerian one to two hours before bedtime — between 250 to 600 mg in capsules. It may take a few weeks of supplementing before the effects become significant.
Valerian is generally very safe, although In very high doses it can have a negative effect on the liver.

, Chamomile is one of the most popular herbal supplements in the United States and often taken to combat anxiety and insomnia (sleeplessness).The flowers of the chamomile plant act as a mild sedative and can calm the nerves, promote relaxation and trigger sleepiness. Chamomile tea is widely available. Drink a cup of chamomile tea about one hour or so before bedtime.


Drinking chamomile tea (or any other herbal tea) too close to bedtime can cause you to have to urinate in the night, which disrupts your sleep. Experiment with how much is right for your body.
Because chamomile can cause drowsiness rather quickly, you should not consume it and drive or operate heavy machinery afterwards.
Chamomile is also available as a tincture and capsules, although drinking the tea gets absorbed into your body quicker.

, Melatonin is a natural hormone made by the small pineal gland within your brain. It's the main hormone for establishing your circadian rhythm and triggering deep sleep at night when it's dark, although some people don't produce enough. Melatonin supplements can help induce a deep sleep, particularly in people who have disrupted circadian rhythms (from jet lag or working nights), or those with low levels of natural melatonin.Taking melatonin may also help with insomnia, although the current research is inconclusive.In terms of dosage, take between 1 to 3 mg of melatonin about 45 minutes or an hour before bedtime.
Melatonin is also a strong anti-oxidant that boosts your immune system during sleep, so it has other health benefits.
The main downside to supplementing with melatonin is that you may feel groggy for the first five to 10 minutes while waking in the morning.

, If none of the above-mentioned suggestions and remedies allows you to sleep soundly, then make an appointment with your family doctor. Not being able to get to sleep normally or not sleeping soundly for more than a few weeks is usually diagnosed as insomnia, although many medical conditions can cause it, such as chronic pain syndrome, depression, restless leg syndrome, sleep apnea (severe snoring), bladder control problems, arthritis, cancer, overactive thyroid, menopause, heart disease and chronic heartburn / indigestion.Your prescription drugs might be causing your sleeping issues. If you're taking medications for depression, high blood pressure, allergies, weight loss or ADHD (such as Ritalin), then your doctor may need to alter your dosage or find alternative drugs.
Check the labels of any medications you take regularly. Many contain stimulants such as caffeine or pseudoephedrine, which can disrupt sleep.Your doctor may refer you to a sleep specialist, who may monitor you at a clinic while you sleep. Electrodes are attached to your head to see if your brain follows normal sleep cycles.

, If your doctor thinks it's necessary, he/she may prescribe medication to help you sleep soundly at night. Some medications are more effective for short-term insomnia, whereas others are more powerful and effective for long-term insomnia and other sleep disorders.Sleeping pills can be habit forming and cause other side effects, such as low blood pressure (hypotension), nausea, anxiety, excessive daytime drowsiness, bad dreams (night terrors) and sleepwalking.


Sleeping pills for short-term bouts of insomnia include temazepam (Restoril), flurazepam (Dalmane), estazolam (ProSom), ramelteon (Rozerem) and triazolam (Halcion).Halcion usage is strictly monitored because some people can become addicted to it.
Newer sleeping pills with a better safety profile include zolpidem (Ambien), zaleplon (Sonata) and eszopiclone (Lunesta).
Sleeping pills more appropriate for longer-term insomnia and some other sleep disorders include diazepam, lorazepam, and quazepam.
Some over-the-counter (OTC) medications can induce drowsiness, such as cold medications and antihistamines.
OTC anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, aspirin) and muscle relaxants can also induce sleep in many people.

, Ask your doctor for a referral to a psychologist or therapist who practices CBT, which can benefit people having a difficult time getting to sleep and getting quality sleep. CBT is used to identify and modulate factors that trigger sleeping problems, such as negative thoughts, excessive stress, poor sleep hygiene, irregular schedules and disruptive lifestyles.CBT is an effective and drug-free approach that can remove the triggers preventing you from sleeping soundly.


CBT often involves sleep education, information on better sleep hygiene, relaxation training, cognitive control methods, psychotherapy and biofeedback.
CBT promotes helpful behaviors (mentioned above), such as keeping regular bedtimes and wake-up times, as well as eliminating or modifying afternoon naps.
CBT therapists work with you to help control or eliminate negative thoughts, stress, anxiety, worries and any false beliefs that are preventing deep sleeps.

Keep an eye on the weather.,
Avoid focusing on the thunderstorm.,
Create a thunderstorm plan.,
Work to overcome phobias about thunderstorms.",How to Sleep Through a Thunderstorm1," The first thing is to know when a storm system might be coming. Check up on the weather regularly. Read the local forecast online or watch your local television newscast. If you have a barometer (a device that measures barometric pressure in the atmosphere) note when it starts to drop – this means that a low pressure system is coming, and possibly a storm.;
, Think calming thoughts and keep them off of the storm. Try reading a book until bedtime. Try playing a game of cards. Think about what you might dream about, or what kind of day you'll have tomorrow. This will distract you from the storm.

, Identify a safe and comfortable place in the house that you can go to in case of a big storm. If your room has lots of windows or faces the weather side of the house, for example, try switching to the basement or an inner-room. It helps to have a place that is insulated from the sights and sounds of the storm. Bring blankets, pillows, and other things to make the space as cozy as you can. Also, you might have a “storm kit” that includes things to do to take your mind off of the weather. Games, puzzles, other activities, and flashlights in case the lights go out are all good ideas.

, Many children and some adults are frightened by thunderstorms. Try to learn more about these weather events. As you do, you’ll realize that they are usually not dangerous if you have a safe place inside.There are certain thing you can do.


Understand what’s happening. A thunderstorm happens when hot air and cold air meet in a certain way, making the hot air rise upward. This pushes moisture into the upper atmosphere where it cools, condenses, and forms clouds. The electricity comes from particles in these clouds rubbing together. Tension builds up until – Boom! – lightning is discharged.Know how to stay safe. If you are inside during a thunderstorm, you’re already pretty safe. Make sure that if the storm is severe, with high winds and a lot of lightning, to stay away from windows. It’s often good to go to a low place or room without windows like a basement. Do not take showers and avoid using appliances like the phone."
"
Try using earplugs.,
Listen to white noise.,
Block out the lightning flashes.",How to Sleep Through a Thunderstorm2," Thunderstorms make a good deal of noise. To get to sleep you will either have to ignore the noise or drown it out. One method for the latter is to use earplugs. You can buy these at any pharmacy in a variety of kinds, including foam, cotton, or wax. Following the directions on the box, insert the earplugs into your ear canal. Then lie down and try to sleep.


Earplugs vary in effectiveness. You will want to get a kind that keeps out the loudest noise, which is measured in decibels.Do not use tissue paper to plug your ears. This seems like a good idea in a pinch and is easy to do. However, there is a danger that the paper will rip and end up lodged in your ear canal. All things considered, it is a bad idea to put household objects inside of your ear., It could be music – classical, ambient music like that of Brian Eno, or even whale songs – provided that the music is at a low volume and has a low dynamic range. You don't want sudden noises to wake you when you’re on the verge of drifting off. It might also be noise from a fan. The point is to have low-level, ambient sound.Try a free online white noise generator like SimplyNoise. Or, you might also invest in a white noise application for your iPad, as they’ve been proven to help people fall asleep more quickly. Moreover, the constant, low-level sound can also help mask more abrupt noises that may disturb you when you finally do fall asleep.

, Try putting down your shades and drawing your curtains if the light from lightning flashes disturbs your sleep. Or, you might try sleeping in a room with no window, which will also insulate you from sound.

Turning on a dim light or ""night light"" might help. One of these lights can diminish the contrast between total darkness and flashes of light from lightning
If you still see lightning through your window, consider moving your head away from the window and try to close your eyes.

"
"
Create a pillow and blanket barrier.,
Put on a hoodie.,
Create a stuffed animal barrier.,
Try not to worry about the storm.",How to Sleep Through a Thunderstorm3," Find some comfortable heavy blankets and big pillows when you know that a storm is coming. These can block out the storm. If you are agitated or particularly bothered by the noise, try covering your head with the blanket or with a large pillow – being very careful that you have room to breathe.

, Grab a hoodie instead of pillows and blankets. This can be a pullover, zip-up, or full zip. It really doesn’t matter. However, the hoodie should preferably be a thick but comfortable, and not one that is tight or restrictive.


Try to fall asleep the hoodie on. Once you have retreated to your thunderstorm room, have earplugs, and are snug in your hoodie, give sleep a shot. The hoodie will cover your ears. If the lightning is still bothering you, reverse it so that the hood covers your eyes.
Alternatively, some hoodies zip up all the way to the top of the hood. If you have one of these, pull the zipper all the way up to cover your face.

, If it makes you feel more secure, make a barrier of your favorite stuffed animals against the storm. Gather your animals together. Try arranging them in a circle or rectangle around your bed. You will be at the center.


Hop into bed and snuggle down. Imagine that the animals are guarding you. Let their presence reassure you and create a make-believe force field to keep away the dark things.

, Remember, the storm will not last. Usually, the worst of a thunderstorm is over within a short amount of time, often between thirty minutes to an hour. You are also safe at home, inside of your room. Try not to worry yourself too much.

Know where your cervix is located.,
Wash your hands with soap and warm water.,
Get in a comfortable position.,
Insert your longest finger into your vagina.,
Feel for the cervix.,
Determine whether your cervix is low or high.,
Determine whether your cervix is firm or soft.,
Determine whether your cervix is wet.,
Use other methods to verify whether you're ovulating.",How to Feel Your Cervix," The cervix is the lowermost part of the uterus, where it connects with the vaginal wall.It is located 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) inside the vagina, at the end of the vaginal tunnel. It is shaped like a small donut with a tiny hole in the center. The position and texture of the cervix change throughout the ovulation cycle.


The inner canal of the cervix contains glands that secrete vaginal mucus. The color and texture of the mucus also change throughout the cycle.;
, Since you'll be using your fingers to feel your cervix, it's important to wash your hands thoroughly to prevent transmitting bacteria to your reproductive system. Avoid using lotion or hand cream before feeling your cervix, since the ingredients in these products can lead to vaginal infections.


If you have long nails, you might consider giving them a trim before feeling your cervix. A long, sharp nail could scratch your vagina.

, Most women find that a sitting position (rather than standing or lying down) allows for easy access to the cervix with a minimum of discomfort. Sit on the edge of your bed or bathtub with your knees apart.

, Gently move your finger into your vaginal opening and let it glide into your vagina. Depending on where you are in your ovulation cycle, your finger may reach several inches into your vagina before you feel your cervix.


If you wish, you may lubricate your finger with a water-based lubricant to help it glide in more easily. Do not use petroleum jelly, lotion, or any other product not specifically labeled for use in the vagina.

, The tip of your finger will touch the donut-shaped opening at the end of your vagina. You'll know it's your cervix if your finger isn't able to keep reaching further. The cervix may be soft, like pursed lips, or firm, like the tip of your nose, depending on whether or not you are ovulating.

, If your cervix is ""low,"" meaning just a few inches from your vaginal opening, that means you probably aren't ovulating. If it's ""high,"" located deep within the vagina, you may be ovulating.


The first few times you feel your cervix, it will be difficult to determine whether it's high or low. Keep feeling every day over the course of a month or two, noting the differences in the position of your cervix from week to week. Eventually you'll be able to tell whether your cervix is low or high.

, If your cervix is firm and tight, you probably aren't ovulating. If it's soft and has some give, you may be ovulating.


The texture of the cervix during ovulation has been described as feeling like a pair of lips. During other periods, before and after ovulation, it's more like the tip of your nose - slightly hard with less give., During ovulation, the cervix will feel very wet with fluids, and you'll likely have an increased amount of vaginal discharge. After ovulation, the cervix will feel drier until menstruation occurs.

, In addition to feeling your cervix, monitoring your cervical fluids and recording your basal temperature can help you figure out when you're ovulating. This combination of tracking methods is called Fertility Awareness, and done correctly, it's an effective way to determine when you are fertile.


Just before and during ovulation, your vaginal fluid will become heavy and slippery.
When ovulation occurs, your basal temperature will rise slightly. It's necessary to take your temperature using a basal thermometer every morning so that you catch the rise in temperature."

Do pelvic exercises.,
Reduce substances that trigger hot flashes.,
Combat vaginal dryness.,
Prepare mentally for other symptoms.",How to Prepare for Menopause Related Health Changes2," One of the side effects of menopause is urinary incontinence or leakage. To help combat this before these health issues arise during menopause, you can start doing pelvic exercises, called Kegel exercises, to help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.Kegels are a series of muscle tensing and releasing exercises in different positions and for different lengths of time. You can identify the muscles used in Kegels by trying to stop the flow of urine as you pee. The muscles you squeeze to accomplish this are the muscles you will be working curing Kegels.
Start out by squeezing your pelvic floor muscles for two to five seconds, then release for 10 seconds. Do this ten times to complete one set. Do one set three to four times daily.
Increase the time you squeeze and hold your muscles to 10-second intervals. Continue to do three to four sets daily.
Kegels can be done just about anywhere and at any time. Do them while driving, sitting at your desk, watching TV, or whenever works for you.

, When you are preparing for the changes your body goes through during menopause, you can start to avoid the substances that trigger hot flashes. This will help them to get out of your system before you start menopause so you won’t start out with bad hot flashes.


These triggers include hot and caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and spicy foods.
Many of these things trigger other menopause symptoms as well, so you will be healthier and more prepared overall if you avoid these., One of the major side effects of the reduction in estrogen during menopause is vaginal dryness. Before you go through menopause, you can ask what your doctor can do for you if this happens. A common treatment that is prescribed during menopause is vaginal estrogen, which is a cream, rings, or tablet inserted directly into the vagina to be absorbed by the tissues.


You can prepare for this eventual health change by seeing if your insurance covers these treatments, looking into types of these medications that you have access to, and stocking up on these medications.

Take medication for osteoporosis prevention.,
Inform yourself about treatment for upcoming hot flashes.,
Ask your doctor about antidepressants.",How to Prepare for Menopause Related Health Changes3," If you are at a high risk for osteoporosis, your doctor may suggest your start major preventative methods before you hit menopause. This is because menopause increases your risk of osteoporosis. Preventative medications and supplements for osteoporosis include dietary changes to include more dairy products and other foods with calcium and vitamin D, adding calcium and vitamin D supplements to your routine, and an increase in exercise to strengthen your bones.You will also be told to quit smoking, since it also contributes to bone density loss.Once you begin going through menopause, your doctor may put your on estrogen medication, which will help you maintain bone density., There are certain medications that can help with hot flashes in some cases.

Rest.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat nutrient-rich foods.,
Wash your hands frequently.",How to Fight a Cold when Pregnant1," Rest is a great way to allow your body to recover from any illness like a cold. So, listen to your body. If you feel tired, then you should rest and relax. Make sure to sleep through the night, take naps, and sit down to relax when you are feeling tired.Even sitting down or lying in bed while reading a book or watching TV will allow your body to rest.
Sleep the recommended seven to nine hours per night. Also, minimize your activities during the day so your body can reserve its energy to fight the cold.If sleeping is uncomfortable, use a foam wedge or layer your pillows into a triangle shape to prop your upper body.;
, Even if you aren’t pregnant, staying hydrated is crucial to getting over a cold. Therefore, make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Drink water, broth, and juice frequently throughout the day to stay hydrated.It is recommended that pregnant women drink 10 glasses of water per day. Up your intake to 12 or 13 glasses per day to make up for the fluids you lose due to symptoms such as sweating and a runny nose.

, Eating nutrient-rich foods will help you maintain good levels of immunity. Eat nutrient-rich foods such as brightly colored fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants that will give your immune system the boost it needs.Examples of nutrient rich fruits and vegetables are spinach, tomatoes, broccoli, bell peppers, garlic, onion, lemon, blueberries, strawberries (any berries), bananas, apples, and more.Wash all produce thoroughly to avoid a serious blood infection called toxoplasmosis, which is caused by a parasite that can be found in soil.Make sure to continue taking your prenatal vitamins, as well.

, Wash your hands before and after eating, during office hours, and before you touch your face. Also wash them after blowing your nose, and coughing and sneezing.Wash your hands by wetting them with clean running water. Lather them with soap and scrub your hands for 20 seconds. Then, rinse them with clean water, and dry them off with a paper towel or air dry them."

Place a humidifier in your room.,
Drink warm tea.,
Inhale steam.",How to Fight a Cold when Pregnant2," Humidifiers increase the room’s moisture level, which will make it easier to breathe. Therefore, placing one in your room will relieve and reduce your congestion. Choose a cool mist humidifier since doctors often recommend these to relieve cold symptoms in children.Cool mist humidifiers are recommended because they prevent burns in children, as well as adults.
Additionally, prop your head up with a pillow during the night to reduce postnasal drip, which often triggers coughing during the night.

, When choosing teas, choose non-caffeinated teas, like herbal teas. Choose herbal teas that contain soothing properties for sore throats. In addition to warm tea, gargling with salt water and sucking on ice chips will relieve a sore throat. Avoid herbal teas that contain St.John's wort, ginseng, don quai, yarrow, pennyroyal, licorice root, and ephedra.Safe herbal teas for pregnant women are ginger, nettle, raspberry leaf, dandelion leaf, rooibos, and peppermint tea.
Mixing warm water with lemon juice and honey will also relieve a dry, scratchy throat and cough.

, Steam inhalation is another great method for decongesting your sinuses. Boil a pot of hot water. Place the water in a bowl. Wait for the water to cool for a minute. Then, sit with your head over the bowl of hot water. Place a towel over your head and breathe deeply. Do this for about five to eight minutes.The steam should loosen any mucus in your sinuses.

"
Consult your doctor.,
Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,
Be wary of decongestants.,
Use cough drops.",How to Fight a Cold when Pregnant3," Before taking any over-the-counter medications to relieve your symptoms, always consult your doctor. Your doctor will know which medications are safe to use and which ones are not. Your doctor will also be able to prescribe medications based on your individual case.Also, call your doctor if your symptoms including shortness of breath, chills or back, neck or abdominal pain persist or worsen, or if you develop a fever that is 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius) or higher.

, NSAIDs like aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil), and naproxen (Aleve) should be avoided. These pain relievers and fever reducers may interfere with your baby’s development in the early stages, as well as cause labor complications.Instead, opt for acetaminophen, like Tylenol, if you have a fever, headache, or body aches. Be sure to consult your doctor prior to taking any over the counter medication, though, to make sure the medication and the dose are safe and appropriate.

, These medications come in a variety of forms, for example, nasal sprays or drops and oral medications. Before using these, speak with your doctor. Nose sprays and drops are generally ok, but use caution, and do not over use them.If your congestion is severe, then use a nasal spray before you sleep.

, Cough suppressants like cough drops, Robitussin, and cough medications that contain dextromethorphan are generally ok to use. Again, speak with your doctor before using these medications.Sometimes doctors will prescribe a combination of cough suppressants, like cough drops and Robitussin, for very stubborn coughs.

Fake doctor's appointments.,
Make it appear that you've gained weight.,
Fake fatigue.,
Change your make-up.,
Complain of aches and pains.,
Look into faking a baby bump.,
Continue to increase your breast and belly size.,
Act tired.,
Find an exit strategy.",How to Fake Pregnancy," The easiest means of faking a pregnancy might be simply buying a fake test. You can find fake pregnancy tests online or at a local joke shop. These tests are specifically designed to always result in a positive reading.The one downside of purchasing a fake test is that you may be asked to retake the test to be sure. You might want to purchase a few fake tests so if someone request you take a pregnancy test again you can simply use another fake one.On eBay, you may be able to purchase a fake test. If someone brings you a real test to take, consider keeping a fake positive test in your pocket. Switch the real one out for the fake positive while in the bathroom.;
, A fake test is not always possible. A friend, family member, or significant other may bring you a test to take themselves. In some cases, you can use any type of soft drink, like Pepsi or Coke, to get a positive sign on a pregnancy test. Keep in mind, however, that this method is not foolproof. If possible, sneak a can or bottle of some kind of soft drink into the bathroom when you go to take the real test.


In a real pregnancy test, the test detects the pregnancy hormone in a woman's urine. Certain properties of soft drinks are similar to the pregnancy hormone. Dipping a real pregnancy test in a soft drink may result in a positive reading., If you're unsure how to use a pregnancy test, you may be tempted to fake medical documents. First off, a doctor or gynecology clinic is unlikely to help you fake documents. Second, forgery is considered a medical offense. Faking medical documents that claim you're pregnant could be considered a possible form of forgery. It is not advised you fake medical documents as this could result in legal repercussions., Nausea and vomiting are common early in pregnancy. Specifically, these symptoms tend to occur between the 6th and 12th week of pregnancy. As over half of all pregnant women experience morning sickness, consider faking these symptoms.Women who experience morning sickness cope in a variety of ways. They may drink ginger or lemon tea, eat small meals throughout the day, drink club soda, and drink small amounts of water frequently to avoid dehydration.Engaging in these behaviors can help convince others you are experiencing nausea associated with early pregnancy.
Odor tends to trigger nausea. Pregnant women may open windows or turn on fans in the presence of strong scents to block out unwanted smells.Consider complaining of smells and making efforts to cover odors to make it appear you're feeling nauseous.
You can also pretend to be sick on occasion throughout the day. Excuse yourself and run to the bathroom. You can dump a beverage in the toilet to make it sound like you're vomiting. Dab some water on your forehead before returning to the room. This will make it look like you're sweating from the exertion of throwing up., Frequent urination is very common in the early weeks of pregnancy.If you want to successfully fake a pregnancy, work on taking measures to urinate more often.


Certain fruits make you pee more often. Eat lots of citrus fruits, as well as pineapple, cranberries, tomatoes, prunes, bananas, grapes, and apples. Vegetables like onions may also increase urination.Coffee and tea are both diuretics and can result in more frequent urination.However, many women watch the amount of caffeine they consume during pregnancy. Try telling people you're drinking decaf.
Carbonated drinks tend to increase the frequency of urination. Drinking something like club soda or ginger ale can indicate you're feeling nauseous as well, helping you fake an additional symptom of pregnancy., For many women, breast size will increase during pregnancy. It may be one of the earliest noticeable signs.Work on taking measures to make your breasts look larger.


There are many products you can buy, such as water bras or push-up bras, to make your breasts look larger. However, you don't want to go too big too quickly. You could try slowly stuffing your bra with socks or tissue paper until you gradually reach the breast size provided by an enhanced bra.You can also make simple alterations on your existing bra rather than buying new products. Wearing two bras can increase breast size, for example. Twisting the middle part of your bra, the part between the cups, can push your breasts together to make them look bigger., Pregnant women frequently have doctor's appointments and check ups early in their pregnancy. It's fairly easy to fake an appointment. Just claim you'll be late to a meeting or social obligation due to a check up. Show up 10 to 15 minutes behind schedule. If you work a job that requires a doctor's note, remember forging a medical document could be considered a form of forgery. It might be best to make conversation about your appointments in the office and claim you scheduled your appointments during your days off.

, As pregnancy progresses, women begin to gain weight. How women gain weight in pregnancy varies from woman to woman, but you'll want to begin altering your clothing options to make it appear you're trying to hide excess pounds.


Go for horizontally shaped clothing with horizontal shapes. Look for wider pants and choose outfits with brighter colors. Darker shades, like blacks, tend to be slimming but something like yellow or white might help create the illusion you've gained some weight., Fatigue is a very common symptom of pregnancy in the second trimester. Complain that you feel tired frequently. Take more naps throughout the day. This will help convince others you are pregnant. If you struggle to fall asleep in the middle of the day, consider lying down for 30 minutes or so with your eyes closed.

, Pregnant women sometimes get brown marks on their face. This is usually due to an increased production of melanin levels which cause a browning of the skin. Consider swapping your regular make-up for a slightly darker shade. This will help convince others you're attempting to hide some of the facial imperfections caused by pregnancy., Pregnant women may experience back pain during the second trimester. Headaches are also a common complaint.Work on faking these kinds of aches and pains to make your pregnancy look authentic.


Backache and headache are fairly easy to fake as there's no external evidence. You can rub your back or just mention you have a headache. You may want to start lying down and resting more to make it appear these symptoms are causing you some fatigue.
Keep in mind you don't want to overdo it. While women do experience aches and pains during the second trimester, for many women it's the easiest part of pregnancy.You do not need to be complaining of pain constantly to be convincing.

, When women show during pregnancy varies. However, most people will expect you to start showing some time during your second trimester. Work on creating a convincing baby bump.


Go gradually. People will be suspicious if your stomach goes from flat to round overnight. Start stuffing your clothing with extra padding, gradually adding more layers. You can stuff old shirts and socks into a tank top. You can also add layers as you want your stomach to look larger.
Many websites and companies sell fake pregnancy bellies. These are shaped to your body type and made out of a variety of materials. You might want to consider buying a fake belly early on in your ""second trimester"" and gradually work up to using that belly.

, Both your breasts and your baby bump will continue to grow into the third trimester. You'll need to work on increasing the size of these body parts if you continue to fake your pregnancy into the third trimester.


Your breasts will continue to increase in size during your third trimester. They will also become sore and tender. Work on continue to enhance the size of your breasts, using some of the methods outlined above. You should also occasionally complain your breasts are sore.Continue to add to the size of your fake baby bump. Layer more clothes on top of your bump and gradually add more padding. You may need to buy several fake bellies, in varying sizes, and gradually increase the size of your baby bump as your ""pregnancy"" progresses.

, Women tend to be very tired in the last leg of pregnancy. Lie low as you continue to fake your pregnancy. Complain that you need to lie down and rest. Mention that you're feeling tired at work meetings and social events. Work on sleeping, or pretending to sleep, more often., You cannot keep up a fake pregnancy indefinitely. Eventually, you'll either have to admit you were faking or fake a miscarriage. Both of these routes are uncomfortable and come with negative consequences. Faking a pregnancy is risky and may not be a good decision. It could damage your relationships with other people. If you were using your fake pregnancy to get out of work obligations, it could result in the loss of your job. Before deciding to fake a pregnancy, seriously consider the consequences. A fake pregnancy might not be worth the risks.

Mark your calendar for 18 weeks into your pregnancy.,
See your OB/GYN for an ultrasound.,
Pursue non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT).,
Discuss more invasive testing with your doctor.",How to Find Out Your Baby's Sex1," You can usually determine the baby’s sex starting between 16-20 weeks into your pregnancy. It gets easier to tell around 18 weeks, so your best bet is to wait until then.Schedule your second trimester ultrasound for around this time.

You can find out your estimated date of delivery (EDD) when you have your first ultrasound at around 8-14 weeks of pregnancy. This is the best way to know how far along in your pregnancy you really are.;
, Ultrasounds (also called sonograms) make images of your baby using sound waves in a safe and non-invasive way.See a skilled doctor, nurse, or ultrasound technician. They can usually tell the baby’s sex by looking at their genitals on the ultrasound.When you schedule your ultrasound, ask your doctor if there are any specific instructions you should follow – you may need to drink a certain amount of fluids or avoid going to the bathroom before your ultrasound.The ultrasound may not help if your baby is in a position that makes it hard to see their genitals.
Ultrasounds are not 100% accurate for predicting the sex, though they’re close. You may still get the wrong answer due to human error.

, If an ultrasound doesn’t tell you what you want to know, talk to your OB/GYN about NIPT. Non-invasive prenatal testing is done by taking a blood sample from the mother. It can look for sex chromosomes to determine if the baby is a boy or a girl.This is a relatively common, accurate, and affordable option, and may even be offered as part of your prenatal care. This may vary, however, so call your health insurance company to ask if it's covered if you're worried about cost.
NIPT also checks for Down syndrome and some other abnormalities, so is a valuable test for several reasons. It can be done after 10 weeks into your pregnancy.

, Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis are tests that look for abnormalities in your baby’s genetics. They are usually only done if your baby is at risk for having genetic problems. If you do have one, request to find out your baby’s sex, as well. Do not pursue these simply to find out the sex – they can be uncomfortable and carry a small risk of miscarriage.CVS is performed between 10-13 weeks of pregnancy, and amniocentesis is done between 16-20 weeks.

Talk to your doctor before you start working out again.,
Wait at least six weeks after your surgery to start exercising.,
Start with gentle, low-impact exercises.,
Transition back to your normal routine over several weeks.,
Be gentle on your body.,
Consider wearing compression garments as you heal.,
Be prepared for physical and emotional barriers.",How to Exercise After a C Section1," Any post-pregnancy exercise should be okayed by a physician — this is especially true after a major procedure like a c-section, as the sutures on the incision can be compromised if the mother overexerts herself.Most new mothers need to be seen by their doctor at least once after their c-section anyway to ensure that their body is healing properly, so at this post-delivery checkup, let your OB/GYN know that you would like to start working out again and ask when it would be okay.



Note: the content of this article is not intended to replace the advice of your doctor.;
, Carrying a baby and giving birth can be traumatic for your body, even if everything goes right. For instance, a normal pregnancy can sometimes cause a condition called diastasis recti where the abdominal muscles move apart as the belly expands.On top of this, a c-section will leave you with an incision that takes time to heal. This makes relaxation during the recovery period especially crucial, even if you were in great shape before your pregnancy.


Traditionally, new mothers are advised to wait about six to eight weeks after any kind of pregnancy to resume most exercise. During this time, they are usually limited to very gentle activity like walking. Recently, doctors have begun allowing women to start exercising sooner than this.However, this does not necessarily apply to women who have had a c-section, as these women still have an incision that needs to heal.
Since different women heal at different speeds, be prepared to wait longer than this minimum time limit if your doctor advises you to do so.

, The first exercising you do after your c-section should be very gentle, even if you routinely lifted weights or ran marathons before your pregnancy. Your muscles (especially the ones in your hips and core) have been taxed by your pregnancy and the resulting lack of exercise that accompanied it, so they'll need to gradually work back up to their previous level of strength. Don't push yourself — doing too much too soon is a good way to injure yourself.



See the sections below for a selection of low-intensity strength and cardio exercises that you may want to consider trying. Your doctor or physical therapist will also be able to provide you with plenty of ideas.

, With a gentle exercise routine that gradually ramps up in intensity, you should quickly be back to your old self just a few months after your procedure. Be patient — you've just undergone a pregnancy and a major surgery, so the minor inconvenience of having to stick to a gentle exercise routine is nothing compared to your health and safety.

, As you work your way back towards your ordinary exercise routine, it's important to minimize the unnecessary stress you put on your body. Take the basic precautions below to stay safe:Take about five minutes to warm up and cool down every time you exercise.
Restrict your first few exercise sessions to about 10 minutes apiece, three times per week.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Wear a supportive bra (don't forget nursing pads if you're breastfeeding.)
Stop exercising immediately if you feel pain or get fatigued.

, One popular way to protect a c-section wound during exercise is to wear a type of clothing designed for postpartum women called a ""compression garment."" These sorts of clothes (which can have varying names like ""recovery shorts"" and so on) use gentle pressure to support c-section wounds as they heal, making them a useful aid for new mothers looking to get back into shape. While compression garments can tend to be on the expensive side (with some costing as much as almost $200 per pair), many mothers swear by them.


Note that compression garments aren't intended as shapewear, so if this is something that would bother you, you should feel no embarrassment about wearing them (which isn't to say you should be embarrassed if you do wear shapewear.)

, Exercising after a c-section can be tricky even if you're healing perfectly. You'll likely be quite busy. You'll probably get fatigued more easily than you're used to. You may even feel emotional or demotivated due to hormonal processes beyond your control.Do your best to surpass these hurdles and exercise when you can — exercising will help you feel better and give you plenty of energy to care for your new child.


If you frequently feel too tired, sad, demotivated, or ""blah"" after your pregnancy to start exercising, you may be suffering from postpartum depression. Talk to your doctor to find a treatment plan that works for you.

Chart your morning sickness.,
Use a Chinese gender chart.,
Find your extra baby weight.,
Make a ring pendulum.",How to Find Out Your Baby's Sex2," Old wives tales say that if you suffer from morning sickness a lot in the first three months of pregnancy, you’ll have a girl. Keep a log or chart of your morning sickness. You may be more likely to have a girl if you have morning sickness and feel ill throughout your pregnancy, according to some modern studies. Little or no morning sickness might mean a boy is on the way.It’s normal to have morning sickness most in the first trimester because of your changing hormones, so this method isn’t very reliable., Use your birthday and the date of the baby’s conception to guess the sex based on a Chinese gender chart. Simply input those two dates onto the grid and see where they line up - on male or female. This ancient method claims to be very accurate, though no research support it.Try a gender chart here for fun., Look in the mirror and notice where you’re gaining your extra baby weight. This is an old method of guessing the sex, though it’s not scientifically backed. If your extra weight is on your hips and buttocks, you may be having a girl; if it’s at the front of your belly, a boy may be on the way., Tie your wedding ring or another ring to a string and let it swing over your belly. Watch which way it swings. If it moves in a circle, legend says you’re having a boy; if it moves side to side, a girl.There’s no science to back this up, but try it just for fun!"

Try bridges to strengthen your hips.,
Try Kegels to strengthen your pelvic floor.,
Try forward bends to strengthen your lower back.,
Try planks to strengthen your abs.,
Try arm rotations to strengthen your arms and thighs.",How to Exercise After a C Section2," These gentle, easy exercises help tone crucial muscles in your hips and core. Follow these steps to do a bridge:


Lay on your back with your legs apart and your knees bent at about 45 degree angles.
Squeeze your lower ab muscles as you raise your hips off of the floor.
Raise your hips to a point that they're aligned with your upper body. Hold this position for a few seconds.
Slowly lower your hips back to the floor.
Repeat for three sets of 10 reps (or as many as feel comfortable.)

, These exercises can strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which are important for balance and stability. In addition, Kegels improve your ability to stop urine flow (which can sometimes be a problem for postpartum women) and can be performed anywhere. Use the steps below to do a Kegel:


Find your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing the muscle you use to stop your urine mid-flow (you can wait until you have to go to the bathroom to test this if you're having a hard time.) These are the muscles you'll use during a Kegel exercise.
Concentrate on gently squeezing your pelvic floor muscles. You can do this in virtually any position, though some find it easiest while sitting.
Hold the squeeze for five seconds.
Gently release your squeeze. Repeat as often as you want, whenever you want.
Note that some women find it uncomfortable to do Kegels with a full bladder, as this can cause pain and may lead to some leakage.

, Back strength is important for anyone, as it's crucial for maintaining proper posture and avoiding lumbar pain. Follow the steps below to do a forward bend:Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands on your hips.
Raise your arms over your head. Start to slowly bend forward at the waist.
Keep bending forward until your upper body is level with the floor, keeping your back flat.
Slowly rise back to a standing position.
Repeat for three sets of four to eight reps (or as many as feel comfortable.)

, While ab strength is important, crunches and situps can be a little too intense for someone who's just had a c-section. Try starting instead with an exercise called a plank, which won't put stress on your wound. Follow the steps below to do a plank:


Get into a pushup position (knees and palms on the ground.)
Lower yourself onto your elbows. Simultaneously lift your knees off the ground.
Straighten your body. Your feet, hips, and shoulders should make a straight line.
Hold this position for 30-60 seconds, keeping your ab and hip muscles tight and your form straight.
Repeat two to four times.

, While postpartum exercise routines usually put a great emphasis on core strength, your arms and legs shouldn't be ignored. Try following the steps below to hit both at once:


Stand, legs a shoulder-width apart, with your arms fully extended to your sides.
Trace the smallest circles you can in the air with your fingertips, keeping your arm rigid as you do so.
Increase the circle width slowly over a period of five minutes. Use your leg muscles to stabilize yourself as the larger circles start to affect your balance.
When you get to the fullest circle you can manage, start decreasing the circle size and rotate in the opposite direction.
Rest for several minutes before repeating the exercise once again.

Walk around your neighborhood.,
Try swimming or water aerobics.,
Try gentle cycling.,
Try elliptical machines.,
Work up to more strenuous activities.",How to Exercise After a C Section3," Walking is an extremely safe, effective form of exercise. Not only is this a light enough activity to get you gradually back into exercising after surgery, but it also allows you to bring your baby in a stroller. Use a walking routine as an excuse to get outside for fresh air, which can be a challenge during the first few weeks after birth.

, In general, activities that take place in the water tend to be low-impact. Try making a trip to your local pool and doing five to ten gentle laps or enrolling in a water aerobics class for a gentle, balanced, and (most importantly) low-risk cardio workout.


If you swim, use a gentle stroke like the crawl, back, or breast strokes. Don't use a difficult or high-intensity one like the butterfly stroke.

, As long as you don't go over any major bumps, cycling can be a great form of low-intensity exercise. Best of all, it's something you can do at the gym and at home, provided you own a bicycle. You can even add a baby carrier to your bike to bring your new baby along for a ride.


Try restricting your cycling to flat areas and gentle hills. Straining to pedal uphill or going over bumps can be problematic if your incision hasn't completely healed yet.

, While running is usually off-limits for women for a while after a c-section, elliptical exercise machines offer a low-impact alternative. If you use an elliptical machine, proceed at a moderate pace and use a level of resistance that you're comfortable with. Don't overtax yourself — it's harder, but it's still possible to hurt yourself on an elliptical.

, Once you have been working out for several weeks with no issues, you can start ramping up your cardio routine. Gradually reintroduce more difficult, higher-impact exercises like running, jogging, stair climbing, dancing, aerobics, and so on. Only increase the intensity of your exercise routine as quickly as is comfortable — if at any point your exercise starts to hurt you or causes you to become over-fatigued, decrease its intensity.

Set an aerobic goal.,
Aim for at least 150 minutes of steady-state cardio each week.,
Do interval training one to two times a week.,
Reduce the amount of time you are sedentary each day.,
Set a weight training goal.,
Include strength training.,
Improve strength in your lower body.,
Improve strength in your upper body.,
Include flexibility training.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Don't skip meals.,
Include a pre- or post-workout snack.,
Drink adequate fluids.",How to Get in Shape Fast," Getting in shape quickly is a vague goal. It mostly includes a desire to get in shape both aerobically and to build muscular strength.


Start by setting an aerobic or cardiovascular goal. Make sure to be specific and realistic with your goals.
An example of a goal could be: “I want to be able to run a 5k in two months” or “I want to be able to jog continuously for 30 minutes without walking.”
Give yourself a monetary or physical reward if you reach your goals. Rewards can help keep you motivated and positive.;
, Regardless of your specific aerobic goal, you should aim to include 150 minutes of cardio exercise each week. This is the minimum amount found to have a significant benefit on your health and get you into shape.Cardio will help you reach part of your goal to get in shape. It can help you to control your weight, strengthen your heart and lungs, improve your circulation, improve your mood, and increase your chance of living a longer, healthier life.If you are just starting with exercise, do low intensity activities for short amounts of time, like 20 to 30 minutes. Try walking, using an elliptical machine, or swimming. Once exercises become easier, increase the intensity, frequency, or duration to continue to keep your body challenged.
If you currently exercise, try to do more moderate or higher intensity exercises. You can jog or run, use a stair master, do the rowing machine or take high intensity aerobic classes for periods up to 60 minutes.
Always warm up and cool down for aerobic exercise. Spend 5 minutes doing a lower intensity version of whatever exercise you plan on doing. For example, walk briskly for about 5 minutes if you plan on jogging for your workout.

, Whether you run, use the elliptical, sprint or do other types of cardio, you can increase the amount of calories you burn by changing the intensity or alternating between higher and lower intensity exercises.


Higher intensity interval training is typically beneficial for those who currently exercise. These exercises can be very difficult and are a great way to increase your aerobic fitness quickly.In addition, these exercises are known for increased calorie burn, increased fat burning and increased metabolism.They are great for weight loss in addition to getting you in shape.
Interval training is a type of exercise that alternates short bouts of high intensity exercise with longer bouts of more moderate intensity activities. You can use any aerobic activity and turn it into interval training. You can alternate between sprinting and jogging, switch up between low and high intensity cycling, or increase the intensity on an elliptical machine.

, There is more and more evidence that increased sitting during the day also increases the risk for obesity, metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.Try to increase your activity levels during your entire day. If you want to get in shape, then moving more or walking more during the day in addition to your planned and structured activity can help to improve your fitness levels.Try walking an extra 30 minutes each day. If you do not have time to walk 30 minutes continuously, then walk for 10 minutes after each meal, or walk during your lunch break.
Try to stand more at work. Invest in a sit/stand desk that allows you to raise your computer screen and keyboard. Standing burns more calories, and it can give you more energy. Remember to slowly incorporate standing, since your feet and legs can become sore.
Avoid sitting in front of a television on nights and weekends. If you do watch TV, then try doing something active during this time. Do exercises during the commercial breaks or walk in place for a portion of this time.
Buy a pedometer. Aim to reach the doctor-recommended goal of 10,000 steps during the course of your day.

, In addition to your cardiovascular goal, set a weight training or resistance training goal. Think about whether or not you want to build muscle mass, build strength or just tone your muscles.


Building bulk requires a specific weight lifting regimen. In addition, it will require a different type of diet to help support the increase in muscle mass.
Building strength and toning uses different types of exercises and weights compared to when you want to build bulk.

, In addition to your cardio exercises, include a couple of days of strength training. This will round out your workouts and help get you in shape.Strength training exercises are ones that will help build strength, bulk and provide definition to your body. In addition, strength training helps increase your metabolism and body's ability to burn calories and reduce your risk for osteoporosis.Take adequate amounts of rest days. With strength training specifically, it's important to rest your muscle groups. Take a day off in-between strength training days or alternate between different muscle groups. You do not want to work the same muscle groups more than one day in a row., The best lower body exercises to include to get in shape fast are compound exercises because they work multiple muscle groups all at once. Include some of the following exercises to help build strength in your lower body quickly:


Squats
Lunges
Deadlifts
Leg press
Hamstring curl
Calf raises

, It is important to include compound exercises for your upper body as well. This can cut down on training time and help you get multiple muscle groups into shape more quickly. Try:


Bench press
Front, lateral and rear flyes
Dumbbell overhead press
Pushups
Lat pull
Power clean
Rows, such as bent over dumbbell rows or barbell rows, resistance band pulls, seated rows on a machine, or cable pull rows.

, Stretching and flexibility training is equally important part of an exercise plan. Stretch every time you work out to help complete your workout plan.


Stretching can help relieve aches and pains, improve range of motion, increase athletic performance, decrease your risk for activity-based injuries, and prevent postural problems including joint misalignments.When you're stretching, do not bounce in the position. Hold your stretch steady and only push slightly - don't push to the point where you feel pain.Hold each position for a minimum of 20 seconds.
Some stretches to include are the standing side stretch, forward bend, low lunge and the seated back twist.

, Regardless of your health or wellness goal, eating a balanced diet will play a key role. This helps to ensure that you're eating enough food for your body and activity level.Eat foods from each food group every day. Choose a wide variety of foods from within each food group over the course of a week.Protein will play an especially important role in your diet when you're trying to get in shape. It will fuel your workouts and maintain your lean muscle mass. Include a 3 to 4 oz serving of protein at each meal.Also include 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables each day. These foods are low in calories, but they will provide your body with a large quantity of essential vitamins and minerals daily.Try to include 100% whole grains in your diet. These high fiber grains are much more nutritious that refined grains like white flour. Measure out a few 1 oz or 1/2 cup servings daily., It's never advisable to skip meals. When you're trying to get in shape and increasing your physical activity levels, you'll need adequate fuel from your diet to maintain your lifestyle.


You need to maintain your blood sugar and energy levels by eating healthy foods regularly, rather than skipping meals.
Skipping meals regularly can result in unwanted weight loss or loss of lean muscle mass. This will make getting in shape more difficult., If you've increased the amount of time, duration or frequency of your workouts, you might find that you're more hungry and need to have either a pre or post workout snack.


Snacks can be a healthy addition to your diet. Regardless of whether or not you're watching your weight, well-planned and nutritious snacks can fuel workouts and help improve recovery.Pre-workout snacks should be somewhat small and be mostly simple carbohydrates. These help give your body the immediate energy to get you through your workout.Try a piece of fruit, a slice of whole grain bread with jam, or a glass of low-fat milk.
Include a post workout snack to help your body repair and recover. You'll need to include carbohydrates and protein.Try an apple with peanut butter, a protein shake, or just have a healthy meal.

, Like eating regular balanced meals, you'll also need to ensure you're consuming enough fluids each day to help maintain proper hydration.


With increased physical activity, you will lose more water and fluids from your sweat. In addition to drinking adequate fluids for your body, you'll need to make sure you drink enough to replace the fluids lost through your activities.
Most health professionals recommended consuming at least 8 to 13 glasses daily. You want to make sure your urine is light or pale yellow by the end of the day.Only drink fluids that will hydrate your body without added calories. Try water, flavored water, decaf coffee and decaf tea.

Perform a uterine massage.,
Try bimanual compression if the massage does not work.,
Manually explore the uterine cavity if bimanual compression does not produce results.,
Remove any fragments found in the uterus.,
Use surgical methods to combat the PPH.,
Use sutures to repair wounds caused by trauma.,
Treat hematomas.,
Revert the uterus in case of uterine inversion.,
Consider a cesarean delivery in the case of a uterine rupture.,
Treat tissue retention.",How to Eliminate Postpartum Hemorrhage1," The first step in managing this condition is a technique called bimanual uterine massage which is performed to try to stimulate the uterus to regain its tone.At the same time, administration of uterotonics (like oxytocin) should be carried out.


Uterine massage should only be carried out by a physician. It involves elevating the uterus, by pressing on the fundus both internally (with one hand) and externally (with the other).;
, If uterine massage fails to give the uterus some degree of ""tone"", bimanual compression should be applied. This is a similar maneuver to the uterine massage, with a more aggressive approach.


With bimanual compression, a firm pressure is applied by the physician with both hands (which are in similar positions as in uterine massage) in order to evoke a response from the uterine musculature.

, Manual exploration of the uterine cavity is carried out by the physician, to try to find the cause of PPH. Exploration of the uterine cavity should be performed in the operating room, in more sterile conditions, to minimize chances of contracting an infection.


The exploration may reveal some defects in the muscular wall of the uterus, as well as hematomas, or even uterine rupture, which can be seen if the patient had previous cesarean delivery or uterine surgery.
If any of these disorders are found during the exploration by the physician, operative intervention will be necessary.

, During a manual examination, placental fragments that were retained in the uterus during birth may be discovered.


Removal of these fragments is essential in eliminating PPH, since they can be recognized as the source of bleeding.
Manual removal of these fragments or curettage are procedures by which these fragments are removed. Curettage comprises surgical ""scraping"" of these fragments, with the use of a scoop.

, In such cases, a laparotomy is performed to efficiently control and stop the bleeding, by promptly identifying the source of hemorrhage. Laparotomy is a procedure carried out via a large incision on the abdominal wall, in order to gain direct access into the abdomen and uterus.


Depending on the findings, surgical suturing, ligation of blood vessels, and in severe cases, hysterectomy, are procedures that are indicated in PPH.
Suturing and ligation include management of the arterial supply to the uterus and the abdominal cavity. Closing these arteries may effectively reduce and eliminate PPH.
Hysterectomy is performed only if these surgical procedures fail, and the patient is not hemodynamically stable.

, Lacerations and hematomas resulting from birth trauma can cause significant blood loss that can be lessened by hemostasis and timely repair. Sutures should be done if direct pressure does not stop the bleeding.


Episiotomy increases blood loss and the risk of anal sphincter tears, and this procedure should be avoided unless urgent delivery is necessary and the perineum is thought to be a limiting factor., A hematoma is a solid swelling of clotted blood within the tissue. It can present as pain or as a change in vital signs disproportionate to the amount of blood loss. Small hematomas can be managed with close observation.


Patients with persistent signs of blood loss despite fluid replacement, as well as those with large or enlarging hematomas, require incision and evacuation of the clot.
The involved area should be irrigated and the bleeding vessels ligated.

, Uterine inversion is rare, occurring in 0.05 percent of deliveries. The inverted uterus usually appears as a bluish-gray mass protruding from the vagina.


Every attempt should be made to replace the uterus quickly. Once the uterus is reverted, uterotonic agents should be given to promote uterine tone and to prevent recurrence.
If initial attempts to replace the uterus fail or a cervical contraction ring develops, administration of magnesium sulfate, terbutaline (Brethine), nitroglycerin, or general anesthesia may allow sufficient uterine relaxation for manipulation.
If these methods fail, the uterus will need to be replaced surgically., Although rare in an unscarred uterus, clinically significant uterine rupture occurs in 0.6 to 0.7 percent of vaginal births, after a cesarean delivery in women with a low transverse or unknown uterine scar.The risk increases significantly with previous classical incisions or uterine surgeries, and to a lesser extent with shorter intervals between pregnancies or a history of multiple cesarean deliveries, particularly in women with no previous vaginal deliveries.
Before delivery, the primary sign of uterine rupture is decrease in fetal heart rate (bradycardia). Vaginal bleeding, abdominal tenderness, maternal tachycardia (increased heart rate in mother), circulatory collapse, or increasing abdominal girth are also signs of uterine rupture. Symptomatic uterine rupture requires surgical repair of the defect or a hysterectomy.

, Classic signs of placental separation include a small gush of blood with lengthening of the umbilical cord and a slight rise of the uterus in the pelvis. The mean time from delivery until placental expulsion is eight to nine minutes. Longer intervals are associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, with rates doubling after 10 minutes.


Retained placenta (i.e., failure of the placenta to deliver within 30 minutes after birth) occurs in less than 3 percent of vaginal deliveries. One management option is to inject the umbilical vein with 20 mL of a solution of 0.9 percent saline and 20 units of oxytocin. This significantly reduces the need for manual removal of the placenta compared with injecting saline alone.Alternatively, physicians may proceed directly to manual removal of the placenta, using appropriate analgesia. If the tissue plane between the uterine wall and placenta cannot be developed through blunt dissection with the edge of the gloved hand, invasive placenta should be considered.

Discuss your plans with your doctor.,
Build up slowly.,
Observe your limits.",How to Exercise Safely During Pregnancy1," If you and your baby are healthy and the pregnancy is not expected to be complicated, your doctor will probably encourage you to engage in a moderate amount of exercise. Your doctor may advise you not to exercise if you have:Vaginal bleeding
Problems with your cervix
High blood pressure due to the pregnancy
Heart or lung problems
A risk of having a preterm birth;
, You may find that you get tired more easily than you did before you were pregnant. If you exercised before pregnancy you can continue at similar length but may need to reduce intensity. Otherwise, start with five or 10 minutes of exercise per day and work up to about 30 minutes of moderate activity.It doesn't have to be a long period of exercise or should not be too intense. Push yourself just enough to get your heart rate up and your blood circulating.
If you are out of breath and unable to speak then you are pushing yourself too hard.

, You will get tired more easily as the pregnancy progresses. Be sure to drink extra water. During pregnancy you are particularly vulnerable to dehydration. Stop exercising immediately if you feel any of the following:Dizziness or lightheadedness
Difficulty breathing
Back pain
Nausea
Swelling or numbness
An abnormally accelerated or uneven heartbeat

Consider the use of oxytocin.,
Give the mother ergot alkaloids.,
Give the mother prostaglandins.",How to Eliminate Postpartum Hemorrhage2," Oxytocin stimulates the upper segment of the uterine myometrium to contract rhythmically, which constricts spiral arteries and decreases blood flow through the uterus. Oxytocin is an effective first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage.


10 international units (IU) should be injected intramuscularly, or 20 IU in 1 L of saline may be infused at a rate of 250 mL per hour.
As much as 500 mL can be infused over 10 minutes without complications.

, Methylergonovine (Methergine) and ergometrine are ergot alkaloids that cause generalized smooth muscle contraction in which the upper and lower segments of the uterus contract.


However, these ergot alkaloid agents raise blood pressure, hence they are contraindicated in women with hypertension. Other adverse effects include nausea and vomiting.
A typical dose of methylergonovine, 0.2 mg administered intramuscularly, may be repeated as required at intervals of two to four hours.

, Prostaglandins enhance uterine contractility and cause vasoconstriction. The prostaglandin most commonly used is 15-methyl prostaglandin F2a, or carboprost (Hemabate). Misoprostol is another prostaglandin that increases uterine tone and decreases postpartum bleeding.


Misoprostol is effective in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, but side effects may limit its use.It can be administered sublingually, orally, vaginally, and rectally. Doses range from 200 to 1,000 mcg; the dose recommended by FIGO is 1,000 mcg administered rectally.

"
"
Discuss your patient’s medical history.,
Actively manage your patient.,
Reexamine your patient regularly.,
Consider giving your patient oxytocin to reduce her chances of developing PPH.",How to Eliminate Postpartum Hemorrhage3," Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage include a prolonged third stage of labor, multiple delivery, episiotomy, fetal macrosomia (large baby) , and history of postpartum hemorrhage., Active management, which involves administering a uterotonic drug with or soon after the delivery of the first shoulder and using controlled cord traction and uterine massage after delivery of the placenta can decrease the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and shorten the third stage of labor with no significant increase in the risk of retained placenta., Reexamination of the patient's vital signs and vaginal flow before leaving the delivery area may help detect slow, steady bleeding.

, Prophylactic administration of oxytocin (Pitocin) reduces rates of postpartum hemorrhage by 40 percent. This reduction also occurs if oxytocin is given after placental delivery."
"
Choose beneficial exercises.,
Avoid risky sports.,
Enjoy the benefits of cardiovascular exercise.",How to Exercise Safely During Pregnancy2," If you previously did cardiovascular exercises and your doctor says it is ok to continue, you may find it easiest to just adjust the intensity of your activities. Possible activities include:Walking. Walking is an excellent way to get your heart rate up and maintain your leg muscles. Take care to wear shoes that support your feet and your ankles. Invest in a good sports bra which will continue to support you as your breasts enlarge. Walking will get you outside in the sunshine and can be done with your partner or friends.
Swimming. Swimming is excellent during pregnancy because it takes the weight off your joints while you move. Purchase a good pair of goggles so that you can swim with you face in the water. This will reduce the stress on your back. Avoid the butterfly stroke because of the extreme spinal movements it requires. If you have any pelvic pain while doing the breaststroke, switch to a different stroke. Even if you don’t swim well, many community pools have water aerobics courses for pregnant women.
Biking. If you biked a lot before your pregnancy, you may want to switch to using a stationary bike. This has the advantage that it is stable and you won't fall.

, This means that you should avoid activities in which you have a risk of falling or being hit, bumped, or jostled. Activities to avoid include:Yoga poses that require you to lie flat on your back after 20 weeks. This can reduce the blood supply to you and the baby.
Contact sports like football, soccer, boxing, rugby, and basketball
Sports like tennis or volleyball which require you to make sudden changes of direction
Activities in which you are in danger of falling such as climbing, horseback riding, skiing, or skating
Activities that involve exposure to heat like exercising during hot weather, Bikram yoga (hot yoga), steam rooms, saunas, and hot tubs

, Engaging in a safe, moderate amount of exercise will benefit both you and the baby by:Relieving backaches, leg cramps, constipation, bloating, and swelling
Lowering your risk of having gestational diabetes
Improving your mood and giving you more energy
Making you sleep better
Getting you in shape for having an easier birth and faster recovery

Maintain your upper-body strength.,
Work your core muscles with V-sits.,
Tone your legs.,
Try yoga or pilates.,
Strengthen your pelvic floor muscles with Kegel exercises.",How to Exercise Safely During Pregnancy3," There are several activities that you can do to get your arms and back in shape for lifting and holding your baby after the birth:


Wall pushups. This exercise strengthens your pectoral muscles and your triceps. Stand facing a wall with your legs shoulder-width apart. Put your palms on the wall at shoulder height. Bend your elbows and lean into the wall until your nose touches the wall. Push yourself upright with your arms. Start small and work up to doing 15.Rowing with a resistance band. Sit on a chair with the band under your feet in front of you and hold the ends. Sit with your back straight. Pull the band back with your elbows as if you were rowing. Aim to build up to 15 repetitions. You can purchase a resistance band at your local athletics store., There are several variations on these exercises. These exercises are best done only during the first three months of the pregnancy.The following exercises are recommended for pregnant women by the Mayo Clinic:


Supported V-sits. Sit on the ground with your legs bent and your feet flat on the floor. Lean back so that your back is approximately 45 degrees from the floor. You can support yourself by putting a firm pillow in the small of your back or use a balance trainer (a piece of gym equipment that looks like a large stability ball cut in half). Lift one leg until your lower leg is parallel to the floor. Maintain that position for about five seconds and then put your leg down. Do this 10 times and then switch legs.V-sits. Sit on top of a balance trainer or a footstool so you are about a foot off the ground. Your legs should be bent and your feet flat on the floor. Lean back until you feel your stomach muscles working. Hold the position for approximately five second and then sit up straight again. Do this 10 times.Once you get good at the V-sit you can do them while lifting first one leg, then the other., These exercises will help you maintain your leg muscles, your flexibility, and your balance. Some of the positions, like squats, can even be done during labor to help the baby drop down into the birth canal.


Squats. Stand with your back against the wall and your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and slide down the wall until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Then push yourself back to a standing position. If you can’t go all the way down, that is okay. You can work up to it. Aim to be able to do 10 squats.Leg lifts. Get on your hands and knees. Then lift one leg so that it is out straight behind you and parallel to the floor. Hold this position for five seconds, and then lower your leg. Repeat this 10 times and then do the other side., Many women enjoy doing yoga and pilates to both stay in shape and to get in touch with their bodies. These activities focus on stretching and toning your muscles.


If you take a course at your local gym or community center, look for one that is specifically for pregnant women. Tell the instructor how far along you are in the pregnancy.
If you do yoga or pilates at home, discuss it with your doctor first to make sure the exercises are safe for you. Consider a pregnancy-specific video to do at home.

, Getting your pelvic floor muscles in shape can help you have an easier delivery and recover faster. It also helps women avoid having urinary incontinence after giving birth. Practice these exercises three times per day.Short squeezes. These exercises increase your strength. Lie on your back or sit with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Contract the muscles around your anus as if you are preventing yourself from passing gas. Then, at the same time, contract the muscles around your vagina and bladder like you do if you are stopping the flow of urine midstream. Do this without squeezing your buttocks together. Your buttocks should be relaxed throughout. Hold this squeeze for one to two seconds. Repeat it until you get tired.
Long squeezes. These exercises increase the endurance of your muscles. They are done the same way as the short squeezes except that you hold them longer. For some women holding it for four seconds will be enough to give the muscles a workout. Other women may be able to hold it for 10 seconds or longer. Overtime you will be able to squeeze for longer and do more repetitions.
If you are experiencing significant incontinence and can't do the Kegels correctly, there are physical therapists that specialize in teaching these exercises correctly. Your doctor can make a referral.

"
Drink lots of water.,
Have high fiber foods.,
Avoid foods that cause gas.,
Have small meals throughout the day.,
Eat your food slowly.",How to Fight Bloat During Pregnancy1," When you are pregnant, you should drink about 10 cups or 2.3 liters of water a day. Staying hydrated will help your body flush out foods and liquids in your body. It can also prevent constipation and reduce your bloating.You may try adding lemon or lime slices to your water to give it a little natural flavor and to motivate yourself to drink water throughout the day.You can also drink more water by having a glass of it with every meal. You can also get in the habit of carrying a water bottle with you so you can sip water throughout the day.
Avoid drinking soda and fruit drinks, as they often contain high fructose corn syrup. This ingredient can be difficult for your body to digest and lead to more bloating.;
, If you are feeling bloated, fiber is a good way to help get things moving in your intestines. You should make sure you get at least 25 grams of fiber a day so your digestive system can do its job properly.Have bran cereal or other high fiber foods like strawberries, blueberries, dried apricots, and dried plums. Add a little bit of fiber at a time to your diet as having too much fiber at once can lead to more bloating. Your body needs some time to process increased bulk in your digestive system.

, Beans, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage all contain sugars that can lead to bloating and gas. Try cutting them out of your diet or eating a half-cup serving of these foods at every meal. You should also reduce your intake of fried foods, sugary foods, and rich sauces high in fat. You can try moderating your intake by having smaller amounts of these foods or cut them out of your diet completely.Another option is to take a digestive enzyme before you eat any foods that could cause gas. You can find digestive enzymes at your local drugstore or online. Speak to your doctor before you take the enzyme if you are worried about complications while pregnant.

, Break up your meals so you have five to six small meals a day rather than the standard three meals a day. Having smaller meals will make it easier for your body to digest your food and keep your nutrition levels consistent.You may try making a meal plan where you schedule in small meals throughout the day so you know exactly when you are eating and what you are eating. Post the meal plan where you can see it or keep it on your phone so you can refer to it throughout the day.

, Take your time when you eat and chew your food several times before swallowing. Eating too fast can cause you to swallow air, which can lead to feeling bloated and gassy.When you eat, you should try to focus on your food and enjoy each bite. Eating while distracted, such as while watching television, can cause you to eat too fast and not pay attention to your food.

Add relaxation breaks into your schedule.,
Do deep breathing exercises.,
Take up a calming activity.",How to Fight Bloat During Pregnancy2," Another major cause of bloating during pregnancy is feelings of stress and anxiety. You should try to reduce your stress levels by adding in breaks into your schedule where you can relax and unwind. You may put in 10 minute breaks into your daily schedule so you can take some time to sit in a private place or a quiet space and relax. This way, you have enough time to get things done and time for yourself.When you are pregnant, you may also take some time off from your regular routine and responsibilities. You may take on less at work and have shorter work hours. Or you may lessen your load at home and allow your partner or family to help you with chores like cooking and cleaning.

, You can reduce your stress levels by doing breathing exercises at home or at work. Deep breathing can help you relax and calm down if you are feeling overwhelmed or uncomfortable. Try doing deep breathing exercises in a quiet, dark space, such as in your office with the door closed or in your bedroom at home.


To do deep breathing exercises, sit in comfortable position and close your eyes. Inhale slowly from your diaphragm. You can place your hands on your diaphragm, just below your ribs to feel it expand. Inhale for a count of four and then hold the top of the breath for one count.
Exhale slowly, letting your diaphragm contract, for a count of four. Repeat these motions for five to ten breaths.
While you do deep breathing exercises, you can try elevating your legs for extra relaxation. Elevating your legs can also take pressure off your lower back and ease bloating. Place your legs on a stack of pillows and lay down on the floor. Or lay down in bed and put pillows under your legs so they are higher than your head., To de stress, you can take up an activity that will be calming and relaxing. This could be a calming exercise like yoga or going for a walk. Or you may take up a calming hobby, such as knitting, painting, or drawing. Doing a relaxing activity can help keep your stress levels down and prevent you from feeling bloated or gassy due to stress.You may trying scheduling in a calming activity into your day so you have time set aside for relaxation. You may also schedule your calming activity for right before you eat so you can come to your meals with a calm demeanor, allowing you to eat slowly and enjoy your food.

Ask your doctor about natural remedies for bloating.,
Schedule monthly check ins with your doctor.",How to Fight Bloat During Pregnancy3," If your bloating gets very uncomfortable or intense, you may want to talk to your doctor about the problem. Your doctor may do a physical exam to ensure there are no other medical issues that may be causing your bloating. They may also suggest certain lifestyle changes to help relieve your bloating.Your doctor may also recommend dietary changes to help with bloating.
They may suggest you take over the counter digestion medication or bloating medication to addressing your issue.

, There are several natural remedies for bloating that can help to relieve the issue, such as drinking peppermint tea, taking peppermint capsules or using charcoal capsules. You should check with your doctor before you take any natural remedies to ensure they are safe for use during pregnancy and will not conflict with any medical conditions you may have.For example, you may ask your doctor, ""Do you recommend any natural remedies to treat bloating?"" or ""Are natural remedies like peppermint or charcoal capsules safe for me to use?""

, As part of your health plan during pregnancy, you should have check ins with your doctor on a monthly basis. You should discuss any medical issues you may be experiencing while pregnant, such as bloating, constipation, and gas.

Get dressed in the morning.,
Do something nice for yourself.,
Make yourself feel sexy.,
Buy new clothes to fit your new, curvier shape.,
Give yourself time to heal.,
Enlist the help of friends.,
Eat right and well.,

Set goals that you can accomplish.",How to Feel Confident About Your Post‐Pregnancy Body," Your body will go through a number of changes during pregnancy and after delivery. Remind yourself that some people recover faster than others, and that studies have shown a year is typically the average time for a body to heal and reach it's new normal. Don't be discouraged if it takes time, and remind yourself that you are working toward a larger goal., Remember that your body has just undergone considerable stress and is under transition. You are likely bruised, torn and swollen and all of this will take time to readjust and heal. Avoid staring at yourself in the mirror for the first few weeks and remember that this body is not permanent., In addition to not judging yourself, avoid making negative remarks about your body, both in your head and to others. This will only make it harder for you to feel confident and is a form of self harm. Also, be sure to accept compliments. Someone might tell you that you look beautiful, and though you may not feel it, accept it. Express thanks to them.Repeat kind things to yourself in the morning like “I am beautiful, I am strong, I am confident.”

, Though you may not be feeling so confident about your body, work to see it as better, not worse than it was pre-pregnancy. Many women, after having their first child, report feeling more powerful and more motivated to push their body further than before. Some run marathons, report having better sex lives, or feel more confident at work.Take some time to think about all that your body has endured. This will help to shift and reconfigure your negative thoughts about your body.

, Though your body has changed, there are likely still many parts of it that you do still like. Perhaps your breasts have grown or your hips have become curvier. You might love your facial features, your hair or your lips. Emphasize the parts of yourself that you do like by wearing lipstick or certain styles of clothes.Focus on the other characteristics of yourself that you like as well that are not external, like your humor or intellect.

, Many of your friends or family may have struggled with similar issues of body discomfort after having a baby. Talk to them about those issues as well as how they overcame them.

You might say “Lately, I’ve been really struggling to get used to my new body. What did you do after you had your baby and your body changed?”

, One way to begin feeling better about yourself is to wake up and get dressed in the morning like you used to before the baby. Fix your hair, put on a cute outfit, and wear some makeup. These simple things can make a big difference in increasing your confidence and making you feel more like yourself.Be sure to shower everyday, though you may feel that you don’t have time. Not showering will only make you feel gross and even less confident.

, During this time of transition, show kindness to yourself by buying something you’ve been wanting or treating yourself to a spa day. It can be easy to slip into caring only for your child and forgetting to care for yourself. But remember that in order to be the best mother, you have to feel happy and content as well. Get those new shoes or that lipstick you’ve been wanting.If you’re tight on money, have an at home spa day. Do your nails and toenails, style your hair and do an at home facial.

, Though you may not feel it at this time, fake it until you make it. Think of the things that made you feel sexy before the baby and continue to do those things now. Go out dancing if you can find a sitter one night, wear red lipstick or buy some new sexy panties for yourself.Though sex might help you feel more sexy, you should avoid it entirely for six weeks after having your baby.

, Your lack of confidence may be tied up in your body changing but it could also have something to do with your clothes being ill-fitting now that you have more curves. Go out and buy a few new items to wear for now so that you don’t have to wear maternity clothes or clothes that are too tight. Wear what fits, and what makes you feel comfortable in the moment.

If you are tight on cash, consider going to a Goodwill, Plato’s Closet, or other resale shops. You can also sell some of your own old clothes.
You can also consider updating your old clothes if the size is right but the silhouette is wrong.

, You may be eager to begin hitting the gym immediately after giving birth, anxiously researching diets to go on to lose the weight or considering surgery to rid yourself of your stretch marks. Though these feelings and plans are understandable, give yourself some time and some space to heal. Put off weight loss or other cosmetic planning for a bit after having the baby.Enjoy motherhood during this time. You will never get these days back, so soak up the memories.
Do things to relax yourself in the moments of quiet that you do have.
Do only the cooking and cleaning that is absolutely necessary. It’s okay to have a bit of a mess for a few weeks while you heal.

, If you have a partner, rely on them to clean and cook around the house, as well as help care for the new child. You can also rely on friends or family to help, too. If you have any close and trusting relationships, invite those people over to help watch the baby for a few hours while you catch up on any things that you might need to do.

You might call them and say “Hey, could you come over for a bit to help me with the baby? I need to do some laundry.”
Don’t turn away help if you are offered it.

, After you have had your baby, though you may not be eating for two anymore, your body is still recovering and needs proper nutrition. Do not try to starve yourself to lose weight quicker; if you do so, you will lack energy and be less able to care for your child. Fuel up on foods high in protein and vitamins like grilled chicken, fruits and vegetables. Your body will feel better the better you feed it.If you are breastfeeding, avoid alcohol, smoking and drugs.
Be sure to have three balanced meals per day.

, Remember that during this time, your body needs rest. Though your newborn is likely keeping you up a lot at night, try to sleep when they sleep instead of staying awake to complete other tasks. You can complete some of those while they are awake, particularly if you have a baby carrier that attaches to your body.If you live with family or a partner, you may consider establishing a rotating late-night care schedule. That way, there is always someone appointed to look after the baby, but everyone has a chance to get some rest as well.

, After a few weeks of rest and getting acclimated to motherhood, you may want to get back into a workout routine. Start off small while your body is healing and perhaps take a walk around the block with your baby a few times a week. Join a gym or purchase some workout DVDs. You can also find workout routines online.Find a workout buddy to help keep you committed to exercise.
Find workouts online that incorporate your baby.
Look for gyms that have daycares.

, During this time, you are likely very eager to get back to your pre-pregnancy body. While this is understandable, realize that this might not happen or might take a while to do so. Work on setting small goals that you can accomplish so that you feel productive.Set goals like “Walk for 30 minutes today.”

Your parent or guardian can write a sick note for your teacher after you recover or drop it off personally.


Be sure that the note written by your parent or guardian has the date of your illness. It should also address the teacher and have a brief explanation of why you are absent.
For example, ""Dear Mr. Smith, Please excuse Martha Cohen's absence from school for the past three days. My daughter had strep throat and needed to rest at home. Thank you. Mr. Nathan Cohen.”
Your parent or guardian should then sign the letter and seal it in an envelope addressed to the teacher.
Your parent may also be able to call the school’s office or attendance hotline. Some schools give a window of several days to do so.Be aware that certain places do not accept parents’ notes for sick days.Be sure that your school district recognizes them.</ref>;
, In some school districts, or for extended absences, you will need to get more formal proof of your illness or medical treatment. Ask a doctor or other medical professional for a certified letter to present to the school.


The letter should detail your illness and the duration of time you’ll be absent while you recover.
Your doctor can also provide you with records of your surgery or any medications you took for the illness. These documents are then stamped with an official seal at the doctor's office and given to you.
Don’t expect to get the medical certificate for free. US doctors are starting to bill for them and a range of other, formerly free services., Your school might want to follow up with your parents or doctor to verify your absence. This just means that they wish to check that your absence is legitimate.


Ensure that your parents include leave a telephone number in the letter or with the attendance office, so that the school can call for verification.
If you use a note, your guardians may have to give the doctor written permission to verify your condition. In the US, HIPAA laws prohibit doctors from sharing most medical info, even with schools., If you’re in college, getting a sick note is a bit different. You’re probably a legal adult by now and don’t need a guardian’s permission to be absent from class. Professors and universities also have different policies on how to excuse absences.


Start with your professors. Many professors do not mind one or two missed classes and will want to accommodate you if possible. They will also let you know how you can make up missed assignments or if they will excuse you with proper documentation.
Professors do not have to excuse absences, even if you have medical documentation and work through the college dean or registrar’s office. Make sure you know what each professor’s policies are., You’ll next want to talk to the college administration. At some schools you’ll need to go to the registrar, at others the Dean of Students.


Follow the instructions that the registrar gives you about how to get a sick note for your absences.
Be prepared to go to the on-campus university health center for an assessment. Some schools only accept medical notes from university doctors., Although your professor does not have to honor a sick note, she does have to give “reasonable accommodation” to students with disabilities and chronic issues. You may be able to register with your college’s disability office to help you cope with a serious medical condition.Disability services will work with you to make it easier for you to perform in courses. This might include later deadlines, more time for tests, or peer note takers.
You’ll need to talk to a medical professional and get supporting documentation – your note does not necessarily have to state a diagnosis. In many places, the school will only ask for verification and what your needs are.Once you are enrolled, you’ll be able to work with an adviser to determine a plan of action.
Some centers provide on-site testing for learning disabilities, as well., How to get excused for sick days depends on where you work and live. In the UK, for example, employers can’t ask for proof of illness unless you’ve missed a week or more of work.In the US, things are more complicated.


US companies can ask for justification before giving you sick leave. Your boss is legally allowed to ask questions about your condition or to demand a doctor’s note, even if the illness is minor.However, companies CAN’T demand to know your diagnosis or other private medical information.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employers from obtaining medical info that is not strictly job-related. A doctor only needs to write that you were examined and need time off.Ask around to see what your workplace requires. Companies may ask for proof in case of “suspicious” absences, like missing too many Mondays or Fridays, or they may simply have a blanket policy.

, Your sick note will have to be signed or stamped by a doctor or medical professional. Most likely, you’ll have to schedule an appointment so that she can assess your condition and then certify your absence.


Certain employers might ask for a doctor’s note for minor illnesses like the flu, food poisoning, or even the common cold. This is legal in some places.For longer absences, the doctor may have to attest that you are not fit to work and specify when or how you can return to work.
Some practices offer telephone consultations. If your doctor is booked up or you have a fairly minor illness, see whether she is willing to assess you over the phone.

, If you are already being treated at a hospital or another medical institution, a doctor there can issue a sick note or a certificate confirming that you were a patient. Submit this to your workplace as proof.


You may be treated by a professional who is not a medical doctor but a nurse, physiotherapist, or a mental health therapist. You might be able to ask them for a letter or a copy of your hospital discharge summary as proof.
Keep in mind that documents like discharge summaries contain private, confidential data. You do not have to give this sort of detail to your employer.

, You might have to give documentation or comply with additional policies, especially if your absence is long. Make sure that you do so.


Fill out a self-certification form, if needed. In the UK, your employer can ask you to fill one out for their records if you have missed less than a week of work.In Canada, your employer can request a formal medical certificate for extended sick leave within 15 days of your return to work.Have a doctor fill out a “reasonable accommodation form” if you need special consideration after sick leave, when returning to work. This will inform your employer of your condition, any limits it places on you, and how you can perform your duties., Get in touch with a doctor as soon as you realize you are too sick to fly. With a note and proper documents, you may be able to get partial or full reimbursement for a missed trip.


Even if you have travel insurance, you can be denied repayment if you don’t see a doctor before cancelling.See your doctor, then cancel.
The doctor's note should briefly explain your condition and state that you are not healthy enough to fly in a certain time period. The note should be on the doctor's official letterhead and signed., If you end up with the flu or a life- threatening condition and cannot make a scheduled flight, reach out to the airline. Ask them about their policy regarding sickness. Some airlines will require you to cancel 24 hours in advance of your flight and to sent them the signed doctor's note or a copy.Some airlines have set cancellation fees. You may be charged this fee when you cancel your flight and then refunded once you provide a doctor's note.
Be ready to file a travel insurance claim. Travel insurance often covers cancellation because of illness. If you have a plan, submit the doctor’s note as well as your unused tickets, receipts, and other proofs of payment., Some people rely on animals like dogs for daily help, to navigate or for other physical and emotional needs. If you use a support animal, you can qualify for special accommodations by getting a doctor’s note.


Landlords and airlines have to accommodate people with disabilities, for instance. By having a demonstrated need, you can bring your support animal with you on flights or into a normally pet-free building.The law interprets disabilities widely. Chronic depression or pain, AIDS, autism, cancer, or heart disease can all qualify as disabilities. Some people keep support dogs for serious depression, for instance.Talk to your doctor about a note. It needs to be on letterhead and signed, and she must verify that you have a medical disability and need a support animal.
Whether you reveal your diagnosis is your choice. Again, this is confidential information."

Exercise on purpose.,
Read how this works as explained by Dr. Tim Church, Pennington Research Center, Baton Rouge, La.,
Realize the regular recommendation is to gradually work up to 150 minutes a week (21+ minutes per day) of exercise — and this did not change, yet recent studies indicate that results are apparent in half that time.,
Avoid perfectionism, ie: all-or-nothing thinking:


like ""I can’t run fast for 4 minutes, or jog for an hour, so why even try?"",
Reshape your thinking and shape-up your health: as Dr. Church suggests that your walking a few minutes a day: “... will reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, anxiety, depression, diabetes, and many other conditions.”

",How to Get Better Health in 10 Minutes a Day1," Do at least a little moderate exercise everyday. This study suggests 70 minutes a week (10 minutes a day) of added exercise can lessen your dangers of blood, heart and arterial diseases and improve your quality of life.

,; he said


“Our bodies respond very positively to even small amounts of physical activity,”
“For sedentary individuals, the immediate health benefits are huge. In fact, those who have been doing nothing stand to benefit the most from increasing physical activity in terms of dying prematurely.”
Sedentary individuals (who seldom get exercise) may benefit by increasing daily exercise by several minutes.

,


Dr. Church also says of the study: “We saw a change in waist size, which is associated with the most dangerous form of abdominal fat, in just 70 minutes of moderate exercise, such as walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike.”

, and
like you may underestimate the positive effects of less-intense exercise.
like equating weight loss with fitness and despair if the scale doesn’t change much.

Narrow down your problems.,
Eliminate foods on a trial basis.,
Take small meals, at least six meals a day.,
Examine stress and coping mechanisms.,
Analyze your results.,
Don't get overwhelmed.",How to Fix Your Digestion1," The best place to start is by analyzing your diet, what foods are you eating that could contribute to this discomfort? There are many different foods that can contribute to these feelings of unease in the gut. First, do some quick research on how the gut works; learn the process that your gut goes through whenever you put something into your body. This will give you an understanding on what exactly you are trying to fix.;
, Remove difficult to digest foods from your diet. This doesn't necessarily have to last forever but it is a good idea to do it for at least 3-5 days to give your digestion an opportunity to relax a little bit.


These foods can vary from person to person so it's not a simple process to figure this out, but there are some surefire foods that need to go and these include: dairy, gluten and wheat, all processed foods, coffee, smoking (anything), and refined sugar. After the elimination of these from your diet you should feel immediate results.

, Break your total calorie intake into six (or more) equal portions. Do not drink water right after the meal and take a walk. Try to stay active and avoid lying down right after a meal.

, Stress levels play a direct role in your digestion. Are you stressed out all the time? This can cause an issue. As much as you might not believe what it, you must consider doing activities that reduce your stress in a healthy way: yoga, meditation, walking the dog, biking, being outside, and so on.


Lots of people smoke cigarettes or pot to relieve stress, which is highly unhealthy unfortunately causing more harm then good.
The most popular unhealthy stress-reducer is eating, especially bad food and junk food. No diet will ever work for you if your body is in a constant state of stress. Stress attacks your digestive system through a complex breakdown of various hormones.

, Now that you have determined what you are going to do as a healthy stress-reliever and have eliminated all ""volatile"" foods from your diet you should start to see improvements. This reduced diet can't last forever though, it's time to try to reintroduce things quite slowly. Every two days, reintroduce a new food.


Very important: During the reintroduction stage make sure you are reintroducing things one at a time, no mixed ingredients, one new food item every 2 days. For example, try to eat a little bit of cheese (a little bit), if this upsets your stomach then remove cheese again. Two days later try to introduce some gluten or wheat (FYI scientific research indicates that gluten and wheat are unhealthy for everyone, even those who can digest it.) And so on, until you have an idea of the foods that were causing you issues in the first place.

, The steps laid out above are very general; consider them ""general guidelines to repairing your digestion."" They will only get you on the right track, but everyone is different. This being said there is copious amounts of information on the Internet and lots of it is good. Lots of it is scary and there sheer volume of it is very intimidating. Take it one step at a time, keep on truckin' along until you find something that works for you.

Lose weight possible much more quickly (if you are healthy enough) and get athletic stamina by interval training (this is not for building massive muscles)


Check with your doctor, and do this strenuous effort only, if you have gotten into pretty good shape and have a healthy enough heart by simple, moderate exercise such as by following a fast walking program, etc..,
Always, warm up first: for 5-10 minutes with a very fast walk or slow jog and a pre-stretch routine -- Enjoy Yourself While Stretching.

,
This exercise is sprinting: all-out from 10 to 60 seconds to reach around 90% (85-95%) of your maximum safe heart rate, weight and overall conditioning.,
Rest to lower your heart's pulse rate to nearly normal.,
Rest by walking slowly, some stretching and other low impact movements to stay warm.

,
Rest for 1 to 2 minutes to recover to a moderate heart rate.,
Exertion is to stay at that 90% level for only 10 to 20 seconds.

,
Calculate Your Target Heart Rate for your fitness level.,
Push only hard enough -- but only for your 90% heart rate for that 10 to 20 seconds.,
Repeat these intervals for 10 to 20 minutes at first (and increase it to only 20 minutes when you can do without fatigue): so that is 10 to 20 minutes depending on your heart rate and body fitness level.

,
Build six pack abs: by changing to abdominal training when you have slimmed down and are in good cardiovascular shape by doing your intervals.",How to Get Better Health in 10 Minutes a Day3," The interval technique is used by swimmers, track and cross country to get in greatest shape possible.
If you qualify, you will get into much better shape by doing interval training.

Later on after getting into shape with this interval program you can do 6 pack (abdominal muscle) training, too.



,,


Exercise for a very short time intervals of high speed effort and then an equally short rest interval: ""on"" and ""off"".

, Repeat the effort and rest.

,, Then go again.

,, If your fitness is not good keep the highest effort down to just 10 seconds until you get a better tone, including better breath and lower your high blood by this cardiovascular conditioning.

, Do not maintain your high-intensity interval longer (even for the most highly trained athletes, only slightly longer for the desired result).

,, Now it will be ""abdominal intervals"".


The interval training is high impact on feet and legs (muscles, bones and joints) and stress the blood vessels, heart and lungs, etc. -- so only do them, if it works for your condition and health.

Discuss your future plans with your doctor.",How to Recover from a Miscarriage," You should seek medical help during the first signs of a miscarriage. Recovery depends on your personal health and stage of pregnancy.


An ultrasound can be used to detect a miscarriage. You have several choices about how you wish to proceed medically. The right choice depends heavily on your own personal preference and your stage of pregnancy.You can let the miscarriage happen naturally if there are no signs of infection. It takes anywhere between one and four weeks for the process to complete. This process can be emotionally difficult. Many women opt to speed a miscarriage medically. Medication can cause your body to expel the pregnancy and might minimize side effects like nausea and diarrhea. This treatment works within 24 hours in 70 to 90 percent of women.A surgical procedure may be necessary if there is heavy bleeding or infection. Your health care provider will dilate your cervix and remove the tissues from inside your uterus. This procedure could potentially damage your uterine wall, but such complications are very rare.;
, Physically, miscarriages may come with certain side effects. Be prepared to experience the following during a miscarriage:


Mild to severe back pain
Weight loss
White-pink mucus
Brown or bright red dischargeAlways see a doctor if side effects get worse. You want to make sure any infections or complications are dealt with quickly.

, After a miscarriage, your doctor may prescribe you certain medications. These can prevent infections and help manage the pain. Take any medications the doctor prescribes as directed.


Most medications will be prescribed to prevent hemorrhaging. The farther along you are in your pregnancy, the more likely hemorrhaging will be. Your doctor will prescribe medication designed to help your blood clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Take all the meds as directed. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.Antibiotics will likely be prescribed if your doctor worries you're at risk for an infection. Take all antibiotics as directed and make sure you do not engage in any activities, such as consuming alcohol, that will make the drugs less effective., Once you've dealt with the miscarriage medically, you need to recover at home. Talk to your doctor about how to give yourself time to heal.


For the first two weeks after your miscarriage, refrain from sex and do not put anything, such as a tampon, in your vagina.When you can return to normal activity depends on your personal health and how far along the pregnancy was at the time of the miscarriage. Talk to your doctor about when to return to normal activity and any precautions you should take.Recovery generally takes from a few hours to a few days. Your period should return within 4 to 6 weeks., Miscarrying is an incredibly emotional experience. It's normal to feel a sense of loss and you need to allow yourself time to grieve the baby.


The emotions you experienced after a miscarriage are normal and may be quite intense. Many women feel sadness or anger. Some unfairly blame themselves or those around them. Allow yourself to experience emotions, even negative ones. Journaling your thoughts during the weeks following your miscarriage can be a healthy way to process your feelings.Remember, hormones play a roll as well. The hormonal response you have to pregnancy and miscarriage increase the intensity of your emotions. It's not uncommon to cry for prolonged periods in the wake of a miscarriage. Trouble eating and sleeping are also common after losing a baby.While the emotions may be difficult to deal with, you need to allow yourself to experience them fully. Try to remind yourself these feelings are temporary and, with time, you'll feel closer to normal., Having a strong support network is very important after a miscarriage. Seek out guidance, comfort, and advice from those around you, especially people who've undergone a similar ordeal.


Nurses at hospitals see a lot of miscarriages. Talk to the nurse who worked with you and see if she knows any support groups in the area. It can be hard to make others understand a miscarriage. Many women find it helpful to talk to people who've undergone the same experience.Try to explain to your loved ones how you are feeling and what you need from them. Some people need a lot of extra support after a miscarriage while others might crave space. There is no wrong way to feel after suffering pregnancy loss.There are many resources online that address pregnancy loss and some include forums where you can share your thoughts with others. Sites like angelfire.com, mend.org, and aplacetoremember.com are good sites to go to in the weeks after your miscarriage., Many people will say the wrong thing to you after a miscarriage. For the most part, people are not trying to be hurtful but they may be at a loss as to what to say. When trying to help, your loved ones may end up saying the wrong thing.


Many people will make comments trying to help you feel better. They may say something like, ""At least you weren't very far along"" or ""You can try again."" If you have other children, they might advise you to take comfort in them. They fail to realize such comments negate the loss you're suffering.Try to cope with these comments without getting angry. Simply say something like, ""I know you are trying to help, and I appreciate that, but those kinds of comments aren't helpful right now."" The vast majority of people do not mean to offend and will genuinely want to know if they're saying anything upsetting to you., It takes time to recover from a miscarriage. However, if it's been more than a few months and you're still feeling off you may need psychiatric help. A miscarriage can be traumatic. The assistance of a professional therapist or counselor can help you manage your grief.


You can find a therapist by calling your insurance provider and asking what doctors in your area are covered by your program. You can also ask for a referral from your general practitioner of OB/GYN.
If cost is an issue, many therapist and psychiatrist offer sliding scales. There are also low cost clinics in most big cities that offer free or discounted counseling.

, Unless your miscarriage is a result of a specific reproductive problem, most women can conceive again after miscarrying. When and if you make this decision is personal and depends on a number of factors.


The World Health Organization recommends waiting at least six months to try conceive again. However, medically delaying conception has little benefits. If you are otherwise healthy and feel emotionally ready, you should be able to conceive as soon as your menstrual cycle resumes.Be aware that pregnancy after a miscarriage can be an anxious experience. Many women worry about a miscarriage happening again. Make sure you're ready for the emotional toll of undergoing another pregnancy before trying to conceive again. Less than 5% of women have two consecutive miscarriages. The odds are in your favor. Knowing this can help some women manage the anxiety.If you've had more than two miscarriages, you should talk to a doctor and get tested for a variety of medical problems that can cause miscarriage. If problems can be diagnosed and treated, you'll increase the likelihood of carrying a baby to term., The vast majority of miscarriages are unpreventable. However, there are some things you can do to minimize your risk of miscarrying.


Maintain a healthy lifestyle throughout pregnancy. Exercise regularly and keep your weight gain consistent with medical guidelines. Eat a healthy diet and avoid anything, like soft cheeses or raw meats, that could be damaging to the fetus.Do not smoke or drink alcohol when pregnant. Limit caffeine consumption to one 12 ounce cup of coffee each day.Take prenatal vitamins and folic acid supplements daily., Any plans you make regarding another pregnancy after a miscarriage should be discussed with your doctor. When it comes to pregnancy, there are no hard and fast rules applicable to every woman. Only a medical professional familiar with your health records and medical history can advise you on any extra steps you should take moving forward after a miscarriage."

Avoid dairy.,
Avoid fried or fatty foods.,
Avoid excessive alcohol consumption.,
Avoid spicy foods.,
Eat lean meats and fish.,
Eat healthy, low-carb grains.,
Eat cooked green vegetables.,
Eat yogurt.",How to Fix Your Digestion2," It is definitely worth mentioning that, for many, milk and dairy products are recipe for digestive disaster. It is thought that humans did not evolve to maintain the digestive mechanisms that break down dairy into adulthood - in fact, some studies have shown that the majority of adults can't properly digest milk.Generally speaking, dairy intolerance is so common that, if you're experiencing digestive troubles, you may want to try eliminating dairy as your first move.


The exception to this rule is yogurt, which, in many circumstances, can actually improve digestive functioning. See below for more information.

, We all know the telltale ""about to burst"" feeling that can result from eating an enormous, high-fat meal. In addition to causing uncomfortable bloating, excessively rich, high-fat foods like red meats and fried dishes can lead to painful conditions like heartburn and acid reflux in some individuals.Though a certain level of fat intake is desirable to ensure proper functioning of several important body processes, try to minimize the amount of fatty food you eat to improve your digestive health.

, Alcohol's nausea-causing effects are well-documented. While it's common knowledge that alcohol can disturb a drinker's stomach in the short-term, what's less well-known is that alcohol can cause lingering digestive issues that persist even after a drinker has sobered up. In fact, intestinal distress and an uneasy stomach for a day or more after a particularly prolific binge drinking session. As with all food and drink, use moderation with alcohol to maintain proper digestive health.

, Hot, spicy foods can cause lasting discomfort, especially to people who aren't accustomed to a high-spice cuisine. This discomfort can be accompanied by stomach pain, diarrhea, and/or painful bowel movements. If you have a history of digestive issues, you may want to shy away from spicy, stomach-irritating foods.


If you're trapped at an Indian, Mexican, or Thai restaurant and can't seem to find anything on the menu that's not spicy, ask your server for a mild alternative or try ordering a side dish a la carte.

, It's important to eat protein throughout your life. To keep your digestive system healthy and comfortable, try to get your protein from lean sources like chicken and fish, rather than from red meats. These sources of protein contain less fat than red meat, which means that, for some, they will be easier to digest. They also have not been linked to colon cancer, a deadly digestive disease, while high-fat red meats have., The health benefits of a diet rich in nutritious grains are well-publicized. In addition to providing a variety of crucial nutrients, healthy, neutral carbohydrates can be a great way to soothe an upset stomach. Try mild dishes like rice, quinoa, or whole grain toast to get a healthy amount of carbohydrates without provoking an uncomfortable reaction from your stomach.

, Vegetables, in general, are healthy, nutrient-rich foods. However, many leafy green vegetables can be tough and fibrous when eaten raw, leading to digestive difficulties. To soften the vegetables and break down the nutrients they contain for easy digestion, try cooking them. You can get tasty results by preparing most vegetables alone, with a mild seasoning, or as part of a larger dish.


A variety of methods exist for cooking vegetables - boiling, baking, sauteing, and stir-frying in a low-fat oil are all valid choices.

, Yogurt is smooth, mild, and easy on the digestive system. It's delicious on its own or in dishes with other ingredients (as in, for example, a parfait). In addition, most varieties of yogurt also contain healthy strains of bacteria that supplement the digestive tract's own bacterial flora. Look for a ""live and active cultures"" label on the yogurt's packaging to determine whether it contains these beneficial bacteria.


Yogurt's digestion-boosting benefits come in spite of the fact that it's a dairy product, which would normally make it difficult for most people to digest. This is because traditionally-produced yogurt contains lactose, an enzyme that helps the body digest the lactose molecule which normally causes digestive problems in people who can't tolerate dairy.

Understand that you can’t know how she feels.",How to Support Your Wife After a Miscarriage," Talking may allow her to express emotions she might otherwise not. Afterward, you’ll be better equipped to support her. Remember to use suggestive language versus telling her what to do.


Ask her if she wants to share how she feels. For instance, say “I know you are really hurt, I want you to know that I’m here to talk when you are ready.”
Do not force her to talk. Let her talk to you when she is ready.
If appropriate, share how you feel. Say something positive, like “Although I feel really sad, we’re here for each other.”;
, Ultimately, you and your wife may need more help than you can provide alone. Fortunately, there are a lot of resources available to help women who have gone through a miscarriage. Spend a little time locating these resources.


Locate a mental health professional. See if your wife wants to talk to someone alone or with you.
Use the internet or ask friends to find support groups for women who have suffered miscarriages.
Find online resources to help your wife. You or your wife may be able to find great information on websites, blogs, or discussion forums about similar experiences others have gone through.
Your OBGYN may be able to refer you to support services geared toward women who have suffered miscarriages., Many women who experience a miscarriage continue to suffer serious emotional problems for an extended amount of time. Ultimately, the emotional trauma of a miscarriage may persist throughout your wife's life.


Make sure you continue to offer support and a shoulder to lean or cry on indefinitely.
Just because your wife does not articulate that the miscarriage still bothers her, this does not mean it doesn't.
Realize that the emotional trauma of a miscarriage may persist for months or even years.
Offer to run any errands she may have to do, unless she expresses that she wants to get out of the house., Women who have suffered miscarriages may ignore their own health and well-being in the short-term. As a result, you need to provide extra support to make sure her grief does not overshadow her own immediate physical needs.


Suggest that she takes some of her stress out by running, walking or doing light weight training. Make sure she has doctor approval first.
See that she is eating complete and well-balanced meals with protein, carbohydrates, and fruits and vegetables.
Talk to her to make sure she has communicated with her doctor about her own physical condition. For instance, her doctor may counsel her about ways to avoid infection and what to expect in the days or weeks after the miscarriage.
Remind her that most complications, like vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and breast discomfort should go away within a week., You and other loved ones may often be at a loss of what to say. There are common misconceptions about what is helpful to say. Steering clear of these may make it easier to find your own supportive words.

Don’t sidestep her grief by saying things like, ""It's a good thing it happened early in the pregnancy.""
Don’t reinforce any blame she places on herself. Remind her it wasn’t her fault.
Don’t make any false promises. Instead, role model hope and looking to the future with your own behavior.

, Going out may cheer her up and can be an important part of the grieving process. In addition, going out may provide her with new and enjoyable experiences.


Invite your wife on a date night. See if she wants to get dressed up and go to one of your favorite fancy places to eat.
Invite her to lunch at her favorite outdoor bistro or café. Getting some sunlight and fresh air may help her move beyond her sadness.
Make sure she’s ready emotionally to go into the world. Don’t force her unless she’s ready.If she's not up for going out, consider planning a date night at home. Prepare dinner and watch a movie, do a puzzle, or something else you can enjoy at home together.

, Social activities can be a good idea to relieve some of the melancholy feeling and to distract you and your wife from your loss. Remember that this may not be helpful for everyone. If your wife is more introverted and tends to find socializing taxing or draining, then going out with people may not make her feel better.


Avoid activities where there might be young children, especially if you don’t have any children.
Go to the movies with friends.
Attend a festival, music event, or an art show., By surrounding your wife with loved ones, she’ll feel cared for in this time of emotional turmoil. This might just be the support she needs to work through the grieving process.


If you are a man, don't be surprised if she wants to spend time with a girlfriend or her mother or sister instead. She may want support from other women right now.
With your wife’s consent, invite people over to your home for coffee, wine, or conversation.
See if your wife wants to invite her or your parents.
Don’t invite friends or family over as a surprise – your wife may need alone time at first.Again, remember that this may not be healing or appropriate for everyone. Think about who your wife is an individual and whether she seems to be invigorated by spending time with others or if she finds this draining.

, There are a variety of activities your wife may want to do in order to help her relax and move through the grieving process. Suggest:Meditation
Yoga
Martial arts
Breathing exercises

, Writing in a journal may provide a great way for your wife to express her feelings in a private and controlled way. This is important, as she'll need to express her feelings before she can move through the grieving process.


See if she can spend a few minutes each day writing her feelings.
Encourage her to express her deepest emotions and true feelings in the journal.
Let her know that you'll never want to see her journal — you simply want her to use it for her own good., In addition to journaling, expose her to other creative activities as well,like coloring, crafts, and music. Being creative is a way to work through feelings without words. Great strides in grief work are made through these additional approaches. The creative process heals!

Try coloring or online coloring apps. There are a lot of adult coloring apps available to download and use on a tablet.

, Sometimes you might think that you can fix all the problems of the world. A miscarriage is a problem you can’t fix — all you can do is wait for you and your wife to deal with your loss.


Realize that you may not be able to cheer your wife up.
Understand that grieving after a miscarriage takes time. Your wife may take days, weeks, or even months before she seems “normal.”
Your relationship might suffer, and it may not be your fault., To properly support your wife, you’ll need to move through the grieving process, too. Thus, you need to make time for yourself to come to terms with this important loss.


Find some time to quietly think about your loss.
Talk to someone about it. While you wife may be able to support you, depending on the circumstance you may need to contact someone else so you can appear strong for your wife.
Talk to your parents, sibling, or best friend about your loss.
Contact a psychologist or counselor. They may have insight for you, and they may have insight or tactics you can use to better support your wife.
Crying is okay. This is an event that has hurt you, too., Even though you are suffering a loss, too, there is no way for you to know exactly how your wife feels. This is because you’re both unique individuals who are experiencing the loss differently.


Embrace the reality that you were not pregnant and did not carry the embryo, fetus, or baby with you. While your loss is true and deep, you are only experiencing a part of it.
Avoid comments like “I know how you feel.” While this may seem like a natural thing to say, she may see this as insensitive. After all, you’re different people with different roles in the pregnancy.
Let her know that you may not understand how she feels. It may be helpful to articulate that you don’t know exactly how she feels. Say something like, “I feel this incredible loss, but I can’t even imagine how you feel right now."""

Use an at-home ovulation monitoring kit.,
Consider letting your doctor monitor you, as well.,
Schedule your appointment.,
Don't forget the sperm.,
Expect some cramping and spotting.,
Try to de-stress.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Consider trying visualization.,
Stop smoking.",How to Prepare for Intrauterine Insemination," This type of x-ray is called a hysterosalpingography, and most doctors recommend you have one before you are artificially inseminated. The purpose of the test is to make sure you have at least one functioning fallopian tube.Before the test, a technician will use a speculum in your vagina and then will clean out your cervix. He or she will next inject a dye into your cervix with a catheter.
An x-ray is then taken with the dye in your uterus and fallopian tubes. If your tubes are open, then dye can be seen spilling out of them on the x-ray.
Basically, the procedure will feel much like a pap smear.;
, If you have abnormal results, you may need to get treatment before proceeding with insemination. It's possible you may not be able to go through with insemination at all, but your doctor will discuss your options with you.Some possible complications this test might show include obstructed fallopian tubes, scarring, polyps or tumors, intrauterine adhesion, or a development disorder in your uterus or fallopian tubes.
However, the results might be normal, as well.

, While not all states require this step, you may need to have tests done for sexually transmitted diseases before being inseminated. In addition, if your partner is providing sperm, he will need to be tested, as well.Tests can take up to a week to come back, so you'll need to do this well in advance of your insemination appointment.
As you will need to be tested for a wide range of diseases, you will likely need to provide urine, as well as have a swab test done of your genital area. In addition, you'll likely need a blood test., Some people choose to try insemination the first time without the addition of fertility drugs, especially if they're having normal periods. Others choose to go ahead and try fertility drugs. One of the main fertility drugs, clomiphene citrate (Clomid), works to help you release eggs when you ovulate.This drug is mainly for women who are having trouble releasing eggs at all. For example, women with PCOS often have this problem. This drug is usually taken starting at day 3 or 5 of your period, for 5 days in a row. Day 1 of your period is when first bleed. If you don't have regular periods, you may be given a drug to start your period.
One consideration is that fertility drugs increase your chances of having more than one baby at once, which makes your pregnancy more dangerous.The risk of multiples with Clomid is 7%, while it is only 1% when trying to conceive without medication.
Talk to your doctor about whether this drug is an appropriate choice for you.

, With these tests, you check your own urine for an increase in the luteinizing hormone (LH). Because this is the hormone that tells your ovary to drop the egg, checking for a rise tells you when you're ovulating.You can find these tests at drug stores, though your doctor might provide you with one, as well.
Start testing 11 days after you started your last period.
The kit comes with about a week's worth of sticks that you must use to test your urine once a day. You can either hold the stick will you pee on it or pee into a sterile container, then dip the stick in. The test will tell you what color the stick should turn to indicate an increase in the hormone.

, Another option is having your doctor monitor your ovulation through regularly scheduled appointments. Your doctor will do a transvaginal ultrasound, which lets the doctor see when you are ovulating.Your doctor will be looking for what is called a dominant follicle. This is a cyst on the ovary that is large enough for an egg to develop inside of.


For this test, you may need an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). This drug can help you ovulate, so that you can be inseminated at the correct time.

, Once you show you are ovulating or about to ovulate, it's time to schedule your appointment. Your doctor should have already let you know how and when to schedule your appointment following ovulation., If you're being impregnated with your partner's sperm, he's going to need to come into the clinic and be able to produce on command. If you're not using your partner's sperm, the clinic should have the sperm you've chosen ready when you're ready.Sperm is usually chosen from a sperm bank and they will send the sperm directly to the clinic.


After your partner produces sperm, it will need to be ""washed."" Basically, they are separating the best sperm from the dead sperm, as well as washing off the seminal fluid, which shouldn't go directly into the uterus., Some women experience cramping and/or spotting after the procedure is over, which quickly lessens or goes away completely. Some women may continue to experience mild cramping for a day or two after the procedure along with some light vaginal spotting.Try to relax and take it easy the day of the IUI. You can go about your usual activities the day after the IUI.

, While studies disagree about whether stress can cause infertility, de-stressing may improve your chances of getting pregnant. One study showed that women who were more stressed during their conception window were less likely to get pregnant than women who were less stressed. Therefore, it can't hurt to try to calm down before your insemination.Try taking a meditation class, which has helped many people de-stress. If you don't have time, try taking a few moments several times a day to practice deep breathing. Simply find a quiet place, and close your eyes. Breathe in deeply through your nose while counting to 4 in your head. Breathe out slowly through your mouth, counting to 4 again in your head. Yoga may have similar benefits.
You could also try journaling about what's bothered you throughout the day before you sleep. That way, you get it out on paper and can have a restful night.
Listening to calming music can also help you de-stress or just doing things you enjoy.Exercising regularly can also cut down on stress.

, While it may not magically make you fertile, eating a healthy ""fertility"" diet may help increase your chances of becoming pregnant. In addition, getting the right nutrients and vitamins will help your body be ready for a baby if you do get pregnant.Focus on lean proteins, such as chicken, fish, beans, and nuts, and get plenty of fruits and vegetables every day. Also, make sure your carbohydrates are mostly whole grains.
In addition, try to eat full-fat dairy at least twice a day. You can eat yogurt, cheese, or milk.
Include a folic acid supplement of at least 400 micrograms per day before you undergo IUI and after the procedure as well. This will help to reduce your baby’s risk of anencephaly and spina bifida, which are birth defects that can happen in the first few weeks of pregnancy.Decrease your caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day to decrease the chances of miscarring after you are pregnant.
Cut out alcohol altogether as well. Drink lots of water instead., While this step may seem silly, visualizing yourself as pregnant can make you happier and less stressed overall. In turn, that can increase your chances of getting pregnant. Therefore, as you are waiting for the go ahead from your ovulation kit, try visualization techniques a couple of times a day.One way to use this process is to simply envision yourself pregnant. Imagine your belly expanding and what it will feel like to have a baby kicking inside you, for instance.
Another way is to use another image. For instance, you could imagine your uterus as a lotus, slowly blooming into a flower., If you haven't already, you should stop smoking. Smoking can adversely affect your chances of getting pregnant, so if you want to up your chances, try to cut out the cigarettes.You should also consider asking your partner to stop, as secondhand smoke can be just as bad.

While remaining abstinent is the only way to significantly reduce your risk of getting bacterial vaginosis, it’s not the most practical solution. Always use condoms during sexual contact to reduce your risk of getting BV.If you are in a monogamous relationship and don’t normally use condoms, use them if you are being treated for BV to avoid causing further problems for yourself or your partner.;
, Doctors do not understand why, but the more sexual partners a person has, the higher the risk of getting bacterial vaginosis is.Try to limit the number of partners you have to minimize your risk of getting BV.


If either you or your partner isn’t faithful, this will also increase your risk of BV, especially if you are not using protection.Communicating openly with your partner may help both of you avoid getting or transmitting BV.Having BV and multiple partners can significantly increase your risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases., There are some studies that suggest using an intrauterine device, or IUD, for birth control can increase your risk of getting BV. If you have a history of bacterial vaginosis, speak to your doctor about using other forms of birth control.Condoms are an excellent way to decrease your risk of pregnancy and contracting BV.
Other forms of birth control you could use are the birth control pill, patch, or vaginal ring; a diaphragm; hormone shots, or a cervical cap., Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance in the good bacteria in your vagina. Helping your vaginal bacteria stay in balance can keep you from getting BV. Daily cleansing and wearing appropriate clothing in warm weather may help keep your vaginal bacteria from potential imbalances.Wash your external genitals and anus every day with mild soap, such as Dove or Cetaphil.After you go to the bathroom, always wipe from your vagina to your anus.Keep your genital area cool by wearing cotton undergarments and avoiding tight pants. During summer months, it’s a good idea to avoid wearing pantyhose., Avoid using douching products to clean out the inside of your vagina. Don’t using vaginal douches if you have or have had bacterial vaginosis. Douches kill good bacteria in your vagina and increase your risk for infection or recurrence.Your vagina cleans itself naturally, but if you feel like you need to clean it, wash it with warm water only in a bathtub.

, Seeing your gynecologist regularly for pelvic exams is important to maintaining not only your overall well-being, but specifically the health of your genitalia.Your doctor may discover BV during a regular exam and prescribe you a course of treatment.


If you don’t have a gynecologist, most general practitioners can perform annual pelvic exams.

Discontinuing treatment can increase your risk of a recurrence of BV., Some theories hold that eating probiotics or using lactobacillus colonization therapy, which tries to increase good bacteria in your vagina, can help you prevent BV. Consider eating foods such as fermented cheese for probiotics or yogurt as a form of lactobacillus colonization therapy. These foods may help keep your vaginal bacteria healthy.The number of lactobacilli is lower in women with BV, hence the theory to use lactobacillus colonization therapy as a form of treatment.There is little research to determine if consuming foods high in lactobacilli such as yogurt or bananas will prevent BV.Consider taking an over the counter probiotic. Some studies suggest that using probiotics helps to prevent BV.You can get probiotics in foods such as kombucha, miso, and kefir. Fermented vegetables and cheeses including sauerkraut, kimchi, Gouda, cheddar, and Swiss are high in probiotics., There are many different symptoms of BV that you may have. Learning the symptoms of BV can help you identify them and know when you need to schedule an appointment with your doctor for potential treatment.


Some women don’t show any symptoms of BV.The most common symptoms of BV are a thin vaginal discharge, a “fishy” odor, and pain, itching, or burning in the vagina.You may also experience pain when urinating., If you have any symptoms of BV, see your doctor. She will confirm a diagnosis and prescribe medication, which is the only way to treat BV.Your doctor will examine your genitals for signs of BV. She may also perform lab tests on your vaginal fluid to confirm a diagnosis.The most common medications used to treat BV are oral or topical metronidazole, the cream clindamycin, or the oral pill tinidazole.It’s generally not necessary to treat male partners of women who have BV.In some cases, BV will go away on its own, though it’s always advisable to have a doctor diagnose and treat you., If you suspect or know that you have BV and don’t get treatment by your doctor, you may put yourself at increased risk for serious health conditions. Knowing the risks of not getting treatment may sway your decision on seeing your doctor.


BV can increase your risk for other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.BV can increase your risk of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, to your partner(s).If you are pregnant and have BV, not getting treatment can increase the risk of premature delivery or low birth weight., Just as you should know how to prevent BV, you should also know what does not cause the disease. You cannot contract bacterial vaginosis from toilet seats, bedding, swimming pools, or touching objects in your vicinity."

Understand what a vaginoplasty involves.,
Expect some pain and discomfort at the incision site.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Take antibiotics to prevent infection.,
Abstain from sexual intercourse for approximately two weeks after surgery.,
Do exercises that help to tighten and strengthen the pelvic muscles.,
Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water daily.,
Avoid doing heavy work or lifting any heavy objects.,
Follow a balanced diet.,
Maintain close contact with your surgeon.",How to Recover from a Vaginoplasty," A vaginoplasty is done under general anesthesia or sedation. The procedure involves joining the muscles that are stretched at the back of the vagina and shortening them with dissolvable stitches. The unwanted tissue is removed and this helps to tighten the tissues and muscles of the vagina, as the excess lining is reduced.


The operation may take up to an hour and the patient can usually be released from the hospital after 24 hours.
During these 24 hours the patient is kept in the hospital for close monitoring to ensure that they are stable before being discharged.;
, The doctor will prescribe painkillers for pain management. While in the hospital, the patient can be given strong, intravenous painkillers. Once they are discharged they will be prescribed oral painkillers to take until the pain has subsided.


At first, the patient may be given 1 gm of acetaminophen intravenously ,three times daily. Upon discharge, this can be changed to an oral tablet of the same dosage. The patient is advised to take the tablet when in pain but they should not exceed the maximum dosage of 3 gm per day.
This drug works by inhibiting the release of pain receptors (prostaglandins) in the body and this helps to reduce pain.

, The incision site should be kept clean at all times and the patient is encouraged to ensure that they maintain good personal hygiene.


The patient is allowed to take a shower 1 to 2 days after the surgical procedure, but not before. The patient is advised against putting anything into the vagina in order to try to clean it.
When the patient passes stool, they are encouraged to ensure that the incision site is gently and thoroughly cleaned with mild soap and water. They are also encouraged to soak in warm water after passing stool to ensure that the area is clean, which allows it to heal without infection.

, After a vaginoplasty, the patient may need to take an antibiotic such as augmentin. The dosage is usually 1 gm, two times daily for 5 to 7 days depending on the doctor’s prescription. This drug acts by destroying and killing microbes in the body, thus preventing infection.

, This allows the incision site to heal without any complications or infections. It is important that both the woman and her partner are aware of this before the surgery.


Abstaining from sex is also necessary because the contraction and expansion that is experienced during sexual activity can lead to tearing of the vaginal muscles.
This can lead to delayed or incomplete healing of the vagina after the procedure.

, The patient is encouraged to perform kegel exercises to tighten and strengthen the vaginal muscles. Kegel exercises also help to stretch the vaginal muscles, which reduces the amount of scar tissue that is formed. These exercises should be performed very gently at first, to prevent re-injury.


To perform kegel exercises, the patient first needs to locate the right pelvic muscles that are used to stop urination in midstream. Once the right muscles have been identified, the pelvic floor muscles should be contracted and then relaxed for five seconds at a time.
This can then be done 4 to 5 times in a row. The time spent contracting and relaxing the muscles can also be increased with time.

, This helps to flush out toxins that may be present in the body and also helps to soften the stool. It is important for the patient to avoid straining when passing stool because this can cause the sutures at the incision site to rupture.


The patient can also be given stool softeners to help soften the stool and ensure that the patient does not strain. The patient can take 10-20 mls of duphalac three times daily, but should stop immediately if the stool becomes watery.
The patient should observe the stool after taking then medication to ensure that they do not start having diarrhea.

, This reduces the amount of pressure on the incision site and allows the area to heal faster. When there is a lot of pressure, the stitches may come out and this can lead to complications.


During the recovery period the patient is encouraged to take things easy and rest a lot. This allows the body to recover and helps to promote healing.

, The patient is encouraged to follow a balanced diet that contains carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and plenty of vegetables.


They should also eat foods that are rich in iron, includes lean meat, liver and green leafy vegetables. These foods help to produce blood, helping to replace the blood that was lost during the surgical procedure.
Foods that provide the body with carbohydrates include whole grains, brown bread and cereals. The recommended daily amount of carbohydrates is 225 grams .
Foods that provide the body with protein include milk, beans, meat and nuts. The recommended daily amount of protein is approximately 50 grams.

, The patient should be able to contact them in case of any issues. The patient should also ensure that they go for follow up evaluation. This enables the surgeon to check on the incision site to ensure that it is healing well.


It is also important for the patient to report to the doctor in case of increased bleeding, as this indicates that there may be a complication that needs immediate intervention. The patient is also encouraged to monitor the incision site for swelling, bruising and redness.
It is also important for the patient to watch out for signs of infection such as excessive tenderness, redness or unusual discharge from the incision site.

Realize that endometriosis can reappear after surgery.",How to Treat Endometriosis1," Hormonal therapy can help in the treatment of endometriosis because it is these hormones that cause the lesions to undergo changes similar to the menstrual cycle.One of the most common forms of hormonal therapy is oral contraceptives; you take the pills for 21 days and then take sugar pills for 7 days to mimic the natural menstrual cycle. If the sugar pills are not taken, birth control pills stops the menstrual period completely, this helps in decreasing the pain and in some cases causes it to vanish completely.
There are a few type of birth control pills that have only a couple days of sugar pills every 3 months; these also help reduce or eliminate pain.;
, This can be taken in different forms like a pill, via an injection, or through an intrauterine device (IUD). Progestin is similar to the body's hormone progesterone.When progestin is taken, it makes the progesterone levels in the body similar to what they would be if you were pregnant.
Progestin helps in reducing estrogen production, thereby stopping ovulation, along with menstrual cycle in most women.

, Your options include the following:


Pill: When taken as a pill daily, these hormones decrease menstrual flow without causing the uterus lining to grow. Once you stop taking the progestin pill, you are back to square one; the symptoms can return and pregnancy can occur.
IUD. An IUD containing progestin, such as Mirena, helps in reducing endometriosis-related pain. It decreases the size of lesions and menstrual flow.
Injection. As an injection, progestin has to be taken once every 3 months. This treatment generally stops the menstrual flow, but some women do bleed many times during the first year of taking the injection. When this bleeding occurs, pain can recur. After stopping the injections, it can take few months for menses to return. Once the periods are back, the woman can conceive.

, These medications stop the production of certain hormones to prevent ovulation, menstruation, and the growth of endometriosis. This treatment sends the body into a ""menopausal"" state. These medicines are available in different generic names.Their doses are as follows:


Leuprolide is injected into muscle (intramuscularly) once a month. You can also take an injection that lasts for 3 months.
Nafarelin is sprayed into the nose (intranasally) twice a day.
Goserelin 3.6 mg pellet is injected under the skin of the abdomen (subcutaneously) once every 28 days. Slowly the pellet is assimilated by your body.

, Danazol is a suppressive drug with some androgenic activity. The treatment with this drug stops the release of hormones that are involved in the menstrual cycle. Women will have a period only now and then or sometimes not at all when on this medication.The patient is started with the dose of 800 mg, administered in two divided doses depending on the severity of the disease.For mild cases, an initial daily dose of 200 mg to 400 mg given in two divided doses is recommended and may be adjusted depending on patient response.

, Conservative surgical treatment involves removal of the tissues, adhesions and restoring the normal pelvic anatomy as far as possible.


In order to do this the physician can perform a laparoscopy (camera assisted video surgery) so as to remove the lesions or destroy them using intense heat without harming the normal tissues. It is a minimally invasive procedure in which the surgeon makes only 2-3 small incisions on the abdomen.
He or she can also do laparotomy which is a major operation during which the small lesions that are not visible in laparoscopy are removed, and if needed, the surgeon removes the uterus. The physician tries to conserve the ovaries as far as possible but if necessary he can remove them also. This major surgery is the last resort for endometriosis treatment.

, The recurrence rate is estimated to be 10 percent per year. In women who have had a hysterectomy where both ovaries have not been removed, there is 6 times the risk of recurrence as compared to cases in which the ovaries are removed.

Boost your calcium intake.,
Eat more vitamin-C rich foods.,
Increase your vitamin E intake.,
Experiment with an herb called goldenseal.,
Try an herbal remedy made from cramp bark.",How to Treat Endometriosis2," Different studies reveal that chronic exposure to environmental chemicals like dioxins can be a cause of endometriosis. Dioxins along with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with an increased prevalence and severity of endometriosis.


The intake of these chemicals can be reduced by decreasing your consumption of animal fat, mainly high-fat dairy, red meat, and fish. Dioxin and PCBs both get collected in animal fat and it is through them that you ingest it.

, Data supports the fact that flavones, a group of plant chemicals, can inhibit aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens.Celery, parsley and capsicum pepper are good sources of flavones.
Dietary indoles also help in regulating the estrogen metabolism in the body. Vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, and bok choy are good sources of indole.

, Flaxseeds are high in lignans and fiber. Lignans are good in estrogen-related conditions because the bacteria in your gut converts them into metabolites that produce a weak estrogenic effect (meaning they can help to regulate estrogen-related conditions like endometriosis).


You should eat 3 to 4 tablespoons of unrefined flax seed every day to maintain healthy blood levels of enterolactone. Other sources of lignans are whole grains, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, cashews, kale, broccoli and berries.

, Studies have found that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial for people with endometriosis as the fish oil contains two specific compounds, EPA and DHA, that can relieve pain by decreasing levels of an inflammatory chemical called prostaglandin E2.Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and anchovies.

, Magnesium is a mineral that is believed to ease cramping caused by menstruation. It also helps in preserving water levels in the gut and can help combat constipation.


The daily recommended dosage is 600 mg.Foods rich in magnesium are spices, cocoa, nuts, tea, cereals and vegetables like green leafy vegetables.

, Calcium levels in menstruating women decrease 10 to 14 days before the onset of menses. Deficiency can cause muscle cramps, headache or pelvic pain. The recommended daily intake is 1200 mg.Calcium can be found abundantly in milk, curd, cheese, butter, egg, amaranth, and other dairy products.

, Vitamin C is well known for helping to boost the immune system and help provide resistance to disease. It helps in building and maintaining collagen in the body. It is important that your immune system is functioning properly so that your body can combat endometrial patches that form.The recommended dosage of Vitamin C is 1000 to 4000 mgand can be procured by consuming citrus fruits, lemon, papaya etc.

, Vitamin E plays an important role as it strengthens the immune system and reduces inflammation due to its antioxidant nature. It is also thought to be able to relieve menstrual cramps.The recommended dosage is 800 IU. Almonds, avocados, etc are rich in vitamin E.
Selenium when taken along with vitamin E helps in reducing inflammation associated with Endometriosis, and is also an immune system booster. Dosage is 400 mg., It is herb that may have anti-biotic, anti-inflammatory, astringent and immune stimulating properties. Goldenseal contains calcium, iron, manganese, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, B-complex, and other nutrients and minerals.


The astringent quality may help in cases of excessive menses and internal bleeding.
It can be taken as a tincture about 2-4 ml or 0.5-1 gm decoction made by boiling goldenseal., As its name implies, cramp bark may be useful in easing uterine cramps. Being a muscle relaxant, it is effective on other organs, like the intestines and the skeletal muscles.For dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), cramp bark may work most efficiently when taken regularly. Begin with 1/2 dropperfuls every half hour till some effect is seen, then every one to three hours. Decrease the dosage as symptoms wane."

Understand that endometriosis may be caused by hormonal changes.,
Be aware that endometriosis may be caused by an error during surgery.,
Know that a condition called Müllerianosis can cause endometriosis.,
Understand that there are a variety of other possible caused.,
Recognize the possible signs and symptoms of endometriosis.",How to Treat Endometriosis3," During menstruation, sometimes the endometrial lining sheds from the uterus but does not exit the body. It can go into the fallopian tubes (attached to the uterus) and attach itself to pelvic surfaces instead of leaving the body through the vagina.


In general, every woman undergoes some degree of retrograde menstruation but does not develop endometriosis because their bodies clear the residual endometrial tissue before it forms deposits.

, Growth of the faultily implanted endometrial tissue is dependent on the female hormone estrogen as its natural function is to stimulate cell growth. Thus along with the normal menstrual cycle, the displaced tissue also undergoes growth and shedding each month.

, Bits of the endometrium may get dislodged and become embedded in an area outside of the womb during a gynecological operation accidentally.

, This refers to a condition where cells that have similar properties to endometrial cells are deposited in the female reproductive tract during pregnancy when fetal organs are being formed. The primitive endometrial cells later get dislodged from the uterus and act like stem cells. This theory is supported by fetal autopsy., Other factors that can cause endometriosis include immune system disorders, genetic predisposition and environmental toxins., The main symptom is persistent pelvic pain. Patient also complains of painful menses (dysmenorrhea), painful urination (dysuria), painful sex (dyspareunia) and severe pain in the legs.The pain is because of the reaction of endometrial tissues to the hormonal activity. These lesions also bleed during the normal menstrual cycle due to which the blood collects in the surrounding areas leading to swelling and inflammation finally leading to pain.
Pain can also occur due to adhesions that bind the internal organs together, thereby leading to their dislocation. So we see that many a times the fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, bowels and bladder are bounded leading to pain in day to day life too apart from the menstrual cycle.
Patients may also complain of constipation, nausea, vomiting, chronic fatigue, low grade fever, irregular menses. Around 30-50% come with complains of infertility.

That’s okay. But do share the news with your husband and let him know what is going on.


As the conversation progresses, you may choose to share or express more.;
, Men deal with miscarriage differently from women, but they are often deeply affected by it. They may become depressed, but their feelings may be masked by anger.Talk with your husband about the miscarriage and find out more about his thoughts and feelings.


For example, you might ask your husband some questions to find out how he is feeling: How is he coping with the miscarriage? What thoughts and feelings does he experience? How does he need to express himself? Ask him what kind of support he appreciates and what will be most helpful to him in getting through this time., While one partner may express feelings through tears, depressed mood, and sadness, another may take on a “be strong” role and become very action-oriented.Let each other cope and grieve in ways that feel good for each of you, and don’t accuse each other based on how you grieve. Questions like, “Why aren’t you crying or upset?” or, “Why can’t you get over this?” don’t help. Instead, accept the way each other grieves.
Even if you express grief differently, know that you both experience grief in ways that work for you.
Keep in mind that the after-effects of a miscarriage can include depression and anxiety, and these feelings may last for a long time. Seek help from a therapist if you are struggling to cope with these feelings.

Discuss with your husband ways to honor those days and the emotions you feel.You may want to do an activity together or plan a low-key day to allow you to process your emotions.


You may want to take the day off of work, spend time outside, create a memory board, or journal.

, One partner may be ready to return to a sexual relationship while another may not be. Be willing to take things at a pace together.

Be willing to be patient together and enter into sex when you both feel ready.Sex and intimacy are separate. While you may not be ready to return to sexual activity, share physical closeness. Cuddle, hold hands, and hug each other. Be close and share affection.

, Sometimes a spouse isn’t the most supportive person to lean on during a difficult time. Don’t hold this against your husband.

If you’re not ready to talk about the miscarriage, say, “I’m going through a difficult time and could use a hug.”

, Many women find it helpful to join a group of others who have lost a pregnancy.

The object is to full your lungs with each breath while placing your hands to feel the lungs and abdomen rising and falling.Couple focused breathing with progressive muscle relaxation if you have a quiet place to sit or lie down. Close your eyes, and inhale deeply and slowly through the nose while tensing one muscle group at a time. Exhale through the mouth and release all tension in those muscles. Start at your feet and work your way up through the body., Along with other lifestyle changes aiming to reduce stress, adding weekly massages can help calm your mental state and relax your body.

Getting regular massages feels luxurious, and can improve your overall mood by being a way of treating yourself kindly and taking care of your needs first.

, Some women report significant relief from symptoms of menopause with acupuncture, but more large-scale studies may be needed to prove a direct correlation.However, there is little doubt that acupuncture is useful for pain management, including low back pain and menstrual cramps, as well as for sleep problems."

It uses specific finger placement and pressure along pivotal points on the body.Acupressure most commonly uses the fingers, especially the thumbs, to massage, rub, and stimulate the pressure points. However, elbows, knees, legs, and feet can also be used.The points are thought to be arranged along channels, called meridians. According to Asian medical philosophy, stimulating these areas can release tension and increase blood flow.The popular massage technique of Shiatsu massage is a form of Asian Bodywork Therapy from Japan.;
, Like a massage, acupressure is thought to cause deep relaxation and a decrease in muscle tension. The technique is also used to relieve pain. People use acupressure to help with nausea and vomiting, headaches, back and neck pain, fatigue, mental and physical stress, and even addiction.It is believed that acupressure and other Asian body therapies correct imbalances and blockages of the flow of vital energies through our bodies.Many Western spas and massage services have started offering acupressure massage. While many people are skeptical of acupressure's efficacy, many doctors, practitioners, and advocates of holistic health believe in the positive effects of acupressure.For example, researchers at the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine study the scientific basis of acupressure while providing explanations and practical applications of the techniques.Licensed acupressurists attend formal training programs, either at special acupressure and acupuncture schools, or through massage therapy programs. These programs include study of anatomy and physiology, acupressure points and meridians, Chinese medicine theory, technique and protocol, and clinical studies. To become a licensed acupressurist generally requires up to 500 hours of schooling, less if a person already has a massage therapy license., There are hundreds of pressure points through our bodies. Some of the common ones are:


Hoku/Hegu/Large Intestine 4, which is the webbing between your thumb and forefinger.
Liver 3, which is the soft flesh between your big toe and your second toe.
Sanyinjiao/Spleen 6, which is on the lower calf.
Many pressure points are called by multiple names, and sometimes designated by an abbreviation and number, like LI4 or SP6.

, Acupressure has been attributed to helping pregnant women with morning sickness and nausea, with alleviating back pain, with pain management during labor, and with naturally inducing labor.Though acupressure is safe to use during pregnancy, always use caution. You may want to contact your physician, a doula who practices acupressure, or a licensed acupuncturist or acupressurist before trying it on yourself.


All pressure points connected to inducing labor should be avoided on a pregnant woman until after 40 weeks.There is a risk of applying pressure to the points that induce labor too early causing problems.

, This pressure point is considered one of the most popular ones to induce labor. It is located on the hand between the thumb and the index finger.


Pinch the webbing between your index finger and thumb. You will be focusing on the area towards the middle of your hand, between the first and second metacarpal bones. Apply steady, firm pressure to this point. Then, start rubbing a circle with your fingers.When your hand gets tired, just shake it out and start again.
When a contraction starts, stop rubbing the pressure point. Resume when the contraction passes.
This pressure point is believed to aid in helping the uterus contract and the baby descend into the pelvic cavity. You can also use this during labor to help ease the sensation of contractions., Gallbladder 21 is located between the neck and the shoulder. Before locating GB21, drop your head forward. Have someone find the round knob at the top of the spine, and then the ball of your shoulder. GB21 is located midway between these two points.


Using your thumb or index finger, apply steady downward pressure to this point to massage and stimulate the area. You can also pinch the point between the thumb and index finger on your opposite hand, massage in a downward motion with the index finger for 4-5 seconds while releasing the pinch hold.
This pressure point is also used for neck stiffness, headaches, shoulder aches, and pain., This pressure point lies on the lower back, between the back dimples and the lumbar spine. It is used for inducing labor, easing pain during labor, and helping the baby descend.


To locate this point, have the pregnant woman kneel on the floor or a bed. Drag your fingers down alongside the spine until you feel two small bony hollows (one on either side of the spine). These hollows will be between the dimples and spine - but not the dimples themselves.Press your knuckles or thumbs into the BL32 pressure point for constant, steady pressure or rub in a circular motion.
If you cannot find the hollow, measure the length of the pregnant woman's index finger. BL32 lies approximately the length of index finger above the top of the buttock crease, approximately one thumb width to the side of the spine.

, This pressure point is located on the lower leg, just above the ankle bone. SP6 is believed to stretch the cervix and strengthen weak contractions.This point should be used with caution.


Locate the ankle bone. Place three fingers above the shin bone. Slide your fingers just off the shin bone towards the back of the leg. There will be a tender place just behind the shin. This spot is very sensitive in pregnant women.
Rub in circles or apply pressure for 10 minutes, or until you have a contraction. Resume applying pressure after the contraction passes., This pressure point is considered helpful if your baby hasn't dropped yet.It is located on the ankle.


Find the spot between the ankle bone and the Achilles tendon. Press into the skin with your thumb and apply pressure or rub in a circle.This spot is frequently used during the first stage of labor, when the baby hasn't descended yet.
BL60 is thought to increase circulation and relieve pain., This point is located in your pinky toe. It is thought to help induce labor and reposition breech babies.Take the pregnant woman's foot in hand. Use your fingernail to apply pressure to the tip of the pinky toe, right under the toenail.

, If you are worried about the safety of you and your baby, why you have not delivered yet, or just acupressure in general, contact your obstetrician, midwife, or doula. They can answer your questions and address your concerns.


If you want to find out more about acupressure during pregnancy, find a licensed acupressurist. Schedule a visit and find out more to see if it is for you.

Mark down the achievement of short and long term goals.",How to Make a Nursing Care Plan for a Postpartum Hemorrhage1," A Nursing Care Plan arranges a nurse's approach to patients in order to deliver their specific needs. It is composed of Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Intervention, Rationale and Evaluation.Each Assessment can aid in creating the Nursing Diagnosis and Planning which corresponds to a sequence of Interventions that are done according to priority.
Each intervention has its specific Rationale which explains why it is done.
The process of Evaluation gives the nurse insight into whether the Interventions made have been effective or not.;
, This step is referred to as Assessment. You can directly ask the patient about what she feels. Examples are the amount of blood that results from vaginal bleeding, the type of pain, fever, weakness and other symptoms that the patient has experienced.


The data you will get that is verbalized by the patient is called subjective data, while the data that the healthcare provider gets upon assessing the patient is called objective data.
Aside from the patient, you can read the patient’s chart and browse the recent laboratory or diagnostic results. In this way, you will know what significant values affect the condition of the patient.

, This diagnosis must be approved by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) based on the patient’s signs and symptoms. In order to form the Nursing diagnosis, you must prioritize based on the ABC's of life (Airway, Breathing and Circulation).


In postpartum hemorrhage, if the patient does not experience breathing problems, then the priority is the loss of blood because of vaginal bleeding. A suitable NANDA diagnosis is Fluid Volume Deficit that is related to specific problems that cause bleeding.

, In planning, have a short-term goal and a long-term goal. Usually, you will state your plan in a future tense form. You will state what you will expect from the patient after undergoing all of the interventions.

, In postpartum hemorrhage, the short-term goal will be “Client will maintain a functional level of fluid volume as evidenced by normal blood tests after one week”. Keep in mind that in postpartum hemorrhage, the priority is to restore blood loss due to vaginal bleeding.This can be done through blood transfusion per the doctor’s order. The short-term goal will focus on the number one priority: blood loss.

, The long-term goal is “Client will be able to regain her normal activities of daily living before discharge”. This describes a much longer time frame and it is of least priority. This can be achieved when the person no longer has vaginal bleeding and has already fully recovered.


As you can see, there is always a time frame in the nursing plan. Always make sure that your plan is specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bounded.

, The nursing interventions can be dependent or independent. Dependent nursing actions are those that need collaboration with the doctor. Examples are prescription of medicines, ordering laboratory and diagnostic tests and doing medical procedures.


Independent nursing interventions are those that do not require collaboration with the doctor and are part of the scope of the practice of a nurse.

, In the case of a postpartum hemorrhage, nursing interventions will be based on the nursing diagnosis, which, as previous discussed, is Fluid Volume Deficit. The primary nursing intervention here is to replace the lost fluids and blood products through blood transfusion, which requires proper collaboration with the physician.


After each nursing intervention, mention in the Rationale section why each nursing intervention is done. So in the replacement of fluids and blood products, the Rationale is to replace the lost blood in the body that has been lost because of the hemorrhage. The other nursing interventions can be found in the patient’s chart, specifically the section that deals with the doctor’s orders.

, Write down your patient’s observations after the time frame you specify in the Planning section. For example, your short-term goal is “Client will maintain a functional level of fluid volume as evidenced by normal blood tests after one week”. So after the time frame of one week, you can check the patient’s blood tests result, specifically the haemoglobin level (protein in red blood cells that supplies oxygen) to make sure that it is within the normal range. Although the normal range greatly varies in different laboratories, the general rules are:


For female: 12.1 to 15.1 grams per decilitre., After checking if your short-term goal is achieved, check if the long-term goal (which is “Client will be able to regain his normal activities of daily living before discharge”) is also achieved. You can ask the patient if she is able to do normal activities of daily living or you can simply observe them do the activities.

Understand what a postpartum hemorrhage is.,
Familiarize yourself with the causes of PPH.,
Understand that placental abruption can lead to a PPH.,
Look for signs of placenta previa.,
Check for an overdistended uterus.,
Know that multiple pregnancies increase the chances of a PPH.,
Ask about a history of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.,
Note that prolonged labor can lead to PPH.,
Check to see if the mother took any medications to induce labor.,
Find out if the doctor used forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery.",How to Make a Nursing Care Plan for a Postpartum Hemorrhage2," After the baby is delivered, the natural response of the uterus is to contract to tighten the uterine muscles and then expels the placenta. Once the placenta is completely expelled, the uterine contractions work by compressing the bleeding vessels in the area where the placenta was attached.On the occasion the uterus does not contract enough to suppress the bleeding, uterine atony develops. The blood vessels bleed intensively and cause hemorrhage. Bleeding after delivery can also be accounted from placental fragments that are left attached.

, Some women are more vulnerable to postpartum hemorrhage than others. Conditions that might lead to postpartum hemorrhage include the following.

, It is a condition wherein the placenta detaches from the uterus at an early stage. Usually, the placenta which is a structure that nourishes the growing baby is naturally expelled from the woman’s body as soon as the baby is born. If it detaches from the inner wall of the uterus too early, heavy bleeding may occur because damage in the inner structure of the placenta may cause blood to spill out from it and as a result, the blood volume inside the uterus may increase. The body reacts by expelling excess blood through vaginal bleeding in order to begin the healing process (Weiss, R., 2014, August 2).

, A condition wherein the placenta is situated near or covers the entire cervical opening. This can interfere with the normal delivery of the baby because it may block the opening. As the baby nears term, his or her head is slowly being fixated at the cervical opening and the placenta may compress itself against the baby or other structures near it.


Further compression can lead to rupture and blood leakage. The body now reacts by expelling excess blood through vaginal bleeding in order to begin the healing process.

, The uterus becomes excessively enlarge due to increase amount of amniotic fluid or a large baby weighing over 4, 000 grams (8.8 pounds). Because of this enlargement, the pressure builds up inside the uterus and can lead to rupture.As a result, blood leaks out of the ruptured structure and the body reacts by expelling excess blood through vaginal bleeding in order to begin the healing process.

, Carrying more than one baby with more than one placenta in the uterus can overdistend the uterus. If sufficient pressure builds up inside the uterus because of overdistention, rupture may occur.


The body will respond by expelling excess blood through vaginal bleeding and begin the healing process.

, These conditions are experienced by women during pregnancy. The blood pressure elevates and can lead to the rupture of blood vessels. Blood leaks out of the ruptured structure and the body responds by expelling excess blood through vaginal bleeding and begin the healing process.

, Mothers can experience labor for more than a day. Because of this, the contracting uterus may be pushed to its limits and may be ruptured. Blood leaks out of the ruptured structure and the body responds by expelling excess blood through vaginal bleeding and begin the healing process., There are certain drugs that are given to mothers to trigger labor that are forms of oxytocin which stimulates contraction of the uterus.


If these medications are given in high amounts, the uterus may contract beyond the normal leading to rupture. This leads to vaginal bleeding as the body removes excess blood and begin the healing process.

, In cases where there is difficulty in delivering the baby, some health care professionals utilize instruments to assist in safe delivery. These instruments may cause injury or trauma to the nearby tissues and lead to bleeding. Blood leaks out of the ruptured structure and the body responds by expelling excess blood through vaginal bleeding and begin the healing process.

Write a birth plan.,
Include contingencies for complications.,
Consult with your healthcare providers.,
Tour potential hospitals for delivery.,
Decide on your birth facility.,
Revise your birth plan.,
Pack a bad ahead of time.,
Provide copies of your birth plan.,
Schedule a meeting with your doctor and birth attendant.,
Remind hospital staff of your wishes.,
Be confident and flexible during delivery.",How to Make a Hospital Birth a Natural Birth," The birth of your baby is often one of the most joyful and life-changing experiences of your life. The prospect of childbirth can scare many women and may cause some uncertainty. Thinking about and composing a flexible birth plan can help you and your health care providers develop your natural childbirth in the hospital.Your plan should be about one page and include:Preferences for the birth such as place and positions you’d like to use
Your fears and expectations, which you can discuss with your healthcare provider
Feelings about pain relief, including if and what type of pain relief you will accept
Expectations on fetal monitoring, including what type of fetal monitoring is and isn’t acceptable to you
Opinion on episiotomy, including if you will accept it and under what conditions
Hydration techniques such as IV, sips of water, or ice chips
Clothes you want to wear
Media such as music or videos you want to watch as a distraction
People you want present;
, Ideally, you want your birth to progress naturally without any problems, but there are sometimes unexpected situations that may require medical intervention to safely deliver your baby and protect your health. Make sure to include your plans for complications. You might want to include:Special wishes if you need a cesarean section
Wishes if your baby is breech
Feelings about forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery
Position on accepting an IV if you are dehydrated or antibiotic IVs if the doctor discovers infection in your amniotic fluid

, Most healthcare providers will try to support a woman who wants to have a natural birth, even in a hospital; however, some may have concerns about certain aspects of your birth plan or be unable to accommodate the natural birth in a hospital. Talk to your doctor and any other healthcare providers such as doulas and midwives about your plan, which can help you formulate a more realistic plan or make alternative plans if necessary.Share your birth plan with your healthcare providers and express your desire to have a natural birth in a hospital if possible. Discuss any concerns you may have.
Ask for suggestions on your plan and discuss your options so that everyone involved has a clear and realistic idea for your natural birth in the hospital.
Find a healthy balance of keeping your plan and respecting your doctor or healthcare provider’s expertise.
Consider using a midwife or doula during delivery. Studies have shown that constant support from a trained and experienced woman can make for a easier and more natural delivery.Your doctor may be able to suggest a registered nurse, midwife, or doula with whom she works.

, If you’ve discussed or chosen a healthcare professional based on their support for your natural delivery, ask them at which hospitals they allowed to attend deliveries. This ensures that your providers can attend the birth and navigate interactions with other hospital staff while accommodating your wishes as much as possible.Ask your doctor to suggest hospitals that offer birth centers or a natural setting and in which your doctor and any other healthcare providers are allowed to practice.
Visit different facilities to see what resources they offer. Look for tubs or jacuzzi tubs and birthing balls. Ask whether women are allowed to walk around during labor and what their policy is on being allowed to eat while in labor. Make notes on each so that you can remember while making your final decision on where to deliver.
Let the hospital know about the birth plan you’ve written and see how they can accommodate you.
Ask the staff at each facility questions about their resources and policies. For instance, you may be interested in doing a water birth, but this may not be allowed or accommodated at your delivery hospital. Make sure you ask the staff about water birth or any other methods you may be interested in.

, Once you’ve had a chance to tour a few different hospitals, make a final decision on where you’d like to deliver your baby. Consult your notes from the tours, your feelings, and any advice your doctor may have given you. Some of the factors you may want to consider are:The atmosphere. Did it make you feel relaxed, warm, and comfortable?
The option to return home shortly after the birth
The staff. Are there obstetricians, nurse-midwives, doulas, or direct-entry midwives available?
The hospital’s construction. Is there a birth center and are the rooms set up to be as comfortable as your home?
The resources. Are facilities available if you decide you want pain medication or there is an emergency?

, You may want to change your birth plan after you’ve chosen a hospital and as you get closer to delivery. This can help ensure that you take advantage of any resources your hospital offers and may prevent unexpected surprises.


Attend any prenatal or childbirth education programs your hospital offers.Consider using bathtubs or trying natural birth methods such as Bradley, Lamaze, water delivery (if allowed), or the Alexander Technique., Look at your birth plan and see what you items you need to help make your delivery as comfortable as possible. Make sure to pack a bag a few weeks before your delivery in case you go into labor early. Some items you might want to have are:A copy of your birth plan
Music, videos, or reading material
Comfortable clothing and footwear
Scented lotion or massage oil
Pillows

, Once you’ve finalized your birth plan and your due date approaches, give a copy of it to anyone who will be involved in the birth.This can help ensure that everyone involved in your birth understands your wishes and can accommodate them and any emergencies in a manner you like.


Let your healthcare providers know you want as natural a birth as possible in the hospital.
Make sure family members have copies of your plan, too. Even if you don’t want them in the delivery room, it may be good for them to have an idea of your wishes so they can be your advocates during your delivery.

, If you have a nurse midwife or physician scheduled to deliver your baby, suggest that your doula or birth advocate meet her prior to the delivery. This gives you all a chance to discuss any expectations or particulars about your delivery and can prevent conflict or tension when you are in labor.


This can be an important step if you chose a doula, or birth attendant who hasn’t met your doctor or healthcare provider.
Ask your advocate to help defend your decisions during delivery as long as they maintain the safety of you and your baby. This can prevent interruptions during your labor and after birth and keep medical staff interferences to a minimum., When you are admitted to the hospital and enter your room, remind staff of your birth plan. Some facilities immediately begin physical checks and examinations to determine the progression of labor simply through habit and may forget or not know your wishes.


Be aware that if you are considered high-risk, you may require examinations or other procedures that aren’t a part of your plan.
Let your doula or midwife advocate for you if they meet you at the hospital or as soon as they arrive., Stay confident and decisive about sticking to your plan for a natural birth; however, remember to be flexible for contingencies like extreme pain or danger to your baby.Reiterate your desire for no interference unless absolutely necessary.
Stay mobile if you prefer. Take walks around the hospital ward, take a bath or shower, practice breathing or stretching techniques or anything that makes you feel comfortable.
Consider asking for privacy until you feel comfortable moving or being examined if this helps you.
Deliver in a position that makes you feel best. Some women may find that active delivery positions are more comfortable, while others may prefer to lay back or sit down during childbirth. Request to change your position to ease yourself through the process as much as possible."

Study the Bradley Method of labor pain management.,
Take Lamaze classes.,
Study the Alexander Technique.,
Try HypnoBirthing.,
Take a prenatal exercise class.",How to Manage Pain During Labor1," This method teaches techniques to the mother to manage labor pain without drugs and teaches the father to be an effective birth coach. The focus is on relaxation techniques, good nutrition, and regular exercise during pregnancy. Classes take 12 weeks to complete and are taught by certified instructors.;
, Lamaze is the most used natural birthing method in the US. It focuses on breathing patterns, massage, relaxation and distraction techniques, and teaches how to care for your new baby.The class requires at least 12 hours of instruction over a period of weeks.
Instructors also prepare mothers for changing birthing plans at the last minute and discuss options for pain management. Lamaze neither supports nor discourages the use of pain medications, leaving it up to the discretion of mother and doctor., This method promotes simple lessons for improving movement, balance and coordination that teach women how to accommodate for the changing size, shape and flexibility of their bodies throughout pregnancy. The philosophy for managing labor pain rests on knowing your own body well and how to move it efficiently, safely and comfortable under varying circumstances.

Classes should be taken once a week, ideally.
This technique can be used with or without pain medications.
The technique is taught to anyone who wants to take classes, not just expectant mothers.

, For this method, women work with a qualified educator to learn self-hypnosis techniques and study how good nutrition and appropriate exercise can make labor easier. They teach a combination of breathing exercises and relaxation techniques, including meditation and visualization.Women typically attend five 2 ½ hour classes.
If you are late in your pregnancy, practitioners may be able to make special arrangements.

, Sticking to a careful, consistent exercise regime will help you prepare for labor. There are a few exercises that can help you practice movements you will use during delivery to make it as easy as possible. Tailor sitting teaches you how to sit during labor to best support your back and pelvis. Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic organs. Squatting during labor helps open your pelvis to give the baby more room, but can tire moms quickly. Pelvic tilts can relieve backaches and ease delivery.To practice tailor sitting, sit on the floor with your back straight and your legs out straight. Press your knees gently into the floor with your elbows. Hold the stretch for 10 second and repeat 5 to 10 times.
Kegels imitate the effort you would make in stopping and starting urination. Do slow Kegels by contracting your pelvic muscles for 3 to 10 seconds. Relax, and repeat up to 10 times. For fast Kegels, contract and relax your pelvic muscles quickly 25 to 50 times. Relax for 4 seconds and repeat. Do up to four sets.
To practice squatting, do a wall slide. Stand with your back against the wall and your feet 6 inches in front of you, shoulder width apart. Slowing slide down the wall into a squat, with your thighs parallel to the floor. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds and then slide back up slowly. Repeat 5 to 10 times.
Pelvic tilts are easiest done on your hands and knees on the floor. First pull in your abdominal muscles while arching your back like a cat. Hold for several seconds. Release the stretch, returning to a flat position. Repeat 3 to 4 times, up to 10 repetitions total.

Try focused breathing during contractions.,
Try visualization techniques.,
Create a relaxing environment.,
Move around.,
Try water therapy.,
Ask about a TENS unit.,
Use aromatherapy.",How to Manage Pain During Labor2," Pay attention to your breathing while repeating the word “relax” in your head. Think “re-“ as you breathe in through your nose and “-lax” as you exhale through your lips. Let go of the tension in your body when your exhale also.Don’t worry about the speed or depth of your breaths, as long as you establish a rhythm and your inhale is shorter than your exhale.
Focused breathing helps relieve pain and allows you to conserve energy for later stages of labor.

, Focus your attention on something that makes you happy and imagine it in your head during intense pain. It could be your favorite object or your partner’s face, or anything that gives you pleasure when you see it. Imagining you are in a relaxing place can also help you forget about the pain for a few minutes.

Think of your favorite vacation spot or imagine sitting in your most comfortable chair at home.

If you could be anywhere, would you be sitting on a beach in the sun, listening to the waves crash and seagulls? Maybe you would prefer a cabin in the woods with a rocking chair out front and listening to songbirds and insects.
The more fully you can imagine the scene, the better doing so will distract you from any pain. Use all of your senses to make your image seem more real. Try to feel the sun on your skin or the breeze blowing by.

, Include soft music, candles, comfortable pillows for your bed or chair, or whatever you typically use as tools for relaxation time. Spend the minutes in-between contractions enjoying your surroundings in the moment, instead of anticipating the next contraction or thinking about the last one. This will help you get through contractions one at a time, instead of them having a cumulative effect.Use the candle flame as a focal point to bring your attention to the present if you are having trouble keeping your mind calm. Sit comfortably and look at the flame, watching how it flickers.
Include an object from home that you love and has personal value for you. Concentrate on it and think about what it represents or how it makes you feel to see it.
Try using your favorite small thing you bought for the baby to remind you of why all the pain is worth it.
Ask your partner to massage your feet, hands, or back to help you relax more. For some women, the counter pressure of massaging sore areas can relieve some of the pain., If you can, get up and take a short walk. If not, change positions where you are as frequently as you feel the need. Sit on the bed on your hands and knees, squat down, lean over the bed or counter, roll on a birthing ball, move from the bed to a chair, etc. Moving your body helps labor along by taking advantage of gravity, and it also gives your mind something to concentrate on instead of the pain.If in the hospital and hooked up to monitors and IVs, change your position in bed any time the pain starts worsening. Try sitting on the side of the bed with your feet on the floor, or getting up on your knees, if it is comfortable to do so. Ask your partner to support your torso with their weight.Make sure someone is with you while walking around in case you get a contraction and need support or someone to lean on for a moment.
Keep your walk short and go more than once if you like, rather than walking for too long and tiring your body out before the late stages of labor.A birthing ball is similar to an exercise ball, often used in yoga and pilates. Bouncing and using it to rock your hips back and forth can help ease pain., If you are at home or at a birthing center, you likely have a bathtub nearby. Fill it up with warm water (100 degrees F) and soak. Have your partner use a cup to pour water over your shoulders too. Or, take a hot shower instead. The streams of water can feel like a massage and relax you even more.You should be dilated at least 5 cm before using water therapy.If used earlier in labor, this technique might slow labor down.

, TENS, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, units can help to manage pain naturally during labor. These units emit a small electrical impulse that is delivered through electrodes placed on your lower back. They can help to reduce the need for other types of pain relief during labor and give you a sense of control, since you can control the frequency of the electrical impulses.Ask your doctor about getting a TENS unit to use during labor.

, Although there are few studies on the effects of aromatherapy during labor, aromatherapy has not yet been found to be effective at reducing pain during labor.However, it may be a nice addition to your labor experience to help promote relaxation. In one study, aromatherapy seemed to help reduce anxiety in women during labor and it also seemed to correlate with a reduced need for opioid pain relievers.Try using lavender, chamomile, or clary sage essential oils in a diffuser during labor and breathe in the scent as you inhale through your nose.

Consider an epidural.,
Ask about analgesic pain medications.,
Ask about nitrous oxide.",How to Manage Pain During Labor3," An epidural is a regional anesthetic administered through a needle into your spine. A low dose of medicine is delivered continuously through a pump, with a button to self-administer more when you need it. It might add about an hour to your labor time, but make all of the hours much more manageable..


The old epidural could cause total numbness in the lower torso, causing many women to avoid it so they could experience the actual birth, but this is no longer usually an issue. Spinal headaches are also much less commonly a side effect now.
Doctors can administer an epidural even in later stages of labor, but it takes 10-20 minutes to start working. Women close to delivery may get a combined spinal-epidural, which adds a second shot lower in the spine that offers almost immediate relief. A spinal is only effective for about 2 ½ hours.
Spinal anesthesia may be recommended by your doctor instead of an epidural dependent upon progressing health and labor.
If you prefer not to use drugs for pain, you may want to ask your doctor to keep an epidural on your back-up plan in case cannot manage the pain on your own.
If you decide during your labor to take pain medication, your doctor may suggest a combined spinal-epidural to give you quick relief.

, Some women cannot get an epidural for medical reasons, and may need a narcotic pain reliever, such as stadol, nubain, morphine, or fentanyl. Opioids also relieve pain during labor and are usually administered as a single shot.These can also be given using a patient controlled pump. However, these medicines are not typically given if you will be delivering soon because they can affect the baby.


They may cause drowsiness in both mother and baby, since they affect the entire body.
All pain medications offered to ease labor discomfort are safe for the mother and her baby. Going over pros and cons of each one can help you make the best personal choice.

, Nitrous oxide functions as a safe analgesic (pain reliever) and anxiolytic (anxiety reducer) when used at a low dose during labor. In some countries, 50% nitrous oxide blended with 50% oxygen is given frequently to women in labor. It will not affect the baby in a negative way and it will allow you to remain alert during labor.Another benefit of nitrous oxide is that it is a short acting drug that you can control. If you do not like the effects, then you can discontinue use and the effects will wear off after about five minutes.
Be sure to consider the risks of this drug as well. While nitrous oxide is relatively safe, it does have some potential side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and putting you to sleep. Discuss the risks with your doctor before you decide if this might be a good option for you.

Get up and walk around.,
Shift around when you're lying down.,
Get on all fours.",How to Speed up Early Labor1," Walking can help the baby shift in the uterus, causing it to the descend towards the pubic bone. This sends a signal to your body that the baby is ready to be born, which may trigger labor to progress.Walking up and down stairs can be especially helpful to shift a baby in the right position for birth.;
, Even if you're too tired to be walking up and down the stairs, you can move around in bed to help the baby reposition. Shift from your back to your side, for example, and then switch it up again a few minutes later. Staying in the same position will not help the baby move to speed up labor.Going from a sitting to standing position can be helpful. Try to get out of bed a few times an hour. If possible, walk around the room a bit before lying back down.
Try lying on your left side. This increases blood flow to the baby and can improve pain., Your back will feel better, and you'll help the baby rotate into the face-down position he or she needs to take in order to come out. Get on the floor and gently hold yourself up on your hands and knees. Kneel on a pillow if that's more comfortable.However, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before you try this or any other unusual stretches or movements. You want to make sure such motions are safe for your specific pregnancy.

Relax and wait.,
Create a soothing environment.,
Take a soothing bath.,
Try to sleep.,
Try nipple stimulation.,
Have an orgasm.",How to Speed up Early Labor2," Usually, the best thing you can do during prolonged labor is relax and accept you need to wait. If your doctor thinks your pregnancy is progressing normally, there is not a lot for you to do other than try to remain calm. As you usually do not have to go to the hospital during early labor, do things around your home to wind down like reading a soothing book or watching a movie you enjoy., While further studies are needed some evidence suggests stress could stall pregnancy. It certainly couldn't hurt to create a soothing, stress-free environment for yourself and it may help you get through early labor faster.Evaluate the room and take note of anything you don't like. Is the television too loud? Are the lights more bright? Do you want more privacy?
Make any adjustments you need to create a soothing room for yourself. This may result in early labor picking up again.

, A nice warm bath can be relaxing, and can also help if you're feeling any physical pain from labor. While you're waiting for labor to progress, draw yourself a nice, warm bath and linger in the water until you feel calm., While sleep does not always speed up labor, it can make the time feel like it's going by faster. It's also a good idea to sleep during the early stages of pregnancy, when you're able to get rest. Eventually, you will progress to later stages where you'll need to push. Sleeping can help you build up strength.If you went into early labor during the night, it's particularly important to try to get some sleep.

, Nipple stimulation has been known to speed up early labor for some. If you're having trouble getting through early labor, you can roll your nipples between your thumb and pointer finger. You can also rub your fingers with your palm. If you want, you can have a partner or a nurse do this for you.However, some women's fingers are very sensitive throughout the course of pregnancy. If your nipples are sore, do not cause yourself discomfort by engaging in nipple stimulation.

, There is some evidence that having an orgasm can help labor progress. If you want, you can try to engage in sexual activity with your partner to bring about an orgasm. You can also try masturbation."

Ask your doctor about any drugs you're taking.,
Apply acupuncture.,
Have a doctor or midwife break your water.,
Try a hormonal drip.",How to Speed up Early Labor3," If you took drugs early in your pregnancy, they may be slowing down labor. In this case, flushing drugs from your system can help you advance through early labor. Talk to your doctor about any drugs you took and ask them for advice about how to get the drugs out of your system quicker., If you can, book an acupuncture appointment during early labor. Pressing down on certain pressure points may affect hormones and speed labor.If your partner or midwife knows acupuncture, you can simply have them speed up your labor.

, If your labor has been stalled for a long time, a doctor or midwife may suggest manually breaking your water to help labor progress. This is usually done during active labor, however, but may be done earlier in rare cases. Only go this route if your doctor or midwife suggest it, as you should not attempt to manually break your water on your own., A hormonal drip administers Syntocinon, an artificial form of oxytocin which is a hormone that helps with labor. Your doctor will need to monitor your baby's heartbeat if a hormonal drip is used. It may help speed up a labor that has stalled."

Keep track of the bleeding.,
Get plenty of bed rest.,
Avoid heavy work.,
Put intercourse on hold for the time being.,
Do not use tampons or try to douche.,
Stay hydrated.,
Be aware of causes of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy.,
Calculate your due date and consider whether or not your bleeding could mean that your labor has started.,
Know when to seek help from a medical professional.",How to Stop Vaginal Bleeding During Pregnancy1," It is very important to have an idea about the amount of blood loss during an episode of bleeding. This will help your doctor to make a possible diagnosis as well as establish a management plan. Start monitoring the amount of blood you are losing as soon as you notice the bleeding.


You can do this by keeping a sanitary pad in your underwear until it is soaked. Count how many pads are soaked from 8 am one day to 8 am the next day. Keep a written record of this number, then bring it to your doctor for assessment.
Also keep track of other characteristics of the bleeding, such as whether it is painful or painless, and intermittent or constant bleeding. This information describing your bleeding will be helpful to your doctor in figuring out what is at cause in the matter.
Take note of the color of your blood (pink versus red versus brown), as well as the presence or absence of blood clots or other ""tissue masses"" that may come out alongside the blood. If you do have any tissue masses come out of your vagina alongside the blood, you may want to collect these in a container to show to your doctor, as this could be of assistance to her in diagnosing the cause of your problem.;
, For minor bleeding in early pregnancy, rest is the ideal treatment. Physicians usually advocate complete bed rest for the first few days following the episode of bleeding.


If the bleeding does not stop or diminish with rest, it is important to see your doctor for a more detailed assessment.

, Your physician will definitely advise you to avoid strenuous or heavy work such as weightlifting, climbing stairs frequently, running, cycling, etc. These activities cause jerking of the uterus and can rupture the delicate, newly-formed blood vessels in the placenta. Avoidance of these kind of activities is absolutely necessary, even if you only notice a tiny amount of bleeding.


You should limit your physical activities and avoid heavy work for at least two weeks after the bleeding stops.

, Sometimes intercourse can induce or aggravate bleeding from the vagina.


If you experience bleeding during pregnancy, you should avoid intercourse until your doctor tells you it's safe. Normally, you will have to wait at least two to four weeks after bleeding has stopped.

, Do not insert anything into the vagina following vaginal bleeding. Absolutely avoid using tampons or douching, as these may injure the cervix or vaginal wall causing further bleeding. Douching may also introduce bacteria and other microorganisms into the vagina, leading to serious infection.

, It's very important that you drink adequate amounts of fluid during a bleeding episode. This is particularly true if you have experienced severe bleeding.


Drink at least eight cups of water daily to stay hydrated, and more. Bleeding correlates to fluid loss, so you will need to drink more than your normal to make up for the lost fluid.
It is also important to stay well-hydrated for your baby's health and wellbeing.

, This can help to differentiate what may be going on in your particular case.


Bleeding is actually quite common in the first trimester (in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) and occurs for about 20 – 30% of women. Many of these cases of bleeding are benign, meaning they are not worrisome for the mother or the baby and may be due to the fetus implanting in the wall of the uterus or other physiologic changes of pregnancy. There are, however, more worrisome possibilities associated with higher volumes of blood loss and/or pain in the first trimester as well. These include the possibility of ""ectopic pregnancy"" (the baby has implanted in the fallopian tubes rather than the uterus), ""molar pregnancy"" (a rare condition in which abnormal tissue grows inside your uterus rather than a fetus), or a miscarriage.In 50% of cases of vaginal bleeding within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, it indicates that a miscarriage is occurring. Bleeding later in pregnancy (in the second or third trimester) is more likely to be worrisome. Causes include problems with the placenta, problems with the uterus (especially if you have had a previous C-section), premature labor (defined as the onset of labor before 37 weeks), or also of course labor itself (if you are near the time of your due date). Additional causes of bleeding that may be unrelated to the pregnancy specifically include ""trauma"" (or injury to the vaginal wall) from sexual intercourse, cervical polyps (masses around the cervix that may bleed and that can be present in women irrespective of whether or not they are pregnant), cervical dysplasia (abnormal cells that can lead to cancer), and/or cervical cancer (one of the most prevalent forms of cancer for women who are not regularly screened with Pap tests)., Pregnancy normally lasts for 40 weeks or 280 days. You can use this information to calculate your due date — just add nine calendar months and seven days from the first day of last menstrual period. For example, if your last period began 1st January, 2014, your due date is 8th October, 2014.


Bleeding near your due date may indicate that your labor has begun. The typical range is from 10 days before to 10 days after the due date. You should immediately report to your doctor if your suspect that you might be in labor.

, Any bleeding during pregnancy should be discussed with your physician in a timely manner. If the bleeding is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it is recommended to be seen by a doctor as soon as possible in the emergency room for quick assessment and treatment:Severe pain or cramps
Dizziness or fainting (signs of large blood loss)
Tissue that comes out of your vagina alongside the blood (could be a sign of miscarriage)
A fever and/or chills (could be a sign of infection)
Severe bleeding that does not slow down or stop.

Know that you can ignore very light bleeding.,
Seek medical help if you experiencing heavy bleeding.,
Pay attention to any pain or cramps you feel.,
Seek help if you are dizzy or feeling faint.,
Check your temperature.,
Seek immediate help if you are passing tissue through your vagina.,
Follow the instructions of your doctor post-treatment.",How to Stop Vaginal Bleeding During Pregnancy2," If you are bleeding very little (only a few drops), the blood is brown in color, it lasts less than one or two days, and is not associated with pain or cramps, then you can usually ignore it. Most likely it is implantation bleeding or the result of stretched blood vessels.


Regardless of how light the bleeding is, you should avoid heavy work for a few days and meticulously monitor the amount of bleeding.

, Any type of profuse bleeding during pregnancy should be regarded as an emergency. Profuse bleeding roughly means any amount of bleeding more than usual menstrual bleeding. , Pain that comes and goes indicates contractions of the uterus, which means that the uterus is trying to expel the fetus. In early pregnancy, pain and cramping may be a sign of miscarriage and in third trimester it may indicate that you are going into labor.Therefore, if you experience any pain or cramping, you should contact your doctor immediately.


True labor pain is regular and occurs at intervals. It gradually increases in intensity and duration and it associated with ""show"" (expulsion of mucus mixed with blood).

, Dizziness or feeling faint are symptoms of massive blood loss. , Bleeding accompanied by fever usually indicates an infection, such as infection in your uterus following natural miscarriage or abortion. As a result, any signs of fever should be brought to the attention of your doctor immediately. , Passing a fleshy mass through your vagina is a serious indication of miscarriage. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately so he can evacuate the uterus if needed and thus control the bleeding. , Regardless of what caused vaginal bleeding (whether it was a miscarriage, an ectopic pregnancy outside the uterus, an infection, or the onset of labor), it will have caused significant stress to your body. In the great majority of cases your doctor will strongly advise rest, no strenuous exercise, often abstaining from sex for a little while, and drinking lots of water. Be sure to heed your doctor's advice for recovery in order to maximize the speed at which you recover, as well as to prevent any other complications.

Locate an aromatherapist.,
Speak to your obstetrician or health care provider before beginning a course of aromatherapy treatment.",How to Use Aromatherapy During Pregnancy1," A specialist trained in aromatherapy should be able to evaluate your medical history and recommend suitable dosages and blends of oils to meet your specific needs.;
, Some essential oils carry a serious risk when used in the presence of some medical conditions. Additionally, certain oils should not be used during pregnancy as they may be harmful to the fetus. You doctor will likely be able to advise you about the safety of specific aromatherapy treatments during pregnancy.

Expect to bleed heavily for three to 10 days.,
Pay attention to the color of your discharge.,
Anticipate continued bleeding.,
Learn about what's happening in your body.",How to Tell if Postpartum Bleeding Is Normal1," For roughly the first week after you give birth, you will experience a heavy, bright red flow of blood. During this time, you may also pass several small to medium-sized blood clots.During this first stage of postpartum bleeding, you will probably saturate a menstrual pad about every three hours.You may also pass one or two large clots (the size of a quarter), and several more small clots (the size of a grape).If you have given birth by Caesarean section, you can expect your bleeding to be a bit heavier.You should begin to notice a slight change in the color of your lochia after two to four days postpartum.;
, For those first three to 10 days, your lochia will be a deep, bright red (growing a bit lighter after about four days). After three to 10 days, this should change from red to pink. After another few days, lochia will change to brown, and finally to a yellowish-white., Although you should only bleed heavily for around three to 10 days after giving birth, you will continue to have a light to medium flow for several weeks (up to six). Your bleeding should be slowly tapering off, and becoming lighter in color during this time.If you are breastfeeding, you may notice a slight increase in bleeding and cramping when you nurse (or immediately after). Nursing causes the uterus to contract slightly, so this is perfectly normal.
If you have begun taking hormonal birth control, you may continue spotting after six weeks. Discuss this with your healthcare provider.

, It may ease some of your fears to understand what is happening inside your postpartum body. After you give birth, the placenta separates from your uterus, and the blood vessels where it was attached are left open, bleeding into your uterus. After the placenta is delivered, your uterus continues to contract, releasing this blood, as well as any leftover tissue, fluid, and bacteria. As the uterus contracts it also closes off the bleeding vessels. In short, during your first six weeks postpartum, your uterus is cleansing itself and restoring normal conditions.During pregnancy, the amount of blood in your body rises by about 50%, so your body is well-prepared for this postpartum blood loss.
If you experienced a tear during birth or had an episiotomy, you may bleed from this site as well.

Know when to medically induce labor.",How to Speed Up Labor," Standing upright can help your baby get in the ideal birthing position (the anterior position) so that labor will be quicker and easier.Constantly sitting at a desk or lying down during pregnancy alters the position of your pelvis, which can increase the likelihood that your baby ends up in the posterior position with the back of its head pressed up against your spine.This can cause lower back pain during labor and potentially delay giving birth as you wait your baby to make a 180 degree turn at your pelvis.;
, One study conducted at the University of North Carolina found that pregnant women who got acupuncture at 40 weeks were more likely to go into labor naturally than those who didn't.As you near your due date, consider getting acupuncture to help naturally induce labor.

, Being dehydrated can cause ""false contractions,"" or contractions that occur before labor has even begun.Staying properly hydrated once labor has started is also important to maintain your strength and stamina.

, This releases the hormone oxytocin which can help prompt contractions. You can either have your partner do this for you or use a breast pump.

, If your water has not broken yet, having sex can help naturally induce labor. When the man ejaculates inside the vagina, the prostaglandins contained in his sperm help stimulate the cervix.Make sure that the man ejaculates inside the vagina so that the prostaglandins can do their job.

, Many people believe that light physical activity, like walking or cleaning around the house, can help speed up the labor process. Only do as much physical activity as you feel safe and comfortable doing.

, Being stressed can cause you to tighten your muscles which is the opposite of what you want to happen during labor. Have your partner give you a massage or try breathing exercises to help relax. You may also find that a warm bath helps you relax and ease some of the discomfort caused by your contractions.

, Most women experience significantly longer labors for their first born than with their next kids because the cervix and vaginal walls have not yet been stretched or dilated. Your subsequent labors will likely be much shorter and less painful

, There are a few circumstances that might prompt your healthcare provider to suggest medically inducing labor. They include, among other things:


You are two weeks past your due date.Your uterus is infected.You are not having contractions even after your water has broken.You have a preexisting health condition, like high blood pressure or diabetes, that might put your baby at risk.Your placenta is deteriorating.Your baby has stopped growing unexpectedly.There's not enough fluid within the amniotic sac protecting your baby."

Purchase a nebulizer that is to be used only for aromatherapy.,
Use a clean spray bottle.,
Use your own body as a diffuser.",How to Use Aromatherapy During Pregnancy2," These diffusers are easy to use and require only a few drops of oil.


Place several drops of oil on a ceramic light bulb ring. Place the ring around the light bulb and wait for the heat from the bulb to disperse the scent into the room.

, Aroma lamps rely on water to help disperse the scent into the room. They are easy to use and provide a lighter scent than full strength oils.


Fill the top of an aroma lamp with water and add a few drops of essential oil to the water.
Light a tea light candle underneath. The heat of the candle will diffuse the scent throughout the room.

, Fans are a convenient way to use aromatherapy. They come with pads that are used to absorb the oils and disperse them through the fan and into the room.


Place a few drops of oil on a diffuser pad.
Insert the pad into the fan.
When the fan is turned on, it will blow the scent out into the room.

, Nebulizers are generally more expensive than other types of diffusers, however, they are well made and can withstand a lot of usage.


Fill a glass vial from a nebulizer with a small amount of oil.
Place the vial into its designated location and wait for the air from the nebulizer to blow the scent into the room.

, You don’t have to purchase expensive equipment to reap the benefits of an aromatherapy diffuser. A simple spray bottle can be just as effective at diffusing scents into the room.


Make sure the spray bottle is cleaned thoroughly and free from any left-over liquid residue.
Pour 7 oz of distilled water into the empty spray bottle.
Add 1 teaspoon of oil and 1 ounce of vodka to the bottle.
Use the spray as room deodorizer and to freshen bedding and linens.

Contact your doctor if you are soaking through one pad (or more) per hour, for three or more consecutive hours.The use of tampons is discouraged during this time, as using they can introduce bacteria into the vagina.
Your bleeding should be heaviest during the first few days and then begin tapering off. Contact a doctor if your bleeding does not seem to be tapering off.

, During the first few days after you have given birth, your blood should be very bright red. After around four days, it should lighten in color. Speak to your doctor if your blood is still bright red more than four days after delivery., If your blood has a foul, rotten odor this could be a sign of postpartum infection.

Understand that this condition is rare.,
Learn about medical conditions that increase risk.,
Learn about other risk factors.,
Recognize the signs.",How to Tell if Postpartum Bleeding Is Normal3," Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a rare, but serious condition that affects only 4 – 6% of women after giving birth. Although PPH is very rare, it remains the number one cause of postpartum death. As such, it is important for you to recognize the risk factors that make PPH more likely, as well as the symptoms of PPH., You are more likely to experience PPH if you have been diagnosed with any medical conditions that affect the uterus, conditions that affect the placenta, or conditions that affect the way your blood clots.Conditions that affect the uterus include: uterine atony, uterine inversion, and uterine rupture.
Conditions that affect the placenta include: placental abruption, placenta accrete/increta/percreta, and placenta pelvia.
Conditions that effect the way your blood clots include: von Willebrand disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and you are taking anticoagulants (warfarin, enoxaparin, etc.).

, A variety of other factors can place you at a heightened risk for PPH. Keep in mind, none of these conditions indicate that you will experience PPH (again, this condition is rare); they only signal that your risk is slightly increased.You may be at an increased risk if you experience:


Obesity
Long labor (lasting more than 12 hours)
Emergency c-section
Anemia
Pre-eclampsia or high blood pressure
PPH in a previous delivery
Uterine infections (endometritis)

, PPH is most likely to occur within one day of giving birth; however, it is possible for PPH to occur up to two weeks postpartum. It is crucial for PPH to be treated immediately, so contact your health care provider if you experience any symptoms.Symptoms include:


Heavy bleeding from the vagina that does not slow down or stop
Drop in blood pressure or symptoms of shock (blurry vision, chills, clammy skin, very rapid heartbeat, feelings of confusion, extreme dizziness or fainting)
Pale skin
Swelling and pain around the vagina and/or perineum

Manage your attitude and emotions.",How to Return to Work After Maternity Leave," Remember that, unless you were planning to be a stay-at-home mom, you made the decision to balance a career and a family – and that’s a perfectly valid choice. It’s best to come to terms with your decision as quickly as possible, so don’t second guess yourself! Let go of your guilt, and you’ll be more likely to go back to work with the right mindset.;
, Once you go back to work, your time with your baby will be limited, so use the rest of your maternity leave to bond as much as possible: hold and cuddle your baby, sing and laugh and make faces with your baby, and enjoy the extended time that you have together.

, There are plenty of ways to continue bonding with your baby once you go back to work. You can start preparing now. Consider:


Waking up earlier in the morning and spending some quality time cuddling with your baby before you start getting ready for the day.
Turning routine chores and activities into bonding opportunities. For example, you might work to make breakfast or bath time a special shared time for you and your baby.
Talking to your baby about your routine.
Smiling at your baby during routine moments. The happier and more interactive you are, the more content your baby will be.

, Dependable childcare is crucial to your success at work, and you won’t feel comfortable unless you know that the person caring for your baby is someone you can trust.


Ask family and friends if they are available to provide childcare, or if they have recommendations for childcare providers.
Ask potential childcare providers for references, and follow up to learn as much as possible about the person who may be caring for your child.
If you are considering a daycare facility, go for at least one tour, and ask if you can sit in and watch a typical day.
Make arrangements for back-up childcare. Ideally, a friend or relative will be able to take your baby on short notice if, for some reason, your regular childcare falls through. If not, research drop-in childcare options and ask people you know for suggestions.
Check to see if your company offers childcare benefits. Some employers do offer childcare at the office; others offer financial help with the cost.

, Once you have thought about your routine and established a childcare plan, it can help to have a practice run. This will help you identify potential problems and feel more prepared for going back to work. For the best results:


Set a wake-up schedule for you and your baby.
Go through your regular hygiene routines – including whatever additional steps you would take to be dressed and ready for a work day.
Be productive during the times you will be spending at work.
Identify steps that can be completed in the evening in order to make mornings easier, and start doing those things.
Consider starting childcare during this time. This involves some unnecessary expense, but it will ease your stress. Once you go back to work, your baby will already be more comfortable with the new routine.

, When your maternity leave ends, schedule a meeting with your supervisor. Get an update on what’s being going on in your workplace, and then bring up any questions or concerns you might have regarding the transition.


Consider asking if you can return to work mid-week to ease the transition for you and your baby.
Discuss options like telecommuting or part-time hours during the initial transition. These adjustments may allow you to ease back into your work routine.
Ask for any special considerations you may need. If you plan to continue breastfeeding, for example, you may need to ask for a clean and private room where you can pump breast milk during the day.

, There are ways to keep in touch with your baby throughout the work day. If you live close to the office, consider going home during your lunch break to feed and spend time with your baby. If you live further away, you may be able to schedule Skype sessions. If not, you can leave a picture of yourself with your child or make a recording of you talking or singing for your childcare provider to play for your baby.


Be aware of your baby’s individual needs. If seeing you briefly during the day seems to upset your baby even more, leading to additional stretches of distress and crying, you might decide that it’s better to say goodbye once in the morning and then wait until the end of the workday to reunite for some cuddling time.

, You may feel emotionally drained as you try to meet the demands of motherhood and a career simultaneously. Don’t forget to take time for yourself. Relax in a warm bath once the baby is asleep, or curl up with a good book. Get your hair done, or go for a run, or buy some new clothes – whatever makes you happy and restores your energy.

, A positive attitude will make balancing a career and a baby much easier, so:

Address any feelings of guilt. Reaffirm that you are doing what you think is best for your family.
Cultivate a sense of accomplishment. Motherhood is challenging; work is challenging. You are doing both.
Stay positive. You might feel anxious or depressed at first, but try to keep a positive attitude. You and your baby will get used to your new routine; it will get easier.

Wait at least 24 hours after you give birth to soak in a bath.
Try a sitz bath – a shallow plastic tub you can sit in that’s positioned over your toilet seat., Put chilled witch hazel on a pad and hold it against the hemorrhoids. This can ease the pain and bring down some swelling., If the hemorrhoids are very uncomfortable or are taking a while to heal, talk to your doctor. Ask about hemorrhoid medications. These are usually topical – apply them to the affected area."

Breastfeed your baby, if possible.,
Use warm compresses to express milk.,
Use cold compresses between feedings.,
Wear a supportive bra to decrease milk production.,
Consult a lactation specialist if breastfeeding is painful.",How to Treat Postpartum Pain3," Breastfeeding is healthy for your baby and will improve your breast pain. Sore breasts after delivery are caused by engorgement – milk being produced in your breasts. Breastfeed to help alleviate the pressure and ease pain.You can also use a breast pump to express milk.

, Apply warm compresses to your breasts to alleviate some pain from engorgement. This can help release milk. Use clean washcloths or towels every time so you don’t introduce bacteria to your breasts and nipples. You can also soak in a hot bath, or stand in a hot shower., When you’re not feeding, put cold packs, bags of ice, or cool washcloths on your breasts to relieve some discomfort. Wrap ice in towels so you don’t damage your skin., If you’re not breastfeeding, take measures to minimize your milk production. This will alleviate breast soreness. Wear firm, supportive bras like a sports bra.


Don’t rub your breasts or use a breast pump – this will encourage more milk production.

, If you’re experiencing pain during breastfeeding, a lactation specialist can teach you techniques to make breastfeeding more comfortable. They can also help you watch out for any problems you might encounter while breastfeeding (like mastitis)."

Apply heat to the sore area.,
Get a massage.,
Start a gradual exercise program.",How to Treat Postpartum Pain4," Use a heating pad on your back, or take a warm bath or shower. This can provide short-term relief from back pain.If heat doesn’t help, try a cold pack. You may find that one feels better for you.

, Visit a licensed massage therapist for a relaxing massage. This can help alleviate stress and may improve back pain caused by labor, tension, and sore or tight muscles.Try to relax and minimize your stress level as much as possible.

, Start to improve your back pain with an exercise program that gradually increases in intensity. Start by taking short walks for a few weeks – this is safe after vaginal or cesarean delivery. Then when your healthcare provider says it’s okay, gradually amp up your activity:Start doing back and abdomen strengthening exercises, like the pelvic tilt.
Do gentle stretching and yoga, but avoid strenuous postures.
Remember that when you’re lifting, bend at your knees and lift from a crouching position. Be tentative and careful if you had a c-section – recovery is longer after a c-section than after vaginal delivery.

Encourage visualization.If a pregnant woman envisions your touch as absorbing or releasing her labor pains, the process will continue more smoothly.,
Make contact.,
Utilize aromatherapy.Aromatherapy is the use of scents from essential oils to reduce feelings of anxiety and pain.,
Play music.,
Chant with her.,
Give her a snack.",How to Relieve Panic During Labor1," Help her imagine this by gently squeezing her arm or leg while reciting: “When I squeeze, I want you to envision all your anxiety and negative energy leaving your body. Ready?” When she offers her assent, count backwards from three, then apply a three to four second squeeze. Relax your hand but do not let go of the limb. Ask her if she feels better. Try it again at five to 10 minute intervals, or when particularly painful contractions come, until she is less panicky.


You might also encourage her to envision her favorite place. Free visualization might take her to the snowy Alps, or a shimmering Malibu beach. Ask her to close her eyes and tell you about her favorite place in the world. Push her to offer lots of details. If her place of choice is the beach, ask her, “What color is the water? What color is the sand? What does it smell like? How tall are the palm trees?” and so on.Programmed visualizations, unlike free visualizations, rely on a particular vision which you must walk the pregnant woman through. For instance, maybe you have an end-state visualization of the actual baby in her arms, or of the contraction process at work. Ask her to imagine how wonderful she will feel at home with her new, beautiful baby.;
, Hold her hand or touch her face to coax her through the process. Focus her attention. If she cannot make eye contact with you, place your hands on her cheeks and focus her attention to your eyes. If you cannot be in front of her due to the hospital arrangement or other birthing conditions, gently lean on her shoulders.Give her a massage. A gentle massage on the shoulders, feet, or hands can help women in labor relax.

Cup your hand around the foot or hand and gently work your thumbs into the surface in a circular motion. Slowly move your thumbs across the surface of the hand or foot so that the entire surface is massaged.Massage her shoulders from behind. Grasp the upper arm between your fingers and the heel of your hand. Squeeze and hold for a few seconds, then release. Repeat, moving inward towards the neck.



, It might also involve lotions which are massaged into the mother-to-be’s skin.


You can dip or apply the essential oil to a slip of paper (called a taper) and attach it to the woman’s hospital gown or clothing. Place it near her wrist or neckline, somewhere close enough that the scent will waft up to her nostrils.
Diffusers are devices which distribute the scent of essential oils. They vary in technical specifications. A good one will have the option to release an intermittent or continuous dispersal, automatic shutoff when water reaches a low level, and a long (eight or more hours) operational time for a single quantity of water and oil.
Lavender, sage, rose, or jasmine are popular scents, and inspire a sense of calm. Find a scent the pregnant woman enjoys.Check with the woman’s midwife or physician before utilizing essential oils, as they may interact with conventional medications.

, Music can be therapeutic and distract the pregnant woman from her pain and fear. The music can be anything from ‘80s pop to classical. As long as it soothes the listener and helps her relax, the music is doing its job.This method is especially useful if the woman has already been listening to a particular piece of music or style of music during her pregnancy in anticipation of the actual childbearing process. Now that she is in labor, encourage her to think back to the musical practice sessions and the positive associations she coupled them with. Have her envision how calmly and confidently she imagined giving birth during those practice sessions.
Encourage the woman in labor to move or sway slightly with the beat. This provides a more focused, deliberate kind of movement than simply thrashing about aimlessly in fear.
While doctors and nurses often respond positively to music, it might be distracting to them. If possible, locate some headphones so the woman can listen to her calming music without disrupting the hospital staff from doing their jobs.

, If a woman can chant or recite a mantra to keep her focused, she will relax and allow anxiety and fear to pass. Making a low-toned sound requires relaxation of the vocal cords, which can in turn relax the rest of the body. Chants and mantras will help her pass through the pain and overcome her panic.


Mantras and chants don’t need to be complicated. A simple one might just be the word “relax” broken into its two syllables.Encourage the panicky woman to breathe in on “re” and out on “lax.”
Ask her to recite a simple phrase or religious verse. “I am in control of my thoughts,” “This is hard but I am strong,” or “I do not need to be afraid” are good examples of phrases you can chant repeatedly with the woman to disrupt her fear and panic.

, Labor is hard work. While some women may be in no mood for eating or drinking, others will want light refreshment or a small snack, especially during the early stages of labor.Snacks appropriate for a pregnant woman include cereals, pasta, crackers, soup, or cookies.These snacks are good sources of carbohydrates, which will provide needed energy over a long period.


She’ll probably want something to wash the snack down with. Water is the best bet. An alternative choice is an isotonic drink.Isotonic drinks are known colloquially as sports drinks, and contain a low amount of sugar and salt. These drinks are meant for anyone engaging in vigorous activity over a long period — perfect, in other words, for labor. Find a flavor she likes and provide it for her.

Know which conditions can cause a PPH.,
Understand that uterine atony is a cause of major blood loss.,
Know that trauma during childbirth can lead to a postpartum hemorrhage.,
Understand that sometimes the blood does not flow out of the woman’s body.",How to Recognize Symptoms of a Postpartum Hemorrhage1," Several conditions that occur before, during, or after delivery can result in the precipitation of PPH. Some of these conditions require close monitoring of the woman during and after delivery to rule out PPH. It is important to know about these conditions, as they increase a woman's chances of suffering from this condition.


Placenta Previa, placental abruption, retained placenta, and other placental abnormalities
Multiple pregnancies
Pre-eclampsia or increased blood pressure during pregnancy
History of PPH in a previous delivery
Obesity
Uterine abnormalities
Anemia

Bleeding during pregnancy
Long lasting labour more than 12 hours
Baby’s birth weight above 4 kgs;
, Postpartum hemorrhage, or blood loss after giving birth, is one of the world’s leading causes of maternal death, even after safe delivery. There are several reasons why excessive bleeding of more than 500 ml after delivery of the baby occurs. One of this is called uterine atony.


Uterine atony is when the uterus of the mother (the part of the female reproductive system that housed the baby) is having difficulties in going back to its original state.
The uterus remains lose, hollow and non-contracting when it should be firm and contracting. This makes the passage of blood easier and faster, contributing to postpartum hemorrhage.

, Another reason why excessive bleeding occurs is when trauma or injury occurs as the baby exits the body.


Trauma may be in the form of cuts, which can be caused by using assistive devices during delivery
Alternatively, lacerations can occur when the baby is larger than average and is coming out rapidly. This may cause a tear in the vaginal opening.

, Bleeding caused by PPH will not always flow out of the body. At times, bleeding occurs internally and if there’s no outlet for the blood it will move toward the small crevices found in between bodily tissues and will form what is called a haematoma.

Rest as much as possible.,
Maintain good posture to support your abdomen.,
Brace your incision during sudden movements.,
Use OTC pain medicine.,
Breastfeed using the football or side-lying hold.",How to Treat Postpartum Pain5," Take it easy for several weeks after your c-section. Your body needs time to heal. Set yourself up in bed or on the couch, and try to keep everything you need within reach. Don’t lift anything heavier than your baby for the first eight weeks., When standing and walking, stand up straight and in good posture. This will help to support your abdomen.If it feels comfortable, place a hand gently over your incision with light pressure – you may feel more secure moving around like this.

, If you move your body quickly or bear down at all, apply pressure to your incision site. This includes when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or defecate., Most pain medications you get at your pharmacy are safe during breastfeeding, but ask your doctor or pharmacist to be sure. NSAIDs, Aspirin, and acetaminophen can help improve pain while your c-section wound heals., You can breastfeed almost immediately after your c-section, but do so in specific positions to make it more comfortable. Place a pillow over your abdomen while you hold your baby. Also try the following holds, and determine which is more comfortable for you:The football hold: Hold your baby at your side and bend your elbow. Support your baby’s head with your open hand. Face them toward your breast. Rest their back on your forearm. Support your breast in your other hand, if it’s comfortable.

The side-lying hold: Lie on your side. Face your baby toward your breast and support them with one hand. Use your other hand to hold your breast and press your nipple to your baby’s mouth. When they latch, use one arm to hold the baby and your other arm to support your own head.

Keep calm.,
Make yourself visible.Stand next to her or sit on the bed.,
Walk with her.,
Play a game with her.,
Talk her through it.,
Encourage rhythmic breathing.During panicked breathing, the body becomes tense and breaths are short and shallow.",How to Relieve Panic During Labor2," You cannot expect her to stay calm if you are not. Even if you have never been present at a pregnancy, try to relax and enjoy the experience. Maintain a positive attitude. Do not yell or express yourself in an emotionally charged manner. Remember, she’s giving birth, not you. If you are the father, try to remember what you learned during the pregnancy and birthing courses you attended with your partner. Call for help if you think she needs it. Stay with her and do not leave to get help unless absolutely necessary., Assume a position from which you can make eye contact with her. Knowing you’re nearby in the event that something goes awry will reassure her that she can make it through the process.


If she will not make eye contact and is continuing to panic, bring your face close to hers to ensure she sees you.

, Walking can be a good way to relax in the earlier stages of labor. Whether it’s just to go to the bathroom or to take a stroll around the house or hospital, help the panicky woman as she needs it. If dilation is between 4–7 centimeters (1.6–2.8 in), you will need to support her.Stand next to her and face the same direction as the panicky woman. Have her drape her right arm around your neck. Place your left arm around her body gently, cupping your hand beneath her left armpit. Locked together, begin walking slowly to the destination of her choice. The change of scenery will do her good.


Walking can ease the labor process. Moving the pelvis helps the baby find the easiest exit position out of the womb.Be especially attentive and stay nearby if she insists on walking during later, more intense stages of labor. If a painful contraction suddenly strikes, she may collapse from the pain and you will need to support her.

, Games can keep her mind off the labor process. Whether it’s a card game like hearts, go fish, or war; or a board game like Monopoly, Scrabble, or chess, games can be a great source of fun and a good way to relax. Since she’s in labor, she’ll probably be in bed most of the day anyways, and there are few better ways to spend time in bed than by playing games.


Videogames are a possibility too.In this case, she won’t even necessarily need a partner to play against — just a console, a TV, and a controller, or a portable gaming device.

, Keep your tone soft and soothing. Your calm demeanor will mollify her panic. Don't be offended if she doesn't appreciate it at the moment. Keep your tone even and do not yell or express undue excitement. Offer words of advice and encouragement such as “You’re doing great,” and “You can do this.”


If contractions have begun it will be more difficult to keep her in the moment, but you can still help. As the contractions arrive, tell her three to five times in succession to push until the contraction has stopped. Following the end of each contraction, remind her again she is doing a great job.Focus on her feelings and ask her how you can help. Encourage her to express herself in whatever way best helps her overcome her feelings of panic, whether it’s reaching out to you for reassurance, remaining quiet, or screaming in short bursts. (In the case of screaming, though, it’s best to suggest that she lower her scream to a groan or moan; lower tones are calming, while higher ones incite fear and panic.)Be positive! Tell her she's doing a great job, tell her how proud you are of her. Encourage her throughout the process. Let her know she will be a great mom.
Ask her what she wants. If she wants to deviate from the birthing plan she had in place before she went into labor, she should be allowed to do so. Just because she’s in labor doesn’t mean she’s incapable of making decisions.

, The shoulders will arch up and the head and neck will be hunched forward. This consumes a lot of energy and oxygen the mother-to-be will need to make it through the labor process. It also reduces the available oxygen to the baby. To prevent this, help the woman breathe slowly and deeply, in and out. Make sure each breath and exhalation is balanced in length and depth. A natural rate is about one breath in every two seconds, and a corresponding exhalation lasting another two seconds. Demonstrate the technique and ask her to mirror it with you.


Counting breaths is a good technique too.Ask her to breathe in deeply with you and count out loud, “One, two, three, four.” As you reach four, instruct her to “Breathe out.” Exhale together, counting out loud again to four. Repeat until her breathing has slowed and she has relaxed.
Have her breathe in through her nose and out through her mouth. Show her how, and suggest that she release labor pains with a sound (“ahhh” or “oooh”) as she exhales. Provide a glass of water for her to sip from between breaths.

Keep track of the quantity of blood.,
Look at the flow and texture of the blood.,
Know that the blood’s odor may help you determine whether or not there is a PPH.",How to Recognize Symptoms of a Postpartum Hemorrhage2," The type of bleeding that occurs immediately after delivery, within 24 hours of delivery, or a few days after delivery is crucial to help rule out a PPH. The most important parameter for this purpose is the quantity of the bleeding.


Any bleeding above 500 ml after a vaginal delivery and above 1000 ml after a caesarean section is considered as a PPH.
In addition, bleeding that exceeds 1000 ml is labeled as severe PPH and requires immediate medical intervention, especially if there are additional risk factors.

, PPH is generally continuous in flow and is profuse, with or without several large clots. However, clots are much more common in a PPH that develops after a few days of delivery, and this type of bleeding may also be more gradual in flow.

, Some additional characteristics that can help differentiate a PPH from normal post-delivery bleeding or lochia (vaginal discharge consisting of blood, tissue from the lining of the uterus and bacteria) are its odor and flow. Suspect a PPH if your lochia has an offensive smell, or if your flow suddenly increases after delivery.

Seek medical help if you recognize any severe symptoms.,
Watch for signs that occur a few days after delivery.,
Go to the hospital if you see these warning signs.",How to Recognize Symptoms of a Postpartum Hemorrhage3," Acute PPH is often accompanied by signs of shock such as reduced blood pressure, tachycardia or low pulse rate, fever, rigors, and faintness or collapse. These are the most definite indications of a PPH, but also the most dangerous. They require immediate medical intervention.

, There are some less severe yet dangerous signs of a secondary PPH that tend to occur a few days after delivery. These include fever, abdominal pain, painful urination, general weakness, abdominal tenderness over the suprapubic area and adnexae.

, PPH is a medical emergency and requires immediate hospitalization and measures to stop the bleeding. Hence, it isn’t a condition that can be ignored. If you experience any of the following symptoms after delivery, contact your OB immediately, as you could be developing shock.


Low blood pressure
Low pulse rate
Oliguria or reduced urine
Sudden and continuous vaginal bleeding or passing of large clots
Fainting
Rigors
Fever
Abdominal pain

Quickly identifying the cause of the bleeding allows for faster intervention.


A nursing care plan is a very useful tool in doing just that. There are five steps in the nursing care plan. These steps are assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention and evaluation.
In order to make a nursing care plan on postpartum hemorrhage, it is important to know what to look for and what to do in each of these steps.

, Before carrying out an assessment, it is important to take note of the mother’s history. There are several predisposing factors that make the mother more prone to postpartum hemorrhage, as all women who had just given birth are prone to excessive blood loss. If one or more of the following are present in the mother, assessment should be done at least every 15 minutes during and following delivery until the mother is not showing any signs of bleeding.


These predisposing factors include a distended uterus caused by carrying a large infant inside or having excessive fluid in the placenta (the sac surrounding the infant), having given birth to more than five children, rapid labor, prolonged labor, utilization of assistive devices, a caesarean birth, removal of the placenta manually and an inverted uterus.
Predisposing factors to excessive bleeding also include mothers who have suffered from conditions such as placenta previa, placenta accreta, utilizing drugs such as oxytocin, prostaglandins, tocolytics, or magnesium sulfate, underwent general anesthesia, if the mother has clotting disorders, have suffered from hemorrhage in the previous childbirth, has uterine fibroids, or has suffered from bacterial infection of the fetal membranes (chorioamnionitis).

, In assessing the mother, there are certain physical aspects that need to be checked regularly to determine if there is an ongoing postpartum hemorrhage and also to help determine the cause. These physical aspects include:


The fundus (the top part of the uterus opposite the cervix), the bladder, the amount of lochia (the fluid coming out of the vagina that is composed of blood, mucus, and tissue from the uterus), the four vital signs (temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure) and skin color.
When assessing these areas, it is important to note what to look out for. Follow the steps below for more info.

, it is important to check for the consistency and the location pf the fundus. Normally, the fundus should feel firm upon palpation and the level will be inclined towards the umbilical (belly button) area. Any changes to this - for example if the fundus feels soft or is difficult to locate - could be indicative of postpartum hemorrhage.

, There might be instances when the bladder is causing the hemorrhaging and this is indicated by the fundus being displaced above the umbilical (belly button) area.


Let the mother urinate and if after urinating the bleeding goes away, then it is the bladder causing the displacement of the uterus.

, In assessing the amount of discharge coming out from the vagina, it is important to weigh the pads being used before and after in order to get accurate documentation. Excessive bleeding should be indicated by saturation of one pad within fifteen minutes.


Sometimes, the discharge often goes unnoticed and it can be checked by asking the mother to turn on her side and check underneath her, especially in the buttocks area.

, The mother's vital signs include her blood pressure, respiratory rate (number of breaths), pulse rate, and temperature. In postpartum hemorrhage, the pulse rate should be lower than normal (60 to 100 in a minute), but could vary depending on the mother’s previous pulse rate.


However, the vital signs may not show abnormality until later the mother is already suffering from excessive blood loss. Therefore, you should assess any deviation from what is normally expected with adequate blood volume, such as warm, dry skin and pink lips and mucous membranes.
The nails can also be inspected by pinching and releasing them. There should only be a there second interval for the color of the nail bed to return to pink.

, If any of these changes have been assessed, the mother could be suffering from postpartum hemorrhage caused by the uterus failing to contract and getting back into its original shape. However, if the uterus has been assessed and it was found to be contracted and not dislocated, and yet there is still excessive bleeding, this could be due to trauma. In assessing for trauma, pain and external color of the vagina have to be considered.


Pain: The mother will be experiencing deep, severe pelvic pain or rectal pain. This can be indicative of internal bleeding.
External vaginal orifice: there will be bulging masses and skin discoloration (usually purplish to bluish black hue). This can also be indicative of internal bleeding.
If the laceration or wound is found outside, it can be easily assessed upon visual inspection, especially if done under proper lighting.

, If there is considerable blood loss and the cause have been determined, the next step in the nursing care plan has already been accounted for, which is the diagnosis.


Upon confirmation of the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage, the first step in planning is always to inform the physician and other healthcare providers involved in the care of the mother as the nurse cannot use client-centered goals.
The nurse’s key roles in this kind of complication is to monitor the mother, implement ways to minimize blood loss and replace it, and to report right away if there are any significant changes in the previously noted condition and if the response from the mother is not what is desired.

, Nursing interventions appropriate for postpartum hemorrhage will be to continuously monitor the vital signs and the output via weighing blood soaked pads and linens. Massaging the uterus will also aid in getting it to contract and become firm again. Notifying the physicians or midwives when there is still bleeding (even during the massage) is important as well.

, The nurse should have already notified the blood bank in case there is a need for blood transfusion. Regulation of intravenous flow is also the nurse’s responsibility.

, The mother should also be positioned in what is called a modified Trendelenburg, where the legs are elevated by least 10 degrees and at most 30 degrees. The body is horizontal and the head elevated a little bit as well.

, The mother will usually be on a number of medications, such as oxytocin and Methergine, and the nurse should be able to determine the side effects of these medications, as they could also be life threatening to the mother.


Oxytocin is mainly used for labor induction and is safe to be given during labor; however it is also utilized after delivery. The action of the drug is to facilitate the contraction of the smooth muscles of the uterus. It is usually given through an intramuscular (usually in the upper arm) injection with a dose of 0.2 mg given every 2 to 4 hour with a maximum of 5 doses after delivery. Oxytocin has an antidiuretic effect, which means that it will inhibit urination.
Methergine is a drug that is never given before labor, but can be given afterwards. This is because the action of Methergine is to promote sustained uterine contractions, and will therefore cause a decrease in the oxygen consumption of a baby still inside the uterus. Methergine is also given by injection intramuscularly with a dose of 0.2 mg every 2 to 4 hours. Methergine’s side effect is an increase in the body’s blood pressure. It should be noted if the blood pressure spikes up more than normal.

, The nurse should be aware of any buildup of fluids inside the body by consistently listening to breath sounds. This is done in order to identify any fluid in the lungs.

, The final step in the nursing process is evaluation. Like the assessment, the areas of concern in a mother suffering from excessive bleeding will be checked.


The location of the uterus should be midline, with the umbilicus as the center. The uterus should be firm upon palpation.
The mother should not be changing pads as often (using only one pad every hour or so) and there should be no leakage of blood or fluids found on her bed sheets.
The mother’s vital signs should have returned to her normal, pre-delivery vital signs.
She will not have clammy or cold skin and her lips should be pinkish in color.
Because she is no longer expelling fluids in bulk, her urine output should return to 30 ml to 60 ml every hour. This shows that there are enough fluids inside her body for adequate circulation.

, If her bleeding was due to trauma, any open wounds will have been sutured by the physician. These wounds will need consistent monitoring to ensure that they don't re-open.


There should be no more severe pain, although there may be some local pain coming from the sutured wound.
If there was blood pooling inside the mother’s muscles or tissues, the treatment should have eradicated the purplish or black bluish coloring on the skin.

, The medications that were aforementioned should be routinely checked for any side effects, until the use of the medications is discontinued. Even though managing postpartum hemorrhage is done in cooperation with the physician, the nurse will be able to gauge the effectiveness of the interventions by a consistent improvement in the condition of the mother.

However, a contraction is not always a sign of preterm labor, as you can have false contractions called Braxton Hicks contractions.Braxton Hicks contractions are generally less severe than regular contractions. Though Braxton Hicks can be painful sometimes, actual contractions are usually accompanied by more pain and are more regularly spaced.In fact, actual contractions will move closer together as time passes.If you're having more than eight contractions in an hour or more than four in 20 minutes, your contractions are likely not Braxton Hicks.If you are having contractions and are worried, don't be afraid to call your doctor. She'll be better able to determine whether you are having false contractions or regular contractions.;
, These false contractions can be triggered by a number of activities. If you or the baby has been moving around a lot, that can trigger them. You may also have a round of these contractions after sex or if you are especially dehydrated. Finally, a full bladder or even someone just touching your stomach can trigger these contractions.Therefore, if your contractions are light and started after these activities, they could just be false contractions instead of preterm labor.

, If your contractions are Braxton Hicks, they will eventually subside. To hurry the process along, try changing how you're positioned. Lie down if you've been moving around, or do the opposite if you've been lying down.


You can also try drinking more fluids or getting extra rest to help alleviate these contractions over time., If you start feeling pressure in your lower abdomen, that could be a sign of preterm labor. You may also feel pressure in your pelvic area. If you're not sure whether the pressure you're feeling is preterm labor, call your doctor to be sure., If you start feeling cramps, it may be a sign of preterm labor. Generally, these cramps will feel like you are on your period.In addition, diarrhea may accompany your cramping., While a backache may just seem like an annoyance, it may also be a sign you're going into labor. In particular, backaches that are in your lower back could be a symptom, especially ones that don't go away. You'll feel a dull ache, not a sharp pain., You may see some spotting or bleeding from your vagina. Spotting is light bleeding. Check your underwear for this symptom, though it may also show up when you are using the restroom.In a more severe case, your water may break. In that case, you should notice watery discharge from your vagina. It may gush all at once or be a slow leak.You should especially be looking for changes in your vaginal discharge.Some discharge is normal during pregnancy. In your second trimester, you're likely to see white, thin discharge. This discharge is acidic in nature, as it tries to stave off bad bacteria and yeast in your vaginal area.In your third trimester, you're likely to see heavier discharge near the end of the pregnancy.If you've been having normal discharge, but it suddenly changes, call your doctor. Also, look for an increase in thickness or the amount of mucus., It's nearly impossible to completely protect yourself against infections. Nonetheless, vaginal infections can lead to early birth, so you should do what you can to prevent this issue.Stay clean by showering or bathing daily. However, skip beauty products that might irritate your vaginal area, such as bubble baths or feminine sprays. Also, skip douching.Douching tends to change the levels of bacteria in your vaginal area, which can let the bad ones take over.Keep the area breathable. Skip clothing that is too tight, as that can make you hotter down there. Instead, wear breathable fabrics such as cotton, and keep it loose.Practice safe sex. If you or your partner is having sex with other people, use barriers when having sex. Researchers aren't clear why there is a connection between sex and infections; however, they are sure there is a connection. Also, practicing safe sex will protect you and the baby from sexually transmitted diseases.Skip tampons completely while pregnant. When using pads, use unscented ones without dyes., Women who don't gain the recommend weight during pregnancy are at a higher risk for early births. How much you should gain depends entirely on your weight before pregnancy, though doctors sometimes make recommendations based on your body mass index, a measurement of your height versus your weight.If you're underweight to begin with (with a BMI less than 18.5), you should gain 28 to 40 pounds. If you're of average weight (with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), you should gain 25 to 35 pounds. If you're in the overweight category (25 to 29.9), you can gain 15 to 25 pounds. Finally, if you're above a BMI of 30, you can gain 11 to 20 pounds.Nutrition is also important. Make sure you are eating a balanced diet that includes protein, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and whole grains. Ask your doctor for a more comprehensive list if you are unsure about what you should eat., Smoking can increase the risk of your baby being born early. In addition, smoking may cause your baby to be underweight at birth because the chemicals from smoking may block some of the oxygen your baby needs. Secondhand smoking can be equally as harmful, so ask your partner to quit if he or she is the smoker., Alcohol also increases your risk of having your baby early. Also, you up your chances of having a stillborn baby if you drink while pregnant. If you carry your baby to term, she may still have problems due to your alcohol use, such as fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause deformities and disabilities in your baby., Abusing illegal drugs, such as cocaine, can lead to an early delivery. You should avoid illegal drugs anyway, because they can affect the health of your baby, and always talk to your doctor before starting on any medication, even over-the-counter medications or natural supplements., Although you can't avoid stress altogether, you can skip situations where you know you will be stressed out. In addition, when you find yourself in a stressful situation you have no control over, learn to practice techniques to de-stress yourself.Try deep breathing. Close your eyes. Focus completely on your breathing. Take a deep breath in, counting to four. Breath out, counting to four. Keep focusing on your breathing until you feel yourself calm down.
Use visualization. With this technique, you take a journey with your senses. Imagine yourself some place you're happy and relaxed, such as the mountains. Think about the smell of the pines, the cool air on your skin, and the sounds of the birds. Imagine as many details as you can., Having pregnancies too close together can increase your chances of giving birth too early. Your body needs time to rest and recover. It's best to wait a year and a half after your last birth before trying to get pregnant again., For instance, preeclampsia can lead to preterm labor. Preeclampsia is extremely high blood pressure during your pregnancy.Other pregnancy complications include gestational diabetes and too much amniotic fluid.Problems with the placenta can also cause preterm labor,such as placental abruption.Another issue could be if your uterus is not shaped normally.Your doctor should be checking you for all these issues so that she will know if you are at risk.

, If you have high blood pressure or diabetes before you get pregnant, you can also be at risk for a preterm labor.Other chronic diseases can also cause issues, such as kidney or heart disease.Even something as small as gum disease can put you at risk for preterm labor. In fact, when you get pregnant, you have a higher chance of developing gum disease because of the hormones in your body.Pay extra attention to dental health while pregnant, by flossing, brushing, and using mouthwash twice a day at least.

, If you've had a preterm pregnancy in the past, you are more likely to have one in the future. Let your doctor know if about your pregnancy history so she can assess your risk.Also, if your mother gave birth to you early, you may also give birth early.If you have a history of a preterm delivery, your doctor can talk to you about the medications available to help prevent this from happening again.

, If you have severe injury or trauma, that can put you at risk for preterm labor. Obviously, you don't have control over events that cause trauma, such as car accidents, but try to not put yourself in dangerous situations while pregnant., For instance, if you are having twins or triplets, you are more likely to give birth early. In addition, your age can affect your pregnancy. If you are an older mother, you may give birth earlier."

Understand the three stages of labor.,
Do Kegel exercises in addition to daily exercise.,
Take birthing and parenting classes with your partner.,
Ask your doctor about eating during labor.,
Write down your birth plan with the assistance of your partner and your doctor.,
Discuss your birthing options with your doctor.,
Decide at what point during your labor you are going to the hospital.,
Discuss your pain management options.,
Determine if you are going to personalize the birthing environment.,
Ask your doctor about situations that may require a Cesarean delivery.,
Decide if you are going to breastfeed soon after delivery.",How to Prepare Yourself for Labor and Delivery," Though the duration of each stage will vary for every mother, you will experience all three stages during your labor:The first stage of labor includes early labor and active labor. During stage one, the muscles of your uterus start to tighten, or contract, and then relax, which will help to thin and open the cervix so your baby can pass through the birth canal. Your labor will begin with early contractions that are irregular and last less than a minute. This early phase can last from a few hours to days. You will then experience active contractions that are regular and last about a minute. Once you experience active contractions, you will need to head to a hospital or birthing center. You will eventually transition to the second stage of labor, when your cervix opens completely and you are ready to give birth.
The second stage lasts through the actual birth. During the second stage, your cervix is completely dilated and your baby travels down and out of the birth canal. Your baby will then be born.
The third stage of labor occurs after your baby is born. You will have contractions until the placenta is delivered out of your birth canal.;
, You should maintain a daily exercise routine of light to mild exercise during your entire pregnancy and focus on doing Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles and ligaments. These exercises will help your body prepare for labor and delivery.To do Kegel exercises, squeeze the same muscles in your pelvic area that you would use to stop your urine. Do not move your belly or your thighs, just your pelvic muscles.
Hold the squeeze for three seconds, then release them for three seconds.
Begin with holding and releasing for three seconds. Gradually add one second to the hold and release time every week until you are able to squeeze for 10 seconds.
Repeat the Kegel exercise 10 to 15 times per session. Do three or more sessions a day.

, If you have a partner who is going to be part of the baby’s life, you should both attend birthing and parenting classes before you give birth. If you are having a hospital birth, your hospital can provide birthing classes and many medical clinics offer these classes as well.During these classes, you will learn about how to breastfeed, how to care for your new baby, how to have a healthy pregnancy, and how to massage your infant.

, Most doctors will advise you to have clear liquids during labor and small snacks, like a piece of toast, applesauce, Jell-O, or popsicles, to keep your strength up as you go into delivery. However, you should avoid large, heavy meals (no steaks and no burgers) and only eat foods that will not upset your stomach as you will likely be feeling stomach pains already due to labor.

During labor, you should have liquids like clear chicken broth, made with low-sodium, fruit juice without pulp, tea, and sports drinks. You can also suck on ice chips to refresh you as you do your breathing exercises during labor.
Some doctors may recommend clear liquids only, especially if they think you have a high likelihood of requiring a cesarean delivery.

, Though it is never possible to predict any delivery, having a written or typed birth plan can help you outline what you would like to occur during your labor and delivery. You should provide a copy of your birth plan to your partner, your doctor, and any staff at the hospital.


Many hospitals will provide a standard birth plan that you can fill out and submit so they are aware of your wishes.

, You can decide to have your baby at home (home birth), or in the hospital (hospital birth). You may decide to have your baby at a birthing center in your area, rather than at a hospital. It can be overwhelming to decide where you want your baby to be born, so discuss your options with your doctor and your partner before you make a decision. Ultimately, you should do what you feel is best for the health of you and your baby.A hospital birth is a standard plan for many expecting women. You should look for a hospital that is located within driving distance to your home, and a doctor on staff that you feel comfortable with and trust. Many hospitals offer tours to expecting women, including the floor where you will likely give birth, so you are familiar with the environment before you deliver.

A home birth is an alternative to a hospital birth and can provide you with comfortable atmosphere for your child’s birth.There are risks involved with a home birth, however. You must carefully choose a midwife, being aware that the midwives that home birth in the US are not required to be certified and may not have any training. The mortality rate of newborns delivered during home birth is triple that of hospital births., If you are having a hospital birth, you should discuss at what stage of your labor you are going to plan to go the hospital. By the time you experience active contractions at the end of the first stage of labor, you should head to the hospital.


Your midwife should also be made aware of when you are going to call her for assistance at home during your labor. Depending on the policies of your midwife, you may both decide on a rough estimate of when she should expect a call from you to come over to your home and assist with the birth. It may be necessary for you to give birth in a hospital if there are complications.

, Labor is an intense and painful process. Your doctor should outline your pain management options and you should agree on what level of pain you are going to sustain without or with medication. You may choose one or several of these options:

Epidural: This anesthetic is injected directly into your spine, bypassing your bloodstream. This makes it safer for your baby and ensures you receive quick pain relief. It is a popular pain relief option for many women in labor. Though it can take 15 minutes or longer to kick in, epidurals can be administered as soon as you request it, even if you are not dilated to a certain amount. The anesthesia will numb your entire lower body, including the nerves of your uterus, thereby numbing the pain of your contractions.
Pudendal block: This is used to relieve early second-stage labor pain and is usually reserved for when you are at the vaginal delivery stage. Your doctor may use this medication if he needs to use forceps or a vacuum vaginal extraction. It will reduce pain in your perineal or vaginal area but you will still feel your contractions.
Spinal block or saddle block: These pain relievers are rarely used for vaginal births. They are given in a single dose right before delivery if you did not have an epidural during labor but want pain relief for your delivery. They are fast acting pain relievers and you will be numb during your delivery. If you get a spinal block, you will need to stay flat on your back for eight hours post delivery.
Demerol: This pain-relieving drug can be administered via a shot in the buttocks or an IV. You can be given Demerol two to three hours before you give birth and then given doses every two to four hours. The drug will not interfere with your contractions, and some women are given Demerol to give their contractions a more normal rhythm.
Nubain: This is another pain-relief drug that is administered via IV. It is a synthetic opioid that does not numb the body but can reduce pain and anxiety.Some doctors may use nitrous oxide (like they use in dental offices).
General and regional anesthesia: General anesthesia is rarely used for delivery and only used for emergency surgical births. You will inhale or receive it via injection and it will put your entire body to sleep as the doctor performs an emergency Cesarean. It may also be required if you have a difficult vaginal breech birth to help deliver your baby’s head. You will be knocked out for the entire birth on general anesthesia and it can cause you to feel queasy and nauseous once you wake up from the birth.
Natural birth (drug free): If you are concerned about using pain medication during your labor, you may decide to go for a drug free natural birth. Talk to your doctor about going unmedicated during your labor, or using a combination of medication and natural birthing techniques.

, If you are giving birth in a hospital, you should discuss any specific requests for the birthing environment in your hospital room. This could include dimming the lights, playing music, or wearing your own clothes as you give birth. Your doctor should be made aware of any specific request for the birthing area before you give birth.If you are giving birth at home, you should discuss the birthing environment with your partner and your midwife. You may decide to give birth in your bathtub or in a special pool made for home births. You may also decide to have music playing, lighting and other calming elements in the environment during the birth.

, It’s important that you prepare for the possibility of a C-section in your birth plan. Phrase this as: “In the event it is necessary to perform a Cesarean delivery…”. Depending on your pregnancy, your doctor may recommend a C-section for medical reasons or your doctor may be required to perform a C-section in an emergency situation during your labor. Your doctor may recommend a C-section if:You have certain chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease.
You have an infection like HIV or active genital herpes.
Your baby’s health is at risk due to an illness or a congenital condition. If your baby is too large to move safely through the birth canal, your doctor may advise a C-section.
You are overweight, as being obese can cause other risk factors and may require a C-section.
Your baby is in the breech position, where she is feet-first or butt-first and cannot be turned.
You have had a C-section during your previous pregnancies.

, Skin-to-skin contact during your baby’s first hour in the world is important for your baby’s health and to help you and your baby bond. This is called the Golden Hour and it is often recommended that you have skin-to-skin contact with your baby as soon as possible post-delivery. You should also decide if you are going to breastfeed after your baby is born, as the hospital should be made aware of your wishes.

Keep in mind the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that mothers breastfeed their newborns for the first six months of life and continue to breastfeed for at least 12 months. Breastfeeding can protect your baby from infections and reduce her risk of health problems like diabetes, obesity, and asthma."
"
Familiarize yourself with the signs of lightening.,
Watch for the bloody show and mucus plug.,
Figure out when your water breaks.",How to Recognize the Signs of Labor1," Lightening, also known as the baby dropping, refers to your baby moving towards the lower pelvis. This may happen a few weeks before birth or a few days.


You will find yourself less short of breath as the baby is pushing less on your lungs; however, as the baby is moving downward, there will be increased pressure on your bladder. You may need to urinate more frequently.There might also be a sense of pressure or heaviness in your pelvis.It may be a few weeks before labor begins, but if you've experienced the lightening it is a sign that labor is coming.;
, In labor, the cervix expands to allow the baby to pass through the vagina. When this occurs, a large amount of discharge comes through the vagina. The mucus plug and bloody show are two early signs of labor.


Capillaries burst as the cervix dilates in preparation for birth. This causes pink or brown vaginal discharge, known as the ""bloody show."" Your bloody show can occur anywhere from a few hours before birth to a few weeks.Throughout your pregnancy, a thick plug of mucus blocks your cervix to prevent infection. For some women, the plug falls out during the early stages of cervix dilation.The plug will be pinkish in color and stringy in texture. Much like your ""bloody show,"" this can happen a few hours to a few weeks before you give birth., One of the most well-known aspects of labor is the water breaking. This can be a slow or sudden process. You should always inform your doctor or midwife when your water breaks as labor needs to start soon after this occurs to prevent complications.


The amniotic sac is filled with a variety of fluids that help cushion the baby during pregnancy. The membranes in this sac rupture during the early stages of labor. This is what's known, conventionally, as your water breaking.Your water breaking can be a slow, trickling sensation, something like gradually leaking. It can also be a sudden release of fluids.With the amniotic sac no longer intact, labor will begin soon. The risk of infection increases if labor is delayed after your water breaks so your doctor may want to induce if you do not begin labor naturally."
"
Notice if contractions are regular.,
Time contractions to track duration and frequency.,
Notice if the pain is getting more intense.,
Watch for radiating pain in your lower back and upper belly.,
Try to talk or laugh during the pain.,
Look for pressure on your pelvis.,
Check for the bloody show.,
Change your activity level or position to see if pain increases.",How to Recognize Contractions1," Real labor contractions will quickly develop a pattern of duration and frequency. While the length of time that you experience the contractions and the time between them will vary, the changes will be progressive and steady.You will be able to expect when the contractions will happen.
There will not be gaps of time where the contractions stop, such as an hour long break.;
, Use a timer, clock, or watch that tracks seconds to see how long your contractions last. Labor contractions last from 30-70 seconds. Then see how much time passes between contractions to determine the frequency, which is how often your contractions are coming. As you get closer to delivery, your contractions will last longer and happen more often.Time the contractions from beginning to end. This is the duration of the contraction.
The time between contractions shows the frequency., Labor contractions get more painful and longer as they progress toward the baby being born, so judge the intensity of your pain to see if it feels like it’s increasing.Use a scale of 1-10 to judge the pain as it comes. If the ratings are steadily increasing, then you may be having labor contractions.

, You will feel labor contractions in your lower back and upper belly, which will differ from other types of pain associated with your pregnancy, such as Braxton Hicks contractions or stretching muscles.Pain not in your lower back or upper belly is most likely not a real labor contraction. If the pain persists, contact your health care provider immediately.

, As your labor contractions progress, you will not be able to talk or laugh during the contraction. If you are able to talk or laugh, then you are probably not having labor contractions., Since your labor contractions mean that your body is getting ready for the birth of your baby, you should start to feel pressure on your pelvis that coincides with the pain of the contractions. If you’re starting to feel that pressure, then you are likely having labor contractions., With real labor contractions, you should see red or pink spotting in your underwear. Contractions can cause the blood vessels in your cervix to burst, which results in a bloody spot. With false labor, this spotting will not occur., While resting or changing positions can stop false labor pains or pain from stretching muscles, real labor contractions will not stop no matter how comfortable you make yourself. If you continue to feel pain after you get into a relaxing position, then you are likely in labor."
"
Recognize Braxton Hicks contractions.,
Familiarize yourself with the nature of true contractions.,
Cope with early contractions.",How to Recognize the Signs of Labor2," Braxton Hicks contractions are mild contractions that occur before labor begins. It can sometimes hard to differentiate between Braxton Hicks contractions and true labor.


Braxton Hicks contractions are typically short and not painful. They feel like a mild contracting feeling, similar to period cramps.Braxton Hicks contractions are not accompanied by any bleeding or leaking of fluids. They do not last particularly long, and they do not come at regular intervals. Sometimes, moving around or shifting positions can cause the contractions to stop.Braxton Hicks contractions usually show up later in pregnancy, around the 35th week. If you're unsure whether you're having Braxton Hicks contractions or true contractions, contact your OB/GYN., True contractions do not necessarily come after water breaking; they come at the beginning of labor. There are many ways to identify true contractions.


True contractions come in regular intervals. They generally begin 15 to 20 minutes apart and last about 60 to 90 seconds. As time goes on, they come closer together until you reach the active stage of labor where contractions are only two to three minutes apart.True contractions will not stop, even if you switch positions or walk around. They will be quite painful, and the pain will often spread to your lower back and upper stomach.Contractions will make interacting with others challenging. During a genuine contraction, you might not be able to talk or laugh at jokes., During the early stages of labor, contractions will be far apart. Your doctor will probably not advise you to come to the hospital or prepare for birth at home immediately. There are ways to cope with contractions when they're still in the early, mild stage.


Take a warm shower or bath. The water can help ease some of the pain; however, if your water has broken, talk to your healthcare provider before taking a bath.Try to distract yourself with daily activities. Go for a walk, go shopping, or watch a movie.If it's nighttime, try to sleep. You'll need energy later on as labor progresses and you need to work to push the baby out."

Take stock of nausea and diarrhea.,
Be aware of the nesting instinct.,
Seek immediate care in the event of an emergency.",How to Recognize the Signs of Labor3," During the early stages of labor, you may experience some signs of indigestion. Nausea and diarrhea are common right before labor or in its early stages.


Some women have the urge to empty their bowels from the release of prostaglandin. If stools are loose and bowel movements are frequent, this may be a sign labor is beginning.Nausea can be caused by hormonal changes that upset the stomach. You may have no appetite and feel sick in response to certain smells and foods., In the days leading up to labor, you may feel a sudden burst of energy. This energy spike is often coupled with the desire to begin preparing your home for a baby. You may want to make meals, set up the crib, and arrange the baby's outfits. This is known as the nesting phase. While there is no scientific basis for its occurrence, many women experience the urge to nest just before labor., Some aspects of labor are abnormal and may be a sign something is wrong with you or the baby. If you notice any of the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately and go to the hospital:Heavy, bloody vaginal discharge
Decreased fetal movement
Very painful contractions for over an hour that come every five to 10 minutes

"
"
Check if they’re irregular.,
Consider if you’re feeling discomfort or tightening.,
Notice if they’re in your lower abdomen rather than your lower back.,
Time the contractions.,
Try to feel your baby’s movement.,
Change your position to see if they stop.",How to Recognize Contractions2," Notice the gaps in between your contractions to see if they vary in length. Braxton Hicks contractions will be inconsistent and will ebb and flow, while real labor contractions will steadily build.For example, you may notice that you’re having pains every few minutes for half an hour, but then the pain stops for an hour.
Alternatively, you may realize that the pain is happening at odd intervals, such as every minute for a few minutes, but then every five minutes for the next half hour.

, Most women describe Braxton Hicks contractions as uncomfortable but not that painful. Braxton Hicks contractions also feel like you’re experiencing a tightening in your abdomen., Real labor pains will radiate from your back, while Braxton Hicks contractions are mostly located in your lower abdomen.The discomfort or tightening of a Braxton Hicks contraction will begin in the top of the abdomen and move down into your lower abdomen., Use a timer, clock, or watch that shows seconds to find out how long your pain is lasting. Braxton Hicks contractions normally last for about 15-30 seconds.If your pains are shorter, then they are unlikely to be real labor pains or Braxton Hicks contractions. Call your doctor if the pain persists.
If your pains last longer, then you may be having labor contractions.

, If you can feel your baby moving around, then the discomfort is probably Braxton Hicks contractions. The movement of the baby can cause the discomfort, and you shouldn’t feel your baby during labor contractions., Shift to a more comfortable position, then rest for 15-30 minutes. If your pain stops, then it was likely Braxton Hicks contractions. Braxton Hicks can be caused by certain positions and can be alleviated by resting in a better position. Real labor contractions, however, cannot be relieved by changing positions."
"
Look for pain shooting up and down your sides.,
Check if the pain is caused by movement.,
Time the duration of your pain.",How to Recognize Contractions3," Round ligament pain is caused by your muscles stretching due to the baby’s growth. As your muscles stretch, the pain will shoot down your sides and into your groin. Since you’re feeling pains through your stomach and pelvis, you may think that you’re in labor; however, these muscle pains are in the wrong area., Round ligament pain will occur when you change positions, cough, sneeze, or use the bathroom. Pay attention to when you’re feeling the pain to see if it could be caused by your stretching muscles. It will help to rest for several minutes to see if the pain subsides.When you feel pain shooting down your sides, sit or lay down in a comfortable position. Take a few calming breaths, but don’t inhale too deeply because it might cause your muscles to spasm again.
If the pain goes away, then it is likely round ligament pain.
If the pain does not go away or happens frequently, call your healthcare provider.

, Round ligament pain can last for a few seconds or minutes, but it’s usually not recurring. Use a timer to track how long the pain is lasting.Remember that labor contractions usually last from 30-70 seconds, so short bursts of pain are likely not contractions.
If your pains are sharp and happen at irregular intervals, they are probably not contractions.

Decide who you want to help with your delivery.,
Find a birth coach.,
Look for a doula.,
Ask others about natural childbirth.",How to Prepare Yourself for Natural Childbirth1," Before you give birth, you need to decide who you want to help you with the delivery. You can choose a physician that specializes in births, called an obstetrician, a family medicine doctor, or you can choose a midwife. All are professionals who have experience with childbirth. Make sure you choose an obstetrician, physician, or midwife who is comfortable with natural childbirth and who will listen to your wishes.


Set up interviews to talk to of few of each to determine who seems like your best choice. Ask about his or her experience, by whom he or she is certified, and what he or she would do under emergency circumstances.
Midwives often have professional relationships with hospitals and with obstetricians, so the majority of them are safe and will have your best interest in mind. If a midwife decides that either you or your baby would be better served in a hospital setting, she will let you know. If you are looking for a midwife, try the online database run by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.;
, You also need to find a birth coach. Often times this will be your partner, husband, or wife, but it can be a friend or relative such as your mom or your sister. Make sure whomever you choose makes you comfortable and will be able to support you during the hard road to childbirth.


You may also want to make sure the birthing coach has the same views about your natural child birth as possible., In addition to a birthing coach, or instead of, look into finding a doula, a labor and delivery coach that will stay with you before, during, and directly after the delivery. To find the right doula for you, ask your obstetrician, midwife, local birthing center representatives, friends, family, or other expectant mothers for recommendations. Once you find a few recommendations, meet with each of the doulas, see if she or he meets your criteria for a labor coach, and make sure you get along.


You can also find a doula through an international search on the DONA International website, the oldest association of doulas in the world., To understand more about what will happen during natural childbirth, do some research. Talk to new moms, check out pregnancy support groups, and talk to birthing educators. This will help quiet your fears and give you vital resources to turn to when you have questions about your delivery as it approaches.


The people you talk to may also have recommendations of good doctors or midwives who are experienced in natural childbirth."

Add counseling.",How to Recognize and Treat Postpartum Psychosis," Women who develop postpartum psychosis often see or hear things that are not really there. These hallucinations may be frightening, upsetting, or disorienting. They may come and go, or they may persist. Hallucinations are one of the major signs that distinguishes postpartum psychosis from postpartum depression, and it requires immediate medical intervention.;
, Confusion also distinguishes postpartum psychosis from postpartum depression. Even healthy new mothers may seem exhausted and mentally foggy, but these symptoms should not evolve into true confusion or bewilderment. A woman with postpartum psychosis may seem puzzled by what’s going on around her unable to understand what others are saying to her.

, Along with hallucinations and confusion, delusions – strange but strongly held beliefs that a rational person would know to be false – are one of the chief symptoms that distinguishes postpartum psychosis from postpartum depression. Delusions also require immediate medical treatment. They may not cause a woman to hurt herself or someone else, but in some cases, they do lead to violence.


These delusions, perhaps in combination with hallucinations, may make a woman paranoid or suspicious. Someone with postpartum psychosis may think her friends and family members are lying to her or trying to hurt her; she may feel that she is being watched or followed.

, Mood swings are a common symptom for women with postpartum depression and anxiety, and they also play a role in postpartum psychosis. Women who develop postpartum psychosis tend to move quickly from one emotional state to another; they may suddenly find themselves overwhelmingly sad, distressed, irritated, or angry, and they may or may not be able to pinpoint any reason for the abrupt shift in mood.

, Difficulty sleeping is also characteristic of all the postpartum psychiatric conditions, but it may be especially pronounced in women with postpartum psychosis. They may develop persistent insomnia, or they may feel that they do not need to sleep at all.


This symptom can be especially difficult to detect because most new mothers, even perfectly healthy ones, struggle with sleep. Newborns do not sleep reliably, and they must eat frequently, which can disrupt their mothers’ sleeping patterns. For women with postpartum psychosis, though, difficulties with sleep persist even when they are given the opportunity to rest (as when a spouse, partner, friend, or relative agrees to care for the baby temporarily).

, Postpartum psychosis can make a woman seem manic, agitated, or unusually energetic. She may not be able to sit still or calm down.

, Women with postpartum psychosis sometimes articulate the sense that they are “going crazy” or “losing their minds.” Do not dismiss these feelings; get help.

, Technically, postpartum psychosis can develop at up to six months postpartum, but almost all cases occur during the first four weeks. If you are a new mother yourself, or if your wife or partner recently gave birth, pay particular attention to mental and psychological symptoms during this early period.

, Women with a history of bipolar disorder have a much higher incidence of postpartum psychosis, as do women who have had postpartum psychosis before. Family history may also play a role: if a new mother has a family history of mental illness, her risk of developing postpartum psychosis increases. Be particularly vigilant in these cases.


Note, however, that half of all women who develop postpartum psychosis have none of these risk factors. The disorder sometimes occurs for no discernible reason at all.

, If you think you may have postpartum psychosis, see your doctor or go to an emergency room or urgent care center right away. If someone close to you is showing signs of postpartum psychosis, do everything in your power to get that person treatment – she may be too disoriented or unstable to recognize that she needs help on her own.

, The doctor should ask for a complete medical history and a detailed description of any symptoms. Provide as much information as you can, and be honest – do not attempt to conceal the severity of your symptoms or act like you are okay when you are not.


Note that if the person getting evaluated for postpartum psychosis is not you but rather your wife, partner, or friend, you may need to provide some or all of this information yourself. She may not be in a position to speak rationally or to give a detailed account of her symptoms.

, Some of the symptoms of postpartum psychosis can occasionally be caused by underlying medical conditions: a serious infection, a very high fever, or a neurological problem, for example. A doctor should evaluate symptoms and perform tests, usually including basic blood work, to rule out potential medical issues.

, Many women develop postpartum depression after the birth of a baby, and their symptoms can be very debilitating. Some of these symptoms – especially mood swings, extreme sadness, and sleep disturbances – are also indicative of postpartum psychosis. A good doctor will distinguish between these conditions by looking for evidence of psychotic episodes: hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, mania, and the like.

, Knowing exactly what’s going on is the first step to treating the condition and recovering completely. If the doctor rules out underlying medical causes and notes a psychotic component to the mental disturbance, he or she may diagnose you (or your wife or partner) with postpartum psychosis.

, A woman with postpartum psychosis may insist that she needs to be at home, caring for her baby, but this condition requires that you follow medical advice. Doing otherwise poses a threat to both mother and baby.

, Many women with postpartum psychosis need to be hospitalized so that medical staff can monitor them until they stabilize. Entering a hospital – especially a psychiatric hospital, as frequently necessary – can be upsetting, especially for new mothers, who may insist that they need to be at home. But this step is often necessary for effective treatment.


If your wife, partner, or loved one must be hospitalized with postpartum psychosis, try to assure her that hospitalization is temporary and that full-time, effective treatment will help her get home to her baby as quickly as possible. Do everything in your power to convince her that she is doing the right thing for herself and for her newborn.

, Women with postpartum psychosis are typically prescribed some combination of antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers. When taken as directed, these drugs are generally quite effective.


These drugs may or may not be safe to take when breastfeeding, so talk to your doctor and weigh the risks and benefits of particular medications. Remember that treating the postpartum psychosis should be the primary concern, followed by continuation of breastfeeding.

, Some women benefit from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This is a modern form of shock therapy that is sometimes effective in treating psychotic episodes.

, Postpartum psychosis is a medical condition, and it demands medical treatment. In addition, though, talk therapy may be beneficial, especially the disorder begins to recede. A counselor can help you (or your wife, partner, or loved one) deal with the symptoms of postpartum psychosis and the trauma that the condition can inflict. Moving forward, a counselor can also help you deal with any feelings of doubt or guilt about motherhood, which many women experience after postpartum depression, anxiety, or psychosis.

Talk to your husband about childbirth.,
Discuss your expectations for childbirth.,
Respect your husbands feelings - especially if the thought of childbirth makes him uncomfortable..",How to Prepare Your Husband for Childbirth,"


Ask your primary care physician to recommend educational books, videos, or even library books to prepare for childbirth. You can also ask the childbirth teacher which educational materials about pregnancy and childbirth they recommend. As you choose which resources you'll use to educate yourself, share them with your husband.
Insist to your husband that he attend childbirth classes with you. These classes play a key role in understanding what will happen to your body before, during, and after childbirth, and can provide both of you with valuable information and the confidence that you'll know what to do during labor. It will also help your partner understand that your reactions may change during labor and that that's only natural.
Watch at least one birth video together - preferably one that has been recommended by your primary care physician, obstetrician or teacher at your pregnancy classes. Though many husbands resist the idea of watching a recording of a birth, it can demonstrate exactly what to expect of childbirth and emphasize how the birth partner can help relieve the mother's stress and pain.;
, It's important to communicate how each of you feels about childbirth. If you want a natural birth and your husband thinks it's an unsafe and scary option, you should be able to talk about it and resolve the issue so both of you feel good about how your baby is delivered.


Have your husband speak to your primary care doctor about your pregnancy and childbirth. This way, he's free to ask any questions and express any concerns he has and can get an expert answer.
Make your birth plan together with your husband. That way, you can finalize your preferences for your baby's birth together and you are both prepared when you go into labor.
When making your birthing plans, discuss alternative actions in the event something doesn't happen according to plan. Though this may be a difficult topic, you need to be honest with each other about possible emergencies and/or medical complications that may make you have to schedule a cesarean section.

,


Your husband may feel uncertain and scared about labor, as it's never comforting to watch a loved one in pain. Many men try to fulfill a problem-solving role in a relationship, but during labor this isn't always possible. Assure him that it's okay if he can't immediately take action to relieve your pain, and understand his frustrations.
If your husband doesn't feel comfortable being at the foot of the bed, or even in the delivery room, you should respect that. Only require that he witness the birth to the degree that's comfortable for him. If he gets stressed or even sick, it won't alleviate any of your pain and discomfort during labor. Allow him to remain in a role where he can function properly and still be of comfort and support to you.
If your husband can't or won't provide the support you need during pregnancy and while you're in labor, discuss alternative options. You can get a doula, somebody who provides non-medical support during birth, or ask a friend or family member help you instead.

",How to Prepare for Childbirth," The first stage is when the cervix readies for the delivery of your child. The second stage is the actual delivery of the child and the third stage is when the placenta is delivered.

First stage: Early labor starts at 0 centimeters (0.0 in) dilation and ends at 3 centimeters (1.2 in). This is when the cervix softens and thins out. This is also called effacing or effacement. Contractions will probably be mild and last 30 seconds. Active labor, also known as the transition phase, is when the cervix continues to open in preparation for delivering the baby during the second stage of labor. The cervix dilation is at 10 centimeters (3.9 in) at the end of active labor. During active labor the contractions may last up to 60 seconds. Active labor usually lasts 8 hours for first time mothers.



 


Second stage: The cervix is fully effaced and the baby is delivered. During this stage the woman will feel the need to push. The baby will move downward usually making a few steps forward and then moving back during this process. Eventually a small portion of the baby's scalp will be seen. During the final stage the woman may feel extreme pressure and an urge to bear down. The baby's head will crown and leading to the rest of the delivery.






Third stage: The placenta is delivered during this stage. Any suturing will be done after the placenta is delivered.





;
, An Apgar score is usually done at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth. The Apgar score rates the newborn's status based on skin color, pulse, reflexes, muscle tone and breathing.

,,, The class will teach you breathing exercises and other techniques to manage the stages of childbirth.

,, This plan will let your medical caregivers know the desired birthing process you would like to have.

, This may include tennis balls, a rolling pin, comfy socks and any other allowed comfort items allowed by your medical provider.

, Be sure to include a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, sanitary supplies, hairbrush and comb. Include a comfortable robe, comfortable clothes to wear home and a nursing bra, if you plan to breastfeed.

, Be sure to include a receiving blanket to help cover up baby if it's chilly outside.

, Make sure the infant car seat is installed correctly in the vehicle before the big event.

, When the day arrives you will be able to breeze through admissions and straight back to labor and delivery.

Find birthing classes.,
Practice your techniques.,
Learn pain management techniques.",How to Prepare Yourself for Natural Childbirth2," As you prepare for natural childbirth, you need to look for birthing classes that will teach you ways to deal with the pain and discomfort you may be facing. Your obstetrician, midwife, or doula can help you find the best classes. There are many different kinds you can try.


Lamaze classes have been helping women through natural childbirth for many decades. Lamaze uses breathing, relaxation, and focusing techniques to aid in childbirth.The Alexander technique teaches coping methods for the pain and discomfort associated with labor using methods of flexibility, balance, coordination, and movement.HypnoBirthing takes both the physical and psychological aspects of birthing and pays special attention to relaxation, breathing techniques, meditative practices, visualization, exercise, and nutrition/The Bradley method emphasizes involvement of the whole family and teaches various techniques to improve the delivery experience including breathing and relaxation.Acupuncture and acupressure can help reduce the pain and discomfort during labor and delivery.Birthing from Within is a method that regards childbirth as a something experienced by all women and sees it as a transformational process incorporating physical, mental, emotional and spiritual components.Prenatal yoga helps you increase the strength, flexibility, and endurance of the muscles you will use during childbirth and also reduces your risk of preterm labor and pregnancy-induced hypertension., Practice the breathing techniques and the relaxation techniques taught at your birthing class. Work with your coach and your doula so that you are very familiar and very comfortable with these techniques and know how to use them when the time comes.


Make sure you practice with your birthing coach. This will ensure that your coach is also comfortable and familiar with his or her role in the birthing process., Since you will be having your baby without medical intervention, you should learn about alternative pain management techniques not related to birthing classes. These additional methods include:


Water birthing, a technique that is supposed to put less stress on the mother and child.Or taking a warm bath during early labor.
Applying a warm or cold compress or hot water bottle on areas of discomfort.
Changing position, walking around, or sitting on an exercise ball to relieve the tension.
Massages, especially to the feet and back.
Listening to music.
Visualizing the contractions before they happen to prepare yourself for the pain.
Imagining yourself somewhere else without pain during the labor."
"
Start with an outline.,
Pick where you want to deliver.,
Choose how you want to deliver.,
Understand possible complications.",How to Prepare Yourself for Natural Childbirth3," As you start your birthing plan, you need to have a general outline of what you want to do. Your birth plan should outline what you want to have happen around the time you give birth. This will help you keep track and will also help your obstetrician or midwife and your birth coach to provide you with the experience you want., There are three options to where you can give birth. You can give birth at home, to ensure that you have a natural birth. You can also choose a birthing center. Your home or a birthing center will likely provide more family-centered experiences, and you may have more freedom in creating the natural birthing experience you want. The third choice is a hospital, which is always the safest place in case of unexpected problems.


More and more hospitals are providing birthing centers that are comfortable and homey.
If you choose a hospital, make sure you have a clear plan that has been relayed to your obstetrician or midwife., If you want a drug-free and natural delivery, you need to let everyone know that is your plan. You may also choose to have a water birth, which is a method that occurs while in the water. It is thought that it is less stressful for a baby to leave the amniotic fluid-filled uterus into a water-filled tub.


Water isn’t always recommended. For example, it is not recommended for premature labor, breech birth, or multiple births.
Remember, labor is called labor for a reason. However, most women who have a natural birth say that the pain and discomfort is worth it, especially once they can hold their newborn baby.
Expect some pain and discomfort, but the levels vary for each new mom. Choose how you want to deliver your baby. Different options vary in different locations, so you will need to see what is available in your area. Again, talking to your obstetrician, midwife or doula can provide invaluable information., Although home births are great for natural childbirth, there are some things you need to take into consideration. There are a few reasons why medical or surgical intervention may be needed to ensure safety for both you and your baby. These may occur after all the planning for a natural birth, so you want to make sure you understand and have a back-up plan in place. Under certain circumstances, your obstetrician or midwife may need to send you for an emergency C-section or perform other interventions. These circumstances, which may happen rapidly and unexpectedly, include:If the umbilical cord is being compressed, cutting off blood flow to the baby
If the baby is not positioned correctly for delivery
If you are carrying two or more babies
If your baby is too large to pass through the birth canal (Macrosomia)
If the placenta is not positioned normally (Placenta previa or placenta accreta)
If a fetal heart rate monitor detects any sign of fetal distress
If there is a tear in the placenta, which can cause significant bleeding

Don't procrastinate!,
Consider your birthing location.,
Find out what your birthing location (if away from home) will and will not provide and allow.,
Protect certain surfaces in case your waters break.,
Pack enough for your entire hospital stay.,
Consider many factors when packing a going-home outfit for mom and baby.,
Bring your phone, camera, and any needed chargers.,
Have some cash.,
Pack paperwork.,
Bring your own gown to feel more comfortable.,
Ensure that you have plenty of socks.,
Consider bringing some kind of music.,
Bring hard candy.,
Pack your clothing:


Nightgown/pyjamas (If breastfeeding, try getting nursing pajamas or you can try nursing gowns from morph maternity for ease nursing); three nighties: Large sizes in all three so at least one will fit over your bump when you’re in labour, but more importantly, so it is easy to pull down if you decide to breastfeed.,
Bring any hygiene/beauty needs.,
Pack whatever other accessories and aids you might need.,
Bring the other parent or birthing partner's change of clothes.,
Pack their toiletries.,
Bring snacks and money for the vending machine.,
Include a few things to entertain themselves.,
Bring some maxi pads.,
Bring breastfeeding supplies.,
Bring clothes and shoes for coming home.,
Pack the supplies your baby will need.,
Bring the car seat.",How to Pack Your Bag Before Going Into Labour," This is one time when you want to be ahead of the curve. Pregnancy is full of unexpected events, and one of those may mean needing to head to the hospital before you thought. So don't wait until your thirty-sixth week––pack for any unexpected occasion, early on.


This is especially important if your pregnancy is considered high-risk (e.g. expecting multiple births). For a low-risk pregnancy, start packing around 30 to 35 weeks. If you are having a scheduled induction or C-section, pack at least two to three weeks in advance.;
, There are things you may need to take to the hospital that might not be necessary to worry about at home.

, Sometimes your birthing location has rules in place regarding what they will allow in the labour room.

, For example, to protect your car in case your water breaks while driving, sit on a towel with a bin liner beneath it. Also, use a waterproof mattress pad to protect your bed--it's very likely to happen when you're in bed. Incontinence pads (available at drug stores and retail stores) are also useful and great for use for babies.


Have plenty of towels: You may really need them if your water breaks on the way to the hospital. Pack another towel so you can have a quick wash if you want to.

, The average hospital stay for a standard delivery with no complications is two days; the minimum stay following a C-section is three days. Pack for an extra day or two depending on your situation.

, Make sure it's weather-appropriate and realistic. Those skinny jeans may be screaming for you, but don't think that you'll be runway-ready out of the delivery room. Give your body time to recover and plan your outfit accordingly. Likewise for the baby - that little sundress may be too cute to pass up, but unrealistic if it's raining out. Your best bet for baby is a ""onesie"", a set of pajamas, a hat, mittens (to prevent the baby from scratching themselves), and a blanket. Dressing the baby in layers will provide for various weather eventualities.

, This day will never happen again. Make sure to capture it, and bring what you need to keep a full battery the whole time.

, Money is necessary, but not too much. Only bring with you what you may actually need, such as a cab fare, treat money and cash for sundry items.

, If you don't bring anything else, bring yours and your partner's ID's, any pre-admission forms, insurance papers, birth plan, a list of people to call when the baby is born, etc.

, Hospital gowns are just the worst, so having your own will bring you comfort. Nothing too fancy though - it's childbirth, not a fashion show and you will probably get fluids and blood on it. Comfort over style.


Buy a gown from a thrift store or a cheap store, one you won't mind parting with if it gets too messed up.

, The labour, and especially the delivery processes, steal a lot of heat from the mother's body, and socks are essential. Don't just pack one pair, pack several. You may want to layer them.

, Calming music, audio books or a good book for someone to read to you can help pass the time. Labour is a long process and, aside from the occasional jabs of pain, largely uneventful (if you are lucky). A distraction may help you to pass the time.

, Lollipops are a laboring woman's best friend. Food is not allowed during the labor and delivery process, so if your birthing location, doctor, or midwife allow it, lollipops can help you through.


Barley sugar might be another source of energy and determined sucking during the labor.

,
Slippers, socks, bed socks (hospital floors are notoriously chilly)
Fresh underwear
One or two pairs nursing bras or you can have leak-proof nursing bras if you will be breastfeeding.
About 3-4 outfits that are loose and comfortable that you wore when you were about 6 months pregnant. Make sure the clothes won't rub your incision in case you get a C-section.

,


Toothbrush, toothpaste, travel container. Toothbrushes: One for you and one for your birth partner. Be sure to have a cover of some sort.
Soap
Deodorant
Body lotion (make sure it's not heavily scented - baby's little nose is sensitive!)
Shampoo and conditioner - trial size
Hairbrush
Hairdryer. Check with the hospital you will deliver; they may have them in each patient room.
Scrunchies, hair clips, ponytail holders – to keep hair out of your eyes while in labour!
Lip balm (your lips will get surprisingly dry)
Make-up (you will be in many photographs, so might as well look the best you can)

, Consider bringing:


A shower cap (just in case your hair gets in the way during labour)
Flip flops – to wear in the shower
Wet-wipes
Your own pillow from home, or alternatively, a pillowcase
An overnight bag for your birth partner
Water: A bottle of water during labour is essential. Take in a big bottle to fill a smaller bottle.

, Again, pack for 3-4 days. Make sure they are comfortable and warm.

, Refer to mom's toiletries above.

, Hospital food can suck, and if it's 2 A.M., it might not be open.

, Laptop, books, tablets, etc.

, The hospital will provide these, but you can bring your own if you wish. Make sure they are for postpartum bleeding, which is heavier than normal menstruation bleeding.

, If you're breastfeeding, you'll need certain supplies. These include nipple cream, like lanolin, and breast pads for leakage; the hospital will probably supply these. If you're going to use breast pump, a nursing pillow or any other feeding aids, it's best to bring them (leave in the car until the baby is born, if you like) in order to learn how to use them from the lactation and any feeding consultants available at most hospitals.

, If you already packed these in considering your hospital stay needs, you're probably covered. Bear in mind that you will probably still have a nice round baby bump, so pack maternity clothes. You won't fit non-maternity for a while yet., Most of the things you'll need the hospital will provide. Some people want to bring their own things, so pack according to your wishes.


Diaper (nappie) bag
Baby blanket
Baby clothing (2 in newborn and 0-3 month sizes)
Hats
Socks
Nail clippers or emery board for baby's nails
Warm/cool clothes for going home (if the climate is below or above average).

, The baby needs safe transport home. A hospital or birthing center will not allow the baby to go home in a car without a car seat. Make sure you either bring this with you or ask someone to bring it to the hospital on discharge day.


Fit the car seat before you go into labour as they can be really tricky to fit correctly, and they are not protective unless fitted properly. If you aren’t sure, go back to the shop and ask them to show you how to do it. Some municipal agencies (like state police) may offer car seat fittings, as well as some agencies connected with baby care and needs.

Take care of yourself and your baby as you heal at home.",How to Prepare for a Cesarean Section," Depending on your pregnancy, your doctor may recommend a C-section due to a medical issue that may affect the health of your baby. A C-section may be recommended as a preventative measure if:You have certain chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease.
You have an infection like HIV or active genital herpes.
Your baby’s health is at risk due to an illness or a congenital condition. If your baby is too large to move safely through the birth canal, your doctor may advise a C-section.
You are overweight. Being obese can cause other risk factors and may require a C-section.
Your baby is in the breech position, where she is feet-first or butt-first and cannot be turned.
You have had a C-section during a previous pregnancy.;
, An outline of the procedure should be presented so you can mentally prepare for it. In general, most C-sections follow the same steps.At the hospital, the staff will clean your abdominal area and insert a catheter into your bladder to collect any urine. You will get an IV in your arm so you can get fluid and medication before and during the procedure.
Most C-sections are done with regional anesthesia that numbs only the lower part of your body. This will mean you are awake during the procedure and will have a chance to see your baby being taken out of the womb. The anesthesia will most likely be given through a spinal block, where the medication is injected into the sac surrounding your spinal cord. If you need a C-section due to an emergency during labor, you will be given general anesthesia, and you will be completely asleep during the birth.
Your doctor will make a horizontal incision through your abdominal wall, close to your pubic hairline. If your baby needs to be delivered fast due to a medical emergency, your doctor will make a vertical incision from just below your navel to right above your pubic bone.
Your doctor will then make the uterine incision. About 95 percent of C-sections occur with a horizontal incision across the lower part of your uterus, as the muscle at the bottom your uterus is thinner, leading to less bleeding during the procedure. If your baby is in an unusual position in your uterus or in a lower area in your uterus, your doctor may make a vertical cut.
Your baby will then be delivered by being lifted out of the incision made to your uterus. Your doctor will use suction to clear your baby’s mouth and nose of amniotic fluid and then clamp and cut the umbilical cord. You may experience a tugging feeling as the doctor lifts your baby up and out of your uterus.
Your doctor will remove the placenta from your uterus, check to confirm your reproductive organs are healthy, and close the incisions with sutures. You can then meet your new baby and nurse your baby on the operating table.

, Some mothers decide to request a planned C-section. However, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that mothers and their doctors plan for a vaginal delivery unless a C-section is medically necessary. Choosing a planned C-section should be done only after you have had a serious discussion with your doctor about the procedure and understand the possible risks of the procedure.A C-section is considered major surgery and you will likely lose more blood during a C-section than in vaginal birth. The recovery time is also much longer for C-sections, about two to three days in the hospital. It is still major abdominal surgery and full healing will take six weeks. If you get a C-section, you are more susceptible to complications in future pregnancies. Your doctor will may recommend that you continue to get C-sections for any future births to prevent a uterine rupture, which occurs when your uterus rips along the scar line of your C-section surgery during vaginal birth. However, depending on where you plan to deliver and the reason for your cesarean, some are candidates to try for a vaginal birth after cesarean.
There are also risks associated with the surgery itself, as you will need to be under regional anesthesia, which can lead to an adverse reaction to the anesthesia. You are at a higher risk of developing blood clots in the veins of your legs or your pelvic organs due to a C-section, and it is possible the wound from the incision could become infected.
A C-section could lead to medical issues for your baby, including breathing issues like transient Tachypnea, where your baby breathes abnormally fast during the first few days of birth. As well, C-sections done too early, sooner than 39 weeks of pregnancy, can increase your baby’s risk of breathing problems. Your baby is also at risk for a surgical injury, where your doctor accidentally nicks your baby’s skin during the surgery.

, A planned C-section can allow you to plan for the birth, have more control over when the birth occurs and be able to have some level of predictability about your labor and delivery. Unlike emergency C-sections, planned C-sections have lower risks of complications, such as infections, and many mothers do not experience a negative reaction to anesthesia or accidental injury to their abdominal organs. As well, a C-section will prevent any damage to your pelvic floor during labor, which can lead to bowel issues.If your baby is very large, has fetal macrosomia, or if you are having twins or multiples, your doctor may recommend a C-section as the safest option for your delivery. A C-section will lower the risk of passing an infection or a virus to your baby.

, Your doctor will likely recommend certain blood tests to prepare you for your C-section. These tests will give your doctor important information, such as your blood type and your hemoglobin level, that she may use in the event you need a blood transfusion during the surgery.You should also tell your doctor if you are on any medication, in the event your medication could complicate the surgery.
Your doctor will recommend that you talk with an anesthesiologist to rule out any medical conditions that may increase your risk of complications while under anesthesia.

, Your doctor will recommend the best time for you to schedule your C-section, based on your medical needs and the medical needs of your baby. Some mothers schedule their C-sections at 39 weeks, based on their doctor’s recommendation. If you are having a healthy pregnancy, your doctor will likely suggest a date closer to your due date.Once you choose a date for your C-section, you should include the date in your birth plan and fill out any pre registration forms at the hospital in advance.

, Your doctor should discuss the protocol for the night before surgery, as you will not be allowed to eat, drink, or smoke after midnight. Avoid even a small piece of food like candy or gum and do not drink water.You should try to get a good night’s sleep before the surgery. You should take a shower before going to the hospital, but do not shave your pubic hair as this can increase your chances of an infection. The nursing staff may shave your abdominal area and/or your pubic hair at the hospital, if necessary.If you have an iron deficiency, your doctor may recommend that you increase your iron intake through iron rich foods and supplements. As a C-section is considered major surgery, you will lose blood and having high levels of iron will help your body recover., During your planning for your C-section, you should let your spouse or your support person know what to expect before, after, and during the surgery. You should specify if your spouse or support person will be present for the delivery and if he or she will stay with you and your baby after the surgery.Many hospitals allow the support person to sit next to you during the surgery and take pictures of the birth. Your doctor should allow at least one support person to be in the room with you during the delivery.

, As the anesthesia wears off, you will be given a pump that allows you to adjust the dose of the pain medication via your IV. Your doctor will encourage you to get up and walk around soon after your C-section, as this can speed up your recovery and help prevent constipation and blood clots.The nursing staff will also monitor your incision from the C-section for signs of an infection as well as how much fluid you’re drinking and how your bladder and bowels are functioning. You should start to breastfeed your baby as soon as you feel well enough to do so, as skin-on-skin contact and breastfeeding are important bonding moments between you and your baby.

, Before you leave the hospital, your doctor should outline any pain medications you can take and any preventative care you might need, such as vaccinations. Your vaccinations should be up to date to protect the health of you and your baby.Keep in mind if you are breastfeeding, you may want to avoid medications or ask your doctor for medications that are safe for you and your baby.
Your doctor should also explain the ""involution"" process in your uterus, where your uterus shrinks back to its pre-pregnancy size, called lochia. There will be heavy bleeding of bright red blood for up to six weeks. You will need to wear extra-absorbent menstrual pads, often provided by the hospital after delivery and do not wear tampons as you recover.

, It can take one to two months to recover from a C-section so take it slow at home and limit your physical activity level. Avoid lifting anything heavier than your baby and do not do any housework.Use your lochia bleeding to gauge your activity level, it will increase if you are doing too much activity. Over time the bleeding will change from pale pink or dark red to yellowish or light in color. Do not use tampons or douche until your lochia bleeding stops. Do not have sexual intercourse until your doctor says it is safe to do so.
Stay hydrated by drinking lots of water and eating a healthy, balanced diet. This will help your body heal and prevent gas and constipation. You should keep the changing station and the feeding supplies for your baby close to you so you do not have to get up often.
Be on alert for a high fever or any abdominal pain, as these can both be signs of an infection. If you start to experience these symptoms, see your doctor.

Talk to your insurance company.Oftentimes, if you know in advance that you will be staying at the hospital for a procedure like a C-section, an insurance company will demand prior notification before it will guarantee coverage.,
Recruit the necessary helpers.,
Find out about surgery room regulations.,
Know what to expect.While you have some say in the procedure regarding pain medication and the people present, when all is said and done, the basics of a C-section remain the same.,
Limit your guests.,
Don't feel guilty about guilt.,
Spend some time preparing for the birth the night before.Your body undergoes less of a transition in between pregnancy and birth when you have a C-section, and as a result, you may feel less of an emotional transition, as well.,
Talk to an anesthesiologist.,
Get tested.Your doctor may recommend a course of blood tests, urine tests, and other medical exams shortly before your scheduled C-section.,
Discuss pain management.,
Stop eating and drinking.,
Pack weeks in advance.,
Bring everything you need for you.,
Know what your baby will need.,
Consider packing a few items for your partner, as well.,
Know what not to bring.,
Check in.,
Undergo the prep work.",How to Prepare for a C Section," Call your health insurance provider as far in advance as possible for pre-approval.


When calling your insurance company, the representative should also let you know how long your stay will be approved. The average length of time for a hospital that is ""in plan"" is three to five days. Hospitals not on your insurance policy's primary list might be more expensive.;
, In particular, you should figure out who will help you with the baby and around the house after your C-section. The recovery period can last for weeks, and you'll want to know ahead of time who can help out during that period to remove that stress from you later on.


Make sure that you have caretakers for your other children and pets during your recovery period. It can also be a good idea to get helpers who can clean and cook during the first few weeks of recovery.
For that matter, you should also figure out who can care for other children or pets during your trip to the hospital.

, Even though a C-section is technically major surgery, the rules and regulations governing the procedure are often more lax than those governing other surgeries. Nonetheless, if you have any specific requests regarding what goes on in the room, place them with the hospital staff ahead of time.


Find out if your husband can be in the room with you. Nowadays, most hospitals allow the baby's father and/or the mother's partner to be in the room during the procedure as long as the mother gives consent. There are still a few hospitals and situations where stricter regulations might be followed, though, so it is a good idea to check.
If you want support from another friend, relative, doula, or midwife during the procedure, you may need to clear that person ahead of time with the hospital staff.
Consider the mood you want. While unusual, some surgeons like to operate to music and may be open to the suggestion if you pose it. Additionally, a curtain will usually block you from seeing the procedure as it's being performed, but you can request the removal of that curtain if you really want to see the entire event for yourself.
If you want to record the C-section, make sure that you find out whether or not cameras are allowed in the operating room.

,


After giving you your chosen anesthetic, you will lie down on the operating table. Nurses will insert a catheter to drain urine during and after the procedure, and a curtain will be drawn above your chest to separate you from the surgical team.
Some hospitals still insist that your arms be secured during the surgery. This is both degrading and unnecessary. And not done in many hospitals now. Find out beforehand if this is the case. You have the right to refuse this. If the hospital says no, then try another hospital. In UK hospitals this is not done at all and a women's arms are never tried down for C Sections as this is not done in the UK.
After the birth, you'll be able to see your baby before the doctor takes him or her away for all the post-birth tests and measurements. Your husband or other supporters may be asked to step out of the room as you get stitched up.
Once the anesthesia wears off, you will be given your requested pain medication and will usually be permitted to hold your newborn.

, It's only natural for loved ones to want to visit you and your newborn after the birth, but as a general guideline, you should ask most of your family and friends to hold off on visiting until a day or two after the birth. Doing so will give you time to begin recovering without added stress.

, Postpartum depression is a very real reality for most women who give birth, and C-section mothers are no exception. Many women who give birth via Cesarean experience feelings of guilt about not doing things ""the normal way,"" even if they were satisfied with the decision before their babies were born.


As with most forms of postpartum depression, any guilt you experience will likely fade away with time as your hormones balance out and the excitement of being a new mother kicks in.

, Specifically taking time the night before to acknowledge the birth in a special way can help reconnect your emotions and prepare you on a psychological level.


Anything is better than nothing. You can simply talk to your husband, family, or friends about the upcoming birth. On the other hand, you could have a small ceremony of sorts to acknowledge the birth by lighting a candle in your baby's honor or decorating the house in anticipation of the day you bring your baby home.
Some psychologists also recommend talking to your baby the night before and throughout the prep work for your C-section to keep you emotionally connected to the event.

, There are three forms of anesthesia that can be used during a C-section. Discuss the options with an anesthesiologist at the hospital to learn about each form in depth. Once you figure out which choice you want, include this information in your birth plan.


General anesthesia is sometimes used and will also be used if the Epidural does not work well or for other medical reasons.
Spinal block anesthesia is one of the most common. The medication will work within minutes, and the mother will not be able to feel anything from her waist down once it takes effect. It is given in a single dose and takes a long time to wear off.
Epidural anesthesia is also another common choice. A catheter is placed in the spinal cord and a constant flow of pain medication is pumped into your body. The medicine takes about 90 minutes to kick in, but it wears off shortly after the catheter is removed.

, These tests will reveal crucial information about your health and your baby's health, thereby allowing the doctors to prepare for any potential complications as needed.


At minimum, you should expect to take a blood test that will show your blood type and hemoglobin level. While major blood loss is very uncommon during a C-section, it can occur, and this information will allow doctors to quickly give you a blood transfusion should that happen.
Blood and urine tests may also be used to check for diabetes and other possible medical issues.
You may also go through amniocentesis if complications have prompted your doctor to schedule you for a C-section before you reach 39 weeks of pregnancy. This procedure samples the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby in the uterus and tests it to verify that your baby's lungs are fully mature.

, Without any pain medication, your recovery period can be very painful. The obstetrician will usually prescribe a pain medication that is also safe for your baby by default, but if you have additional concerns, you should bring them up in advance.


If you're breastfeeding, the doctor will make sure that the pain medication prescribed to you is safe for the baby. If you are committed to a more ""natural"" course of treatment that does not use conventional medication, though, you'll need to specifically ask your doctor for guidance.
If you don't plan on breastfeeding, the doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medication based on the amount of pain you feel.

, As with most surgeries, you will need to refrain from consuming any food or drink for a period of 8 to 12 hours before the C-section.


You should receive a reminder the day before a scheduled C-section, but just in case you don't, it's strongly recommended that you remind yourself.

, Even if you schedule your C-section for a specific day, there is still a chance that you could go into labor before your intended delivery date. As a result, you should try to have your bags packed and ready to go at least one month before your scheduled C-section., Aside from the basic necessities, you should pack your bags with belongings that can keep you comfortable during your stay. After all, you will likely remain in the hospital for several days after the birth of your baby.


Bring all the necessary paperwork. You'll need a valid picture ID, your insurance card, and any hospital paperwork issued to you in advance.
For your own benefit, it can be helpful to keep a list of people to call after the birth, as well as a cell phone (complete with its charger) or a prepaid phone card.
Pack all the necessary toiletries. This can include a toothbrush, toothpaste, lip balm, deodorant, hair brush, makeup, and hair bands. If you want your own shampoo, soap, and lotion, bring those, as well. Many hospitals will provide you with shampoos and soaps if you do not bring yours, though.
Bring your eyeglasses or contacts, if applicable.
Pack the right clothes. You'll need nursing bras and maternity underpants, at minimum, but you might also want to consider bringing your own bathrobe, nightgown, slippers, and socks to make your stay more comfortable.
Pack a comfortable, loose outfit to go home in. Make sure that any pants you pack have a waistband that will not press on your incision.
Bring along anything that might help you feel more comfortable. This includes your own pillow, favorite music, favorite reading material, and pictures of your kids or other loved ones. You might also want to bring a book on newborn care and a journal to keep track of your baby's first few days.

, Aside from your needs, you should also pack anything you know you will need to have for your newborn.


Bring a going-home outfit. Your baby will need clothes to go home in, so bring at least one outfit along, complete with socks and a soft cap. Most hospitals will provide basic clothing during your baby's stay, but you can also bring your own baby clothes for the stay, if desired.
Bring a receiving blanket. The hospital will give you blankets to use during the stay, but you might want to pack a blanket that you can wrap around your baby in the carseat when you take him or her home.
Make sure that you have a properly installed car seat. The hospital will not let you go home unless you have one.

, Hopefully your husband or whoever tags along with you for support will be able to pack without your assistance, but it doesn't hurt to make sure that a few things are in order.


Pack a camera and/or video camera, along with any batteries, chargers, or memory cards needed.
Also bring separate toiletries for your partner, along with shoes, a few changes of comfortable clothes, snacks, something to read, and money for parking and vending machines.

, Believe it or not, there is such a thing as being too prepared.


Avoid bringing jewelry, cash, or other valuables.
Leave the diapers and breast pump at home since the hospital will provide these things to you as needed during your stay.
Leave your medications at home, as well. Notify your doctor about the medications you're taking ahead of time. The hospital will provide them to you during your stay if your doctor believes that it is safe for you to continue taking them during this time.

, On the day of your scheduled C-section, go to the hospital at your scheduled time and check in at the main desk. From there, someone should guide you to the right floor and to your hospital room.


You will usually be asked to change into a hospital gown as soon as you get to your room.

, The doctors and nurses will guide you through any remaining tests and procedures they want you to follow prior to the C-section.


The first thing you can expect is a physical assessment. During this procedure, your vital signs will be checked and your medical history will be reviewed.
A nurse will likely hook you up to an IV shortly after your assessment, and your abdomen will be shaved down to the pubic hair. You may or may not be given an enema, depending on the current state of your digestive system.
You should be able to review your birth plans with nurses and anesthetists before the procedure starts. Make sure that they know all the details you've planned out, including the administration of pain medication during and after the procedure. Sign the appropriate consent forms as they come your way to move the process along.

Try a massage.,
Take a short walk.,
Change positions.,
Apply heat.",How to Manage Back Labor1," If you begin to experience pain associated with back labor, ask your partner, birthing coach, or anyone else who may be in the room with you to give you a back massage. This can help ease some of the pain associated with back labor.


Have your partner apply counter pressure to your lower back with a balled up fist. Rolling something along the back, like a tennis ball, can also help.The double hip squeeze is a massage position that many women find helpful during back labor. Lean forward and have two people apply pressure to your hips.;
, Moving during labor can help ease the pain of back labor. This could also improve fetal position, making back labor less acute. Most hospitals will let you walk in the hallways during labor, provided there are no specific complications related to your pregnancy that would make walking difficult., Shifting how you are sitting during labor can help shift fetal position and ease the pain of back labor.


If possible, try straddling a chair and leaning forward slightly. You could also kneel against a pile of pillows or, if available, a birthing ball.You can also get on your hands and knees temporarily as this eases pressure in the spine, a major contributor to the pains and discomforts of back labor.Try lying on your side instead of your back when lying down as this can help change your baby's position and ease pains of back labor., Applying heat to the back, hips, and sides can help soothe pains associated with back labor.


You can use a heating pad, as long as your hospital allows this and there is somewhere in the labor room to plug it in.You can also bring in a homemade hot compress. You can usually just apply warm water to a towel until it's damp and apply it to the area that's experiencing pain. A nurse may be able to provide a compress for you.Cold also helps ease pain. If applying heat is not working, try an ice pack or a cold, damp towel."

Walk it out!,
Swim.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat for nutrition too.,
Do positive affirmations daily.",How to Minimize Labour Pains," You need plenty of exercise throughout your pregnancy. Walking is a simple low impact/high benefit way to keep labour pains to a minimum. You are strengthening your core muscles, getting fresh air, and burning calories all in one activity. Start small and work your way up.


The National Health Association recommends walking 150 minutes a week during pregnancy.
Certified Nurse Mid-Wife Tekoa King states ""When we are in shape we tend to have shorter labour."" A shorter and easier labour could mean less pain for the overall experience.;
, Join your local fitness club or swim in a private pool. Low impact water aerobics and a few laps will strengthen core muscles, gently get your heart pumping, and get your blood circulating throughout your body. All of these elements are key for an easier and shorter labour and lessening the severity of contractions.

, Our bodies on average are around 50-60% water. You must replenish yourself as you are growing this new life in your womb. During pregnancy, your blood volume significantly increases, so drink more water than usual during your pregnancy. Water aids in circulation and is essential for every vital organ. It minimizes cramps and helps you keep your body strong.


Dehydration causes muscle cramps and exhaustion. So hydrate throughout your pregnancy. The stronger your body, the higher your level of endurance. Drinking water calms the uterus and reduces contractions., Everyone has favorite comfort foods and certain cravings during pregnancy. Add foods along with your current favorites that pack a nutritional punch. Eat calcium rich foods.


According to Elizabeth Davis, author of Heart & Hands, a Midwife's Guide to Pregnancy and Birth, calcium status greatly affects child birth pain.
Raw grass fed milk is loaded with vitamin B-6 which also aids in reducing morning sickness.
Seven healing foods that naturally reduce pain are: 1. cherries 2. ginger 3. cranberry juice 4. tumeric 5. yogurt 6. mint and 7. edamame.

, Love yourself through every area of life, and especially during this time. Research at the University of Michigan provides scientific evidence of the mind-body connection via study of the placebo effect.Positive thinking elevates your emotions. Your emotional and mental states will dictate how you navigate through the most challenging times of our life. The way your body feels and performs is directly affected by our thought patterns. Your mind and body are intimately connected. You are not just your body, you are not just your mind and you will benefit immensely from treating yourself holistically. All of you needs the love, including the thoughts you think to yourself. So affirm what you'd like to experience in this most beautiful time of your life.

Have sex.,
Try a breast massage.,
Take a walk.,
Know what doesn't work.,
Have your membranes stripped or swept.,
Take medication to soften and efface the cervix.,
Request a Foley catheter to open the cervix.,
Have your water manually broken.,
Try acupuncture.,
Know that most doctors won't induce early without a medical reason.,
Know that medically valid reasons for inductions vary.,
Be aware of potential complications.",How to Induce Labour," This is a popular recommendation from midwives, though firm research on its effectiveness is lacking. The theory is that the woman's orgasm can trigger labor, as well as prostaglandins in semen coming into contact with the vagina (so plan your activities accordingly!).


There's one caveat: Don't resort to this remedy if your water has already broken. Once the amniotic sac has ruptured, you run the risk of infection. Otherwise, you can try this method to your heart's content.;
, Nipple stimulation can release the oxytocin, which is part of the hormonal cocktail that starts contractions. Do massages for 5 minute periods throughout the day.


Breast stimulation won't start labor. But if the cervix is already ripened, it can speed it up.
Don't go overboard on this one — overstimulation can result in contractions that are too strong.

, The gravity of your upright position and the side-to-side sway of your hips when you walk helps your baby get into the birthing position. Walking can also assist in speeding up labour if you're already having contractions.


Avoid exhausting yourself. Remember, labor is a physically demanding process. Save up your energy so that you're not worn out before the real work begins.

, There are a lot of urban myths surrounding what will and won't induce labor. Here's a quick rundown of what you shouldn't try:


Castor oil, which will irritate the gastrointestinal tract. You won't go into labor, but you might feel sick to your stomach.
Spicy food. No scientific evidence supports a connection between eating spicy foods and starting contractions.
Certain herbs, like cohosh or evening primrose oil. These haven't been studied enough to safe, and herbs with compounds that imitate hormones may actually be harmful. Talk to your doctor before you attempt using any herbal supplements.

, The doctor inserts a gloved finger into your uterus, and sweeps it around the wall of the uterus, separating it from the amniotic sac. This is an outpatient procedure that can be done in your doctor's office, after which you'll go home and wait for labor to progress.


You might experience some menstrual spotting in the meantime, so don't be alarmed. Contact your doctor if the flow becomes heavier than a usual period.
This is the only labor-inducing procedure that isn't performed in a hospital. Everything else listed in this section is done under close medical supervision, with the expectation that you'll be giving birth within hours.

, If you haven't yet experienced the physical changes to your cervix that mean labor is imminent, your doctor can administer a few different medications that might do the trick. These compounds imitate the hormones that initiate labor:


Misoprostol, which can be taken orally or vaginally.
Dinoprostone, which is taken as a vaginal suppository.
Oxytocin (Pitocin), which is administered intravenously. Labor aided by oxytocin can progress even more quickly than natural labor, especially in first-time mothers. Be aware, though, that fetal distress is a risk with this medication, and might lead to a hasty C-section.

, If you'd rather not go the medication route, your doctor can physically coax the cervix to open with a balloon catheter. A small tube with an deflated balloon at the end is inserted into the cervix, and the balloon is inflated.


A balloon catheter is left in place until the cervix has dilated enough for it to fall out, usually around 3 centimeter (1.2 in).

, An amniotomy, in which the doctor gently breaks the amniotic sac with a sterile plastic hook, is usually done when the cervix is open and the baby is in place, but your water hasn't broken on its own.


Your doctor will closely monitor your baby's heart rate, and make sure you don't experience umbilical cord complications.

, Clinical trials suggest acupuncture can help induce labor naturally in some women . The risks are minimal — if acupuncture doesn't work, you're still free to try another method of induction.

, Elective inductions are rare, and most only occur after 39 weeks. Your doctor might consider it if you live so far away from a hospital that you might not be able to get help in time for a natural labor.

, The most common ones are:


Your due date passed one or two weeks ago, and your water hasn't broken. At this point, damage to the placenta is a bigger risk than inducing labor.
You have a condition that makes continuing the pregnancy dangerous, including pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, or lung disease.
Your water broke over 24 hours ago, but you haven't experienced contractions.

, Inducing labor doesn't mean you'll automatically encounter these complications, but your chances do go up. However, if you're giving birth in a hospital or birthing center, your medical team knows about these risks and will be prepared to handle them.


You're more likely to need a C-section. If you start induction and it goes nowhere, a C-section becomes more appealing (and perhaps necessary).
Your baby might have a lower heart rate. Some of the medications used to increase contractions can affect your infant's heartbeat.
You and your baby are at a higher risk of infection.
You might experience umbilical cord prolapse. That is, the umbilical cord might slip into the birth canal before the baby does, which can cause oxygen supply problems.
You're more likely to experience significant bleeding after delivery.

Make an informed decision.,
Determine your risk.,
Consult women who have had home births.",How to Plan a Home Birth1," Home births are controversial in some parts of the world. You want to be well informed on what to expect and whether this is something that you really want to do. Despite the controversy, low-risk women can generally expect to have a safe home birth with minimal risks to themselves or the baby.A home birth is a safe option if you are having a low-risk and healthy pregnancy. Families who choose home births often want to avoid hospital interventions like epidurals, continuous monitoring of the baby, or drugs to induce labor. Certified midwives — health care professionals who assist in home births — carry all the necessary tools to monitor and deliver a healthy baby.Women who choose home births often like the idea of being in the comfort of their own home, the ability to invite friends or family, and the comfort of moving around to adjust to labor pains. Birthing at home can also be more economical than a hospital birth.;
, Women in high-risk pregnancies are usually advised to avoid home births because of the likelihood of complications for themselves and the baby. Talk to your doctor or a certified midwife about whether a home birth is right for you. Make sure you get clarification from your care provider about whether or not you really are a low-risk pregnancy.


Avoid a home birth if you are diabetic, have high blood pressure, or if you have experienced any pregnancy-related complications. These may range from a past c-section to early or late delivery.
Studies show that women who are first-time mothers present a slightly higher risk of complications during home births than women who have had previous pregnancies. Consider a birthing center led by midwives if you are unsure.Though not at home, a birthing center is meant to be less intimidating than a hospital.

, In addition to the women you may know personally, there are online communities that provide information about a home birth experience.Prepare a list of questions if you are meeting a woman in person. Ask for recommendations about hospitals, health care professionals, and birthing equipment. Every birth is different, but a firsthand account may help you make a more confident decision.
Search the web for home birth stories and videos. Seeing a real birth may help you prepare for the big day.

Determine where you'd like to give birth.,
Choose your support person.,
List your planned style of delivery.,
Create a strategy for pain relief.,
Be realistic about your birth plan.",How to Plan for Common Labor Complications1," Women have many options for where they'd like to deliver. For example, you could choose a hospital, birth center, or home birth. If your doctor or midwife feels that your pregnancy and labor are at risk for complications, you may be urged to labor at the hospital. If your pregnancy is low-risk, choose a location where you'll feel the most comfortable.If you're concerned you'll have complications during labor or would like pain management, you'll probably want to deliver at a hospital.;
, Choose someone that you feel comfortable with to be there for you during labor. This could be a spouse, partner, relative, or close friend. You could also hire a doula or someone trained in labor support to be there with you. Your support person should know your preferences for labor and delivery. If complications arise, they should be useful in communicating your desires to medical staff.If you choose a relative or friend, keep in mind that they will have to be able to attend your labor with short notice.

, Even the most basic birth plan should include how you'd prefer to deliver your baby. While you can list your first choice, it's also a good idea to mention scenarios in which you'd be alright with other delivery methods. For example, if a C-section is recommended because of a labor complication, you could say you would like:A second opinion
To remain conscious
To ensure that there are no other delivery options

, Decide what pain relief you'd like during labor, so you can inform your medical staff or support person. For example, if you'd like an epidural, your health care provider can talk with you about the benefits and drawbacks of a walking or standard epidural. If you'd like to avoid medication or if your labor progresses too quickly for an epidural, you could try:Breathing techniques
Hot therapy
Hypnosis
Meditation
Massage

, Understand that your birth plan lists your preferences about how labor should go. Your birth plan is not a contract guaranteeing specific services, so try to avoid using language that's demanding. If complications come up, your health care provider may need to intervene or give medical assistance that's not listed on your birth plan.Remember that your health care provider should make an effort to respect your preferences. But if your health or the health of your baby is compromised, the health care provider may need to give a different treatment.

Use analgesic medicines.,
Ask about regional anesthesia.,
Consider drugs.",How to Manage Back Labor2," Analgesic medicines are a popular form of pain relief during pregnancy. Such medicines are usually injected into a vein or muscle to help ease pain during labor.These medicines are usually used very early during labor and are designed to help you rest to save energy for later in labor. However, you can ask your doctor about use of analgesic medicines if you're experiencing back labor and see if she has any suggestions.There is generally a low risk of complications when using analgesic medicines., Many women use regional anesthesia to treat labor pains, especially those that come in the later stages of childbirth. Ask your doctor about what options are safe for you.


There are typically three types of regional anesthesia used during labor: epidural, spinal, and a combined spinal epidural.In an epidural, a thin plastic tube is placed in the back and medicine is released when needed. The tube is left in place throughout labor and can be used to inject a stronger dose of medication if a caesarian section is necessary.Spinals are usually only used in the event of a caesarian section. A single injection to the spine is used to administer medication.In a combination of the two, the spinal injection is used but a tube remains in place in case more medication is needed.It usually takes 10 to 20 minutes before regional anesthesia works. A lot of research has been conducted on the effects of regional anesthesia on the baby and it is very safe for you and your baby.The obstetrician can also administer a pudendal nerve block, but this is usually done immediately prior to pushing and it is not as effective as epidural.

, There are a variety of pain killing medications available that are safe to use during labor.


A variety of opiates are safe for use during labor. They are usually given in the form of an injection. While they are safe to use for you and your baby, they may cause nausea and sleeplessness and a temporary depression in breathing.Nitrous oxide is an odorless, tasteless gas that is inhaled and is often used to ease pain during pregnancy in the United States."
"
Exercise before labor begins.,
Watch how you sit.,
Move around during the early stages of labor.",How to Manage Back Labor3," During the last stages of your pregnancy, a variety of exercises can be used to prevent back labor from occurring.


Try doing pelvic tilts. This is where you get on your hand and knees, curl up your back, and then straighten it out. It helps loosen ligaments and relieves back pain some experience during pregnancy. It can also help position the fetus to prevent back labor.Invest in a birth ball and spend a little time each day sitting on the ball and doing light exercises with it. You can sit on the ball and rock your pelvis from side to side , rotate your hips from side to side, or lean over the ball in a kneeling position and rock your hips.Wait until you are at 35–36 weeks to try this.

, How you sit in the months leading up to labor can have an effect on the position of your baby. Try to sit in a position that prevents your knees from being lower than your hips and avoid sitting too deeply in couches and recliners., When labor begins, try move around as much as possible. This can keep the baby from getting into a position that would lead to back labor.


Try to avoid lying on your back too much during the course of your pregnancy. This can reduce your risk of back labor when you go into labor. During labor itself, try to sit up as much as possible. If you need to lie down, try to lie on your side.Walk around the hospital during the early stages of labor and do some pelvic tilts.Try sitting backward on a chair or toilet when you need to sit."

Create a birth plan.,
Hire a midwife in your area.,
Consider hiring a doula.,
Decide who you will invite to the birth.",How to Plan a Home Birth2," A birth plan includes the logistical details of your child's birth. You will need to decide where in the house you’d like to have the baby, and what hospital you will go to in case of emergency. You also need to consider what kind of home birth you prefer. You might choose a water birth or simply use your bed. Also consider pain management. Will you take medications or use natural methods to manage the labor?Discuss your birth plan with your partner or with a trusted loved one. Your doctor can also advise you on what is needed during birth.
Though many midwives support water births, this method can present risks and is not recommended by all obstetricians., You will need to hire a reputable certified midwife or a certified nurse-midwife to attend the birth. Expect the midwife to assess you and your health before accepting you as a client. You will also need to assess whether he or she is the right midwife for you and your family.Ask the midwife important questions in the interview. Inquire about their experience delivering babies in home. Make sure you check their references before making the final decision.
Discuss the circumstances under which they would suggest a hospital transfer. Ask how the midwife would arrange for a transfer to a hospital. Will they have an ob/gyn who is prepared to accept you at the hospital?Review your birth plan with the midwife. Make sure that the midwife is comfortable with it and that they can accommodate your needs. Don't forget to inquire about postnatal care for both you and your baby.
Midwives come equipped with everything that is needed for delivery. Still, ask your midwife about the amount of extra towels, sheets, or waterproofing bedcovers you will need for the birth.

, Doulas are experts in pain management and provide physical and/or emotional support to the woman giving birth. Doulas will often do prenatal and postnatal visits in addition to attending the birth itself. You can also hire a doula to attend only the birth or assist after the birth.Like midwives, doulas go through a certification process and are trained in assisting pregnant women.
Seek referrals from other women who have worked with doulas, or consult with organizations that specialize in maternity.
Investigate the cost. Doula fees range from $500 to $3,500 depending on the service you request and the area in which you live., Make a list of loved ones that will bring you comfort during your home birth. Don’t overwhelm yourself with guests. You can have someone take pictures or video to show off later.


Avoid distractions during labor. Assign someone to be the contact person who calls everyone on your list.
Arrange for someone to take care of your other children or pets, if you have them.

Organize your birthing area.,
Create a relaxed atmosphere.,
Have healthy snacks available for you and your team.,
Pack a suitcase in case you need to go to the hospital.",How to Plan a Home Birth3," Whether you plan to give birth on your bed or in your bathtub, you will want to set up well in advance. Make sure that everything you will need is in the room and stored in an easily accessible location.


Find an ideal tub for a water birth. You can use your own bathtub or purchase a blowup pool or birthing tub. Warm water is best to help you relax during birth.Be sure to have some extra towels handy as you will likely be in and out of the water.Prepare a protective covering for your bed or carpeted area. You can a purchase plastic covering or use old sheets.

, Purchase candles, relaxing music, or whatever sensory equipment will help you feel calm. Set them up in your birthing area prior to your due date.


The use of lighting and soft music helps many women relax during labor. Ask your doula about any other pain management techniques.

, You never know how long the process will be, so it will help to have food available. Shop for appropriate food and snacks for before, during, and after labor.Healthy snacks like crackers, granola bars, fruit, and nuts are good options for you and any others attending the birth.

, In the event of an emergency, you'll need to rush to a nearby hospital. Have your identification and health insurance cards ready. You'll also need to pack personal toiletries, baby clothes, and an extra change of clothes for yourself.

Ensure you have access to medical care.,
Discuss common complications.,
Remain positive about labor.,
Be flexible about your expectations.,
Make plans for your support partner.,
Create a support network.",How to Plan for Common Labor Complications2," If you're planning on delivering at a hospital, you'll be surrounded by a trained support staff. If you're planning on a home birth or birth center birth, talk with your doula or midwife about what urgent medical services are available if a complication comes up.

For example, many birth centers are located next to a hospital. This makes transportation to the hospital for urgent treatment very easy.

, Before your due date, talk with your health care provider and support person about possible complications that could come up during labor. Ask about the likelihood of complications, how they're usually handled, and talk about how you'd like them managed.Ask your health care provider if they have a birth plan they'd like you to fill out. You can discuss your responses to ensure that you're agreed about the treatment you'll get.

, It's easy to read about complications and become fearful about labor. Remind yourself that you're prepared to give birth and you've surrounded yourself with people who know your wishes. Keep a positive mindset and realize that you and your baby will be cared for whether or not you develop complications during labor.For example, instead of saying, ""I will not get a C-section under any circumstances,"" you might say, ""I hope to avoid a C-section, but would accept one if the health of my baby is compromised.""

, It's difficult to know how your labor will actually progress. This is why it's important to be open to suggestions from your health care providers. If a complication comes up, you may be urged to try a different labor strategy.

For example, if you plan on laboring on a birthing ball, but the baby is turned differently (malpositioned), you may be told to labor on your knees in an attempt to help the baby turn.

, If complications arise, your support partner may feel like they don't know how to help you. Make it clear in your birth plan how your support partner can be there for you and your baby. For example, you might have your support partner:Stay with you during a C-section
Hold the baby if doctors are caring for you
Contact family members to discuss the labor

, Before you go into labor, talk with friends or family members about how they can help out. You'll probably have people offer to bring you meals or help out once the baby arrives. If complications arise during labor and you'd like additional support, have your support person call these people and explain what's going on.

For example, your support network could show up and provide emotional support after a difficult labor. Or you could ask them to look after your other kids if your labor is prolonged or you end up needing a C-section.

, Make sure you have all the necessary supplies to make the birthing experience as positive as possible. You can have a maternity bag or suitcase. Don't just take stuff for your wife and the baby, bring some things for yourself as well. It is best to pack much of this in advance, so that it is ready before your wife goes into labor. Have you maternity bag ready at least two weeks in advance.For Her:

Oil for massage, but be cautious with scents
A gown, slippers, and robe if she prefers them to hospital clothes
Rolling pin or camper’s ice for pressure and cold on lower back
Warm socks
Relaxing music
Personal focal point (a picture, flowers, a figurine) for her to focus on during contractions
Favorite juice or electrolyte-balanced beverage (such as Gatorade) in a cooler
Cosmetics
Toiletries
Her favorite snacks
Nursing bras
Money for incidentals
Going-home clothing (which should still be maternity clothing)


For you:

Copy of the Birth Plan
Watch with a second hand
Grooming supplies (toothbrush, breath freshener, deodorant, shaver)
Snacks and beverages (consider you wife may be very sensitive to the smell of your breath)
Change of clothes
Swimsuit so you can accompany the mother in the shower
Paper and pencil
Reading materials, or handwork, for slow times when the mother does not need your help
Phone numbers of people to call during or after labor
Camera (still or video)


For the baby:

Diapers,
Receiving blanket
Underclothing
Outerwear (hat, warm clothes)
Crib-sized blanket
Car seat


For the trip to the hospital:

Full tank of gas
Blanket and pillow in the car , By making a birth plan, your wife might feel more confident about getting to the hospital once labor begins. Sometimes feelings of anxiety can be managed by rehearsing and planning what will happen. If you've gone over it again and again, you will know exactly what to do. Women who prepared their birth plans have also been found to be less likely to have a cesarean section.Make these decisions with your wife.
Make a birth partner plan for yourself. You enable yourself then to also avoid mishaps in planning the quickest route, avoiding getting lost, and getting a feeling for the path you'll take.
Consult with your doctor while creating your birth plan. There are many pre-made plans available online, but they are of dubious quality. It's best to plan this with your doctor.

, This is the best thing you can do. More than anything, remain calm for your wife. This will help her to remain calm.

, This is your main job. You know what she wants. It may be important for you to convey her wishes in the case that she cannot., After being calm, this is the second best thing you can do. Fathers can feel the need to do something, anything, and keeping track of how many seconds pass between contractions is a vital role to play. This will not only help you to remain focused and relieve your wife, it will provide important information to your doctors., This will make it easy to recall all the things you can do to help your wife. Each of these can make a big difference in her comfort levels and the over-all positivity of the birthing experience.Take the time to memorize these helpful points.S – Support emotionally. Giving emotional support is crucial during labor. Listen actively, validate her emotions, ask questions, and reassure your wife to help her feel more comfortable.
U – Urination, at least once an hour. Remind her to go to the bathroom. This will get her moving, which can aid during these stages.
P – Position changes, often.
P – Praise and encouragement, not sympathy, is needed to help her get through this.
O – Out of bed (walk/shower) is better than laying down.
R – Relaxation is key.
T – Touch: pressure and massage.

, Delivery is way outside of most fathers' league. Depending on the means by which you choose to birth your child, the father may still be allowed to be with his wife during delivery. Ask to remain with your wife as long as you're capable.


Do not abandon your wife in the later stages of labor if you do not have to.
In some places, though not in the U.S., fathers are not allowed in the delivery room.
If the mother is having an emergency cesarean under general anesthesia, then you will need to leave the delivery room.

, Both baby blues and postpartum depression are very real. Baby-blues are fairly normal, but be careful for signs of postpartum depression. These can be signals of a serious problem that may require professional help.


Signs of baby blues:

Mood swings
Anxiety
Sadness
Irritability
Feeling overwhelmed
Crying
Reduced concentration
Appetite problems
Trouble sleeping


Signs of postpartum depression:

Depression or severe mood swings
Excessive crying
Difficulty bonding with the baby
Withdrawing from family and friends
Loss of appetite or sudden, excessive eating
Insomnia or hypersomnia (lack of sleep or excessive sleep)
Overwhelming fatigue
Intense irritability and anger
Feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt or inadequacy
Diminished ability to think clearly, concentrate or make decisions, You may want to excitedly have everyone you know over to see the baby. Just make sure that you're not over-doing it. A new baby is stressful enough, without all the added chaos from celebrations. Clean up. Shoo people home before it gets too late., Parenting is a two person (or more) job. Make sure you do your part, but don't go overboard. By becoming an equal partner in your relationship, you can make the time after labor more positive. Especially in the first few weeks after the birth, a new mom may need a lot of time to recover. She made need frequent naps, be sore, and generally fatigued.At this time, remember all the work she did in the delivery room, and help her out.


Try to be as involved with the baby as possible. The mother shouldn't be the only one getting up with the baby all night – you should also be present.

, Treat her well, but make sure you take care of yourself, too. Fathers sometimes have such a strong need to help out, they forget to take care of themselves. Make sure you are rested and content, so that you can be there for your wife. Don't burn yourself out.

Try acupuncture.,
Have sex.,
Try stimulating the nipples.",How to Induce Labor Naturally1," In Asia, acupuncture has long been a popular way to bring on labor, and its effectiveness is being studied in the U.S. In a small University of North Carolina study of women who were 39.5 to 41 weeks pregnant, 70% of those who received just three acupuncture sessions went into labor on their own, compared to 50% of those who did not receive treatment., Sex releases hormone-like substances that are similar to the medications used to induce labor. The key--be sure the man ejaculates inside the vagina; the semen is what contains prostaglandins, those hormone-like substances.Prostaglandins help the cervix to ripen (soften) and encourage it to open. Other thinking suggests that having an orgasm plays a role, because during orgasm, the hormone oxytocin is released. This hormone is also responsible for triggering labor contractions.

, Nipple stimulation also produces oxytocin, the hormone that helps trigger contractions. Try stimulating your nipples one at a time with your fingers the way a baby would when sucking. Massage them for about five minutes and then wait 15 minutes or so to see if contractions begin. If not, try again. Another option--if you are still breastfeeding a toddler, let him or her attach and see if that brings results. If contractions do get underway, stop the stimulation."

Stay fit during pregnancy.,
Monitor your weight during your pregnancy.,
Follow the food pyramid during pregnancy.,
Rest between your contractions.",How to Help Labor Progress1," Making sure your body is in top physical condition before labor begins can reduce the likelihood of a prolonged labor. Preparing your body for what's to come can make labor easier and quicker when your baby arrives. Walk or swim regularly, and incorporate a few specialized exercises.Kegels, small internal contractions of the pelvic muscles, can help your body with the pushing stage of labor and also reduce the risk of hemorrhoids in the weeks after childbirth. You can do kegels virtually anywhere. Simply contract the muscles around your vagina, as you would when holding in urine, then hold for four seconds and release. Repeat this 10 times. Three or four sets, done about three times a day, is ideal.The pelvic tilt, also known as the angry cat, can strengthen abdominal muscles and reduce back pain during pregnancy. Get on your hands and knees, keeping your arms straight without locking your elbows. Tighten your abdominal muscles when breathing in and move your buttocks below your back. Relax your back when you breathe out and repeat at your own pace. Move in time to the rhythm of your breath.Squatting helps open your pelvis, important for labor. Stand with a chair facing your back and, using the chair for support, contract abdominal muscles, lift your chest, and relax your shoulders. Lower your tailbone to the floor, as if you were going to sit down on the chair, and then rise again to the standing position.;
, Making sure your body is healthy before delivery is vital to a smooth labor. Nutrition is just as important as exercise. Each woman's body is different, so there's no one-size-fits-all guideline to how much weight you should gain.The adage that you're eating for two is false as your caloric intake does not double. However, you should increase the amount of calories you're eating as your pregnancy progresses.
In general, a woman with a BMI between 18.5 and 25.9 should gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. A woman with a BMI higher than this should only gain 15 to 25 pounds. Discuss how much weight you should gain with your doctor and know how much you should increase your caloric intake to achieve this goal.If you are pregnant with twins or multiples, you will probably need to gain more weight; discuss this with your doctor.

, Be sure you get plenty of fresh fruits and veggies. Focus on whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat breads and pastas, brown rice, and barley. Incorporating dairy will give you plenty of potassium and calcium for you and your baby.Be careful with fats. Stick to heart-healthy fats found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil.Fruits and veggies high in vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, and folate are especially good for pregnant women. Try apples, oranges, green beans, spinach, sweet potatoes, pineapple, mangoes, and squash.
Zinc is particularly important during pregnancy as its vital in cell development. Chicken, turkey, ham, shrimp, dairy products, beans, and peanut butter are all great sources of zinc.Eating fish can also be a great source of protein, but you should avoid fish that may have high mercury levels, such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and shark., When your contractions begin, stay calm so you're able to relax in between. This saves up energy for the later and more trying stages of labor.


There will be continual breaks between contractions throughout labor. Take advantage of such respites, especially during early labor when contractions themselves are gentler.If possible, sleep between contractions. Practice deep breathing and other relaxation techniques. Have reading and viewing material on-hand so there's something present to distract you and help you relax during the process."

Plan for your baby's first breath.",How to Have a Water Birth," During a water birth, a baby is delivered in a birthing pool filled with lukewarm water. Deciding on a birth plan is a highly personal choice. There are a variety of reasons women choose water births over conventional methods. Know the rationale behind water births before deciding to undergo the procedure yourself.


A baby spends nine months floating in an amniotic sac filled with fluids. Many women and doctors believe the transition from womb to world is easier on a child if they're submerged in water before being exposed to the open air.However, there is no research to support this and this is only opinion.
For many women, water births can be less painful. Women who spend time in water during labor request pain-relieving drugs roughly half as much as women who use conventional methods.Tearing of the perineum, the area between the vagina and anus, is common during birth. Warm water can soften these tissues, making them more malleable as the baby passes through. Tearing and damage may be less likely during water births.For many women, warm water can feel soothing and reduce stress during labor. Warm water has also been known to stimulate the body's release of endorphins, a feel-good hormone.Your weight is supported by water, making it easier to sit upright during delivery. This allows your pelvis to open to pass the baby during birth.;
, A water birth can be performed in a hospital setting or at home. Depending on your preference, there are special considerations for each method.


If you decide to give birth in a hospital, you need to make sure the hospital is able and willing to accommodate a water birth. Many hospitals either have policies prohibiting water births or do not have the proper resources for water births.If you want to go the hospital route, you should make sure a water birth is allowed in your chosen hospital and with your OB/GYN or midwife. You may have to switch hospitals or doctors if you're set on a water birth and your doctor cannot provide one.
The majority of water births are done at home or at birthing centers due to the inability of many hospitals to accommodate water births.As you will not be in a hospital setting, you will have to rent or borrow equipment, such as a birthing pool, yourself. You will also need to hire a doula or midwife to help you through the birthing process., Certain risk factors mean you're more likely to undergo complications during birth. A water birth, especially one outside a hospital setting, may not be viable if you have any of the following conditions.


Chronic, long term medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, herpes, and epilepsy.Mothers who are very overweight.A history of heavy bleeding during pregnancy or birth.Premature labor.Pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.Preterm labor, defined as going into labor two weeks before your due date., As stated, not all hospitals allow water births. Before you plan your water birth, make sure your hospital, doctor, midwife, and nurses understand your wishes and are willing to accommodate you.


Talk to your doctor or midwife about your desire for a water birth. They should be able to tell you straight away if this is allowed in the hospital you're giving birth in and whether they're willing to aid with a water birth. You may have to switch doctors or hospitals before you find a hospital willing to accommodate your birth plan.
Waterbirth International, an organization that advocates for the right to water births worldwide, may be able to negotiate between you and your hospital if you're having trouble getting clearance for a water birth.Waterbirth International also provides a directory online of hospitals and birthing centers that allow water births. You can search through their listings to find providers in your area.
Go in with questions. You should ask your doctor, midwife, and nurses all about water births and their professional opinions and experiences with the process. Any concerns you have about the process should be voiced with a medical professional before you settle on a birth plan., Not all hospitals provide birthing pools. Make sure you secure access to a pool before going into labor.


About half of all hospitals have birthing pools. However, even if your hospital does have a pool this does not necessarily mean you can use it. It could be in use by another patient or need to be cleaned. It's also possible the hospital might not have water birth experienced doctors or midwives on staff when you go into labor.If your hospital does not have a birthing pool ready when you go into labor, you could transfer to another hospital in your area or opt to have the baby at home.Birthing pools can also be rented or purchased. If you're bringing your own equipment into the hospital, you need approval beforehand. The hospital will need to make sure they have a room ready to accommodate your birthing pool and the ability to transport it to the hospital when you go into labor. Ideally, a pool should be rented out for 4 to 6 weeks, leaving a 2 to 3 week time period before and after your due date., As your birth progresses, certain factors may arise that mean a water birth is no longer possible. You should have an alternative birthing plan in place in the event the water birth falls through during labor.


If you need to induce labor, you may not be able to undergo a water birth. It depends on your individual circumstances and the reasons for inducing labor. The medications used to induce can sometimes cause the baby stress. The baby will need to be monitored throughout the process of labor and this is not possible during a water birth.If your baby is in the breech position, a caesarian section is needed to assure a safe delivery. A water birth will not be possible.If your blood pressure goes up, you may be asked to leave the pool.If your baby's first excrement (called meconium) is detected in the water, you may have to leave the pool to prevent meconium aspiration.If you go into preterm labor, which means going into labor more than three weeks before your due date, you will probably not be allowed to have a water birth due to the increased risk for complications for you and your baby.You should have an alternative birth plan available so, in the event of any of the above complications, you can still maintain some choice and control over your birth.

, If you're going to give birth at home, you should have a trained midwife present during your labor. A variety of directories online can help you seek out midwives in your area. If you know other mothers who underwent home or water births, you can ask them where they found their midwives.


Have a variety of questions ready to ask the midwife you choose. Ask them what experience they have with water births, what their specific training is, and what services they provide for you and your baby. Make sure you know your midwife's availability. Do they work with assistants? Will they be able to assure availability during your birth and, if not, what would happen?Know what equipment will be provided and what equipment you should be prepared to invest in yourself.Make sure your midwife knows as much about your personal and medical history as possible. Tell them about any past pregnancies, any spiritual or religious practices that are important to your birthing process, and any concerns you have regarding home births., If you're giving birth at home, you need to have a birthing tub present in your home.


Your midwife can help you in the selection process and direct you to companies that rent out or sell birthing pools.A variety of factors should be considered when you're purchasing a birthing pool. How much space do you have for the pool? What room are you giving birth in and, if it's on an upper floor, is the floor strong enough to hold the pool's weight?Some pools have filtration and heating systems that allow you to have the pool set up before labor. This might be a good investment as you can have the pool set up and ready to go. You and your birthing partner will not have to undergo the stress of filling the pool while you're in labor., When you notice the early signs of labor, you need to alert your midwife and fill up your birthing pool in preparation for delivery.


You should have a thermometer on hand to monitor the water's temperature. It should be between 99 and 100 degrees, but no more than 101. Your birthing partner or partners should be prepared to monitor water temperature throughout your labor.Have damp cloths on hand, as well as drinking water, to cool yourself off if you grow uncomfortably hot during labor.Make sure your hot water supply at home is adequate to fill the entire pool and have a plan as to where to dispose of the water after birth., As you're delivering at home rather than a hospital, you need to be extra prepared for potential complications during birth. Make sure you have a plan in effect for any emergencies.


Know how to get out of the pool safely. It can take awhile to get out of a birthing pool during labor. Your midwife should know how to assist during this situation.Have emergency contact numbers ready and do not hesitate to call 911 and request an ambulance if major complications occur.
Your midwife should have equipment to monitor the baby's heartbeat and other vital signs during labor. If they notice anything concerning they should have a plan in place, which they've gone over with you ahead of time, on how to proceed with labor.
As with a hospital birth, certain complications may arise that make a water birth impossible. You should have an alternative plan in place in the event of breech births, preterm labor, increased blood pressure, and other potential birthing issues.

, One of the supposed advantages of a water birth is that it supports your body and allows you to easily position yourself upright. This can be a more comfortable birthing position for many women as opposed to giving birth on one's back.


You will sit upright during labor and the late stages of pushing during birth. The water supports your weight and allows you to more easily maneuver your body in a comfortable position.Some evidence suggests pushing the baby out is easier in water than it is in air, and the upright position increases the opening of the pelvis during birth.Many women are concerned the upright position will cause them to accidentally release their bowels. While this can occur, it rarely causes complications and many women do not notice. A midwife or doctor can easily remove any excrement from the water., While we cannot know for sure how babies feel during birth, many advocates for water birth believe the experience is less traumatic.


The warm waters will ideally mimic the atmosphere or your uterus, easing the intensity of the baby's transition into the world.While many worry babies will inhale water, most babies will not take their first breaths until they're lifted safely out of the water. Babies are usually only at risk of breathing underwater if their head is brought to the surface before the rest of the body is born or if there was an issue with oxygen levels in the placenta during labor., A baby's first breath is one of the most stressful events of a water birth as mothers and doctors worry about a baby breathing underwater. However, with proper precautions and protocol your baby should take his first breath safely above the surface.


A baby should be brought to the surface shortly after the final push. The baby should be submerged for no more than a few minutes. Depending on your plan, either your birth partner or your midwife/doctor will bring the baby to the surface of the water.When the umbilical cord or placenta tear, the baby is no longer supplied with oxygen. Make sure your baby is above the surface of the water before this occurs."

As of 2009, however, in the United States, only about 0.72% of all births were home births.Statistics for most other developed countries are similarly low. Despite their relatively rarity in developed nations in the modern era, some mothers greatly prefer home births to hospital births. There are numerous reasons why a mother might choose a home birth over a hospital birth. However, it should be noted that some scientific studies have associated home births with a 2-3 times greater risk of complication.Though the elevated rate of complication is still not very high in absolute terms (corresponding with only several births experiencing complications per every 1,000), undecided mothers should understand that home births may be slightly more risky than hospital births. On the other hand, home births offer certain advantages that hospital births may not be able to, including:Greater freedom for the mother to move, bathe, and eat as she sees fit
A greater ability for the mother to adjust her position during labor
The comfort of familiar surroundings and faces
The ability to give birth without medical assistance (like the use of painkillers), if desired
The ability to meet religious or cultural expectations for birth
Lower overall cost, in some situations;
, In certain situations, births carry an increased risk of complication for the child, the mother, or both. In these situations, the health of the mother and child outweigh any minor advantages a home birth may offer, so the birth should be carried out in a hospital, where experienced doctors and life-saving medical technology are available. Here are situations in which an expectant mother should definitely plan to give birth in a hospital:When the mother has any chronic health condition (diabetes, epilepsy, etc.)
When the mother has undergone a C-section for a previous pregnancy
If prenatal screening has revealed any health concerns for the unborn child
If the mother has developed a pregnancy-associated health condition
If the mother uses tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs
If the mother has twins, triplets, etc. or if the child hasn't settled into a head-first position for delivery
If a birth is premature or late. In other words, don't plan a home birth before the 37th week of pregnancy or after the 41st week.

, Generally, home births are not prohibited by most state or national governments. In the UK, Australia, and Canada, home birth is legal, and, depending on the circumstances, the government may provide funding for it. However, the legal situation in the United States surrounding midwives is somewhat more complicated.


In the United States, it is legal in all 50 states to hire a certified nurse midwife (CNM).CNMs are certified nurses who usually work in hospitals - though it's rare for them to make house calls, it is legal to hire them for home births in every state. In 27 states, it is also legal to hire a direct-entry midwife or certified professional midwife (CPM).Direct-entry midwives are midwives who attained their status through self-study, apprenticeship, etc. and are not required to be a nurse or doctor. CPMs are certified by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). CPMs are not required to carry insurance and are not subject to peer review.

, It's highly recommended that you have a certified midwife or doctor accompany you for your home birth. Make plans to have the midwife or doctor come to your home well in advance - meet and discuss your birth with him or her before your labor is likely to begin, and keep his or her number on hand so you can call if your labor begins unexpectedly.


The Mayo Clinic also recommends making sure the doctor or midwife has easy access to the consultation of doctors at a nearby hospital, if possible.You may also want to consider finding or hiring a doula - someone who provides continuous physical and emotional support throughout a mother's labor.

, Giving birth is an emotionally and physically draining experience, to put it lightly. The last thing you'll want to do during labor, when you may in intense distress, is to have to make quick, important decisions about the way the birth will proceed. It's far smarter to create and review an approximate plan for your birth well before you enter labor. Try to account for every step of your delivery, from beginning to end. Even if you're not able to follow your plan exactly, having the plan will give you peace of mind. In your plan, try to answer questions like the following ones:Besides the doctor/midwife, which people, if any, do you want present for the birth?
Where do you plan to deliver? Note that, for much of your labor, you will be able to move around for comfort.
What supplies should you plan on having? Talk to your doctor - usually, you'll want lots of extra towels, sheets, pillows, and blankets, plus waterproof coverings for the bed and floor.
How will you manage the pain? Will you use medical painkillers, the Lamaze technique or another form of pain management?

, The vast majority of home births are successful and free of complication. However, as with every birth, there is always a small chance that things can go wrong which threaten the health of the child and/or mother. Because of this, it's important to be prepared to rush the mother to a hospital in the event of an emergency. Keep a full tank of gas in your car, and keep your car well-stocked with cleaning supplies, blankets, and towels. Know the quickest route to the nearest hospital - you may even want to practice driving there.

, Though you'll be able to adjust your position and even walk around for most of your labor, it's a good idea to have a place in your home set aside as the final site of childbirth. Choose a safe, comfortable spot - many mothers prefer their own bed, but it's possible to give birth on sofas or even on a soft part of the floor. Regardless of the location you choose, make sure that, by the time labor begins, it's been recently-cleaned and it's well-stocked with towels, blankets, and pillows. You'll probably also want to use a water-tight plastic sheet or covering to prevent blood stains.


In a pinch, a clean, dry shower curtain will work as a water-tight barrier to prevent stains.
Though your doctor or midwife will most likely have these things, you may also want to have sterile gauze pads and ties ready nearby for cutting the baby's cord.

, Once you've made all the necessary preparations, simply wait for your labor to begin. On average, most pregnancies usually last about 38 weeks, though healthy labor can begin within a week or two of the 38 week mark.If you enter labor before the 37th week of pregnancy or after the 41st week, proceed immediately to a hospital. Otherwise, be prepared for any of the following signs of your labor beginning:Your water breaking
Dilation of the cervix
Bloody show (the discharge of a pinkish or brownish blood-tinged mucous)
Contractions lasting 30 to 90 seconds

, The healthcare professional you have chosen for your home birth has been trained to deliver babies safely and has been certified to do so. Always listen to your doctor or midwife's advice and do your best to follow it. Some of the things s/he may advise can temporarily cause your pain to increase. However, doctors and midwives ultimately want to help you get through your labor as quickly and safely as possible, so try to follow their commands as best you can.


The rest of the advice in this section is intended merely as a rough guide - always defer to the advice of your doctor or midwife.

, Labor can be a prolonged, painful ordeal, and a certain degree of nervousness is almost inevitable. However, it's never a good idea to give in to thoughts of desperation or hopelessness. Do your best to stay as relaxed and lucid as possible. This will allow you to follow your doctor or midwife's instructions to the best of your ability, ensuring your labor is as quick and safe as possible. It's easiest to stay relaxed if you're in a comfortable position and breathing deeply.

, As previously noted, most home births occur without a hitch. However, complications are always a small possibility during childbirth. If you notice any of the following signs, proceed to a hospital immediately, as these may signify serious pregnancy complications which require the technology and expertise available at a hospital:Traces of feces appear in your amniotic fluid when your water breaks
The umbilical cord drops into your vagina before the baby does
You have vaginal bleeding not involved with your bloody show or if your bloody show contains an especially large amount of blood (normal bloody shows are pink, brown, or somewhat blood-tinged)
You don't deliver the placenta after the child is born or the placenta isn't delivered intact
Your baby isn't born head-first
Your baby appears distressed in any way
Labor does not progress into childbirth

, During the first stage of labor, your cervix dilates, thinning and widening to allow for the passage of the baby. At first, discomfort may be minimal. Over time, your contractions will gradually become more frequent and more intense. You may start to feel pain or pressure in your lower back or abdomen that increases as your cervix dilates. As your cervix dilates, your attendant should perform frequent pelvic exams to monitor its progress. When it's fully dilated with a width of about 10 centimeter (3.9 in), you're ready to enter the second phase of labor.


You may begin to feel an urge to push - your attendant will usually tell you not to do so until your cervix has dilated to 10 centimeter (3.9 in).
At this point, it is usually not too late to receive pain medication.If you have planned for this possibility and have painkillers on hand, talk to your doctor or midwife to assess whether or not they are appropriate.

, In the second stage of labor, your contractions will become more frequent and more intense. You may feel a strong urge to push - if your cervix is fully dilated, your birth attendant will give you the OK to do so. Communicate with your doctor or midwife, notifying him or her of any changes in your condition. S/he will instruct you when to push, how to breathe, and when to rest. Follow these instructions as well as you are able. This stage of labor can last up to 2 hours for first-time mothers, while in subsequent deliveries this stage can be far shorter (sometimes as short as 15 minutes).Don't be afraid to try different positions, like getting on all fours, kneeling, or squatting. Your doctor or midwife will usually want you to be in the position that is most comfortable and allows you to push most effectively.
As you push and strain, don't worry about accidentally urinating or defecating - this is extremely common and your birth attendant will expect it. Concentrate solely on pushing out the baby.

, The force of your pushing, combined with your contractions, will move your baby from the uterus into the birth canal. At this point, your attendant may be able to see the baby's head. This is called ""crowning"" - you can use a mirror to see it yourself. Don't be frustrated if, after crowning, the baby's head disappears - this is normal. Over time, the baby's position will shift down the birth canal. You'll need to push hard to get the baby's head out. As soon as this happens, your birth attendant should clear the baby's nose and mouth of any amniotic fluid and assist you in pushing the rest of the baby's body out.Breech birth (when a baby's feet come out before its head) is a medical condition that carries added risks for the baby and will most likely necessitate a trip to the hospital. Most breech births today result in C-sections.

, Congratulations - you have just had a successful home birth. Have the doctor or midwife clamp and cut the baby's umbilical cord using a sterile pair of scissors. Clean the baby by wiping him or her with clean towels, then clothing him or her and wrapping him or her in a clean, warm blanket.


After giving birth, the birth attendant may recommend initiating breast feeding.
Do not bathe the baby immediately. At birth you will notice the baby will have a whitish covering. This is normal - the covering is called a vernix. It is thought to provide protection from bacterial infections and moisturize the baby's skin.

, After the baby is born, though the worst is over, you aren't quite done. In the third and final stage of labor, you must deliver the placenta, which is the organ that nourished your baby while it was in the womb. Mild contractions (so mild, in fact, that some mothers don't notice them) separate the placenta from the uterine wall. Soon after, the placenta passes through the birth canal. This process usually takes about 5-20 minutes and, compared to delivering a baby, is a relatively minor ordeal.


If your placenta doesn't come out or doesn't come out in one piece, go to the hospital - this is a medical condition that, if ignored, can have potentially serious consequences.

, If your baby appears perfectly healthy after birth, it probably is. However, it's important to take your new son or daughter to a doctor for a medical examination within a few days of birth to make sure s/he isn't suffering from any medical conditions that can't easily be detected. Plan a visit to a pediatrician within a day or two after giving birth. Your pediatrician will examine your baby and give you care instructions.


You may also want to receive a medical examination yourself - childbirth is an intense, demanding process, and if you feel out of the ordinary in any way, it's best to have a doctor determine whether anything is wrong.

, Water birthing is exactly what it sounds like - giving birth in a pool of water. This method of birth has become more popular in recent years - some hospitals even offer birthing pools. However, some doctors don't consider it to be as safe as conventional birth. While some mothers swear by water birthing, claiming that it's more relaxing, comfortable, pain-free, and ""natural"" than normal birth methods, it does carry certain risks, including:Infection from contaminated water
Complications from the baby swallowing water
Though very rare, there is also a risk of brain damage or death from oxygen deprivation while the baby is underwater.

, Like any home birth, water births shouldn't be attempted if the baby or mother are at risk for certain complications. If any of the conditions listed in Part One apply to your pregnancy, do not attempt a water birth - instead, plan to go to a hospital. Additionally, you shouldn't attempt a water birth if you have herpes or another genital infection, as these can be transferred to the baby via water., Within the first 15 minutes of labor, have your doctor/midwife or a friend fill a small pool about a foot deep with water. Special pools designed specifically for water births are available for renting or purchase - some forms of medical insurance will cover the cost. Take your clothing off below the waist (you may choose to be completely nude if you prefer) and enter the pool.


Make sure your water is clean and no hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 37 degrees Celsius)., Some mothers prefer having their partner (spouse, etc.) in the pool with them while they give birth for emotional support and intimacy. Others prefer to have their doctor or midwife in the pool. If you plan on having your partner in the pool with you, you may want to experiment with leaning back on the partner's body for support as you push.

, Your doctor or midwife will assist you through your labor, helping you breathe, push, and rest when it's appropriate. When you start feeling the baby coming, ask your doctor/midwife or partner to reach between your legs so s/he will be able to grab the baby as soon as it comes out. You will want to have your hands free to hold on tight when pushing.


As with normal labor, you may change your position for comfort. You may, for instance, try pushing while laying or kneeling in the water.
If, at any point, you or the baby show any signs of complications (See Part Three), get out of the pool.

, As soon as the baby is out, hold it above water so that it's able to breathe. After momentarily cradling the baby, carefully get out of the pool so that your cord can be cut and the baby can be dried, clothed, and wrapped in a blanket.


In some cases, the baby will have his or her first bowel movement in the womb. In this case, get the baby's head above water and away from any contaminated water immediately, as serious infection can occur if the baby inhales or drinks any of its own feces. If you believe that this may have happened, take your baby to a hospital immediately.

Ensure that your pregnancy is proceeding normally as you approach the time for birth.,
Evaluate your baby's position prior to the birth.,
Consider your own health and wellbeing to see if you are a candidate for a home birth.Prior to proceeding with a home birth, it is important to ensure that you yourself do not have health concerns such as diabetes, high blood pressure, a seizure disorder, or other chronic health concerns that may increase the risk of the birth for you and/or your baby.,
Select a midwife or other qualified individual to guide you through the home birth.The first step in planning a safe and successful home birth is to select a qualified healthcare professional to work with.,
Select a location for the birth.Most people will choose a location in their home; the one caveat is that the location should ideally be within 15 minutes of a hospital that has 24-hour maternity care.,
Choose your support team.It is important to think about who you want to have present for your baby, in addition to the healthcare professional (normally the midwife).,
Decide how you want to manage your pain.Having a child can be a painful experience, yet women have a variety of opinions and personal preferences as to how they would ideally like to handle the pain.,
Create a birth plan.It is important to be well-prepared and to know what to expect going into a home birth.,
Understand potential emergency situations.It is important to be aware that there is a small chance that the home birth does not proceed as smoothly as expected.,
Create a backup plan.,
Receive follow-up care after the birth.Right after the birth, your midwife can help you to initiate breastfeeding with your new baby, after your baby has been examined by the person present who is qualified to examine newborns.",How to Have a Safe Home Birth," In order to be a candidate for home birth, your baby must be between 37 and 41 weeks gestation. Any earlier than 37 weeks carries additional risks, and anytime later than 41 weeks is also higher risk as the health of the placenta and the nutrient supply begin to fade.


Your baby must also have had no health concerns or abnormalities during the course of the pregnancy.
In order to qualify for a home birth, you are advised not to have multiples (that is, you are not pregnant with more than one baby at this time, as that carries a significantly higher risk of complications).
Note that, in low-risk settings where the pregnancy and time-frame of the birth are normal, studies have shown that there is very little difference between a home birth and a hospital birth in terms of creating a safe and successful outcome for your baby.;
, It is important that your baby be correctly positioned for labor and delivery. Delivery for a home birth needs to be head first, so if your baby is breech — with their feet first — this is an indication to proceed with the birth in a hospital setting.

, It is also important to rule out any pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia (which requires hospital care).


Note that a home birth is not advised if you have previously had a C-section (if you have, a hospital setting is recommended).

, Normally this is a midwife; however, it can also be a family doctor.


It is important that whomever you choose as your healthcare professional for the home birth has hospital privileges at a hospital nearby, or connections with physicians who can help should an emergency occur.It is also key that you and the midwife or family physician that you choose have compatible views on how you see the birth proceeding, the type and quantity of prenatal care that will be received, and how any emergency situations will be handled., This is because, in the small chance that an emergency should occur requiring additional hospital care, it is important to be able to get there promptly and also for the care to be accessible at any time of the day or night.


Assuming that you are having the birth at home, choose a room that feels like a good fit for you.
Consider whether or not you want a water birth, and discuss the pros and cons of this with your midwife or physician.
Ask your midwife or doula (a professional labor assistant) to bring sheets or towels to cover the bed or floor where you are having the birth.
You should also make sure you have immediate access to reliable transportation.

, Think about the role you want the father or your partner (if you have one) to play, and which other family members or friends, if any, you want to have present.


If you want additional support during the labor process, you can consider hiring a doula.
A doula is a professional labor assistant who can be there to support you throughout the entire process.
The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends having at least one person present who is trained to assess the health and wellbeing of your newborn upon birth.
You should also book a follow-up appointment with a pediatrician (a medical specialist) a few days following the birth in order for your baby to receive a complete medical check-up.

, Think about your own personal views and beliefs, and talk to your midwife or doctor about the type of pain control strategies you would like to use during your home birth.


Some women opt for no pain control. Women have been birthing naturally for decades, so it is possible to do it without medication; however, it is recommended to discuss a back-up plan with your physician, in case the pain becomes too much to handle.
Some examples of pain medications you can consider include Entonox (nitrous oxide, or ""laughing gas""), and pethidine (Demerol).Note that epidurals are not available in the home setting. An epidural is a commonly used method of pain control in the hospital setting (where anesthesia is administered directly into the spinal cord); however, the procedure must be performed by a licensed anesthesiologist (a medical specialist), so women birthing at home do not have access to it.Strategies for pain control without using medications include hypnotherapy, warm water, choosing comfortable positions, practicing relaxation strategies, using a birth ball, distracting yourself, receiving a massage, trying aromatherapy, or using heat on your tummy or back., The midwife (or physician) serving as your healthcare provider will regularly measure your temperature, your heart rate, and your blood pressure, as well as your baby's heart rate, as a means to monitor how the birth is progressing.


Make sure you have covered all the details of how you hope the birth will proceed well before you go into labor.
This includes confirming the location of the birth, who you want present as your support team, strategies to handle the pain, expected time frames and details about each stage of labor, and how any complications will be handled should they arrive (including knowing the location of the nearest hospital with 24 hour maternity care).

, Complications to plan for and to be aware of include:


Labor that fails to progress quickly enough (as labor that stops mid-way or is moving very slowly can be dangerous for your baby).
Finding meconium (feces) in the amniotic fluid — this can put your baby at higher risk of complications following birth and may be a sign that the baby is being stressed by the labor.
Any signs that your baby is otherwise in distress, such as abnormal vital signs, or any signs along the way that your baby has health concerns or abnormalities.
Problems with the placenta, such as ""placental abruption"" (when the placenta detaches from your uterus before delivery), or if the placenta is unable to be fully delivered following the birth of the baby (this poses a risk for dangerous bleeding for mother).
Problems with the umbilical cord, such as ""umbilical cord prolapse"" (where the cord drops into your vagina before the baby and can potentially compromise your baby's flow of nutrients).
Excessive vaginal bleeding.

, If any of the above complications do ensue, you will likely be advised to transfer the birthing process to the nearest hospital. Ideally, you will have chosen a location for the birth that is within close proximity of a hospital with 24-hour maternity care so that you can be transported there to receive professional help should an emergency situation arise.


The doctors may need to do an emergency c-section, or use medications to accelerate your labor if your baby's health is compromised.
It is important to prioritize the health and wellbeing of your baby in situations such as these, because failure to receive professional medical care could forever compromise your future child's quality of life.
Remember that having a healthy baby is the most important outcome of any birthing process; allow yourself to remember this if a change of plans becomes necessary and you are unable to safely proceed with a home birth.

, Assuming that your baby is doing well and that you did not need to move the birth to a hospital setting, you will be encouraged to spend time bonding with your baby (and breastfeeding) right off the bat.


Your midwife or doula may also provide you with ongoing lactation support in the initial stages as you work to establish a routine with your newborn baby.
You should bring your baby for an official medical check-up by a paediatrician within three days following the birth, to confirm that he or she has no health concerns.
You can then proceed with follow-up visits with your midwife at the designated intervals to ensure the ongoing health and wellbeing of your baby.

Consult your doctor.,
Time your ovulation.,
Do deep penetrative position.,
Let the woman orgasm first.",How to Have a Baby Boy1," The only sure-fire way to have a baby boy is to use in-vitro fertilization and gender selection. However, you may not want to rely on these procedures to have a baby boy.Before you try getting pregnant, talk to your doctor about your wishes. They may check your health to ensure you are healthy enough to get pregnant. They may also have some non-surgical tips on conceiving a baby boy. Recognize that many old wives tales or other suggestions for having a baby boy have no medical evidence to support them., Women only carry female X- chromosomes. Men have both one female X- and one male Y-chromosome. This means that the male partner determines the sex of a baby. A male Y-chromosome sperm may swim faster than the female X-chromosome, but the X-chromosomes have more endurance. Keeping track of your ovulation cycle with a calendar or app can help you have sex closest to when your body releases the egg. This might increase the likelihood of having a boy because the Y-chromosome sperm may not tire out before reaching the egg.Consider avoiding sex the week before you ovulate to increase your significant other’s sperm count. Have sex on the day you ovulate, if possible. Although not proven, it may increase your chances of conceiving a boy., Having sex in positions that deeply penetrate the woman could increase the chance of having a baby boy. This may give the male Y-chromosomes a head start on reaching the egg because they can swim faster than female X-chromosome sperm, though there is no evidence to prove this. Try any of the following are deep penetration positions:Standing up
Straddling (woman on top)
Doggy style, or from behind
Missionary with the woman's legs pulled toward her chest.

, Women’s orgasms may give Y-chromosome sperm another head start. This is because orgasms move the sperm closer to the cervix.A female orgasm may also create a more alkaline environment in the vagina, which can also increase the chances of the male Y-chromosome sperm reaching the egg first. Hinder the man’s orgasm if possible. Be aware that there is no medical evidence to prove this increases your chances of having a baby boy.Consider manual or oral stimulation before penetration. This may help a woman orgasm more quickly than the man."
"
Have acupressure treatments.,
Get clear on cohosh.,
Eat spicy food - and lots of it.,
Take evening primrose oil.,
Go for a walk.,
Consider the pros and cons of castor oil.,
Get a massage.",How to Induce Labor Naturally2," Acupressure can be used to try to establish contractions and promote cervical dilation. If your pregnancy has progressed to the point that a medical induction is ordered, a course of acupressure treatments for three days prior to the induction may help. Labor could begin spontaneously, but even if it doesn't, midwives have reported that the treatments allow women to move through the induction with little need for intervention.


Try self-applied finger pressure. Firmly press the ""webbing"" located between the the thumb and index finger for about one minute and release. Press or rub the large muscle located between the neck and the shoulder. Another pressure point to try is the area on the back above the buttocks and lower back. Finally, find the pressure point inside the leg above the ankle or the one on the outside of the ankle, just behind the bony prominence.Acupressure doesn't work for all women and some may find it uncomfortable. If this technique causes you any pain, stop immediately.

, There are two kinds of cohosh--blue and black, both of which are used by women trying to induce labor. Blue cohosh has a history of such use that it dates back hundreds of years. Black cohosh is primarily used to control symptoms of menopause. Their use gives some physicians pause, because the herb contains plant-based chemicals that may act like estrogen in the body.Take these herbs only under the supervision of a medical professional., It may bring on labor, or it may result only in indigestion. While there's no medical research to back it up, many women swear that eating spicy food (think Chicken Vindaloo, jalapeño-filled salsa or a bowl of red, hot chili) is what got their labor underway. Other foods that women report have helped them go into labor include spices like oregano and basil, hot peppers, pineapple and licorice.

, Anecdotal evidence suggests that this oil would be helpful in inducing labor because it contains substances that your body changes into prostaglandins, which soften the cervix and get it ready for labor. There is no hard evidence to back up this claim, however, and opponents of its use by pregnant women consider it to be anywhere from ineffective to downright dangerous., If your body is ready to give birth, walking can help induce labor or encourage stronger, more regular contractions once labor gets underway. Walking uses the force of gravity to pull the baby down and to put gentle pressure on the cervix, which encourages dilation. Walking also helps to move the baby into the correct position for birth. The nursing staff in the maternity ward or birthing center will likely encourage you to walk a lot to help labor progress.

, Castor oil doesn't have any impact on a woman's uterus; instead, it stimulates the bowels, which lean on the uterus. While it may be just the thing to get labor started, it may also cause severe diarrhea, which could lead to dehydration that could be dangerous for a mom-to-be.The taste of castor oil isn't pleasant, so you may want to mix it with a carbonated drink, orange juice, or warm apple juice, or to scramble it in with two or three eggs. If taken in pill form, a recommended dose is two 500 mg capsules.

, A massage is great for relaxation, and for a woman waiting to give birth, a relaxed body and the deep breathing and open diaphragm that come with it can create a feeling of safety and set the stage for labor to begin naturally."

Consult with your doctor or midwife first.,
Try walking.,
Have sex, if possible.,
Move around during labor.,
Take a warm bath.,
Eat and drink during labor.,
Avoid ""old wives' remedies.""",How to Help Labor Progress2," Even though activities such as having sex or trying an herbal supplement may seem harmless, in some cases they could cause harm to you or your baby. Before trying any natural option to help labor progress, ask your doctor or midwife. She will help you decide whether there are safe, effective options for you.


If you ever have questions, or even just feel frustrated about your pregnancy seeming to take so long, talk to your doctor or midwife. These professionals are used to the concerns and questions pregnant women have and are happy to talk with you about them.

, Walking is one of the most popular activities to help labor progress and to start labor. Gravity is the main reason walking works. The baby is drawn down towards your pelvis and this primes your cervix for labor. The swaying rhythm of walking pushes your baby's head against your cervix, simulating the release of oxytocin. This hormone can trigger contractions.Walking can also help build muscle and increase physical fitness, making labor faster and less painful.Slow, gentle walking is ideal. Do not go too far or push yourself too hard physically in the late stages of labor. An easy stroll around the block is probably adequate., Sex can be difficult in the late, late stages of pregnancy, particularly if labor has already begun. However, certain hormones released during sexual activity may speed up labor, although little evidence to support this exists.Because certain pregnancy complications can make nipple stimulation or sex unsafe for your baby, you should always discuss this option with your doctor or midwife before trying it.


Penetration can stimulate your body to release prostaglandins, a hormone that helps dilate the cervix, prepping your body for delivery. Stimulation of the breasts and nipples or orgasm can also trigger the release of oxytocin, which may trigger contractions.Remember, sex is only safe if your water has not broken yet. Once your water breaks, sex could lead to an infection that could complicate labor and delivery., Oftentimes, if your labor has been latent for a long time, walking, moving, or even switching the position you're lying in can help get things moving again.


Moving is a great way to help you cope with the pain of labor. Walking, shifting in bed, and standing up keep your body rested and refreshed and help save energy for the final pushes.Movement also wiggles the baby around, helping it move towards your pelvis and ultimately push through your birth canal., If you're giving birth at home or haven't left for the hospital yet, a warm bath may help you feel more comfortable. However, there is no evidence that a warm bath will help labor progress.Make sure the water completely covers your stomach and breasts as this will provide the most pain relief.Contractions are less painful for many women in water and often the soothing sensation of being in a tub helps women relax and rest in between contractions.Water also makes it makes it easier for you to move around and change positions. As stated, movement during labor helps it progress., The muscles surrounding your uterus need a lot of hydration and nutrition to successfully deliver an infant. Eating well in the weeks leading up to labor, and in its early stages, can help labor progress quickly.


Many doctors do not recommend eating during labor due to the risks associated with food being in the digestive track if emergency anesthesia is needed. Ask your doctor about their policies beforehand and, if eating is not allowed, have a light snack before leaving for the hospital.You may also find that a clear liquid diet, involving a warm broth or jello, is helpful. Most hospitals will allow laboring patients to consume clear liquids.
Labor is shorter when you snack during the process. Women allowed to eat during labor had labor times of 45 to 90 minutes less of those who did not. Laboring is difficult and requires fuel in the form of foods and liquids especially during the final pushes.Stick to bland but filling foods, like toasts with jam, plain pasta, applesauce, and jell-o. As for liquids, go for clear broth, water, and ice chips. These foods are easy to digest and tend not to increase nausea or stomach discomfort., Several ""natural"" ways to induce labor circulate on the internet, but none of them have significant research backing, and some can be actively harmful. It is best to avoid these and consult with your doctor or midwife about proven, safe, and effective ways to speed up labor.Castor oil. Castor oil is one of the oldest recommendations when it comes to starting labor naturally, but there is no evidence that it works, and it can make you very sick. The American Association of Family Physicians does not recommend that you use castor oil to induce labor.Herbal supplements. These commonly include evening primrose oil, black or blue cohosh, red raspberry leaves, and black haw. They do not have much evidence to support their use, and herbal remedies may interfere with other medical conditions or medications you're taking.Acupuncture. Acupuncture is not supported as an effective way to induce or progress labor."
"
Have your water broken.,
Ask your doctor about a hormone drip.,
Ripen your cervix.,
Induce labor medically.",How to Help Labor Progress3," A midwife or doctor might recommend breaking your water manually if labor is slow. It is unlikely your water would be broken during the early stages of labor, as this increases the risk of infection. If things have slowed during active labor, however, breaking your water might get the process moving.You will move your bottom to the edge of the hospital bed. Your doctor will examine you using a gloved hand. If necessary, she will use medical instruments to scratch the membrane around your baby until water flows out.The procedure is not painful but can be uncomfortable. Contractions will become much stronger and quicker after your water is broken., A hormone drip can encourage your contractions to speed up and become more effective. This will push you from latent labor to active labor.


Pitocin, an artificial form of natural hormones released during labor, will be used in your hormone drip.Your baby must be monitored more closely during this process as pitocin can cause very strong, very frequent contractions that can distress the baby.An epidural may be administered before the hormone drip is put in place. You may need pain medication due to the increased intensity of labor, although plenty of women also give natural childbirth using pitocin., The cervix can be widened in one of two ways. This speeds up the process of labor and increase the rate of contractions.


Synthetic hormones that stimulate cervix dilation can be taken orally or placed inside the vagina.The cervix can be dilated manually with balloon-shaped medical catheters, which is why this is sometimes referred to as the ""balloon method.""As with most methods of medical induction, your baby's heart rate and vital signs will be monitored more closely afterwards to assure there are no complications., Inducing labor is usually done at the recommendation of your doctor or healthcare provider. While a wait-and-see approach is usually preferable, a doctor might want to induce labor for one of the following reasons. She will discuss her reasons with you to help you make the best choice.


If you're two weeks past your due date, the doctor might be concerned about the baby getting bigger. This makes delivery more difficult and increases the risk of complications.The risk of stillbirth also doubles when you are two weeks or more past the due date.If your water breaks but contractions don't follow, your doctor may want to induce to minimize risk of infection for you and your baby.Medical conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, put you and your baby at risk for health issues. Your doctor might want to induce.Any sort of infection is grounds to induce labor.In rare cases, the placenta comes undone from the wall of the uterus. This can cause complications and if it occurs your doctor will probably want to induce.Purely elective inductions should not be performed prior to 39 weeks gestation, as there can be complications to the baby.

Thin cervical mucus with guaifenesin.,
Follow a high-alkaline or “boy” diet.,
Consume more potassium and sodium.,
Drink some coffee.,
Lift weights.,
Wear loose-fitting garments.",How to Have a Baby Boy2," Cervical mucus that is thin may be more favorable to the male Y-chromosome. Guaifenesin, which is generally found in cough syrups, can also help thin cervical mucus.Taking guaifenesin during ovulation may increase your chances of having a baby boy.Talk to your doctor before taking guaifenesin to ensure it is safe for you to use.
Check the labeling to ensure that the product only has guaifenesin and not additional ingredients for the symptoms of a cold.

, Reducing the acidity in a woman’s cervical fluid can also increase the chances of conceiving a baby boy. Eat alkaline foods such as spinach or beets in the weeks prior to ovulation to optimize your chances of having a boy.Examples of high-alkaline foods include:


Buttermilk
Coconut, olive, flax, and sesame oils
Avocado
Banana
Sour cherries
Figs
Lima and soy beans
Almonds and almond butter
Beets
Yams
Asparagus
Leafy greens
Broccoli

, There is some evidence that women who consume more potassium and sodium may be more likely to conceive boys.Increase your potassium and sodium intakes within reason in the weeks before ovulation.Foods that provide potassium and sodium include:Bananas
Breakfast cereal
Canned beansLeafy greens
Oranges and grapefruits
Sweet potatoes and winter squash
Plain yogurt
Cheese

, Caffeine may make Y-chromosome sperm more active. Have your significant other drink a cup of coffee or soda before you have sex. This may increase your chances of conceiving a boy., Weight loss may increase your risk of having a girl. Instead of doing intense cardio, reach for some weights. This can increase your muscle mass and add healthy weight, both of which may help you conceive a baby boy.Ask your doctor if you are healthy enough to lift weights. Then, meet with a certified fitness trainer to develop the best strength-training program to build muscle.

, Tight underwear or pants may affect your partner’s sperm production because they keep the scrotum too warm. Having your partner wear boxer shorts and looser pants may increase your chances of conceiving a boy."
"
Discuss your options with your doctor.,
Undergo in-vitro fertilization.,
Contemplate PGD.,
Adopt a little boy.",How to Have a Baby Boy3," Your doctor may have suggestions for increasing the likelihood of having a baby boy. Meet with them in the months or weeks prior to trying to conceive. They may suggest everything from IVF to pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)., There is evidence that woman who use in-vitro fertilization have a higher rate of conceiving baby boys. IVF can also allow the doctor to use the assisted reproduction technique of ICSI, which singles out which sperm fertilizes which IVF egg. If you really want only a baby boy, use IVF to ensure this.Recognize that IVF is a costly and invasive procedure. Many insurance companies don’t cover it. It also has relatively low success rates for pregnancy., Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD, was originally designed to identify embryonic diseases like sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis in embryos created through IVF. Some people also use it to select the sex of a baby. Using PGD to screen for sex or other physical features raises an ethical concerns, and you should talk to your doctor and partner about whether this is an option you want to try to have a baby boy.Keep in mind that you’ll have to go through IVF to do PGD. This can be time-consuming, costly, and take an emotional toll.

, If your heart is set on a baby boy but haven't been able to conceive one yourself, adoption may be the right choice for you. Not only will you fulfill your dream of having a boy, but you can also enrich the life of a little boy who may be in a foster care or other system. Be aware that adoptions can be costly, so meeting with a case manager before you decide on this option can help you better understand what to expect."

, One of the most effective ways to detect fetal distress that can occur during a VBAC is by monitoring fetal heart rate during labor. Although most hospitals and birthing centers do have this equipment, some do not.

,


The main risk associated with VBAC, though rare, is a uterine rupture. #*During a uterine rupture, the force of the contractions causes the previous cesarean scar to rupture. If this happens, it can be a life-threatening emergency for both mother and baby. For this reason, it is imperative that you give birth in a facility that can handle emergencies.

, Research the risk factor of a uterine scar rupture for that type of cut.


The types of incisions for cesareans include a low horizontal incision, a “T” or “J” shaped incision and a vertical incision.
Low horizontal incision carries the least risk of rupture, while a vertical incision is the most risky. Both “T” and “J” incisions fall somewhere in the middle.

, Not all women are candidates for a VBAC.


You are generally a good candidate if you had a horizontal uterine incision, your uterus has never ruptured, you have never had other major uterine surgery, your pelvis is large enough to pass the baby and you do not have any medical conditions that create a risk.

Know what may go wrong with a vaginal birth after cesarean.,
Understand what to expect if the uterus does rupture.,
Know some of the symptoms associated with a possible uterine scar rupture.",How to Have a Vaginal Birth After a Cesarean4," Rupture to the uterus increases the risk of hemorrhage to the mother, neurological complications for the baby and death for both. Fortunately, the chance of having a uterine rupture is extremely small, generally less than 1%.

, An immediate emergency cesarean is the course of action to be taken. A quick response is vital. The longer a rupture goes undetected the more serious complications become.

,


Watch for bleeding from the vagina, sharp pain after every contraction, abdominal tenderness, slowing down of contractions, contractions that become less intense and sharp pain at the site of prior incision. These are all symptoms of uterine rupture and should be evaluated immediately.

"
"
Understand that the decision to have a VBAC is the patient’s choice.,
Begin a wholesome care routine for yourself.,
Prepare yourself mentally for the fact that you may still need to have a cesarean.,
Acknowledge that uterine rupture is a rare event.,
Recognize that there is no way to predict a sudden uterine rupture prior to it occurring.,
Decide on a home birth only if you can ensure that there will be preparation for emergency measures.",How to Have a Vaginal Birth After a Cesarean5," Childbearing women with a history of a prior cesarean are given the option to labor for a VBAC or to schedule a repeat cesarean. Women should be informed of all of the risks involved with both procedures as well as all of the benefits before making a final decision.

,


It would be very beneficial to both you and the baby to begin eating a healthy and nourishing diet.
Keep yourself fit with daily physical activity.
Get plenty of rest.
Keep all doctor appointments to ensure good prenatal care.
Avoid stressful situations when possible.

, Unforeseen complications are a factor with any birth and may have nothing to do with your attempt at a VBAC. Umbilical or placenta problems, preeclampsia, breech positioning or unprogressive labor often require an emergency cesarean.

, To date, there have been less than 0.01% of deaths to mothers due to uterine rupture. Proper prenatal care, trained VBAC birth attendants, careful monitoring of labor and quick response to a uterine rupture usually result in mother and baby doing well. Fetal death due to either VBAC or repeat cesarean is very rare.

, It happens swiftly while laboring or delivering. Some studies have shown that fetal monitoring electronically may be helpful in detecting a uterine rupture.

, Know the directions to your nearest hospitals. Be sure the hospital is equipped to handle an emergency. Make certain that there will be emergency newborn care."

Be patient.,
Do not use herbal remedies to begin labor.,
Quell your impatience with methods that are likely to be safe (though possibly ineffective).,
Undergo a procedure to sweep the amniotic membranes.,
Have the doctor dilate your cervix.,
Have the doctor help your water break.,
Take an intravenous medication similar to oxytocin (Pitocin).,
Discuss possible medical reasons for inducing with your doctor.,
Do not elect to have an induction if it isn’t medically necessary.,
Understand when inducing isn’t an option.",How to Go Into Labor Early," Doctors say that many common techniques are actually ineffective, unsafe, or simply too unstudied.Taking long walks to stimulate labor is likely to be ineffective. In addition, if it does work, it is likely to be dangerous because it is not good for the mother to start labor in an exhausted state.The effectiveness of spicy foods is likely to be a myth. Doctors say there is no evidence that spicy foods start contractions.Castor oil has been demonstrated to be ineffective at inducing labor. And, even worse, it can give you diarrhea and dehydrate you, making for an unpleasant and risky delivery.;
, Usually they have not been scientifically tested. In addition, the quality and dosages may not be well regulated.Cohosh is an herb that has chemicals similar to estrogen. Doctors advise against using it because it has not been studied well enough to determine whether it is safe.Evening primrose oil is also not well studied and should not be used. It can also cause allergic reactions.There is no evidence that bathing in water with ginger oil will shorten the duration of labor. In addition, taking ginger orally is not recommended because of concerns that it could increase the risk of bleeding., In a few years, scientific research may have a better consensus on whether these methods are effective.


Acupuncture is a frequent technique performed on expectant mothers in parts of Asia and scientific studies are underway. The relaxing effects of the acupuncture may make for an easier birth, but it needs further study.Have sex (preferably with orgasm) and stimulate your nipples. If your partner is male, have him ejaculate inside you, as the prostaglandins in semen may help trigger uterine contractions. Sex will release oxytocin and may promote contractions, although it is unlikely to induce labor., During this procedure the doctor reaches inside your uterus and inserts a gloved finger between the wall of the uterus and the amniotic sac (pouch of water holding the baby). This separates the amniotic sac from the uterine wall and stimulates the release of prostaglandin, which helps to soften the cervix..You may experience cramping and bleeding.
This technique is most likely to be effective if your cervix has already started to dilate.

, This can be done either through medications or using mechanical methods.The doctor may give you prostaglandins either orally or directly inside your vagina to stimulate dilation. This should be done at the hospital so that your contractions and your baby’s heart rate can be monitored.
Alternatively, the doctor might use a catheter with a small balloon to dilate your cervix. The balloon is expanded while it is beyond the cervix in the uterus, and then tension is placed on the catheter. This stimulates the release of prostaglandins.

, The doctor will use a thin hook to reach inside you and puncture the amniotic sac. You will likely feel the water flow out when it breaks.This is generally only done if the cervix is starting to dilate and the baby has already turned so the head is in the birthing position.
The hospital will monitor the baby’s heart rate throughout the procedure.

, This will stimulate contractions if the labor isn’t progressing. It is most effective when the cervix has started dilating.


The doctor will monitor your progress and your baby’s heart rate.

, These include situations in which it is safer for your baby to be born, rather than stay in the womb. Common reasons include:It is two weeks after your due date and labor hasn’t started.
Your water broke, but no contractions started.
An infection in your uterus is endangering the baby’s health.
The baby isn’t growing properly.
There isn’t enough amniotic fluid around the baby.
The placenta has started to break down or detach from the uterine wall.
You have a health condition that is dangerous for you or the baby, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.

, Some women try to schedule the birth at a time that is convenient, but the risks generally outweigh the benefits of doing that. Risks include:An increased likelihood of a C-section. If the cervix isn’t dilated and ready, inducing may mean you need a C-section.
The medications used to induce might stimulate too many contractions and cut off the baby’s oxygen supply and lower its heart rate.
Labor induction increases the likelihood that the umbilical cord will go into the vagina before the baby and get compressed during birth, lowering the baby’s oxygen supply.
Induction creates a higher risk that the uterus won’t contract enough after the birth and that you will bleed too much.
There is a greater risk of rupturing your uterus or getting an infection.

, Under these circumstances, inducing labor may be too dangerous.The placenta is blocking your cervix.
The baby is in the transverse fetal position (crosswise) in the uterus.
You have an active herpes infection.
The birth canal is too small.
A prior C-section or major surgery on your uterus which may make you vulnerable to rupturing your uterus.

Write down a list of questions for your practitioner.,
Consult with your midwife or doctor.,
Be sure that your body is primed and ready for labor.,
Decide whether or not to try other methods as well.,
Make a commitment to carefully monitor your progress.",How to Do Nipple Stimulation to Induce Labor1," After you decide to consider induction, get out a piece of paper and make a list of any concerns or questions that come to mind. Look it over and identify your ‘top five’ must-ask questions for your next doctor’s visit.


For example, you might ask, “What are the possible dangers of trying nipple stimulation prior to my due date?”;
, When you see your healthcare professional talk to them about whether they think nipple stimulation is an option for you. Be sure to listen carefully to their advice. In the majority of situations, your doctor will advise you to wait until you are at least 40 weeks before trying stimulation.


You might say, ""At what point would it be a good idea to consider natural induction methods?"" Or, you could ask, ""Have you read any encouraging research about nipple stimulation?""
Remember that you can always make an additional appointment too, if you need extra time.
There are a few situations when your doctor or midwife may recommend nipple stimulation (along with other induction methods) for the good of the fetus. For example,nipple stimulation may be recommended if you are beyond 42 weeks and your placenta is being less efficient at providing nutrients, or if you have a complication, such as preeclampsia, which may be putting your baby at risk., Nipple stimulation generally works best on women who are showing the early signs of labor, such as a thinning cervix. You can ask your doctor or midwife to examine you and give you feedback about your odds of success.


Even if your doctor says it’s okay, watch your body for cues as to how to proceed. If at any point you feel uncomfortable with the process, stop and give it a rest.
For some high risk patients their bodies may feel ready, but their babies can’t necessarily withstand the stresses of induced labor. For example, nipple stimulation can cause abnormal fetal heart rates in some circumstances. If you have a high-risk pregnancy, proceed very cautiously., To boost the odds of success, question your health professional about attempting multiple induction methods simultaneously. Some non-drug induction options include: walking, sex, castor oil, herbal mixtures, and enemas.Be aware that some of these methods have tentative medical approval with a healthy pregnancy (i.e. sexual intercourse) while others (castor oil) are more frowned upon.
You can also ask your doctor about membrane stripping, which would need to be performed by your doctor or another qualified healthcare practitioner.

, Be prepared for your doctor or midwife to suggest some type of monitoring during your attempts at nipple stimulation. This may require you to hook up a fetal heartrate monitor while at your house or you may need to visit the clinic for you stimulation sessions."
"
Walk as much as possible.,
Keep your bladder empty.,
Sit on a birth ball.,
Consider nipple stimulation.,
Try sex.,
Relax.",How to Dilate Faster1," Light exercise stimulates uterine contractions, which put pressure on the cervix and encourage it to dilate. When you walk, you will also help the baby descend into the birth canal, exerting the same pressure and leading to faster dilation.


If your water breaks, your doctor or midwife may want you to stop walking. Always let your attendant know if you experience a rush of amniotic fluid from the vagina.;
, A full bladder inhibits contractions, which means less pressure on the cervix and sluggish dilation. Urinate regularly to avoid slowing down the process.

, A birth ball is an exercise ball, firm but soft and filled with air. When you sit or squat on one, your pelvic muscles relax, and your cervix dilates more quickly. For maximum comfort and efficiency, sit on the ball with your legs spread apart, and support your back against a bed or a chair.

, When you or your partner stimulate your nipples, either manually or with a breast pump, your body releases a hormone called oxytocin, which will speed up cervical dilation.

, Having an orgasm will also cause your body to release oxytocin. It will, in addition, make your uterus contract. On top of that, chemicals called prostaglandins, which are present in semen, help the cervix dilate. All of this means that for some women, sexual intercourse is the most effective (and fun!) natural way to dilate the cervix quickly.

, Tense muscles can delay the progress of labor, obstructing the baby's descent and preventing the cervix from dilating. Try to stay emotionally strong and maintain a relaxed state of mind.


If you are having trouble relaxing, try taking a warm shower, listening to music, or having someone give you a massage.

"
Place your cell phone nearby.,
Wear a shirt with soft, thin material, or remove your shirt completely.,
Begin massaging one breast.,
Repeat the process with your other breast.,
Proceed with caution if you feel contractions.",How to Do Nipple Stimulation to Induce Labor2," Contractions caused by nipple stimulation can come on fast and extremely strong for some women. It is important that you do your stimulation sessions with your partner or with your phone close by. This will make it possible for you to reach out for help if you need it during/after the process. , For stimulation to be effective, you need unfettered access to your breasts. When you are ready to begin, go somewhere private and arrange your clothing in a way that is most comfortable for you. Be aware that some women find that wearing a bra (especially one with an underwire) impacts blood flow and reduces responsiveness .

, Start by placing your areola (the dark area around your nipple) between your thumb and forefinger. Gently massage and roll your areola, slowly working your way inward toward your nipple. When you reach the nipple, you can pull on it lightly or massage it.When you are stimulating your nipples one of the goals is to mimic the actions of a baby suckling. This is one major reason why you should only massage one breast at a time. Doing more can overexcite your system. Massaging each breast in turn will hopefully result in your body releasing oxytocin as it would do if you were breastfeeding.
Another way to massage the entire breast is to place one palm over the areola and nipple while the other palm cups the outer edges of your breast. Both hands then work in tandem massaging the entire area.
It is best to switch to the other breast after your nipple has been erect for one full minute.

, It is best to wait for 2 to 4 minutes before starting the process over again with your as-yet-untouched breast. The entire breast massage should take between 15 to 20 minutes maximum. It is recommended that you repeat the massage a maximum of three times daily., Your goal is to start labor, but you don’t want to rush directly in to heavy contractions. Those can be overly taxing for both you and your baby. For that reason, if you feel a contraction, stop massaging until the contraction concludes. If you choose to continue massaging afterwards, proceed very carefully and stop completely if your contractions last in excess of one minute or if they come 3 minutes apart.If you choose to continue massaging after your contractions start, make sure that you are doing so with the guidance of a medical professional.
Be aware that it is quite possible to overstimulate the baby at this point if you are not tracking their heartbeat."

Keep an induction diary.,
Use an electric breast-pump.,
Apply lubrication.,
Apply hot compresses.,
Get your partner involved.",How to Do Nipple Stimulation to Induce Labor3," For each day, jot down a few notes about when you massaged, the duration, and if you felt any contractions. You can also log information about any other induction methods that you are trying. This can be a very helpful tool in seeing which methods work for you and which ones fall flat.You might write, “Massaged both breasts at 1pm for 15 mins total-used lotion, no contractions.”
If you prefer to operate on a schedule, you might also set a timer on your phone to alert you for your chosen massaging times.
Make sure to bring this journal with you when you visit with your doctor or midwife.

, Some women find it helpful to use an electric breastfeeding pump in addition to massaging. The pump will apply more forceful pressure to your areola and nipple area, possibly prompting contractions. Women may also find that their hands hurt during pregnancy and a pump will do the manual work for you.Experiment with the pump’s settings to find the one that is the most comfortable for you. Remember that the most pressure does not necessarily yield the best results.

, If your nipples are dry, sore, or tender, you will have a more difficult time benefiting from (or tolerating) the stimulation technique. Apply a natural lubricant, such as nipple butter or coconut oil, to your areola and nipple. Rub it in as part of the massage process. Repeat as needed., Heat is also known to stimulate your let-down reflex and the release of oxytocin. Place a hot compress on one breast at a time for five minutes each. Rotate over the course of 30 minutes to one hour. Repeat this process up to three times a day.Make sure that the compress is not too hot. It should warm your skin, not burn it. You can also purchase microwaveable heat pouches that double as bra inserts at your local maternity store.
You can also take a hot shower. Turn towards the water and direct it toward your breasts while massaging for maximum effect.

, This may seem like a lot of work, but if you get your partner involved you may be able to lighten up a bit. Show your partner the proper massage technique and the touches that you prefer and ask them to do it for you. Request that they remind you when you are due for stimulation sessions.You can also request that your partner stimulate your nipples by sucking or licking on them. This works best when combined with massage techniques.If you prefer to do the stimulating yourself, your partner can always provide verbal encouragement.

Consider medications applied directly to the cervix.,
Ask your doctor about intravenous medications.",How to Dilate Faster2," These medications, which are only used under a doctor's care, can help soften and dilate the cervix.


Misoprostol, a prostaglandin, is sometimes placed in the vagina (more rarely, it can be taken orally) to soften the cervix. This particular medication is safe and relatively inexpensive, and physicians use it frequently.
Dinoprostone is a similar prostaglandin, which can have the same effect. It can be inserted into the vagina as a suppository or squirted into the opening of the cervix.
Hyaluronidase is an enzyme made from bovine testes. When injected into the cervix, it can soften it and help it dilate. This medication is sometimes used when a patient's cervix has not begun to ripen or dilate at all.

, Oxytocin, the same hormone that your body releases during nipple stimulation or sexual intercourse, can also be delivered through an IV. This method sometimes causes extremely strong uterine contractions and other side effects, so talk to your doctor at length about the pros and cons.

"
"
Consider a foley catheter.,
Talk to your doctor about Laminaria.",How to Dilate Faster3," A foley catheter is a flexible tube with a balloon attached. When a doctor inserts the catheter into the cervix and fills it with fluid, the balloon swells, exerting continuous pressure on the cervix. In addition, the procedure separates the membranes, which results in the release of prostaglandins and faster dilation. This method is the most common way to dilate your cervix mechanically.

, Laminaria is a seaweed that, when dried, becomes hygroscopic -- that is, it attracts and retains water. When a doctor inserts Laminaria into the cervix, it absorbs water and swells, exerting additional pressure and encouraging dilation.

Don’t panic.",How to Deal with Placenta Previa," Most cases of placenta previa are diagnosed during a routine appointment. Whether you have concerns about this condition or not, regular prenatal care is one of the most important aspects of a healthy pregnancy. See your midwife or obstetrician regularly, and do not skip appointments.


Getting regular care means seeing your doctor as soon as you think you're pregnant. After that, your doctor will schedule appointments as needed.;
, In general, you should contact your doctor if you have vaginal bleeding at any point in your pregnancy; it can indicate a potential miscarriage or a number of other problems. If you have bright red bleeding (but no pain) at any point from the second trimester onward, it may also be a symptom of placenta previa.Bleeding related to placenta previa can be light or heavy, and it is not necessarily constant; it may stop and then recur.
If your bleeding is heavy, it's best to go to the emergency room instead of waiting to hear from your doctor., To confirm the presence of placenta previa, your doctor will order an ultrasound to view the location of your placenta. In some cases, you may need to undergo both an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasounds are performed by inserting a narrow transducer into your vagina.You may also need an MRI, but that test is not often done., Like bleeding, contractions before your ninth month always merit a visit to your doctor. These contractions might indicate preterm labor or other problems, or they may be a sign of placenta previa.It can be difficult to distinguish between true contractions and the normal Braxton-Hicks contractions that many women notice during pregnancy. Do not feel worried or embarrassed about checking with your doctor to be sure. Generally, the cliché that it’s better to be safe than sorry applies here.

, If your doctor diagnoses you with placenta previa, ask for the specifics. There are several different kinds, including a low-lying placenta, a partial placenta previa, and a total placenta previa.A low-lying placenta means that the placenta is attached to the lower part of your uterus but is not covering the cervix. These cases often resolve themselves before delivery; the placenta may move upward as your pregnancy advances.A partial placenta previa means that the placenta is covering part of the cervix, but not all of it. Many of these cases also resolve themselves before delivery.A total placenta previa covers the cervical opening completely, making a normal vaginal delivery unlikely. These cases are much less likely to clear up before delivery., Several factors put you more at risk for this condition. For instance, if you are over 30 or have had a pregnancy before, you are at a higher risk for this condition. Also, if you are having more than one baby or if you have scarring in your uterus, you're at higher risk for placenta previa.It's important to stop smoking while pregnant for a number of reasons, but it also increases your chance of developing this condition., One treatment for placenta previa is just to slow down some. In other words, you'll want to take some of your more strenuous activities off the table. You won't be able to do exercises or many of your normal activities.In addition, you shouldn't travel if you have this condition., If you are not experiencing heavy bleeding, your doctor may prescribe bed rest at home. The specifics may vary depending on your particular case, but in general, bed rest is just like it sounds: you’ll lie down most of the time and sit or stand only when necessary.However, bed rest can cause health risks, including Deep Vein Thrombosis, so it is less commonly recommended than it used to be.If your doctor recommends bed rest, ask her for her rationale or get a second opinion.

, Pelvic rest means that you cannot perform activities involving your vaginal area. You can't have sex, douche, or wear a tampon, for instance., If you have a low-lying placenta or a partial placenta previa, the issue may resolve itself. Some women with these mild forms of the condition find that by the time they deliver, the placenta has moved., The biggest risk to your health is the heavy bleeding that can accompany placenta previa. Occasionally, women with placenta previa experience uterine hemorrhages that could potentially be fatal. Whether you are at home or in the hospital, watch for signs of heavy bleeding.If you notice sudden heavy bleeding, it's best to go to the emergency room.

, When you have this condition, your doctor will likely limit the time she spends examining you vaginally, as that can exacerbate the condition. In addition, she will use ultrasounds to determine where the baby is over time, and your baby's heartbeat may need to be looked at more closely., While medications will not directly treat the condition, you may be given drugs to prolong the pregnancy (so you don't give birth early), as well as corticosteroids to help your baby's lungs develop if you must give birth early. You may also be given blood transfusions due to blood loss., Because this condition can become severe, you may need to go to the hospital for medical care at any given point. If you start bleeding or your bleeding becomes suddenly heavier, you need to go to the emergency room., If you are bleeding moderately to heavily, your doctor may recommend that you enter the hospital. In the hospital, you will be able to lie down most of the time with medical personnel available if any problem arises., If your bleeding cannot be controlled or if you or your baby show signs of considerable distress, your doctor may need to perform a cesarean section. This step may be necessary even if you are not yet approaching your due date.If you are not bleeding heavily and the placenta is blocking the cervix, you may be able to have a natural birth.However, about 3/4 of women who have this condition in the third trimester are not able to give birth vaginally. Doctors commonly recommend delivering a few weeks early with this condition.If you have had a prior caesarean delivery and have placenta previa, you are at higher risk for a condition called placenta accreta. This is a serious condition in which the placenta does not detach after childbirth. You will need to make sure you deliver in a hospital that is prepared for this situation, including having a well-stocked blood bank., Read up on placenta previa and cesarean section, which may be a necessary consequence of the condition. Feeling more informed may make you feel less anxious and more in control., Talk to your partner or to a trusted friend or relative about any sadness, depression, frustration, worry, or anxiety you may be feeling. It’s natural to experience these feelings when your pregnancy does not go as you anticipated, and it’s vital to get these emotions out into the open.Another option is to join an online support group. Online support groups exist for people with placenta previa and people on bed rest. Consider joining one. These groups can provide much-needed commiseration and suggestions for coping strategies., If you are stuck in bed, either at home or at the hospital, try to make the best of the situation. Be productive in ways that are compatible with bed rest: research and purchase baby supplies online, write thank you notes to people who have sent gifts, and take care of any work-related obligations that you can do from bed. But don’t forget to spend time on the things that will make you feel calmer, happier, or less bored.For instance, you could watch your favorite movies or TV shows, read a good book, play computer or video games, have phone or Skype conversations with friends and family members, challenge someone to a board or card game, or keep a journal or a blog.

, Having placenta previa is certainly not ideal, and bed rest can be a challenge. However, with proper treatment, you can expect to have a healthy baby, as most women with this condition do."

Be aware that clamping and cutting the umbilical cord are not necessary.,
Expect your doctor to perform “immediate” clamping within the first moments of your baby’s life.,
Keep in mind your doctor may do “delayed” clamping.,
Understand the benefits of delayed clamping.,
Talk to your doctor about which type of clamping you would prefer.,
Make sure you have access to the right medical supplies.,
If the cord is wrapped around your newborn’s neck, slide your finger under the cord.,
Use sterile plastic clamps or sterile woven umbilical tape to tie off the cord.,
Look for cord rings or cord banders at a medical supply store.,
Always sterilize any woven materials like silk or a shoelace before using it to tie off the cord.,
If you are using woven material, tie the knots firmly on the umbilical cord.,
If you are using clamps or tape, put the first tie about 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 inches) from the baby.,
Prepare the umbilical cord by swabbing between the clamps or ties with antibacterial solution.,
Use a sterile, sharp blade such as a scalpel or a strong pair of scissors.,
Grasp the cord with a piece of gauze.,
Cut cleanly between the ties or clamps.,
Bath the baby within the first six hours of life.,
Wash your hands with soap and water before and after caring for the stump.,
Avoid touching the cord stump or exposing it to unclean substances.,
Treat the cord stump with an antiseptic.,
Apply the antiseptic daily or with diaper changes for at least 3 days.,
Be aware of your option as a parent to collect and store your baby’s cord blood.,
Keep in mind you can still collect your baby’s cord blood even if you use delayed clamping.",How to Cut the Umbilical Cord of a Baby," In fact, some new parents decide to leave the umbilical cord and placenta attached to their baby’s navel until it falls off naturally.


Keeping the umbilical cord on until it falls off naturally can be cumbersome, though. Most parents have the cord cut shortly after birth; they don’t feel comfortable with the idea of carrying the placenta with their baby until the umbilical cord separates.
If you plan to bank your baby’s cord blood, the cord will need to be cut. Since the umbilical contains no nerves (like hair, for instance), neither the mother nor the baby will feel the cut.;
, This is a common practice, as immediate clamping allows the baby, especially if they are high risk or premature, to be evaluated right after they are born.

, Recently, there has been a shift to delayed clamping, where the umbilical cord is not clamped until at least 1 to 3 minutes after birth.Many physicians feel that delayed clamping is a more natural process, and provides better circulatory support during the baby’s transition out of the womb.
At birth, a significant amount of the baby’s blood is still in the placenta and umbilical cord. Delayed clamping allows the baby’s circulatory system to recover of much more blood, often as much as ⅓ of the baby’s total blood volume.Similar to the procedure in immediate clamping, the newborn should be held slightly below the level of the mother to enable some of that blood to return to the baby.

, In full term infants, babies with delayed clamping had less anemia and iron deficiency during the first 3 to 6 months. However, in some cases, phototherapy for neonatal jaundice was required.Premature infants whose clamping is delayed have a 50% lower chance of an intraventricular hemorrhage, or bleeding into the fluid cavities in their brain.
Keep in mind that skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby should not be postponed with delayed clamping.

, Be clear about your expectations for clamping your baby’s umbilical cord with your doctor before giving birth.

, Cutting the cord is a simple procedure that requires:


An antibacterial solution.
Sterile surgical gloves, if available.
A clean cotton pad or (preferably) sterile gauze.
A sterile clamp or strip of woven umbilical tape.
A sterile sharp knife or pair of scissors.

, Then, gently pull it over your newborn’s head. Take care not to stretch the cord tight.


With your baby’s first breaths in the first few seconds after delivery, your baby’s circulation shifts away dramatically from the placenta. In fact, flow of your baby’s blood through the placenta usually completely stops within the first 5 to 10 minutes of life.
You can determine when blood flow through the umbilical cord has stopped when you can no longer detected the umbilical cord’s pulse (similar to what the pulse in your wrist or neck feels like).

, You can find plastic clamps in bulk online, such as EZ clamp and Umbilicutter, but you may have a hard time purchasing just one clamp.While these clamps are very secure, they are bulky and catch easily on clothing.
If you are using sterile woven umbilical tape, make sure it is at least ⅛ inches wide. You can find this product online in single use lengths.

, These can be slipped over the umbilical cord to tie it off.


Keep in mind that some brands require additional equipment to place the band on the umbilical cord.
One type that requires no additional equipment is the AGA umbilical cord ring.

, In a pinch, you can use other woven materials like silk, a shoelace or cotton string, but make sure you always boil the material in water first before using it.


Avoid using thin, strong materials such as dental floss, which could rupture the cord if it is tied too tightly.

, But take care not to rupture the cord by using excessive force.

, The second tie should be placed further away from the baby, about 2 inches from the first tie.


Keep in mind that although a pulse in the umbilical cord may stop shortly after delivery, significant bleeding may still occur if the cord is not clamped or tied.

, You can use betadine or chlorhexidine.


This step should be done especially if delivery occurs in a public or unhygienic setting.

, The umbilical cord is much tougher than it looks, and will feel like rubber or gristle.


If the blade or pair of scissors you are using are not sterile, clean them thoroughly with soap and clean water, and then immerse them in alcohol (70% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol) for 2 to 3 minutes.

, The cord may be slippery so this will ensure you have a firm grip on the cord.

, Make sure you hold the cord firmly to ensure the cut is clean.

, Sponge baths can be done for the first few days.


The newborn baby’s risk of hypothermia is more of a concern, especially in the first few days of life, than any issues with the cord stump.

, Always dry your hands well before touching the stump as you want to keep the cord stump dry, and exposed to air as much as possible.

, While you need to ensure it is not in contact with any dirty or unclean surfaces or substances, you also don’t want to cover it tightly with a dressing.

, Keep in mind the use of topical antibacterial solutions to reduce the risk of serious infections on the cord stump is still not universally accepted by medical professionals. But umbilical infections can be serious, and many practitioners continue to recommend the use of an antiseptic to keep them clean.


Effective and easily available antibacterial solutions include triple dye and chlorhexidine. Iodine tincture and povidone-iodine are less effective.
Alcohol (ethanol and isopropyl alcohol) should be avoided. The antibacterial effect of alcohol is brief and can be harmful to the baby. It can also delay the usual 7-14 days of cord drying and separation by a day or two.

, Only apply it to the cord stump. Try not to leave any of the antiseptic on the skin around the stump.

, You can do this at the time of delivery.


Long term cord blood frozen storage can be a source of stem cells that may be used for future treatment of your child or another child.
Currently, the diseases that may benefit from cord blood are limited and rare. However, as medical science advances, other future uses for cord blood are very likely.

, It is not true that delayed clamping of the UC removes the option of cord blood banking.Even after the transfer of blood from placenta to baby, additional blood can be acquired from the placenta for storage, if desired.

Explore your feelings about visitors.,
Reduce stress with scheduled visits.,
Talk to potential visitors about your wishes.,
Set up a meal train for post-birth.,
Be flexible with your plans.,
Host people to your comfort level.,
Have a policy on child visitors.,
Let visitors know when it’s time to go.,
Navigate unexpected visitors.,
Visit others when you’re ready.,
Refuse unwanted or high maintenance visitors.",How to Deal with Visitors After Giving Birth," Chances are that you are just as excited to have your loved ones meet your new baby as they are. But unexpected complications can arise during labor and after that may make welcoming visitors more difficult. Taking some time to consider whom you’d like to visit and how to deal with potentially difficult situations can help prevent awkward encounters after you give birth.Make a list of people whom you’d like as visitors and those who can wait a bit. For example, you may only want your parents or siblings to visit in the first few weeks. You may also feel comfortable inviting other friends or even colleagues to visit you in the hospital or at home.
Develop a couple of different contingencies for visitors that don’t put stress on you or them. Ask yourself questions such as, “What do I do if there are complications?,” “What if I don’t feel like visitors after giving birth?,” or, “Is this person going to cause me stress?”;
, It’s called labor for a reason: delivering a baby is hard work! You may be too tired or sore to deal with a big group of people joining you after you give birth. Having a loose and flexible schedule of visitors can give you a chance to breathe after the delivery and even enjoy people’s company—and help!—after the initial excitement of the new baby dies down.Spread out your guests as much as possible. The key is to make visits as stress-free as possible and it’s generally easier to handle 1-2 people than a group.Make a schedule of potential visits. You probably want the people closest to you to see you and your new baby first. Put them on your schedule either on your delivery day or a day or two afterward. Then spread out visits every couple of days to let yourself rest and deal with potential complications.

, After you’ve had a chance to figure out how you want to structure possible visits after you give birth, you’ll need to express your wishes to others. This sounds easy in theory, but it can be difficult, especially if it’s someone you love. Letting people know about your wishes for visitors in advance can minimize awkward post-birth encounters and may ease stress once you’re baby arrives.Use conversations about the baby as a way to inform people of your wishes. For example, “Aw, Christopher and I really excited to have you meet the baby, too. Since this is our first, we’re going to wait a few days to see people so we can settle into our new life. I’ll text you as soon as we’re ready to see you.” You might also say, “We decided to do a home birth and are excited to have people see us and meet the baby. I’ll let you know when Sara goes into labor and feel free to stop by whenever you like.”
Be honest with people, knowing that most will understand and respect your wishes. For example, “Mom, this has been a really difficult pregnancy and I’m really worried about this baby’s health. I think it’s easiest if I let you know when it’s born and then figure out the best time to visit from there.”

, Most people are exhausted when they have a new baby. Many will even forgo proper nutrition with fast food or delivery services to get a few extra moments rest. Instead of worrying about expensive takeout, ask a friend or family member to set up a meal train for you. A meal train will allow you to get a delicious and nutritious meal while someone gets to meet and hold your new baby.Use a website such as Take Them a Meal or Meal Train to set up your meal train. This gives you a chance to organize when people come over and visit with your baby.It can also ensure you get food you like and prevent unexpected knocks at the door.

, Your first priority after birth is caring for yourself and your baby. You may have wanted visitors after giving birth, but find that you are too tired or overwhelmed once you’ve delivered. Doing what makes you feel best can help you focus on yourself and your baby, even if it means disappointing someone momentarily.Inform scheduled or other potential visitors that you’re not ready to see them. You don’t have to provide extensive details. A simple, “Hey Sam, I am really looking forward to seeing you and introducing Ellie, but we’re really exhausted today after the C-section. I’ll let you know when we’re ready for a visit. I’m so sorry to break our plans.”

, Many people with new babies don’t have a chance to clean or shower all of the time. This may make you nervous when having guests. But you should welcome guests in a way that makes you feel comfortable. This may include seeing people in pajamas or hiding dirty laundry behind closed doors. In most cases, visitors will understand that you’ve just had a baby and may not be on top of everything.Set aside on comfortable, clean outfit for guests you don’t want to visit with in pajamas. You can also throw on a cardigan over pajamas or dirty clothes.
Keep a stash of cosmetics or other beauty products within reach if you want to freshen up.
Host people in one room and close the doors to others you don’t want them to see. Stash dirty laundry under the bed or in closets if you like.
Avoid feeling the need to apologize for not cleaning, showering, or offering guests something to eat or drink. Visitors are often there because they love you and want to meet the baby.

, Some of your friends and family may have babies or small children of their own. They may want to bring these small persons along during the visit. Children often carry germs or conditions such as chicken pox. Babies haven’t built up their immune systems and don’t usually get vaccinations until they are 8 weeks old and exposure to a bacteria or virus could be fatal. Sticking to a policy on child visitors can help keep your baby healthy.Let friends and family with children know you would like them to visit without their children because your baby doesn’t have their vaccinations. Set up an alternative time after your baby has had their first round of shots.
Recognize that small children have a lot of energy and may be loud. They can also be curious and get into things in your home you don’t want others to see.

, Seeing people after you give birth may exhaust you—even after 15 minutes. Remember that visits should be fun for you. If you have an oblivious guest who overstays their welcome, you can gently let the person know it’s time to go. A few ways to politely tell someone to leave include:”Hey there, Peg, thanks for stopping by! Come on in and see the baby. Unfortunately, I’m going to have to cut out to feed Felix at 2:30, but we’d love to see you until then.”
”It’s been really wonderful to see you, Bob. It’s time for Charlotte’s feeding and I want to help out Sara with it. Let’s try and get together sometime soon.”
”Alexander just put down Eloise. I usually take a nap with her, so I’m going to sneak away now.”

, There is almost always a person or people who show up to see you and the baby without notice. This can put a lot of stress on you. Depending on how you’re feeling, either welcome the visitors or politely cue them to leave.Empathize with people’s excitement and remember they’re trying to share in your joy. Stay as positive as you can, even if you’re surprised. An, “Oh, Teresa, how lovely to see you, I wasn’t expecting anyone,” is much better than, “Teresa, please leave.”
Gently cue people to leave if you are tired or not ready to see anyone. You can simply say, “Thank you so much for coming over, Mrs. Newman, but I was just about to feed Jack and put him down for a nap. Maybe you could stop by later this week?”
Avoid apologizing for yourself if you want to see people but may not feel presentable. Instead, try saying, “Hey Molly, it’s so great to see you! Anna and I weren’t expecting guests but would love to introduce you to Max—and the tornado of laundry he creates!”

, If you know you have guests who will overstay their welcome or who may stress you, considering paying them a visit. This gives you more of a chance to control the situation and how long you spend with them.Say, “Oh, jeez, where did the time go? I’m unfortunately going to have to leave because it’s Annie’s feeding and naptime. I really like to keep it a consistent routine at home.”

, In some cases, you may have people who want to visit or meet your baby who you don’t want to visit. This could be anyone from a high maintenance neighbor to a grandparents you’ve cut out of your life. Refusing visitors can be a very touchy and emotional situation for you. Finding constructive ways to refuse unwanted or high-maintenance visitors can help you avoid stress and enjoy time with your new baby.Have a diplomatic conversation with a person if you are on relatively good terms. For example, “Peg, it would be better if you visited in a few weeks or months. We’re still getting used to having a baby and want to limit visitors as much as we can so we can establish a routine.”
Enlist the help of your partner, a relative, or close friend if you don’t have a good relationship to the visitor. Ask them to explain to the person your feelings. For example, “Sam, my mom is at the door and I’m sure she wants to see the baby. I just don’t want her to meet our baby after how she’s treated me,” or, “Allie, can you please tell Cat to just stay away? We’re not friends any longer and the baby doesn’t change my feelings.”

Plan the route to the hospital.,
Determine where you can park.,
Decide which car to drive.,
Gather the things you'll need at the hospital.",How to Drive Someone in Labor to the Hospital1," Test drive different ways to get to the hospital. This way you'll know which way is the fastest, the best way to go if there's heavy traffic, or alternate ways if there is construction. Be aware that traffic will be different depending on the time of day. You can pick the best route when the woman goes into labor.Keep in mind what events may be going on near the due date. This will help you avoid possible traffic problems, like a parade along your hospital route.;
, If the woman is delivering at a large hospital it's important to know where you can park since many hospitals have several parking lots or garages. Plan to park close to the Labor and Delivery wing or find a convenient way to temporarily park the car so the woman can check in. This way, you can move the car and return to the Labor wing.Don't forget to check any parking fees or time limits before you park. You don't want your car to be towed while you're in the hospital!

, If you have several cars, choose ahead of time which car you'll drive. This way you won't be scrambling at the last minute to find keys, make sure it's full of gas, or load the hospital bag. Ensure that you choose a car that is easy for the laboring woman to get in and out of comfortably.If you plan on using a car service like Uber or Lyft, call ahead to guarantee that the driver will drive the laboring woman to the hospital.

, It's a good idea to have a bag ready with all the things you'll want at the hospital. The woman may already have a bag packed for herself, but you might need things if you plan on staying for the labor. You'll also need to have a car seat installed or ready to install in the car.


If you have an infant car seat, you can install the base and carry the seat into the hospital. However, if you're using a combination car seat, you won't be able to install the seat ahead of time and carry it into the hospital because there is no separate base.

"
"
Make the woman comfortable.,
Protect the car from messes.,
Play soothing music.,
Obey the traffic laws.,
Remain calm.",How to Drive Someone in Labor to the Hospital2," Ask the woman if there's anything you can do to make her more comfortable in the car. For safety reasons, it's important that she buckles up. She may feel more at ease if she sits in the back seat where she can stretch out.You may want to keep blankets and pillows in the car to make her even more comfortable.

, If the woman's water hasn't broken, be prepared in case it breaks while you're driving. Lay a thick towel down on the seat and have a few more in case she needs to wipe herself off as well. You should also travel with a plastic bag for the woman to use if she develops nausea and needs something to vomit into.Some women may still experience leaking even after their waters break, so it's a good idea to put down a towel anyway.

, Play relaxing music or use scents that soothe the laboring woman so her labor continues to progress. Many women find that the stress of traveling to the hospital causes the labor to stall or temporarily stop. Consider spritzing a little perfume or essential oils in the car and turn on soft music. These can relax her and help her labor progress.It's alright if her labor slows down a little. This just means that it may take more time for her labor to pick back up at the hospital.
Some laboring women prefer quiet, so ask the woman if she'd rather you turn the music off.

, Avoid speeding, running lights, and reckless driving that could put your car and others in danger. Instead, follow the traffic laws to ensure that you make it safely to the hospital. You may even want to drive slower if this makes the woman in labor more comfortable.Try to go slower over bumps, railroad tracks, or through construction. The jostling may be painful for the laboring woman, so taking it slowly can make it easier to handle.

, The laboring woman will pick up on your stress and nervousness which could stall her labor (making it temporarily slow down). Try to remain in control, calm, and confident so she can focus on making it through contractions. Practice any breathing exercises you learned birthing classes, repeat a mantra, or visualize a safe arrival at the hospital.Remember that it's alright if you don't feel calm and confident. You just need to display outward control of the situation. Once she realizes that you can safely get her to the hospital, she'll feel more comfortable.

"
"
Call for an ambulance if it's a medical emergency.,
Prepare for a possible delivery in the car.,
Avoid driving yourself to the hospital if you're in labor.",How to Drive Someone in Labor to the Hospital3," If you're prepared to drive the woman to the hospital and there doesn't seem to be a medical emergency, you can certainly do so. But, if it will take you more than 15 minutes to get to the hospital and something seems to be unusual with the labor, you should call an ambulance. To call an ambulance:Give the woman's details, address, and phone number. Be calm and clear when giving the information. Explain the medical emergency and follow any directions that the emergency dispatcher gives you.

, If you're on the way to the hospital, but it doesn't look like you'll make it before the woman delivers the baby, pull off to the side of the road. Call 911 and follow their instructions until help arrives.Keep in mind that you probably won't need to deliver the baby yourself, but it may be helpful to know the basics of how to deliver a baby just in case.

, Call for help or someone to drive you to the hospital. If you feel like the baby may be coming, get down on the ground and try to find a towel or blanket to wrap the baby in. Remain calm until help comes.Don't hesitate to call the hospital you intend to deliver at and ask for an ambulance if no one can drive you to the hospital and you're in labor.

Consider whether your pregnancy is high risk.,
Decide if you want pain medication or not.,
Consider if you would like a midwife.,
Ensure that your choice is covered by your insurance.",How to Decide Where to Deliver Your Baby1," If your pregnancy has been labeled as high risk or if you are planning a vaginal birth after c-section(VBAC), then this will limit your options. In these cases, it is important for you to deliver your baby in the hospital. This will ensure that the latest medical technology will be available if the need should arise.Keep in mind that the decision of whether to give birth vaginally or to have a c-section is a decision that your doctor will make based on medical need. However, some women request c-sections out of fears about the pain of childbirth or for other reasons, such as convenience.Make sure to discuss your concerns with your doctor to find the best option for you.;
, If you want pain medication or anesthesia during your delivery, it must be given at a hospital or birth center. If you decide you want this, you cannot have a home birth. Make sure that your choice allows you to have the pain relief you choose.


The most common form of anesthesia is called an epidural. This is delivered through your spine during labor. It offers great pain relief, especially during contractions.While taking the epidural, you will not be able to walk. You will be confined to your hospital bed. Side effects include headaches and low blood pressure, although these are not common., Midwives are trained to help women deliver their babies. They are not medical doctors, although many have nursing credentials. Midwives tend to order fewer tests and C-sections during birth, which is attractive for those who are worried about extreme medical interventions during their delivery.Midwives can also help you prepare for the delivery and support you in the days following your birth.If you decide that you want a midwife, you will need to find a hospital that gives them admittance privileges. This means that the hospital will allow your midwife to deliver your baby in their facility.
Midwives cannot perform C-sections. If you require a C-section, you must go to the hospital.Birth centers tend to staff more midwives. If having a midwife is important to you, you may consider going to a birth center instead., Insurance companies have different regulations about childbirth. Some may not pay for midwives.Medicaid covers birth centers, but some insurance companies do not.You may have more luck covering a C-section or having a doctor deliver your baby."
"
Ask your OB/GYN where he or she has ""admitting privileges."",
Map out which hospitals are close your home.,
Find a designated Baby-Friendly Hospital.,
Know if private rooms are available.,
Ask if your loved ones can be in the delivery room.,
Find out if the baby can stay in the room with you.,
Ask about their C-section rate.",How to Decide Where to Deliver Your Baby2," OB/GYNs only have “admitting privileges” at certain hospitals. You will most likely be delivering your baby at the hospital where your OB/GYN has admitting privileges. If they do not have admitting privileges at the hospital of your choice, you may want to select a different OB/GYN.

, You may need to go to the hospital quickly while you are in labor. This is especially important if you're expecting during the winter months when weather conditions could be dicey or if you have a high risk pregnancy.

, Given the evidence that breastfeeding is healthier for mothers and babies, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) started the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. This global program ""encourages and recognizes hospitals and birthing centers that offer an optimal level of care for infant feeding and mother/baby bonding.""Baby-Friendly Hospitals will most likely staff lactation consultants. These certified specialists provide education, support, and private consults to pregnant and nursing mothers. If you choose to breastfeed, you should ask to make sure that your hospital can provide you with a lactation consultant., If they are, what accommodations do they offer? Some hospitals only have private delivery rooms, some have only shared delivery rooms, while others have both. Do your research ahead of time so you'll know what to expect.

, Policies vary from hospital to hospital, so this is a great question to ask if your partner wants to accompany you in the delivery room. Having a family member with you may ease your stress during delivery.

, You should look for a hospital that will allow your baby to stay with you constantly throughout your stay. This is also called ""rooming in.” It allows you to bond more frequently with your baby., If you do not want a C-section, you will not want to go to a hospital that will pressure you into one. Instead, you want to find a hospital that has about a 19% rate of C-sections.This generally means that they do C-sections when they are necessary, but they do not perform unnecessary C-sections. Not all hospitals perform C-sections, so asking ahead of time could save you from having to be transferred to a different facility, should the need arise.

"
Find a birth center located in a hospital.,
Ask about their hospital transfer options.,
Tour their facility.,
Look over their natural birth options.",How to Decide Where to Deliver Your Baby3," Some hospitals offer birthing centers as part of their maternity care. You will still receive care from midwives and options for natural birth, but you will not require transportation to a different facility if an emergency occurs. You may simply be moved to a different ward., If you do not find a birth center inside of a hospital, you should look for one that has a partnership with a nearby hospital. This will ensure that if you need a transfer, the process will go smoothly. Check on a map to see how far apart the birth center is from its partnered hospital to ensure that the transfer would be fast. You should ask if their midwives have hospital admitting privileges at their partner hospital. If they have these privileges, your midwives will be able to accompany you from the center to the hospital., Before you decide on a birth center, ask if you can tour their facility. Make sure that it is accredited by the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers and licensed by the state. As you walk around the facility, note its cleanliness. While there, you should ask them:


“Do your midwives have admittance privileges? If not, can the midwives still come with me if I have to be transferred to a hospital?”
“Do you have a physician on staff?”
“Do you accept insurance?”
“What happens if there is an emergency? How do transfers work here?”, If you want natural birth options in a safe facility, a birth center may be right for you. Check out what type of natural relief practices are available to you at your local birth center. At the same time, investigate how they use conventional medicine. Some common practices at birth centers include:


Water birth.
Birthing stools.Ability to walk during labor.
Birth balls.
The option to take a shower or a bath."

Determine the benefits.,
Weigh the risks.,
Consult a doctor.,
Find a certified midwife.,
Make emergency plans.",How to Decide Where to Deliver Your Baby4," Home births come with many benefits. At home, you will be in comfortable surroundings. You will be able to remain with your partner and children throughout labor, and there will be no rush to the hospital before you give birth., You cannot be administered epidurals at home, and if there are complications, you will have to be transferred to the hospital. Keep in mind that transfers to hospitals may take time during vital medical emergencies.There is a higher rate of complications for home births, and a higher risk of infant death.You may need to be transferred to the hospital if:


You develop high blood pressure.
You begin to hemorrhage.
You experience a cord prolapse.The baby experiences any problems, such as abnormal heart rate or breathing problems., Your doctor will review your health conditions to make sure that a home birth will be safe for you. They may tell you what specific risks you may face during a home birth.You should not have a home birth if:


You require a C-section or are at high risk for needing a C-section.
You have had a C-section in the past.
You have preeclampsia, diabetes, hypertension, a seizure disorder, or any other chronic disorder.
You are pregnant with multiples.
You are earlier than 37 or later than 41 weeks along in your pregnancy., When choosing a home birth, you want to make sure that you will be taken care of. There are two types of midwives that receive certification.


Certified nurse-midwives (CNM) must have experience in both nursing and midwifery before passing a rigorous exam for certification from the American Midwifery Certification Board (AMCB). A graduate degree is required for certification.They sometimes do home births, although they are more frequently found in hospitals and birth centers.The North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) regulates certified professional midwives (CPM). These midwives are often trained through apprenticeships, and they may or may not have a college degree. These midwives participate more in home births. Licensing for these midwives varies state by state., You will need to prepare a plan if something goes awry. Set up in advance which hospital you will be transferred to if something goes wrong. Make sure that this hospital is close as you may not have much time to reach it. You should also prepare transportation to the hospital if needed; ambulances are expensive and may take too long to reach you."

Making sure you’re getting proper obstetrical care from a doctor, nurse practitioner or midwife can help ensure not only that your pregnancy is progressing normally but also that it’s safe for you to check your cervix for dilation.


Be aware that beginning in your ninth month of pregnancy, your doctor will begin looking for signs that your labor is getting closer. This includes palpitating your abdomen and performing an internal exam to check your cervix. He or she will see if the baby has “dropped,” which means that the cervix has begun to dilate and get softer.
Ask your doctor any questions you may have, including if the baby has dropped. You should also ask if it is safe to check dilation on your own. If your pregnancy is safe, then you can proceed.;
, Having dirty hands can spread bacteria and germs that cause infection. Checking your cervix requires inserting a hand or fingers into your vagina. It’s extremely important to your health and that of your unborn baby to wash your hands before you check your cervix for dilation.Use any type of soap and some warm water to clean your hands. Wet your hands with running water and apply your soap, lathering well. Rub your hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds, making sure to scrub each surface of your hands. Rinse off the soap and then dry your hands thoroughly.
Use a hand sanitizer of at least 60% alcohol if you don’t have soap. Apply enough of the sanitizer for both hands to the palm of one hand. Just as with soap, rub your hands together and make sure you cover every surface including nails. Keep rubbing until your hands are dry.

, If you’re a bit worried or scared about doing the exam on your own, ask your partner or another loved one for help. Allow the person to help as much as you are comfortable with and like. Support can come in the form of holding a mirror or your hand or even offering calming words.

, Before you can effectively check your cervix for dilation, you need to be in a comfortable position. You might want to sit on your toilet or lie on your bed with your legs spread, just do what is most comfortable for you.Take off your clothes on your lower half before you start. This way, you don’t have to awkwardly remove them when you’re comfy.
Sit or squat on the toilet with one foot on the floor and the other on the toilet seat. You can also squat on the floor or lie on your bed if these are more comfortable
Remember that you have nothing about which to be ashamed. You’re doing something completely normal and natural.

, You’ll need to start your exam by getting an initial sense of how far you may be dilated. Instead of putting your entire hand into your vagina, which may cause discomfort, use your pointer and middle fingers to start checking your cervix.Remember to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before inserting your fingers in your vagina.
Locate the entrance of your vagina with the tips of your fingers. The back of your hand should be facing your spine and your palm should face upwards. Angle your fingers back towards your anus to most effectively feel your cervix. If you feel any pain or extreme discomfort, remove your fingers.

, A woman’s cervix feels like a pair of puckered lips when pregnant. After you’ve inserted your fingers into and up your vaginal canal, keep pushing them until you reach what feels like the puckered lips.Be aware that some women have a high cervix and others have a low cervix. You may need to insert your fingers further up your vaginal canal or may reach it relatively quickly. The cervix is basically the “end” of your vaginal canal no matter its position in your body.Use a gentle touch to feel for your cervix. Pressing or poking it with your fingers can lead to bleeding.Recognize that one finger may easily slip into the middle of your cervix if it is dilating. What you may feel at the center of the opening is your bag of waters that covers the baby’s head. You may find this has the sensation of a latex balloon filled with water., Once a woman is dilated 10 centimeters, she’ll generally ready to deliver her baby. If one of your fingers entered the middle of the cervix easily, you can use additional fingers to figure out how far along your dilation is.Keep in mind the following: if you can slip one finger into the middle of your cervix, you’re about one centimeter dilated. Likewise, if you can insert five finger widths into your cervix, you’re about 5 centimeters dilated. As your labor progresses, your cervix will go from feeling tight to like an elastic band. At 5 centimeters, it may feel like and have the thickness of a rubbery circle jar ring used in canning.
Continue to insert fingers gently into your vagina until you’re using your entire hand or it causes discomfort. Remove your hand to see how many finger widths you used. This can give you a general idea of how far your cervix is dilated.

, If you’re cervix is dilated more than 3 centimeters, it generally means you are in the active phase of labor. You should go to the delivery center you’ve chosen or prepare your home if you’re having a home birth.Be aware that your contractions can also help indicate that you should go to the delivery center. They will be more regular and stronger. They should be about five minutes apart and last for 45-60 seconds., There are many indicators of dilation that don’t require inserting your fingers into your vagina. This can be especially helpful if you are in a lot of pain or discomfort. Most women will make some type of sound when they’re in labor. Listening to what types of sounds you’re making can cue you into how much you’re cervix has dilated. The following sounds can accompany the various stages of labor and cervical dilation:At 0-4 centimeters dilated, you may not be making much noise and can talk through a contraction with little effort.
At 4-5 centimeters, it may be difficult to nearly impossible to talk. Your noises may still be quiet.
Between 5-7 centimeters, you may make louder and staccato noises. It should be nearly or completely impossible to talk through contractions.
Between 7–10 centimeters (2.8–3.9 in), you may be making very loud noises and shouldn’t be able to talk through a contraction.
If you’re a silent laborer, you can also check your dilation. Tell someone to ask you a question at the start of a contraction. The less you are able to say a sentence, the farther along your dilation is.

, Childbirth is an inherently emotional experience for the woman in labor. Watching what emotions you’re experiencing can cue you into how far your cervix is dilated. You may have the following emotions during labor:Happiness and laughter between 1-4 centimeters
Smiley and laughing at little things between contractions between 4-6 centimeters
Irritation at jokes and small talk around 7 centimeters until birth.

, Many people will notice certain scents when a woman gets to between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated. The smell of labor is deep, heavy, and dusky—not musky.If you notice a distinct change to these scents in the smell of the room in which you’re laboring, your cervix may be between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated.

, Some women may see a stringy mucus discharge at 39 weeks that is tinged pink or brown with blood.This bloody show may continue through the early stages of labor. At 6-8 centimeters dilated, however, a lot of blood and mucus may be present. Looking for these substances can indicate that you’re somewhere between 6-8 centimeters dilated.

, The purple line is located in your natal cleft, or what some people call the butt crack. This line can be a measure of how far you’re dilated, with it reaching the top of your cleft at full dilation. You may need someone to help you examine your purple line.Recognize that in the early stages of labor that the purple line will be closer to the anus. As your labor progresses, it will creep up between your buttocks. At full dilation, the purple line will extend to the top of your natal cleft.

, Many women experience physical signs of dilation that are visible without a vaginal examination. In general, many will feel like they have the flu as they get close to 10cm and/ or the pushing phase. Scanning your body for these signs and symptoms can help you figure out how much your cervix has dilated. In most, cases, a combination of these signs can indicate how you’re your cervix is dilated.Feeling like you have to vomit, having a flushed face and feeling warm to the touch can mean you’re about 5 centimeters dilated. You may also tremble uncontrollably. Vomiting alone may be the result of emotions, hormones, or fatigue.
Seeing if your face is flushed with no other signs can be a good indicator that you’re 6-7 centimeters dilated.
Be aware that trembling uncontrollably without any other signs can indicate fatigue or fever.
See if you’re curling your toes or standing on your toes, which is a sign you’re between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated.
Check your buttocks and upper thighs for goose bumps, which is a good sign that you’re at 9-10 centimeters.
Recognize that having involuntary bowel movements is also a sign of full dilation.You may also see or feel the head at your perineum.

, As your baby descends into the birth canal, you will feel pressure at different points along your back. The more you dilate, the farther down your back the pressure will be lower. It will generally move from the rim of your pelvis down to your tailbone."

Listen to and follow your doctors instructions.,
Cover the scar with a bandage.,
Take anti-inflammatory medication.,
Stay in bed for 12-18 hours after the surgery.,
Have any staples removed before leaving the hospital.,
Expose the incision to air.,
Do not lift heavy objects.,
Ask your doctor about applying creams to the incision.",How to Care for Your C Section Scar1," Following your C section the doctor will likely give you a list of instructions on how to properly care for the incision scar. It is very important that you listen to your doctor and follow all of the instructions carefully. You don't want to end up back in the hospital dealing with an infection that could have been avoided.;
, For the first twenty fours after your C section, your scar will be covered with a sterile bandage to reduce the chance of an infection. Your doctor will put on the bandage immediately following the procedure. These bandages will then be removed by your doctor or a nurse about 24 hours after the surgery., Immediately following the procedure you will be given anti-inflammatory and pain medications to help reduce the swelling and pain caused by the surgery. These medications do not impact your ability to breastfeed and should be taken to help with your recovery. Make sure that your follow the directions carefully.Some hospital staff may encourage women to hold an ice pack to the incision area for the first day to help reduce swelling.

, You will need to stay in bed for anywhere from 12 to 18 hours following the surgery. During this time, you will be hooked up to a catheter so you will not need to get up to go to the washroom. This rest time is necessary to allow your body to recover. Once the catheter has been removed, you should stand up and try walking around. This can begin to promote healing in your scar because it will help increase your blood circulation., Prior to being discharged from the hospital, which will usually be about four days after delivery, your doctor will remove the staples from the incision. If your doctor used stitches instead of staples they will fall out on their own and do not need to be removed., Once the bandages have been removed, it is important that you expose your incision to the air. This will help promote healing. This does not mean that you have to walk around all day in a state of undress. Instead, avoid wearing tight clothes so that air can reach the scar., For the first few weeks after the surgery you should avoid lifting heavy objects. It is recommended that you not lift anything that is heavier than your newborn baby. This is so that you do not irritate your incision or cause tearing from over exertion. Hold off on any rigorous physical activity for at least 4-6 weeks to allow the scar to heal., Some doctors recommend applying anti-bacterial ointments to the scar tissue to help with healing. Other doctors believe that the best way to heal the incision is to avoid putting anything on the wound. Ask your doctor what is best for your particular incision.About 6 weeks after the surgery you can begin to moisturize the area with creams.

Many parents find it cathartic to hold the baby in order to create memories and find a sense of closure.


Seeing the baby, holding him or her, and giving the child a name can be very helpful to parents whose child died during labor. Some parents like to take photographs to help them remember.Some babies are born with a small amount of hair. Parents sometimes like to take a lock of their baby's hair as a keepsake. If this is something you are interested in, talk to your doctor. You may also want to take handprints, footprints, or keep any blankets or shawls the baby was wrapped in.If you have other children, whether or not you allow them to see the baby is a personal decision. Many people feel they can better understand the situation by looking at the baby but others feel this would be traumatic. Whatever you decide to do, be honest with your children about what happened and allow them to express their feelings as well.;
, Losing a newborn baby is an emotionally devastating experience. You will need a lot of emotional support.


Sharing the news of pregnancy loss can be a very difficult experience for many. Having one close family member or friend break the news to others for you can help.Remember, your friends and family members have lost something as well. The baby was someone to them, too, whether niece or nephew, grandchild, godchild, etc. Those close to you might want to see pictures, handprints, footprints, and other memories you created of the baby.It may be difficult for others to understand what you are going through and they may offer their support in ways that are not helpful. It is perfectly okay, if you hear a comment that upsets you, to respond with something like, ""I appreciate that you're trying to help, but hearing that hurts right now."", Losing a baby can lead to prolonged periods of bereavement. A qualified therapist can help you sort through your emotions in an effective way in order to cope with the loss.


Many emotions surface during a time of bereavement. You may feel misdirected anger at doctors, nurses, or even a higher power over the loss of the child. You may feel tired a lot and cry for much of the day. You may also feel personal guilt, wishing you could have done something differently to prevent the situation. These are all normal emotions. A bereavement counselor can help you accept your feelings are natural and manage them in a healthy manner.You can find a bereavement counselor or a general therapist by asking for a referral from your doctor or seeing what's covered under your insurance. A counselor will give you a safe, non-judgmental space to talk about your loss and help you process your feelings.You can seek out a counselor at any time, even if it's been months or even years since your loss., Your doctor, midwife, or nurse can help put you in contact with parents who've lost babies during delivery. There may even be support groups at your hospital or somewhere around your location. You can also seek support online as a variety of websites have forums where you can discuss pregnancy loss, stillbirth babies, and babies who died during delivery., If your baby died before or during birth, you'll need to make a decision regarding any ceremonies you want to hold in your baby's honor.


If you are religious, you may want to hold a baptism for the baby. Depending on your hospital's policy, you may be able to bring a priest in to conduct the ceremony. If there are other rights and ceremonies surrounding death in your religion, you may able to conduct those as well.You will need to make a decision about the baby's cremation or burial. Some families prefer to have this done quietly and without ceremony while others may hold a funeral. There is no wrong way to feel in this situation and you should do whatever feels the most helpful and comfortable for you. If your hospital helps you have a small funeral onsite, they usually do not charge for the ceremony., There are certain forms you need to fill out when a baby dies during delivery. It can be painful to deal with paperwork during such a difficult time, so ask for assistance if necessary.


A birth and death certificate will need to be filled out. You will need to provide basic information, like your full name and place of birth. The Medical Certificate of Death and the birth certificate must be taken to your local register office within five days of your baby's death.If you're having trouble filing out documents due to your emotions, ask a friend or family member for assistance. You might also want to take someone to the register office when you go to deliver the documents as this can be difficult., Parents often wonder what precisely caused the baby to die during delivery. You might want to consider asking for a post-mortem examination if you feel answers will help you cope.


Infection, complications during delivery, undetectable health conditions, and other factors can cause a baby to die during or before delivery. A post-mortem exam or autopsy may help detect these causes. Some parents find knowing more information can help them move on.Doctors need your written consent to carry out a post-mortem examination. Many parents opt out as, even when an investigation is discovered, the cause of death sometimes still remains unknown. Understand an investigation may not yield the answers you want and factor this into the decision making process., Your body will need to recover after a stillbirth the same way it needs to recover from a typical pregnancy. You should take it easy for the first few weeks and get lots of bed rest and sleep. Your breasts will likely fill with milk. This can cause soreness and tenderness for a few days, after which the milk should disperse. You might also have spotting or bleeding for a few weeks. A warm bath and over-the-counter painkillers can help you cope with any discomfort., When you leave the hospital, you'll be going home without a baby. You need to be emotionally prepared for this reality.


What you decide to do with the baby supplies is up to you. Many parents choose to keep supplies in and out-of-sight place, like an attic or storage room. Others want to donate or discard items. It can be helpful to have a friend or family member take down the nursery and other supplies before you get home.Many women report they can hear their baby crying for the first few months. This is normal, but if it is troubling for you, talk to a doctor or therapist., After the loss of a baby, you'll have a follow up medical exam in six to eight weeks. This is to make sure your body is recovering physically. Discuss any questions or concerns you have with your doctor at this exam., Many people opt not to try for a natural birth again after losing a baby. However, if you'd like to try for another child talk to your doctor, partner, friends, and family members before making the decision.


Certain preexisting conditions, such as high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and other medical problems, can increase the likelihood of stillbirth. Making sure these conditions are managed ahead of time can help you lessen the likelihood of the problem reoccurring. Talk to your doctor about any health conditions that might compromise the health of your baby and how to manage them before undergoing another pregnancy.Emotionally, make sure you're ready for another baby. Pregnancy might be more stressful after a loss and you may expect this baby to be similar to the one that died. Talk to a therapist before attempting to get pregnant again to make sure you're mentally ready to handle the stress of a second pregnancy."

Avoid taking a bath.,
Wash with a mild soap.,
Dry the area after showering.",How to Care for Your C Section Scar2," Immediately following the C section, you should avoid fully submerging the scar in water. This means you should not take a bath or go swimming. Ask your doctor how long you should wait before taking a shower., You can still take a shower and clean the scar by allowing mild soapy water to wash over the incision area. Do not scrub the area. This could cause irritation and may lead to tearing.Once the incision starts to heal, usually after a few weeks, you can resume your regular cleaning routine.

, Once you have finished taking a shower, you should gently pat dry the area around the scar. You do not want to rub it to aggressively because this may cause irritation."

Monitor your scar for the first year.",How to Care for Your C Section Scar3," You should get in the habit of checking the incision area daily. Make sure that the incision does not separate. If you notice any bleeding or if the incision has a green or pus-coloured discharge, you should see your doctor immediately.This could signal that your scar has developed an infection.

, When you leave the hospital your incision will feel soft to the touch, but over the next few days you may begin to notice that if feels hard. This is completely normal and is called the healing ridge., Your scar may appear slightly darker approximately one month after delivery. This is normal and the colour will begin to fade. At some point, approximately 6 months to a year after the procedure, your scar will stop changing.


Typically incision scars are small and not noticeable.

Consider using a certified midwife.,
Ask your obstetrician about her policy on C-sections.,
Get a doula for additional support.,
Take a natural birthing class.,
Eat a balanced and healthy diet during your pregnancy.,
Exercise throughout your pregnancy.,
Get plenty of rest, especially during your last trimester.,
Do prenatal yoga.,
Do not go to the hospital until you are in active labor.,
Avoid being induced during labor.,
Ask your doctor about your pain management options.,
Learn how to turn a breech baby from your midwife or your obstetrician.,
Let your birth partner know about your desire for a vaginal birth.",How to Avoid a Cesarean Section," Most women deliver their babies under the care of obstetricians, but studies show that midwives can be more successful at guiding laboring women through vaginal deliveries without unnecessary interventions, like a C-section.Before you use a midwife, confirm her credentials as a certified nurse-midwife (CNM). A CNM will have a bachelor’s degree and/or a master’s degree, will have completed nursing and midwifery training, and have passed exams to be certified and licensed as a midwife through their state of practice.Midwives are not trained to perform surgery or handle high-risk deliveries, but most are affiliated with hospitals or obstetrical associations. Be aware that if you end up having complications when you go into labor, a midwife will have to transfer you into the care of an obstetrician. Talk about the possibilities of complications with your midwife well before your due date approaches and add instructions to your birth plan about what to do in the event of complications during labor.
Ask your provider how often she performs episiotomies. This is when a surgical incision is made during the second trimester to enlarge the vaginal opening for the baby to pass through. This procedure is becoming less and less common, but you should ask the midwife if this is something she practices.Midwives generally do not instruments like forceps or vacuums, as they are usually not trained to use them, and they generally do not have the privileges to do so.Be aware that these devices can be lifesaving to mom and baby, and can often prevent the need for a cesarean.
Their patients generally require less pain medication (though some midwives cannot administer drugs or anesthesia, which may impact how many of their patients use pain medication). After delivery, patients report being happier with their experience.
If you have a high-risk pregnancy, such as expecting twins or multiples, or if you have gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, or chronic health problems, it is not advisable to work with a midwife without an obstetrician.;
, If you decide to go with an obstetrician rather than a midwife, make sure you choose one who respects your desire to have a vaginal birth. Ask about where she will deliver your baby: are you limited to a particular hospital, or do you have other options, including birth centers? More flexibility will give you more control over how you will deliver your baby.Ask your obstetrician what her “primary cesarean rate” is. This number represents the percentage of first-time cesareans performed by your doctor. The number should be as low as possible, ideally around 15–20%.

, Doulas are non medical professionals who can be hired to accompany you to your hospital or birth center and offer you extra assistance throughout your labor and delivery. They are not medical care providers, but their guidance and support can contribute to faster labors with fewer complications and lower rates of cesarean sections.A recent study showed that many pregnant women do not know about the services provided by a doula and as a result, are not reaping the benefits of doula care. Ask your obstetrician to recommend a doula or ask other mothers if they can recommend a doula. Some birthing centers may offer doula assistance as part of your overall care at their facility.Keep in mind the services of a doula will likely not be covered by your health insurance and doula rates can range from several hundred to several thousand dollars.

, Get more information on how to prevent a C-section by taking a natural birthing class, which will focus on breathing techniques, and how to get through labor without any pain medication or intervention. You will learn how to manage your pain naturally through body positioning and breathing exercises, which can reduce your need for medical interventions, including a C-section.If you are giving birth at a birthing center or a hospital, ask them for a referral to a natural birthing class. Your doula may also be able to recommend a birthing class, if you are using the services of a doula.

, Labor and delivery are physically demanding, and you need to be able to meet those challenges. Eating a healthy diet with plenty of protein, fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates will help you be in the best shape possible when the time comes.Obesity is one of the biggest risk factors for requiring a cesarean. Optimizing your health prior to pregnancy limiting weight gain through exercise and proper diet can help lower your chances of a cesarean.
Maintain a well balanced diet that contains the four food groups: fruits and vegetables, protein, dairy and grains.Make sure your daily diet consists of five portions of fresh or frozen fruit, six ounces or less of protein like meat, fish, eggs, soya, or tofu, three to four servings of fresh or frozen vegetables, six to eight servings of grains like bread, rice, pasta, and breakfast cereals, and two to three servings of dairy like yogurt and hard cheeses.It is also important that you maintain a healthy weight for your age and body type. Avoid being underweight or overweight while pregnant, as this can lead to complications and health issues. You can calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) using an online BMI calculator and determine how many calories per a day you should be consuming to maintain a healthy weight.
If you are concerned about your diet, ask your doctor or midwife for specific advice. If you have gestational diabetes or other complications, you will need to follow additional, specific dietary guidelines.

, As long as your doctor or midwife approves, moderate exercise will also help you stay fit and ready to meet the demands of childbirth.Do low impact exercises like swimming, walking, and yoga. You can also do targeted exercises made for pregnant women, such as ab exercises.
Avoid exercises where you lie flat on your back after your first trimester, as well as contact sports, and activities that pose a risk of falling, such as skiing, surfing, and horseback riding., If you can go into labor as well-rested as possible, you will be more likely to handle the physical demands of childbirth without needing interventions. Most pregnant women need more sleep than they think, as their body is supporting a baby and may be more tired than usual.It can be tricky to find a comfortable position to lie down while you are pregnant that will not endanger your baby. Try to lie down on your left side, with your legs bent. You can use a body pillow or several pillows on your lower back to sleep in comfort.

, Prenatal yoga has been shown to improve your sleep, reduce any stress or anxiety, and give your muscles more strength, flexibility, and endurance to have a smooth childbirth. It can also reduce your risk of preterm labor, and other labor related issues that could lead to an emergency C-section.During a typical prenatal yoga class, you will learn breathing techniques, do gentle stretching, and do postures to strengthen your flexibility and balance. You will also be given a period at the end of the class to cool down and relax.

, Showing up too early at the hospital, when you are still in the early stages of labor can lead to unnecessary interventions during labor, including a possible C-section.


The first phase of labor is the longest, with mild contractions. Walking around, being on your feet, and squatting during this phase will help your labor continue in a healthy and normal fashion until you reach active labor. This phase of labor often occurs later than once thought by doctors, when your cervix is at least six centimeters dilated. Staying at home until you are in active labor and it is time for medical intervention can help to ensure a vaginal birth.

, In some cases, labor induction, which when labor is brought on with drugs or instruments, is medically necessary. But as long as you and the baby are doing well during labor, it is best to avoid labor induction. Research has shown that induction during labor can double your likelihood of having a cesarean section.Try to avoid an “elective induction,” which is an induction done purely for convenience, rather than necessity. Instead, lean on your birthing partner, your spouse, or your doula and use the breathing and labor techniques you learned in a birthing class to encourage labor.

, There is conflicting evidence for whether or not epidurals can increase your chance of a cesarean section. An epidural delivered too early in labor may increase your chances of C-section; however, a combined spinal epidural (CSE) or ""walking"" epidural offers pain relief without numbness and can actually make pushing easier.Talk to your doctor or midwife about the relative benefits and risks of pain medications so you can decide which pain management option is right for you.An epidural can limit your baby’s ability to move around in the womb, so if he is in a bad position he may have a hard time adjusting to a better position during labor. When you are given an epidural, your ability to move around will also be limited, which could lead to complications during labor.
You may be able to reduce some of the increased risk of needing a cesarean section by waiting until you are at least 5 centimeters (2.0 in) dilated before you get an epidural or other pain medication. By that point, your labor is less likely to slow down or stop. It can also help to stay mobile during the early stages of labor by walking around and shifting positions while you are in labor. Avoid laying flat on your back, as this can make it more difficult for your baby to get in a good labor position, and prolong your labor.

, A baby that is breech is positioned butt-first or feet-first in the womb and if not moved, can cause complications during delivery. If your baby is breech at about 36 weeks of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor can show you hands-to-belly movements to turn the baby so he is head first. These movements can reduce the need for a C-section by ensuring your baby in is a good position for labor.If your baby is a bad position during labor and may have a hard time passing through your pelvis despite hand movements to shift him, your obstetrician may use forceps or a vacuum extractor as a safe alternative to a C-section. Talk to your obstetrician about these procedures and specify in your birth plan if you would prefer these options to a cesarean section.

, If you have requested that your spouse or birth partner be with you in the delivery room, make sure that person knows that you want a vaginal delivery. He or she can support you through your contractions, remind you of your goals, and speak up for you when you are too exhausted to do so effectively.You should also specify in your birth plan that you would like a vaginal birth and give your obstetrician, your midwife, and your doula a copy of your birth plan. However, it’s important that expectant mothers always include a provision in their birth plan about what to do in the event a C-section is needed due to emergency medical reasons.

Get plenty of rest.,
Avoid sex for four to six weeks.,
Urinate frequently.,
Get plenty of iron.Iron is important because it helps to replenish your blood count after labor.,

Invest in a waterproof mattress pad.,
Keep a few disposable waterproof pads around the house.,
Call a doctor if you pass blood clots bigger than golf balls.,
Check your temperature if you feel feverish.,
Check the smell.,
Watch the heaviness of the bleeding.,
Count the weeks your postpartum bleeding continues.",How to Care for Postpartum Bleeding," If you start bleeding bright red after having gotten past that state to pink or brown, you need more rest.If you completely soak a pad within an hour, you should call a doctor. While the amount of rest you need will vary from person to person, increased bleeding or decreased mood suggests you should be getting more rest., The main reason for this is that because there are potential vaginal tears, as well as damage in the uterus, you can get an infection. It will also be uncomfortable immediately after birth to have sex, as you are likely to be sore.You should wait until the bleeding is almost gone before having sex., You may not feel like you need to go, but keeping the bladder somewhat empty will help ease contractions. This will help to decrease pain and bleeding. You should call your doctor if you have the typical symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as burning urination or a persistent urge to urinate., You should try to get the iron you need from food sources, such as meats, beans and lentils, and certain vegetables such as broccoli or okra. This is because too much iron can cause constipation. You should only take an iron supplement if your doctor recommends it., Tampons can increase the chance of infection, and there are plenty of pads out there that can handle most flows.Consider using overnight or heavy flow pads, especially in the first week or so. You can even use pads regularly meant for urinary incontinence, as they tend to be bigger and more absorbent., These are mesh underwear that you can wear during the heavy period of postpartum bleeding. You will usually receive some pairs from the hospital. However, you can buy them online as well. They are more convenient than traditional underwear, especially in the first few days after labor, when you’ll want to do nothing but rest., This will help protect your mattress during sleep, and will give you some ease about leaks that can occur. If your flow is really heavy or you don’t want to stain your sheets, you might want to use a comfortable bed pad that rests on top of the sheets., Using them when sitting on upholstered furniture, the carpet, or any other surface you want to protect from blood stains. These may not be necessary after the first week or so.Using disposable pads are definitely more convenient, but you can use reusable ones if you want to be more environmentally friendly., While some clots are normal, larger ones should raise concern. This can be a sign of postpartum hemorrhage, which can be fatal if left untreated. Other symptoms include pain in the vaginal region and low blood pressure., If you have a fever of over 100.4 degrees, you should check with your doctor. It can be a sign of a serious infection. Fever with any of these other symptoms is especially concerning., If you notice that the vaginal discharge smells significantly different from your menstrual period, you may need medical attention.Foul-smelling postpartum bleeding may indicate the presence of an infection., If you are soaking a pad once an hour for more than two hours, you should call your doctor. It should be noted that normal moderate to heavy bleeding lasts for the first week or so. While the period may vary some, a return to very heavy bleeding should be looked into., It should typically last two to six weeks. While it is normal for about 15% women to experience bleeding after six weeks, you will still want to talk to your doctor at your post-natal check, especially if the extended time occurs with any other symptoms."

Let the doctor break your water if necessary.,
Recognize when your water breaks.,
Do not try to induce labor yourself.,
Ask your doctor why you should be induced.,
Do not have an optional induction.,
Accept that induction may not be an option.",How to Break Your Water," The doctor may suggest manually breaking your water as a way of inducing labor. This is called an amniotomy. This will likely only be done if your cervix is dilating and the baby is in your pelvis in the birthing position. The doctor will put a probe inside you that has a hook on the end, sort of like a crochet needle. The hook will be used to puncture the amniotic sac. You will likely feel the water flow out when it breaks.This procedure may be uncomfortable but it will not harm you or the baby. The hospital may monitor the baby’s heart rate throughout the procedure.;
, Women’s experiences when their water breaks are highly variable. Some women experience an obvious flood of fluid while other women have difficulty identifying it. If you are unsure, call your doctor or midwife. When your water breaks you may feel:Wetness in your vagina and underwear that is different from your normal pregnancy discharge.
A small amount of fluid that starts and stops. It may be difficult to distinguish this from a trickle of urine.
A continuous, but small flow.
A sudden and unmistakable amount of water.

, Scientific studies suggest that commonly suggested methods of trying to start labor are generally ineffective. These include:Acupuncture
Homeopathy
Caster oil
Enemas
Hot baths with ginger oil. This has not been shown to shorten labor. Do not take ginger orally because it may increase your risk of bleeding.
Sex. Having sex won’t cause any problems for you or the baby if you have it before your water breaks. Afterwards you should not have sex because it may increase the risk of infection.

, Generally you will only be induced if there is a reason why it is likely to be better for you and the baby. Reasons for induction include:You are in your 42nd week of gestation and labor isn’t starting.
You have an infection in your uterus.
The baby isn’t developing sufficiently.
There isn’t enough amniotic fluid in the sac.
The placenta is separating from the wall of the uterus and / or starting to break down.
You have diabetes or high blood pressure.

, Some women want to schedule the birth ahead of time and then be induced. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is not against elective induction but they do try to discourage across the board induction of everyone. Patients must be at least 39 weeks before induction will be considered. Risks include:If your cervix is not dilated enough, you will need a C-section.
Manually rupturing the amniotic sac increases your infection risk.
Inducing labor makes it more probable that the umbilical cord will slip into the vagina before the baby. If this happens as the baby passes through the baby will press on the umbilical cord and cut off its oxygen supply during the birth. This is very dangerous for the baby.

, There are situations when a C-section, instead of a natural birth is necessary. Under these circumstances, induction is unsafe for you and the baby:The position of the placenta or baby makes a natural birth dangerous. This includes if the placenta is blocking your cervix or if the baby is not in the correct position. For example, if the baby is crosswise in the transverse fetal position you cannot be induced.
There are concerns about whether you can physically give birth. This includes if your birth canal may be too small for the baby to fit through or if your uterus has been weakened by a prior surgery or C-section that makes it likely to rupture.
Active infections, such as herpes or HIV, may also make a C-section safer.

, Some people prefer private births, with just their partner and their mother present. Other people like to make births a larger event, where their families and friends join together for the delivery. Consider carefully what would make you feel most comfortable.Remember that giving birth can be stressful. Make sure that you are comfortable with people seeing you in labor. Take care to choose people who will not be offended if you snap at them.

, If anybody makes you tense, stressed, or upset easily, do not invite them into the delivery room. You want to pick people who give you positive energy and encouragement. Labor can last a long time, and it can be very painful. The people by your side should be helping you persevere. They should not make you feel nervous or anxious.For example, if your mother upsets you with her unsolicited advice, you might not include her in the delivery room. If she is patient and upbeat, you might find her to be a helpful presence.

, In addition to being helpful and encouraging, you should pick people who you trust to see you in moments of distress. Make sure these are people who will not share unflattering pictures on social media without your consent or tease you about how anxious you were during birth. Choose people who understand your needs and preferences while respecting your privacy.Immediate family members, such as your parents and siblings, are a good place to start. Your best friend may also be a good choice to bring into the delivery room with you.
You may not want to include family members you do not know well, even if your partner vouches for them.
You may want to have a talk with the other person when you invite them to let them know what type of privacy you expect. You might say, ""I do not want any pictures of my birth appearing online. Can I trust you not to do this?""

Talk to the hospital.,
Choose one person in case of a C-section.,
Pick a back up.,
Tell your doctor.",How to Choose Who Should Stay in the Delivery Room2," Each hospital and birthing center will have different regulations regarding who can and cannot be in the delivery room. Some may only allow two or three people at a time while others do not have a limit. Some may permit children while others will not allow them in until after the birth.You might want to ask them:


“How many people can be in the delivery room during birth?”
“Do you have restrictions on who can be in the delivery room with me?”
“Do you allow children into the delivery room?”

, If you are planning to have a C-section, understand that usually only one person will be allowed back with you. Even if you are not planning to have one, choose a person, such as your partner or your mother, to join you in case you need a emergency C-section. By planning ahead, you will make sure that the right person can join you., Sometimes, there are events that prevent people from making it to the hospital in time, so find someone else to step in if need be. Ask these people ahead of time to be your back up delivery crew just in case your preferred team cannot make it. For instance, you might ask your best friend, “Just in case my partner can’t make it to the hospital in time, can I ask you to be on call?”

, Your doctor should be aware of any birth plans that you have. Once you have chosen who will be your support, inform your doctor. You should also tell your doctor who your back up is. This will ensure that the right people have access to the delivery room when it is time.You might say, “I want my husband and my sister there, but if they can’t come for whatever reason, my neighbor will be there instead.”

"
"
Talk to your partner first.,
Ask the other person if they are willing.,
Thank them.,
Teach children what to expect in the delivery room.,
Turn down people firmly.",How to Choose Who Should Stay in the Delivery Room3," If your partner is involved with the birth, make sure that you have a discussion about who will be in the delivery room. If you want a large crowd but your partner wants it to be private, you may need to compromise. Remember that when it comes to the birth, the most important thing is that you are relaxed and comfortable., Once you have settled on a final list, reach out to each person. It may be best to ask them over the phone or in person, as this is a very personal decision. Remember that births can be stressful for other people, so they may prefer to be in the waiting room instead. When you ask them, respect their decision.


You can say, “I was wondering if you could be in the delivery room with me when I give birth. Is that something you’re willing to do?”
You could also try explaining why you want them there. You might state, “You are such a calming influence in my life that I would appreciate having you there by my side when I give birth.”

, Even if they declined to join you, thank them for their support. Let them know that you appreciate their role in your life. If they have decided to join you, emphasize that you are grateful for the support that they will provide.


If they agreed, you might say, ""Thank you so much. Your presence will make the birth truly special.""
If they decline, you can say, ""I completely understand. Thank you anyways.""

, If you are bringing the baby's siblings into the delivery room, you should make sure that they understand what happens during birth. Explain that birth can be painful or stressful but that they shouldn't worry about your health. When the time comes, give them plenty of toys and distractions during labor.You might say, ""We want you to be there when your sibling arrives. Just understand that birth can be messy. I might sound like I'm in pain, but the doctors will be taking care of me.""
You may want to have an extra adult there just to watch the children and care for them. You do not want to be worried or distracted or by the children while in labor. If the children need to be removed, this adult can take them out.

, Some people may want to be in the delivery room, even if you would prefer that they remain outside. In this case, state your wishes firmly. Tell them that while you appreciate their support, you would like them to be in the waiting room.You can say, “I appreciate your support, but I want to keep it small in the delivery room. You can come visit the baby as soon as they are born.”
If the person in question comes from your partner’s family, such as their parents, you should ask your partner to talk to them. Make sure your partner expresses that this decision was made as a couple. They should say, “We have decided to keep it private,” not “she doesn’t want you guys around.”"

Follow your instincts.",How to Choose Between an Obstetrician and a Midwife," OB-GYNs are physicians who specialize in women’s health. They complete medical school and an obstetric residency program, then take written and oral exams to achieve board certification with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the official organization for obstetricians and gynecologists in the United States. They are trained to perform surgery (including cesarean section), handle complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth, and prescribe medications.


Some OB-GYNs complete additional training to specialize in particular aspects of women’s health care, such as infertility treatment or gynecological cancer.;
, CNMs complete nursing school, become registered nurses, and undertake additional training in midwifery. They then pass exams to achieve certification from the American College of Nurse Midwives, the official organization for midwives in the United States. They can generally prescribe medications, depending on state law, but they cannot perform surgery or handle high-risk cases.

, Because obstetricians are M.D.s, they approach pregnancy and childbirth through a scientific and medical lens. This approach has advantages and disadvantages.


A medical approach is beneficial if you have a higher risk pregnancy and are likely to need specialized medical care. OB-GYNs are the only health care professionals who can handle any complication that develops, including the need for surgery.
On the other hand, a medical approach sometimes leads to unnecessary drugs or interventions. Some women who use obstetricians find that their pregnancies and birth experiences become unnecessarily medicalized. Childbirth is a natural process, and most healthy women do not need high-tech interventions.

, You can try to have a natural birth with either an obstetrician or a nurse-midwife. In general, though, women who use midwives tend to use less pain medication and fewer interventions, and they are much less likely to wind up needing cesarean sections.

, Obstetricians are generally the best choice for any pregnancy that is considered “high risk.” If you have a chronic health problem like heart disease or epilepsy, your pregnancy will likely fall into this category. You’ll need to see an obstetrician and, in some cases, a perinatologist (a specialist in high risk pregnancies).


Note that in many areas, you may be able to see a midwife for normal prenatal visits and an obstetrician or other medical specialist for your medical needs. Regardless, your obstetrician will be in charge of your pregnancy and delivery.

, If you have been pregnant before, consider any complications. Did you develop gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or another problem? Did you need an emergency cesarean section or other medical interventions? If so, you may want to choose an obstetrician trained to deal with those scenarios. If not, you can safely consider using a midwife instead.

, If you find you are carrying twins or triplets, you may need an obstetrician to help you deal with the medical problems that carrying multiples can present. If you are pregnant with a single baby, a midwife may be your best option.

, Depending on the reasons for your c-section, you may be able to have a normal pregnancy and a vaginal delivery. Talk to your doctor, but if having a vaginal delivery after a previous cesarean section (VBAC) is important to you, consider using a midwife. Midwives have much better success rates for VBACs.

, Whichever health care professional you choose, you will check in monthly through your seventh month or so, then biweekly for the eighth month and weekly during the ninth. Both practitioners will check your weight, measure your belly, test your urine, and listen to the fetal heartbeat.

, Whichever practitioner you choose, you will have access to laboratory work, ultrasounds, amniocentesis, and other testing.

, While both types of providers offer the same prenatal care, midwives tend to spend more time with their patients. Most set aside extra time to answer all of your questions, provide extra information about your pregnancy, and discuss any concerns you may have. Good obstetricians will listen and answer your questions too, but they are usually more rushed and therefore prioritize getting through each appointment efficiently. Ask yourself which approach you prefer.

, There are exceptions, but in general, midwives provide more emotional support. Obstetricians understand their job to be providing medical care to pregnant women; midwives take a more holistic approach. Ask yourself which style you prefer. Some women want a supportive practitioner who will listen to their concerns and offer emotional support; others prefer a more businesslike relationship, seeking emotional support from other people, like their partners, friends, and family members.

, In the United States, most women give birth in hospitals, but you may also consider using a birthing center of delivering your baby at home. Depending on your preference, you may need a particular kind of provider:


If you want to give birth in a hospital, you can generally use either an OB-GYN or a CNM. Ask potential practitioners which hospitals they are affiliated with so that you know what your options will be.
If you want to give birth in a birthing center, you will likely need a midwife. Birthing centers are alternatives to hospitals; they aim to provide a comfortable and lower-tech setting for healthy women with low-risk pregnancies to give birth. Unlike hospitals, they tend to let you wear your own clothes, eat when you are hungry, and soak in a warm bath during labor and delivery if desired. Birthing centers are typically staffed by CNMs. Note that if an emergency arises, you will need to be transported to a hospital.
If you want to give birth at home, you will definitely need a midwife, and you may need to do some research to find a CNM in your area who is willing to deliver your baby at home. For most healthy women with low-risk pregnancies, home birth is safe. Be aware, however, that if you develop any complications, you will need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible. In addition, know that many health insurance plans do not cover home births.

, If you are healthy, have a low-risk pregnancy, and want to give birth without unnecessary medications, interventions, or surgeries, then a CNM may be right for you. In general, midwives do a better job at coaching their patients through labor and delivery naturally. Women who give birth with midwives are less likely, for example, to wind up with epidurals, episiotomies, forceps deliveries, or cesarean sections.

, Generally speaking, you’ll have more options for pain management with an obstetrician (and obstetricians will be more likely to suggest pain medication). Midwives will be more likely to suggest natural pain relief techniques (breathing, massage, changing your position, laboring in a warm bath) first; however, they can give certain pain medications, and if you deliver in a hospital, you can get an epidural with either type of practitioner.

, Many midwives will stay with you from the early stages of labor through the delivery of your baby, coaching you and providing various kinds of support. If this is desirable to you, you should look for a CNM rather than an OB-GYN. Obstetricians will usually check in on you periodically until it is time to deliver your baby, but they will not stay by your side; in general, they leave most of that care to nurses.

, If you have a spouse or partner, talk to that person about what kind of prenatal care and childbirth experience you want. You are the one having the baby, but he or she should also have a chance to voice preferences and concerns.

, If you know women who have recently given birth, talk to them about their experiences. They may have insights about obstetricians and midwives, and they may be able to answer your questions. Furthermore, if they live in your area, they can recommend (or advise against) certain practitioners.

, If you are low risk and still undecided about which kind of practitioner you want, get referrals for at least one of each, and meet with them to discuss your concerns and answer your questions. Ask them about their approaches to prenatal visits and pain management during labor, and find out where they deliver their patients’ babies. Choose the practitioner that feels like the best fit for you personally.

, If you have done your research and considered all the options, then go with your gut. Assuming that you are healthy and have no serious pregnancy-related risks, there really is no wrong decision here. If you feel more comfortable in a hospital setting with a physician managing your pregnancy, labor, and delivery, then go with an obstetrician. If you feel more comfortable approaching pregnancy from a natural perspective and want a provider who will stay by your side throughout your labor and delivery, then go with a midwife.

Start with two breaths to one ""blow."",
Work on slow, patterned breathing.,
Try using a focus.,
Use breathing when you're stressed.,
Employ breathing when you feel pain.,
Induce a labored state.,
Have someone help you.,
Start with slow patterned breathing.,
Use your rapid patterned breathing.,
Listen to your support.,
Let it all out.,
Find your rhythm.",How to Breathe During Labor," A basic slow breathing pattern is breathing in twice to every single time you breathe out. It's a quicker breathing pattern than how you breathe normally, about twice as fast as normal.You can try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth, though do whatever you are most comfortable with. You'll be using this type of breathing later on in your labor.
You can also use a more even ratio, such as one-to-one, or a higher ratio, using up to six breaths in for every breath out.
Try out different patterns to figure out what seems best to you. You should feel comfortable using the breathing pattern, and you should fall into what seems easiest to you.;
, Slow breathing can help you get through the early contractions. When using slow patterned breathing, you should be at about half your normal breathing pace. It can help to take a very deep breath at the beginning and at the end of your slow, patterned breathing, particularly when you're starting and ending a contraction.Close your eyes, and breathe in to the count of four through your nose. Breathe out to the count of four through your mouth. Continue at this slow pace.

, A focus can help keep your attention away from your pain and on your breathing. You can use an actual object, such as a picture or even just a dot you isolate on the ceiling. You can also create an image in your mind, or focus on someone close to you., You want your patterned breathing to become a normal response to stress and pain. Therefore, you need to employ it in your everyday life. When you find yourself feeling stressed, slip into your special pattern of breathing, using it to calm yourself down.Try the slow breathing when you're feeling stressed.

, Another way to normalize this type of breathing is to try it when you are in pain. For instance, you can try it when you have a headache, or even if you have a cut (that you've cleaned and bandaged) causing you pain. Try to use your breathing to distract you from the pain.Try the faster breathing when you're trying to work through pain.

, If you find you aren't getting enough practice, one way to get practice in is to try holding an ice cube in your hand. As you hold it, try to breathe through the cold and pain, using the pattern you chose. Doing this exercise regularly can help you learn to use it when you're in labor.Try both types of breathing in this exercise.

, It can be beneficial to have someone work on breathing with you. It should be the person who will be with you when you have the baby. That way, if you feel like you can't slip into your breathing pattern, the person can help coach you through it.Have them coach you on breathing when you're trying to work through pain. They can breathe with you, or use words to help you breath ""in-in-out, in-in-out.""

, When your early contractions start getting to the point that they make you stop what you're doing, it's time to start some slow breathing. Breathe in through your nose, taking a deep breath. As you breathe out through your mouth, let your body relax completely. Keep taking slow, deep breaths, focusing your attention on relaxing your body., As your contractions get more intense and closer again, you can slip into the patterned breathing that you chose. For more painful contractions, you may need the quicker, shorter pattern to help you get through them. Don't forget to focus on something if you need to, such as a picture or your partner.Try panting. You may need to move to short, shallow breaths to get through some of the more intense pain, panting almost like a dog., Your birthing team and your support person will be there to help you. Of course, you need to do what feels right, but they can help you get back on track with your breathing if you get off. Try to listen to them to help you find your rhythm., Don't be afraid to cry out, scream, or moan. You do what you need to do to get through labor. Your birthing team has heard it all, and making any noise you need to can help you get through it. In fact, most of the noises you make will be involuntary., During labor, you may find that the pattern you chose earlier doesn't work as well as you'd hoped. Let your body guide you. Use whatever breathing pattern helps you through the labor process, as that is what's best for you in the moment."

Being a doula can be rewarding, but also stressful. You want to make sure the path is right for you before pursuing training and certification.As a birth doula, you will provide emotional support during labor, and also help women with breathing and delivery. Many women who hire doulas prefer home birth, so you must be comfortable working outside the hospital setting. Some doulas are postpartum doulas, and aid women and families during the first months of an infant's life.
You can make money by becoming a doula. Doulas generally charge between $250 and $1,500 for home birth services. You can also work as a volunteer doula, which may be a great way to gain initial experience. Some doulas are hired through hospitals, although most work independently as small business owners.;
, If you want to be a birth doula, you will assist during the actual process of childbirth. There are different types of birth doulas who specialize in different types of pregnancy and labor.Birth doulas support the woman during the last few weeks of pregnancy, as well as during the labor process. Your goal as a doula is to make pregnancy a positive and empowering experience for women. In addition to medical knowledge, you need to have good people skills as you'll be helping women and their families manage the stress of childbirth.
An antepartum doula specifically works with high risk pregnancies. Often, women are confined to their beds during these pregnancies, so you will be caring for women in the weeks leading up to child birth.
Some birth doulas work specifically with adoptive parents and birth mothers. In addition to delivering the baby, you will help birth parents and adoptive parents mange the emotions associated with adoption.

, Not all doulas assist with childbirth. Some doulas work with women postpartum to help with childcare. Other doulas help women manage emotions after a miscarriage.Postpartum doulas work with a women for the first few weeks after an infant is born. As a postpartum doula, you will help women learn the best means of breastfeeding, assist with general childcare, and help families manage the emotional transition of a new baby.
Loss doulas primarily care for women who have suffered pregnancy loss or loss during pregnancy. You will help women learn grieving techniques, aid with funeral arrangements if necessary, and help out with basic household chores while a family is bereaved.

, If you decide you want to become a doula, you should research national and international doula organizations. You can call or email these organizations, or simply browse their websites. Such organizations can provide you with reading material, as well as provide guidance on training and certification programs in your area.Birth Arts International offers international certification and support for doula, postpartum doula, childbirth educator and bereavement certifications. They work with doulas in over 100 countries and offer eLearning, distance learning and training workshops.
Doulas of North America International (DONA) offers international certification, and can be a source of guidance for doulas worldwide.
Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA) can offer guidance, training, and certification for those who want to work as doulas and postpartum doulas.
Childbirth International works with doulas in over 100 countries worldwide. It provides certification for all types of doulas, and has many branches in the United States.

, Once you're ready to pursue training, seek out training programs in your area and price range. Keep a list of training programs on-hand, and jot down the pros and cons of each program.It can be helpful to browse the website of an organization like Birth Arts International or DONA. You can see if there are any doula training programs in your area.
If money is an issue, some organizations provide scholarships or are very low cost. Check tuition costs when browsing programs.

, Once you have a long list of potential programs, you will need to select the right program for you. There are a variety of factors to consider in regards to what kind of doula training will meet your needs.Look into the trainers in the program. Do they practice birthing and postpartum care that fits with your personal ethics? Where were they trained? Do they have certification from reputable doula organizations?
How do you learn best? If you're a hands-on learner, you'll want a program that primarily trains by allowing you to work in the field. If you prefer lecture-based learning, a program that provides a lot of reading and classroom work may work better for you. An online program may even be sufficient.
If you're getting trained locally, make sure the trainer knows the local birth scene. If your trainer is already well-known, using his or her name can help you get clients. A trainer who knows the birth scene can also help you get acquainted with local hospitals and birthing centers.

, Many women prefer doulas as they're more personal than doctors and medical professionals. Therefore, the emotional support you provide will be a big part of your job. During training, pay attention to instructions on how to care for a mother emotionally.Techniques vary by training program. In some programs, you will learn in a classroom setting. You may learn a bit about basic psychology, and receive lectures from experienced, certified doulas. Take notes and stay attentive. You want to know how to develop your emotional intelligence for the job.
For some programs, you may work with an experienced doula during postpartum care or childbirth. Pay attention to how this doulas provides support. How does she ease the stress for the mother?

, This is especially important if you're training to become a birth doula. You will have classes on the anatomy of labor, as well as medical interventions like epidurals.You want to have a heavy amount of medical knowledge as a doula. You should be able to help a mother form a birth plan, and answer any questions along the way. Medical expertise is also necessary to successfully deliver a baby.
There will probably be a great deal of required reading regarding childbirth, labor, and so on. Read all textbooks carefully and ask instructors if you have any questions. You should leave doula training prepared to answer medical questions regarding childbirth.

, The length of training programs vary. Some may take only a few months, while others will take a year or more. Upon completion of your training, you can become certified. You may need certain documents from your program to obtain certification.For example, if you got certified through a DONA or Birth Arts International program, you will need to submit a variety of forms confirming you completed the necessary training. Once you've submitted these forms, you can expect to receive your certification.
The best way to figure what forms you need is to ask at your training program. Someone should be able to tell you which forms, if any, you need to become certified.

, Once you've completed your training program, you can become certified. Each program has different requirements for certification. Upon completing your program, an advisor in your program should be able to tell you what steps you need to take to gain your official certification.In some programs, you may be presented with certification on the last day, or at a graduation ceremony. For others, you may need to mail in paperwork to receive your certification.

, See if you can find a program that takes on doulas as volunteers. Volunteering can be a great way to help mothers who cannot afford a doula. It can also help you gain experience while establishing yourself professionally.Look for programs in your area. Contact a local hospital and see if they offer such programs.
Programs vary greatly. You may be set up with a mother for the weeks leading up to birth. However, you may also be on-call. You may be called in to assist with a birth at any point while signed up as a volunteer.

, You should make flyers, brochures, and business cards that advertise your services as a doula. Start placing your ads in places you're likely to find expectant mothers.Hospital settings can be great places to put up your brochures. An OB-GYN's office may not be a good options, as mothers here are likely going the traditional route. However, see if you can place brochures at services that conduct things like ultrasounds.
You can also look into places like daycare centers, community centers for children and mothers, and stores that sell baby supplies.
Always ask before putting up advertisements.

, If you want to look professional, you should have an office space in your home. Clear out a room and put a desk in it, and make sure to hang up your certification and anything else that showcases your training and expertise. You can conduct meetings here with potential clients.An office can give you legitimacy. Clients may be more comfortable working with someone who maintains a professional atmosphere.
Consider taking a business education program or client attraction training to further develop your business.
Maintain regular business hours. This can also make you look professional.

, As a doula, your job is to work with mothers. You want to be respectful of things like birth plans, as well as plans for postpartum care. Make sure you keep communication between you and your patients open and honest.Emotional support is a big part of your role as a doula. Many women and families opt for doulas over doctors as they believe doulas will be less clinical and cold in their approach. Therefore, be as kind as you can to expectant mothers and families. Make sure to be emotionally intelligent in addition to being knowledgable of childbirth and postpartum care.

That way, even if you have to deliver the baby yourself, help will arrive soon if you experience complications. The dispatcher should also be able to either talk you through the delivery or connect you to someone who can.


If the mother has a doctor or midwife, call that person too. The medical professional can often stay on the phone and help guide you through the process.;
, The first stage of labor is called the “latent” stage, where the body is getting ready to deliver by dilating the cervix. It can take a long time, especially if this is the woman's first child.The second, or “active” stage occurs when the cervix has completely dilated.Women may not experience as much pain or discomfort during this stage as later stages.
If the woman is fully dilated and you can see the baby's head crowning, she's in stage two. Wash your hands, skip to the next section and get ready to catch the baby.
Unless you have been trained to do so, don't try to examine the cervix. Just watch to see if the head begins to appear.

, Time the contractions from the beginning of one to the beginning of the next, and note how long they last. The further along labor is, the more regular, stronger, and closer together contractions become.Here's what you need to know about contractions:


Contractions that are 10 minutes apart or less are a sign that the mother has entered labor.Physicians recommend that you contact the hospital when contractions are 5 minutes apart and last 60 seconds, and this activity has been going for an hour.If this is the case, you probably have time to make it to the hospital if you live close to one.
First-time mothers are likely to give birth when contractions are three to five minutes apart and last 40 to 90 seconds, increasing in strength and frequency for at least an hour.If the contractions are two minutes or less apart, buckle down and get ready to deliver the baby, especially if the mother's had other children and they were fast labors. Also, if the mother feels like she's going to have a bowel movement, the baby is probably moving through the birth canal, creating pressure on the rectum, and is on its way out.
If the baby is preterm, you should contact the mother's physician and emergency services at any signs of labor.

, Remove any jewelry, such as rings or watches. Wash your hands thoroughly with antimicrobial soap and warm water. Scrub your arms all the way up to your elbows. If you have the time, wash your hands for five minutes; if you don’t have time for that, wash them thoroughly for at least one minute.Remember to scrub in between your fingers and under your nails. Use a nail brush or even a toothbrush to clean under your nails.Wear sterile gloves if available. Don’t wear things like dishwashing gloves, which are likely loaded with bacteria.
To finish (or if you don't have access to soap and water), use an alcohol-based hand sanitizing product or rubbing alcohol to kill off any bacteria and viruses that may have been on your skin. This helps prevent giving the mother or the baby an infection.

, Get set up so that you have everything you'll need within easy reach, and so the mother is as comfortable as possible. There will be a mess afterwards, so you may want to have the birthing area somewhere you don't mind getting messy.Collect clean towels and clean sheets. If you have clean waterproof tablecloths or a clean vinyl shower curtain, these are excellent at preventing blood and other fluids from staining furniture or carpeting. In a pinch, you can use newspapers, but they are not as sanitary.
Get a blanket or something warm and soft to wrap the baby in. The infant must be kept warm once it’s delivered.
Find a few pillows. You might need them to prop up the mother as she's pushing. Cover them with clean sheets or towels.
Fill a clean bowl with warm water, and get a pair of scissors, a few lengths of string, rubbing alcohol, cotton balls, and a bulb syringe. You may find that sanitary napkins or paper towels are helpful to stop the bleeding later.
Get a bucket in case the mother feels nauseated or the need to vomit. You may also want to get a glass of water for the mother. Labor is hard work.

, She may feel panicky, rushed, or embarrassed. Do your best to remain calm and reassuring to help her relax.


Ask the mother to undress from the waist down. Provide her with a clean sheet or towel to cover up, if she'd like.
Encourage her to breathe. Avoid hyperventilation by speaking in a low, soothing voice and verbally directing her breathing. Encourage her to inhale through her nose and out through her mouth in an even, rhythmic manner. If you're still having trouble, hold her hand and take deep, slow breaths along with her.Reassure her. This is probably not the birthing experience she had in mind, and she might be worried about potential complications. Tell her help is on the way, and you'll do the best you can in the meantime. Remind her that people have given birth outside of hospitals for thousands of years, and it's more than possible to come through it safely.
Validate her. The mother may feel scared, angry, giddy, or any combination of those feelings. Validate whatever she is feeling. Don’t try to correct her or argue with her., She might want to walk around or crouch down during this stage of labor, especially when a contraction hits. As she starts to transition to the second phase, she might want to settle into a position to give birth or cycle through a few different ones. Switching between positions may help the labor progress more smoothly, but let her decide what’s working for her body.Here are four standard positions, and the pros and cons of each:Squatting. This puts gravity to the mother's advantage, and can open the birth canal 20%-30% more than other positions. If you suspect the baby is breech (emerging feet-first), suggest this position as it gives the baby room to rotate. You can help the mother in this position by kneeling behind her and supporting her back.All-fours: This position is gravity-neutral and can ease back pain, and the mother might instinctively choose it. It can provide pain relief if the mother has hemorrhoids. Position yourself behind her if that's the case.Side-lying: This leads to a slower descent through the birth canal, but can lead to a more gentle stretching of the perineum and may reduce tearing.Have the mother lie on her side, with her knees bent, and lift the top leg. She might also need to prop herself up on an elbow.
Lithotomy position (lying back). This is the most common position used in hospitals, with the woman lying flat on her back and her legs bent at the knee. It allows maximum access for the caregiver, but it puts a lot of pressure on the mother's back and is not considered ideal.It also may make contractions slower and more painful.If she seems to prefer this position, try putting a few pillows under her back to ease the pain.

, Don't encourage her to push until she feels an unstoppable pressure to do so — you don't want to waste her energy and make her exhausted too early. When women are ready to push, they may feel increased pressure near their lower back, perineum, or rectum. It may even feel to her as though she is ready to have a bowel movement.When she is ready, though, you can help guide her through the pushing.


Ask the mother to curl forward and tuck her chin. This curved position will help the baby through the pelvis.When pushing, it can be helpful if the mother holds her knees or legs with her hands and pulls her legs back.
The area around the vagina will bulge out until you see the top of the baby's head (crowning). As soon as the baby crowns, it's time for the mother to push in earnest.
Encourage her to focus her abdominal muscles to push down, as you might do when you’re trying to urinate faster or have a bowel movement. This can help avoid straining or directing the pushing force upward toward the neck and face.Three to four pushes, lasting 6-8 seconds each, are considered appropriate per contraction. However, it is important to encourage the mother to do whatever comes naturally to her.Keep encouraging deep, slow breathing. Pain can be controlled to different extents through mental relaxation and by concentrating on deep breathing instead of panicking or being distracted by everything that is going on. Different people have different levels of mental control, but deep, slow breathing is always a benefit during childbirth.Understand that the woman may urinate or have a bowel movement during labor. This is normal and is not a cause for concern. Don’t even bother mentioning it -- you don’t want to embarrass the mother., This step isn't complicated, but it's important. Pay extra attention to these tips:



Do not pull on the baby's head or the umbilical cord. This can cause nerve damage.If the cord is wrapped around the baby's neck, which is fairly common, gently lift it over the baby's head or carefully loosen it so the baby can slip through the loop. Do not pull on the cord.
It’s natural -- and in fact desirable -- for the baby to pass through the pelvis face-down. If the baby’s face is facing toward the mother’s back, don’t worry. This is actually the best position for delivery.If instead of the head emerging you see the feet or buttocks coming first, you have a breech birth. See instructions for that situation below.

, When the baby's head rotates to one side (which it will probably do on its own), be prepared for the body to come out with the next push.


If the baby's head does not rotate to one side, ask the mother to push again. The baby will likely rotate spontaneously.
If the baby's head doesn't rotate without help, gently turn it to one side. This should help a shoulder emerge with the next push. Don't push it if you feel any resistance.
Deliver the other shoulder. Gently lift the body toward the mother's stomach to help the other shoulder come through. The rest of the body should follow quickly.
Keep supporting the head. The body will be slippery. Make sure you're still providing enough support for the baby's neck, which isn't strong enough to support the head on its own., Hopefully, all goes well and you've successfully delivered a healthy baby by now. If the delivery seems stalled, though, here's what you can do:


If the head comes out and the rest of the body doesn't come out after she pushes three times, have the mother lie on her back. Instruct her to grab her knees and pull her thighs toward her stomach and chest. This is called the McRoberts position, and it's very effective at helping push the baby out.Have her push hard with each contraction.
Never push on a mother's abdomen to try to help deliver a stuck baby.
If the feet come out first, see the section on breech birth below.
If the baby is still stuck and paramedics are still nowhere near the scene, you could try to guide the baby's head gently downward toward the mother's rectum. This should only be attempted as a last resort, and should not be attempted at all if medical attention will be arriving soon.

, Hold the delivered baby with two hands, one supporting its neck and head. Tilt the head down at about a 45-degree angle to allow the fluids to drain. The feet should be slightly above the head (but don't hold the baby by the feet).


You can also wipe any mucus or amniotic fluid from the nose and mouth area with clean, sterile gauze or cloth., Ensure full-skin contact, and cover them both with clean towels or blankets. The skin-to-skin contact encourages a hormone called oxytocin, which will help the mother deliver the placenta.Position the baby so that it's head is still slightly lower than the rest of the body, so fluids can keep draining. If the mother is lying down and the baby's head is on her shoulder and its body is on her breast, this should happen naturally., It should be crying slightly. If it's not, you can take a few steps to help make sure the airway is clear.


Rub the body. Physical touch will help the baby breathe. Rub over it's back firmly with a blanket while it's still on its mother's chest. If that's not helping, turn the baby so that it's facing the ceiling, tilt the head back to straighten the airway, and keep rubbing the body. It might not cry, but doing this ensures that the baby gets the air it needs.Rubbing vigorously with a clean towel can also help stimulate the baby to breathe.
Manually clear fluids. If the baby gags or turns blue, wipe fluids out of the mouth and nose with a clean blanket or cloth. If that doesn't do the trick, squeeze the air out of a bulb syringe, put the tip in the nose or mouth, and release the bulb to suck the fluid into the bulb. Repeat until all the fluid is cleared, emptying the bulb between uses. If you don't have a bulb, you can use a drinking straw.
If nothing else has worked, try flicking the soles of the baby's feet with your fingers, or gently popping its bottom. Don't slap the baby.If none of this helps, perform infant CPR.

, If it happens, a breech birth is a circumstance where the feet or buttocks enter the pelvis first instead of the head coming out., Have her sit at the edge of a bed or other surface and pull her legs to her chest. As a precaution, put down pillows or blankets where the baby is likely to fall.

, You'll see its back and bottom hang down and you'll want to grab it, but don't. You want to avoid touching the baby until the head is delivered because your touch could stimulate the baby to gasp while the head is still submerged in amniotic fluid.Try to make sure the room is warm, as a drop in temperature could also cause the baby to gasp., Once the head is delivered, grab the baby under the arms and bring it up to the mother. If the head doesn't come out in the push after the arms come out, have the mother squat and push.

, Delivering the placenta is the third stage of labor. It will arrive anywhere between a few minutes to an hour after the baby is delivered.The mother will probably feel an urge to push after a few minutes; this is helpful.Put a bowl close to the vagina. Right before it emerges, blood will come out of the vagina and the cord will get longer.
Have the mother sit up and push the placenta into the bowl.
Rub the mother's stomach below her belly button firmly to help slow down the bleeding. It might hurt her, but it's necessary. Keep rubbing until the uterus feels like a large grapefruit in the lower belly., If the cord isn't stretched too tightly by doing so, encourage the mother to breastfeed as soon as possible. This will help stimulate a contraction and encourage the delivery of the placenta. It may also help slow bleeding.If breastfeeding isn't an option, stimulating the nipples can also help stimulate delivering the placenta., As the placenta is delivering, don't tug on the cord to hurry it along. Let it come out on its own as the mother pushes. Pulling on it could cause severe damage., Once the placenta is out, place it in a trash bag or a container with a lid. When and if the mother goes to a hospital, the doctor might want to inspect the placenta for any abnormalities.

, You should only cut the umbilical cord if professional medical attention is hours away.Otherwise, leave it alone and just make sure it's not pulled tight.If you do need to cut the cord, first feel the cord gently for a pulse. After about ten minutes, the cord will stop pulsing because the placenta has separated. Don't cut it before then.Don't worry about pain. There are no nerve endings in an umbilical cord; neither mother nor child will feel pain when its cut. The cord will, however, be slippery and difficult to handle.Tie a string or lace around the cord, about three inches from the baby's belly button. Tie it tightly with a double knot.
Tie another lace about two inches away from the first one, again using a double knot.
Using a sterile knife or scissors (that have been boiled in water for 20 minutes or wiped down with rubbing alcohol), cut between the two laces. Don't be surprised if it's rubbery and tough to cut; just take your time.
Cover the baby again when the cord is cut.

, Cover them both in blankets, and encourage the mother to keep the baby on her chest. Replace any wet or dirty bedding, and move them to a clean, dry area.


Control pain. Put an ice pack on the mother's vagina for the first 24 hours to ease soreness and pain. Offer her acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen if she's not allergic.
Give the mother something light to eat and a drink. Avoid carbonated drinks and fatty or sugary foods, as these could cause nausea. Toast, crackers, or light sandwiches are good options. The mother may want to rehydrate with an electrolyte-containing sports drink.Put a diaper on the baby. Make sure it's below the umbilical cord. If the cut cord smells bad (signaling an infection) clean it with alcohol until it doesn't smell anymore. If you have a small hat available, put it on the baby so it doesn’t catch a chill.

, Sometimes, unexpected deliveries can cause hemorrhaging after delivery. It occurs in up to 18% of all deliveries. To help prevent this, you can firmly massage the uterus. If you see significant blood flow after the placenta is delivered, do the following:Place one (clean) hand inside the vagina. Place your other hand low on the mother's abdomen. Push down with the hand placed on the abdomen as you push against the uterus from the inside with the other hand.You can also make firm, repetitive squeezing movements with on hand on the mother's lower abdomen without placing a hand inside the vagina., Instruct and if necessary help the mother pour warm water over the vagina every time she urinates in order to keep the area clean. You can use a clean squeeze bottle to do this.If she needs to have a bowel movement, have her place a clean pad or washcloth against her vagina while she pushes.
Help the mother urinate. It is good for her to empty her bladder, but due to blood loss, it may be best to have her urinate in a pan or on a cloth you can move from under her so she does not have to get up.

, Once delivery is complete, proceed to the nearest hospital or await the ambulance you called.

Look into the reputations of local hospitals and birthing centers.,
Think about your general health.,
Take a tour.,
Learn about educational offerings at your local hospital or birthing center.",How to Choose a Birth Hospital1," A primary concern regarding your selection will be financial.Insurance companies are required to provide directories listing local options in your area, along with a summary of benefits showing what is covered.Ask, “Does my plan cover services at birthing centers?” “Which local birthing centers are covered by my plan?” “If I choose a water birth, is that service covered?”
You also need to find out about coverage at local hospitals: “If I have to stay extra nights at the hospital because of complications, are those covered?”;
, Your choice of hospital or birthing center may be determined by the doctor or midwife you choose.Most doctors only have admitting privileges at specific hospitals.
At birthing centers, most of the care is provided by midwives.
Talk with your provider about what type of care you prefer: “I really want a natural childbirth experience. Can you treat me at a birthing center instead of a hospital?”
Find out if you have choices if you are not happy with where your provider usually delivers: “I have not heard great things about that hospital, can you help me deliver at a different facility?”

, Once you’ve narrowed down your choices, it is time to figure out whether they offer quality care and the extras you may be looking for.


Ask friends who have recently given birth for recommendations. They will be able to give you first-hand insights on the care they received. You can ask questions like: “How was the nursing care? Did you have to wait long when you asked for assistance or pain relief?” or “Did you get to keep the baby with you immediately after delivery, or was the baby taken away for an exam?”
Research the hospitals or birthing centers online to see how they have been reviewed by patients.
Check to see whether local birthing centers are accredited. The Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers has an interactive, online tool to research birthing centers across the country., Depending on certain medical conditions, you may only be a candidate for a hospital birth.Talk with your health care provider to find out if you are having a healthy enough pregnancy to give birth at a birthing center or if you need to be at a hospital.


Most birthing centers cannot handle high-risk pregnancies, such as those for mothers older than 35 or mothers carrying multiples. Talk with your health care provider about your specific concerns.

, Once you’ve narrowed down your choices between hospitals and/or birthing centers, schedule a tour.Being on site at your potential delivery hospital or center will help you figure out some logistical basics, such as where to park, which doors are open in the middle of the night, and the best route to the maternity ward.
You will be able to meet some of the staff and ask questions like, “Who can be in the room during delivery?” or “Is my partner allowed to stay overnight?” or “What are the security policies at the hospital/center?” or “Do you have tubs for laboring in?”
Pay attention to the comfort level of the delivery and recovery rooms.

, In addition to serving as the potential site of your baby’s birth, these facilities can be a good resource for learning more about becoming a mom.Do they offer childbirth classes?
Are classes available on baby CPR, general baby care, or babyproofing your house?
Are there support groups available for new mothers or new fathers?
Do they offer breast feeding support?

Insert your tampon as you normally would.,
Make sure you're comfortable.",How to Use a Tampon While Swimming1," You should be comfortable with wearing a tampon regularly before you venture into the pool. To use a tampon, just pull it out of its wrapper, find a comfortable position that allows you to position the thicker applicator half of the tampon into your vagina, and then press the thinner applicator end into the top half until it goes as far up as it can, moving the tampon further up your vagina. Once you feel that the tampon is firmly in place, gently remove the applicator.


You should feel the tampon move all the way into your vagina and out of the applicator. If you don't push it back far enough, it'll come out with the applicator.;
, Walk around, sit, and just move around a bit to make sure you can't feel the tampon in your vagina. If it hurts or you can still feel it, try again or insert your finger in your vagina to push it up further. Sometimes, if the tampon cannot be further inserted your period may be coming to an end. In that case, you should avoid trying to force it if it hurts too much.

Avoid processed soy products.,
Eat miso.,
Eat tempeh.",How to Use Soy for PCOS1," Consuming soy in food has been linked to a number of health benefits, including relief of menopausal symptoms, prevention of breast and prostate cancer, reduction in bone turnover, and reduction in heart disease. In women who are diagnosed with PCOS, consuming soy has also been proven to reduce total and LDL cholesterol, reduce insulin, reduce inflammatory markers, reduce oxidative stress, and reduce levels of testosterone., Each gram of unprocessed soy protein provides 3 to 4 grams of isoflavones. In other words, you should aim to consume roughly 9-12 grams of soy protein per day. If you don’t want to worry about specifics, simply including an unprocessed source of soy protein in your diet 3-4 times per week should help you meet these marks.You can try eating miso, tempeh, tofu, or edamame to get your 36 milligrams.

, In order to reap the health benefits from soy, it is important to consume unprocessed sources of soy protein. These include miso, tempeh, tofu, edamame, high quality soy sauce, and soy nuts.Be sure to always read packages. Tofu, for instance, is sometimes packaged with preservatives and other additives. Good quality tofu should contain only soybeans and a coagulant (such as nigari).

, Processed soy products include soy milk, soy cheese, soy protein powders, and meat alternative products. Try to avoid foods that contain hydrogenated soybean oil and/or soy protein isolate. These products are not good sources of soy isoflavones., Miso is a fermented paste created from soybeans, and it is one of the healthiest and easiest ways to consume beneficial soy isoflavones. Miso can be used in place of (or in addition to) stock or bouillon. It can be used in dressings, gravies, and other sauces. The most popular way to consume miso is to make a pot of miso soup.


Miso can be found at health food stores and Asian markets.
Always read ingredient labels. Avoid miso that contains MSG (monosodium glutamate).

, Tempeh is dense cake of fermented soy beans. It can be sliced, crumbled or chopped, and used in most recipes that call for meat. Tempeh is an excellent source of soy isoflavones.


Try making your own tempeh bacon to use on sandwiches or in other recipes.
Tempeh can be purchased at health food stores and Asian markets.

Consider pain management.,
Know your medical history.,
Ask if your healthcare provider is affiliated with a birthing center.,
Consider the average length of stay.,
Consider emergency procedures.",How to Choose a Birth Hospital2," Some mothers consider birthing centers because they offer a more “natural,” hands-off approach to childbirth.Birth centers are considered “low-tech,” compared with hospitals. Patients are not induced at birth centers, and C-sections are not performed at them.
Additionally, patients do not have continuous fetal monitoring or IVs as soon as they arrive, different from a typical hospital birth experience.
Birthing centers offer comforts such as rocking chairs, whirlpool tubs, and kitchens.
Some birth centers are free-standing facilities, while others are located within or adjacent to typical hospitals., If you want to have some choices considering whether to eat while in labor or what birth position to choose, a birthing center may be your better choice.Most birthing centers allow you to snack or have light meals while in labor, in contrast to hospitals that typically only offer ice chips during this time.
At birthing centers, you can usually give birth in any comfortable position, sometimes in a tub or pool. Additionally, your movements are not restricted during labor., Most birthing centers do not offer epidurals for pain relief.Alternative pain management treatments, such as massage, acupuncture, breathing techniques, and hydrotherapy are some of the options offered at birthing centers., You are not a candidate for a birthing center if you have any medical condition that makes your pregnancy high risk.If you have pregnancy-induced hypertension, high blood pressure, or are a diabetic, a birthing center won’t be able to handle your delivery.
Additional factors that would exclude you from using a birthing center include if you are carrying multiples, if your baby is in a breech position, or if you have had a previous C-section.,


Typically, midwives are the primary caregivers at birthing centers, instead of OB/GYNs. Most medical doctors only deliver babies at hospitals.Doctors at birthing centers are usually on call in case of emergency.

, Many birthing centers release their patients hours after delivery. If you feel you will need more time to recover from childbirth, this may not be the option for you., Although rare, sometimes delivery does not go as expected. Check with your birthing center to see how they handle these complications.Will you be transferred to a local hospital if you have an extremely long or difficult labor?
What if you decide you would like to receive pain management like an epidural after all?
What are the procedures if there is a critical health issue with the baby after delivery?

Ask about the procedures when you arrive in labor. Do you go to the emergency room, or do you proceed immediately to the delivery area? Do you need to call before arriving?

, In addition to your own OB/GYN or midwife, you will likely be seen by other providers. Knowing in advance what to expect can make your experience more pleasurable.Is the anesthesiologist on duty at all times, or will you have to wait for one who is on call to arrive?
Is the Labor and Delivery Department staffed around the clock by an OB/GYN?
What is the nurse to patient ratio?
Will medical residents or students be present at your birth? Can you refuse this?

, While hospitals typically don’t offer as many choices as birthing centers for providing comfort measures during labor, you should find out what is available.Are showers or tubs available during labor?
Can you walk around the hallways, or will you be attached to monitors or IVs that will prevent this?
Is equipment like birthing balls or rocking chairs available?

, It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with how the hospital views certain interventional procedures so that you can know what to expect when you deliver.How often are C-sections performed?
If you are considering a vaginal birth after Cesarean (VBAC), remember this while choosing a birth hospital. To accommodate you, your hospital will need to have medical staff available to perform an immediate, repeat C-section if necessary.Find out the rates for patients receiving induction, epidurals, and episiotomies.
Ask if fetal monitoring is used regularly. Is it external or internal?
What is the average length of stay after childbirth?
If you are a high risk patient, then you might also ask if there is a NICU and what level of care it provides.

, Hospitals offer more options for pain management than birthing centers, but they typically offer fewer birthing options.Most hospitals offer epidurals in addition to alternative forms of anesthesia, which is usually given through an IV.
Ask whether there are options for delivery other than in a hospital bed.

, Ask if there is a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on site, or whether babies with health challenges are transferred to another facility.

, Once you’ve learned about the medical side of labor and delivery, consider what your hospital offers regarding rooms, visitors, and other things that will make your stay comfortable.Is there one room for labor, delivery, and recovery? Is it private or semi-private?
How many people can you have in the delivery room? Can they record the birth or take photos?
Is it typical for the baby to room with you?
Can family members or partners stay overnight?
What are the sibling visitation policies?
Is a lactation consultant available to assist you with breastfeeding?

Choose the right bathing suit.,
Carefully tuck in the tampon string.,
Don't wear pantyliners.,
Consider wearing shorts when you get out of the pool.,
Change your tampon a bit more frequently if you want to.,
Enjoy your swim.",How to Use a Tampon While Swimming2," This is probably not the time to wear your brand new light pink or your bold white bathing suit. Pick a suit of a darker color, just in case you have any leaks. You can also go for a bathing suit with a thicker bottom so you feel less exposed. Just pick something that you're comfortable in that doesn't draw too much attention to your bottom. If you know you have less of a chance of having people see you leaking a bit, you'll be much more comfortable.

, The only thing that could happen is that the tampon string could dangle out of your underwear. Just make sure to tuck it into the bottom of your suit carefully and don't stress out about it. If you'd really like to, you can trim the string a bit with nail scissors, but don't cut it too much or you'll have a hard time getting it out., Pantyliners will not work in the water. Unfortunately, you'll have nothing to keep you from leaking onto the bottom of your suit, though the water will take care of that somewhat. You can wear them to the pool only if you know there's no chance you'll be swimming or even showing your bikini bottom (the pantyliner may be visible.)

, If you want some extra protection and are nervous about getting out of the pool and sunbathing in just your bathing suit while wearing a tampon, then you can just throw on a pair of comfy denim jeans to make you feel more secure when you get out of the water.

, Though you don't have to change your tampon more frequently if you're swimming, if you feel paranoid about needing to change it, or if you feel a little uncomfortable after getting out of the water, then you can change it 2 hours or so early if you'd like to.

, Don't worry so much about swimming with a tampon -- everyone does it. Enjoy your swim without worrying about leakage! Swimming will relieve your cramps, give you some exercise, and make you feel better and happier about being on your period.

If you have thyroid problems in addition to PCOS, you may want to avoid eating soy. Some studies suggest that soy products may interfere with certain thyroid medications. If you have been diagnosed with thyroid problems in addition to PCOS, you should consult your doctor before including soy in your diet., You may have heard to avoid soy products when you are trying to conceive, but this is simply not the case. In fact, soy intake has been linked to improving live birth rates, pregnancy rates, and fertilization rates., If you plan to include soy in your regular diet, it is good to be aware of allergy symptoms. If you experience any symptoms, talk to your doctor. Fortunately, soy allergies tend to be uncomfortable, rather than dangerous. Symptoms will appear minutes to hours after consuming soy.Symptoms of a soy allergy include:


Tingling in the mouth
Hives, itchy skin, or eczema
Swelling of mouth, throat, tongue, or other body parts
Diarrhea, nausea, or other stomach pain
Skin redness

, Consider speaking to you doctor before making any drastic changes to your diet or supplement regimen. Your doctor can help you determine whether or not the inclusion of soy food or soy isoflavone supplements is the right choice for you.

Look for water-based or silicone-based lubricants.,
Apply a vaginal lubricant before sexual activity.,
Use a vaginal moisturizer on a daily basis.,
Try using natural oils.,
Use Vitamin E vaginal suppositories.",How to Treat Vaginal Dryness During Menopause1," Water-based and silicone-based lubricants are good for most women as they are not as irritating to your vagina as oil-based lubricants. You should avoid oil-based lubricants if you use latex condoms as a form of birth control, as the lubricant can cause the condoms to break.Look for water-based lubricants at your local drugstore or online, such as Astroglide, FemGlide, Just Like Me, K-Y Jelly, Pre-Seed, Slippery Stuff, and Summer’s Eve.
You can also buy silicone-based lubricants, such as D Millennium, Pink, Pjur, and Pure Pleasure.
Vaseline jelly, mineral oil, and Elegance Woman’s lubricant are all good oil-based lubricant options. Some women may use oil-based lubricants in a pinch or if they are not able to access water-based and silicone-based lubricants. But be aware that oil-based lubricants can be irritating for some women.;
, Most lubricants are made for use before any sexual activity, as vaginal dryness can make sexual activity uncomfortable and painful. You can use lubricants on a daily basis to deal with vaginal dryness but they are short-lasting so you may need to apply it several times throughout the day.Keep the lubricant somewhere convenient, like on your nightstand or in your bathroom drawer. To apply the lubricant, squirt a few drops onto your hands and rub them together to warm up the lubricant so it is not cold to the touch. You can then apply it in your vagina using clean fingers.Another option is to warm the lubricant by placing the tube in a mug of warm water and letting it warm up. Do not let the lubricant get too hot, as you do not want to burn your skin when you apply it.

, If you looking for a daily solution to vaginal dryness, you may want to try a vaginal moisturizer. Though lubricants can help to reduce irritating friction, moisturizers will be absorbed by your vaginal tissues and mimic the natural secretions in your vagina more effectively. Moisturizer are also good for maintaining a normal pH in your vagina and prevent the development of bacterial or fungal infections.You can also apply vaginal moisturizer two hours before you have sexual intercourse to avoid irritating friction during sex.Warm up the moisturizer with your hands or by placing the package in warm water. Use clean fingers to carefully apply the moisturizer to your vagina.
Look for vaginal moisturizers such as Fresh Start, K-Y Silk-E, Moist Again, Replens, and K-Y Liquibeads.
You can also use a small amount of A & D ointment to help moisturize the area around your vulva.

, Natural oils like grapeseed, olive, sweet almond, sunflower, or coconut oil can be effective for vaginal dryness.

Pushing up this cooler air can cool you down and minimize or prevent night sweats.A room in which air cannot circulate properly can also get hot. A small space obstructed with large objects may not be as a cool as a larger space or one that contains less clutter.;
, It seems counterintuitive that if you want to cool yourself, that you should place a fan on the floor; however, this can push up cool air so that it cools you more effectively.Set the fan in a place where no large objects can obstruct it circulating cool air., Put the fan in a position on the floor in which it points in the direction of the opposite wall. This allows cool air to bounces off the wall and circulate throughout your room.Consider positioning the fan so that it crosses your bed when blowing toward the opposite wall. This may give you some added cooling.
If you find that the air isn’t circulating properly, remove any large objects that may be obstructing the fan. You can also put the fan on a small step or box on the floor so that it can blow more effectively to the opposite wall and around the room., Set a bowl of ice water so that the fan blows across it. This may cool down the air even faster and give you relief from your night sweats.Don’t just use a bowl of ice. Water with ice cubes or chips in it is more effective at cooling than simply ice.
Make sure to keep the bowl of ice water away from any cords so that you don’t electrocute yourself or another person.

, If you’re very hot and feel like the fan isn’t cooling you down quickly enough, double up on your cooling efforts. From air conditioning to another fan, this may cool you down even more.


Put a small clip-on fan on your nightstand and direct it at your head. This may help get cool air to you more quickly.
Turn on the air conditioning if you have it. This can cool down a room much more quickly, especially if you use a fan to bolster the effort.
Set a second fan opposite from the first to create a cross-breeze.
Open a window and allow the fan to blow from the floor across the window's path to the opposite wall.

, Make sure that your bedroom is comfortable, cool, and well ventilated. Controlling factors such as the temperature, your bedding, and air circulation may minimize how severe your night sweats are.Your bedroom should be between 60 to 75°F (15.6 to 23.9°C) for the best sleep.Open a window if it is not too cold.Make sure that your bedding isn’t too tight, which can keep air from circulating around you. In addition, aim to use natural fabrics such as cotton, which breathe and can keep you cooler.
Use a blanket that is heavy enough to keep you comfortable without overheating you. For example, you wouldn’t want to use a heavy down comforter in the summer. Instead, opt for a lighter summer down or basic cotton quilt.
Consider foregoing a flat sheet, which can add further heat.

, Tight pajamas can hold in heat and make you warmer. Wearing loose, smooth-textured, and light clothing may keep you cool and wick away sweat.Smooth clothing made of cotton or merino wool can minimize or prevent excess sweating.You may also want to get pajamas made specifically to keep you cool and wick away sweat.

, Stay away from the temptation to wear too much to bed. Put on pajamas that are appropriate to the weather, which may minimize sweating and overheating.Wear soft and lightweight clothing during the summer. For example, cotton is an option that lets your skin breathe.Layer your pajamas during the winter. This allows more easy removal of clothing items to help you cool down.

, There is some clinical evidence that deep breathing can help reduce night sweats. Using deep breathing exercises before bed may reduce your temperature and relieve your night sweats.Deep breathing helps distribute oxygen throughout your body, which can relax you and may also help relieve the night sweats.Inhale and exhale completely through your nose. Inhale to a count of four, hold your breath for two counts, and then exhale completely to another count of four. Vary the counts of your inhalations and exhalations according to your abilities.To optimize your deep breathing exercises, sit upright and breathe slowly and evenly. Place a hand on your belly and feel it rise as you inhale and lower as you exhale. You want to breathe so that your stomach rises and falls, not your chest.

, There is some evidence that natural remedies such as black cohosh, dang gui bu xue tang, evening primrose oil, St. Johns wort, soy, flax, and many others can help relieve night sweats in the short-term.Speak with your doctor and take herbal remedies if other treatments aren’t helping you.Be aware that herbal supplements and remedies are not regulated by governmental authorities and could be dangerous.
You can get black cohosh and dang bu xue tang at many health food stores and some Chinese medical practitioners., A recent study found that regular physical activity can reduce the number and severity of night sweat episodes.Getting some type of exercise most days may help you manage your night sweats.


Incorporate 30 minutes of activity into your schedule at least five days a week. You can walk, run, jog, swim, or do any other exercise you enjoy.Exercise at least three hours before you go to bed to help your temperature return to normal., If your night sweats are very severe or don’t go away with basic cooling attempts, schedule an appointment with your doctor. They can assess if you have any underlying conditions or are taking medication that can cause night sweats.Be open and honest with your doctor. Let them know when the night sweats started and what makes them better or worse.
It’s especially important to see your doctor if your night sweats are accompanied by fever or other symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, as this may be a sign of a more serious problem.Some conditions that cause night sweats are: menopause or perimenopause, infections such as tuberculosis and abscesses, cancer, hypoglycemia, hormone disorders including hyperthyroidism, and neurologic conditions like neuropathy.Some medications that can cause night sweats are: antidepressants, hormone therapy, and hypoglycemic agents., If your doctor diagnoses an underlying cause for your night sweats, get treatment for it. This may help control or eliminate your night sweats.If you are taking medications that cause night sweats, speak to your doctor about alternative prescriptions that may continue to treat your condition as well as helping manage your night sweats.

There are certain signs and symptoms you may experience that point to vaginitis, which means you need to see a doctor. If you have any abnormal discharge or vulvar symptoms, they should be checked by a physician.


You should also see the doctor if you’re sexually active and could have an STD, the discharge is malodorous, you have atrophic symptoms and are of perimenopausal or menopausal age, or if you have a sexual partner, either male or female, with trichomoniasis.
When you go to the doctor, she will perform a pelvic exam to examine the vaginal vault and the vulva to check for inflammation and swelling and obtain a sample of discharge for examination. She will also examine your cervix to determine if there is any discharge coming from the cervix itself, indicating a cervicitis, which can be a STI such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. She may take swabs from the cervix or have you submit a urine specimen to double check for these STDs. ;
, BV is a disturbance of the natural balance of the vagina. It occurs when the bacterial flora become disrupted and the pH of your vaginal flora is higher than normal.


This often develops in women who use douches, have multiple sexual partners, and who smoke., There is one main symptom of BV. You will have a white, milky discharge that has a fishy odor. The best way to diagnosis BV is through a test done by your doctor. She will take a sample of the discharge for microscopic examination in the office. Under microscopic exam, there are the presence of Clue cells, which are bacteria-coated cells.


She might also perform a whiff test, which is where she will check for the characteristic fishy smell., Once you have been positively diagnose with BV, you will receive treatment for it from your doctor. Treatment typically consists of oral metronidazole tablets such as Flagyl. You should take a 500 mg tablet twice daily for one week. You can also use Flagyl Gel, which is a topical treatment. You use one applicator of gel a day at bedtime for one week.


A similar but newer antibiotic, tinidazole, or Tindamax, may also be prescribed. You take one 2mg pill once a day for a week. , There are multiple natural remedies that you can try for BV. You can take probiotics to restore the natural balance of bacterial flora in the vaginal flora. These can come in the form of oral probiotic you take twice a day one week to intra-vaginal dosing for 30 days. Research has shown that the use of a lactobacillus supplement by women who have recurrent BV along with antibiotic therapy helps manage the disease. You can also try eating yogurt with a probiotic every day. You should also avoid douching. Your natural vaginal secretions are intended to keep the vagina cleansed and it needs nothing more than external cleansing with soap and water to be cleaned properly.

, A yeast infection, or vulvovaginitis candidiasis, is a very common condition. Over 50% of women will experience or have experienced it once during their lifetime, though only 5% will have repeat infections. A yeast infection is often developed when you take a course of antibiotics, which disrupts your body’s natural lactobacillus count in the vagina.


The symptoms include complaints of a thick, cottage cheese-like discharge. This is accompanied by an itchy and irritated sensation around the vulva and vagina. This can make those areas irritated and sensitive.
Some women may get recurrent episodes, which are described as 4 or more infections per year. However, this amount of frequency is rare., You can generally tell if you have a yeast infection at home. If you notice the symptoms, you can do a visual exam to see if you fit all the criteria of a yeast infection. On visual exam, you should see the inflamed labia and vulva. You should also notice the obvious discharge, which will be thick and white or yellow along the vaginal vault. There should be no odor.

, If you have 3 or more yeast infections a year that are unrelated to antibiotic therapy, you should take note and seek a medical diagnosis. This is important as taking repeated courses of the antifungal therapy for yeast infections can cause can systemic toxicity. You should also be vigilant because there could be an underlying cause of the infections, such as immunosuppression from HIV.


Try not to over self-diagnose. If you simply tell your doctor you have a yeast infection without proper examination, your family provider might call in a prescription in an attempt to be helpful. This may not be helpful because you could have a more insidious disease, such as an STD. , You can use either oral or topical treatment for a yeast infection. The medicine is an antifungal agent that fights the yeast causing the infection. You can use a 150mg oral dose of diflucan once. You can also use the topical creams diflucan or clotrimazole, which are available over the counter in most drugstores. Topical creams are the most popular treatment because they can be purchased over the counter.


Most of the topical medications have similar medical safety and efficacy and none of them are better than other others. You can get different variations that differ in the amount of times you need to apply. You can get a cream or cream suppository that you only use once, but you can also get creams that you need to use for up to a week.
If you think you might have trouble remembering to apply a nightly cream, the single dose oral therapy might be better for you. However, this method does require a prescription. , Often called trich, trichomoniasis is a type of vaginitis that is caused by a protozoa or parasite. It affects up to 5 million people in the US each year. This organism is a small parasite with a tail. In men, if trich is undetected, it can lead to chronic prostatitis. Trich has some common symptoms. The discharge is will likely be green and cause itching. It will also have a fishy odor.


This disease is sexually transmitted, so if you think you have it, you should let your sexual partner know so both partners can be tested and treated before resuming intercourse. If one of you is diagnosed then both of you need treatment.

, Traditionally, the diagnosis for trich is done in a doctor’s office. A wet pep is done by placing vaginal secretions under the microscope with a drop of saline solution. This will cause the parasite under the microscope to swim across the field and be identified.


There can be doctor discrepancy. Because of this, your doctor may also perform more standardized testing, such as a PCR assay to determine exactly what disease you have. You may also be given a pap smear as well.
If this is not treated in pregnant women, there can be complications when giving birth such as low birth weight and prematurity due to a premature rupture of membranes (PROM). , As with BV, trich can be treated with oral medication such as Flagyl. The usual dose is 2grams orally once. You should avoid alcohol while taking Flagyl. Your partner should also take Flagyl at the same time. While you are taking the medication, intercourse should be avoided until both partners have completed the round of treatment.


Some studies recommend the use of Tindamax for trich as well. If prescribed, you will only have to take one 2 mg dose. This medication has a cure rate between 86-100%., There is only a certain group of women who have to worry about atrophic vaginitis. This type of vaginitis is caused by the normal hormonal changes that occur as you age as well as the decreased estrogen production. These tend to lower the production of the natural secretions that keep the vagina lubricated. Up to 40% of post-menopausal women will have this disorder.


It is often accompanied by pelvic floor weakness and other genitourinary symptoms that predispose you to urinary tract infections. These other disorders should be ruled out by your doctor with as test., Atrophic vaginitis is a disorder that causes vaginal dryness and thinning of the vaginal mucosa. This causes itchiness and painful intercourse. This can happen outside of normal menopause when a women gets sent into premature menopause by removal of ovaries for other conditions.

, You can treat this type of vaginitis with oral hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This will replenish the hormones that you lose when you go through menopause.


HRT is taken daily in pill form.
An alternative to HRT is called Osphena, taken once a day to treat vaginitis.

, Estrogen creams can also be used to help with the symptoms of this condition. This cream is absorbed into the skin when you apply it to the vaginal area. This helps produce its effects and treat the symptoms concentrated in your vaginal region.

, Similar to any other contact or allergic dermatitis, this kind of vaginitis is an allergic reaction. Instead of presenting symptoms elsewhere, the skin of your vagina reacts instead. This can be caused by the detergent you used in washing your underwear, a douche, a condom, a lubricant, or any other product that comes into contact with the area.


To treat contact dermatitis vaginitis, you should remove the object that is causing the issue. This may take some investigation, but you should try to find what you are allergic to as soon as possible to relieve the symptoms. You can then use steroid creams that are available over the counter, such as hydrocortisone cream 1%, and apply them to the area twice a day for five days. This will reduce the signs of itchiness and inflammation.
You can also take antihistamines such as Zyrtec or Claritin to help with the reaction. Take one 10mg daily for symptoms. In severe cases, you may want to see a physician for a prednisone taper to get immediate relief. "

Avoid irritating the cyst.",How to Treat Vaginal Cysts," Most vaginal cysts are called inclusion cysts. These small, painless cysts usually go unnoticed and clear up on their own. If you have cysts that you can see on either side of your vaginal opening, these may be Bartholin's gland cysts. Normally, the glands secrete fluids that lubricate the vaginal lips and opening. But, these can become blocked, creating fluid-filled cysts.Less common types of cysts that develop inside the vagina include:


Gartner's duct cysts: these form during fetal development and they should disappear after birth. If cysts develop later in life, an MRI is usually needed to diagnosis them.Mϋllerian cysts: these develop from fetal structures that should disappear after birth, but often don't. These cysts are filled with mucus and can develop anywhere inside the vaginal walls.;
, While most cysts won't cause any discomfort, you may notice signs that the cyst has become infected. It's important to pay attention to these symptoms so you can get immediate medical attention. Signs of infection include:A lump near the vaginal opening that is tender or painful
Redness and swelling around the lump
Discomfort when walking or sitting
Painful intercourse
Fever

, You should call your doctor or gynecologist if you have any symptoms of infection or if the cyst becomes painful. A normal bacterial Infection or sexually transmitted infection can make the cysts uncomfortable. These require medical treatment. You should also let your doctor know if you have recurrent cysts, even if home treatments work. Recurrent cysts might need to be surgically treated.


If you're over 40 years old and have Bartholin Gland cysts, you need to have the cyst removed. Your doctor will probably want to have it tested for cancer, though this is extremely rare in a Bartholin gland., In addition to testing the cyst for cancer, your doctor may want to treat infected cysts. Treatment can involve draining the Bartholin's cyst by making an incision, then keeping it open with sutures or packing, which will be removed after a few days. A tube may also be used to drain the cyst. Your doctor may want to surgically remove a cyst if it returns, is large, or is painful.


Remember that most vaginal cysts don't need treatment. Instead, they can reabsorb on their own. If they don't resolve on their own, these cysts remain small and painless.

, If you have a cyst removed, you should have the area checked periodically to see if the cyst returns. It's a good idea to be in the habit of getting regular gynecological exams anyway. These can catch cervical cysts and cancer early. The American College of Physicians recommends that women of average risk for cervical cancer get pap smears and exams according to this new schedule:Ages 21 to 29: once every three years
Ages 30 to 65: once every three years (or an HPV and Pap smear every five years)
Over age 65: none are needed if recent tests come back normal

, Fill the sitz bath with warm water and place it over the toilet. This will allow you to sit and soak just your genital area. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of epsom salts in the water and stir the mixture till the salts dissolve. Sit on the bath for 10 to 20 minutes, twice a day. You should do sitz baths three or four days or till the cyst improves.You can buy a sitz bath at a pharmacy or medical supply store. If you don't have a sitz bath, you could also just run a few inches of water in your bathtub.

, More research is needed, but ACV can be used to try to reduce the size and swelling of vaginal cysts. Either run a sitz bath and add 1 cup of ACV or you can soak a cotton ball or swab with ACV. Apply the soaked cotton ball or swab directly to the cyst and hold it there for 30 minutes twice a day until you notice swelling reduce.


While ACV is a popular home remedy, scientists caution against relying on vinegar as a medicinal treatment., Fill a hot water bottle with hot water and wrap it in a clean towel. Place this against the cyst to provide some pain relief. You might also try applying a heat pack, so long as you keep another cloth between the pack and your skin. Take care not to burn the delicate tissue in the vaginal area.


You can also dip a flannel or cotton cloth in hot water, wring the water out, and apply it directly against the cyst., Mix 1 to 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel with 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder. Stir until the mixture forms a paste. Use a cotton ball, tampon, or swab to apply the mixture to the cyst. Leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes once a day. Don't rinse or clean off the paste. Just let it run out naturally.


You may want to wear a sanitary napkin so that the bright turmeric doesn't stain your clothing.
Studies have shown that turmeric (curcumin) is an anti-inflammatory.This can reduce the irritation caused by vaginal cysts.

, Since it may take a few days for the cyst to clear up, you may want to take OTC pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If you feel severe pain that doesn't go away after taking OTC medications, contact your doctor.Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage and how often to take the medication.

, Never rub the cyst, even when cleaning or washing the area. Gentle soaks in the sitz bath or tub are enough to keep the area clean. You should never douche. Douching is unnecessary, can irritate the cyst, and is considered to be harmful to women's health in general.Since you'll want to avoid irritating the cyst, consider using a sanitary napkin instead of a tampon, if you're menstruating.

Be aware of how menorrhagia is diagnosed.",How to Treat Menorrhagia," “NSAIDs” are widely used in cases of menorrhagia due to their strong effect as painkillers and anti-inflammatories. NSAIDs target the skeletal and the uterus muscles which make them the perfect choice for abdominal cramps and lower back pain.


Examples of NSAIDs include Voltaren (Declofenac Sodium) and Ponstan 250 mg or Ponstan forte 500 mg (Mefenamic acid). Voltaren comes in tablet, injection and effervescent sachet form, for the rapid relief of strong pain. The tablets and sachets are taken when needed at a maximum dose of three times daily, after meals.
Caution should be taken while using NSAIDs as they can cause gastric upset such as nausea, vomiting, peptic or gastric ulcers. Women suffering from renal or hepatic disorders or women who are currently taking blood thinners as Warfarin should consult with their doctor before using NSAIDs.;
, Iron supplements are given to women to prevent symptoms of anemia caused by menorrhagia or to treat the anemia if it is already present. Iron is an essential element in the production of healthy RBCs and for raising hemoglobin levels. RBCs are responsible for carrying oxygen to all the body's tissues.


Iron supplements are available in the form of tablets or injections that can be used in chronic states. Examples include Hydroferrin and Ferosac injections, or Sandoz iron chewable tablets.
Tablets are taken once daily after meals to avoid constipation.

, Tranexamic acid is widely used to treat any hemorrhage disorders, including menorrhagia. Tranexamic acid stimulates the formation of blood clots, thereby reducing the excessive bleeding caused by menorrhagia.


Tranexamic acid is available as Kapron in tablet or injection form. It should be taken twice daily or according to the doctor’s prescription, Oral contraceptive pills are also used for treating menorrhagia because they help to regulate the menstruation cycle by inhibiting the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) released from the pituitary gland, which suppresses ovulation.


Examples of oral contraceptive pills include Ovestin tablets or Fem-7 patches. They should only be used according to the doctor’s instructions.

, Oral progesterone therapy is helpful to reduce excessive bleeding by correcting hormonal imbalances, and by inhibiting the production of the luteinizing hormone. This reduces the proliferation stage of the endometrium, and can help to limit bleeding.


Progesterone is taken during days 15 to 26 of each menstruation cycle with a dose of 2.5 to 10 mg daily for five or ten days.
Side effects have been reported in women using this medication, including headache, weight gain and depression.

, This is a procedure in which the doctor dilates the cervix in order to scrape some of the tissues from the inner lining of the endometrial layer.


This helps to reduce the amount of blood loss during a woman's period, by controlling the heavy bleeding and limiting the duration of the period.

, This is a procedure performed during a surgery for any female suffering from fibroid formation, in which a catheter is introduced to the large femoral artery in the woman's thigh until it reaches the uterine artery.


At this point, plastic microspheres are injected into the tiny blood vessels supplying the fibroids. This blocks off the blood vessel, thereby decreasing blood flow to the fibroids.
Without blood flow, the fibroids shrink, detach themselves, and pass out through the vagina.

, Ultrasound ablation is another procedure used in case of fibroid formation. The advantage of this procedure over the uterine artery embolization is that it requires no cutting of the thigh. Instead, it uses ultrasound waves that are able to shrink the fibroids directly.

, This procedure can be performed with two methods.


The first method is done laparoscopically, which requires abdominal surgery to remove the fibroids. The other method is done hysteroscopically, which is performed through the cervix.
The preferred type of surgery can be determined depending on the size of the fibroids, their exact numbers and their location.

, After these two procedures are performed, the woman will not be able to carry a child again. Therefore, they may be considered only as a last resort in treating menorrhagia in women of child-bearing age.


In these procedures, the endometrial layer (the inner lining of the uterus) is removed or destroyed using an electrosurgical loop.
After performing these procedures; the surgeon will advise the patient to use any contraceptive pills to avoid getting pregnant in the future, as the pregnancy cannot be successful.

, In this procedure, the surgeon totally removes the uterus of the patient, leaving her completely sterile. This procedure requires complete hospitalization and general anesthesia.


With this technique, the woman will have no further menstruation cycles (and therefore no menorrhagia), and no chance of becoming pregnant in the future., There are several possible reasons why a woman might develop excessive or heavy periods, these reasons include:


Hormonal imbalance
Fibroid formation
Endometrium irritation
Adenomyosis
Other blood disorders that reduce the platelet count, Symptoms of menorrhagia will resemble normal period symptoms, except the bleeding will be heavier and/or last for longer. Some other signs include:


Excessive bleeding

Candida is a normal part of the body.Candida albicans is naturally found throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth. Candida is also a normal resident of the skin.A thrush infection happens when the candida albicans yeast cells find a source of nutrients they like, and grow beyond what is considered normal.;
, White, patchy areas on the tongue, and other parts of the mouth are the most common symptom.Additional symptoms include inflamed, or reddened, areas in the mouth, accompanied by soreness. This can cause a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and a loss of taste.Some areas might bleed slightly if they are scraped.Cracking, itching and pain at the corners of the mouth is common with oral thrush., Understand the risks of untreated thrush infections. Candidiasis infection, like thrush, left untreated can result in serious health problems.Candida is normally present on the skin, and throughout the gut, and causes no health problems.However, when an overgrowth occurs, it is important to treat the condition before it spreads further, and gains access to the systemic circulation. A systemic candidiasis infections is called invasive candidiasis.Realize the seriousness of an invasive candidiasis infection. Invasive candidiasis is an infection that occurs when the candida infection spreads into the systemic circulation, called candidemia.This type of infection is a serious condition, and can affect the blood, heart, brain, eyes, bones, as well as other parts of the body.People with weaker immune systems are the ones primarily at risk of developing invasive candidiasis. This type of infection requires hospitalization, involves added expense, and, in some cases, results in less than desirable outcomes.Invasive candidiasis is a major type of infection acquired by patients being treated in a hospital or facility setting for other reasons.See a doctor early. Seeking medical attention early and taking a prescription medication are the best ways to effectively manage the initial symptoms of a candida infection.This is the most effective approach to prevent invasive candidiasis and candidemia., It is somewhat rare to see oral thrush in healthy children, adolescents, and adults. But anyone can develop thrush, and the infection is easily treated.Since this condition is considered unusual in healthy people, there may be an underlying cause for the thrush to have developed.In addition, some conditions may look like candida, such as oral cancers or precancerous conditions, so make sure to see you doctor if you are haven't had thrush before or if it does not go away with treatment.
It is recommended that cases of thrush be evaluated by a doctor to provide both effective treatment, and to be sure there is no change in the person’s overall immune system., According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, thrush, or candida, infections that develop in the mouth or throat require the use of prescription medications for effective treatment.The exact medications and the length of treatment will vary depending on the person’s age, general health status, currently prescribed medications, and immune system strength.Make sure that you complete the full prescribed course of medication, or else the thrush may return.

, Treating oral candidiasis is often done by using a product that can be applied topically. This is especially true for infants and young children.Liquid products, such as nystatin oral suspension, are applied topically by either swabbing, or “painting”, the suspension onto the surfaces infected. Nystatin is effective at treating the infection, and is safe if swallowed.In addition to using liquid forms, antifungal creams, ointments, and oral doses such as troches, deliver the medication in a topical manner.Use dissolvable prescription products. Some products are made in dissolvable forms, called troches, that are placed in the mouth to dissolve.This method of administration allows the medication to come into direct contact with the infected areas., In some cases, the medication may be prescribed in a tablet, capsule, or liquid form, that is intended to be swallowed.The antifungal medication works through systemic absorption, just like taking an antibiotic.Some examples of medications prescribed to treat thrush include fluconazole, nystatin, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, posacanazole, and miconazole.These medications can interact with other medications, so be sure to tell your doctor what medications you conditions you have. They can also have side effects, so call your doctor if you develop any new symptoms while taking these medications.

, Infants that develop a thrush infections typically have the white, patchy, lesions, in their mouth. They may have trouble feeding, and be more fussy and irritable.The infant can pass the infection to the mother, then they continue to pass it back and forth, until the infection is effectively treated.The mother’s breasts can become unusually sensitive and reddened, with cracked and itchy nipples. The circular area around the nipple, called the areola, can turn shiny, with flaky skin areas.The mother may experience pain during nursing or notice pain in the nipple area between feedings. The discomfort may also feel like stabbing pains deeper within the breast., Tell your doctor if your baby has a diaper rash also, as candida may also cause a diaper rash, and your baby may need different treatment for this. If your doctor considers the case to be mild, he or she may recommend just using good hygiene measures, and watching the areas in both baby and mom for a few days.Treat the baby. If treatment is warranted, the medications can be easily and safely applied.In many cases, an antifungal product called nystatin suspension, can be prescribed. This is a liquid medication that can be applied directly into the baby’s mouth to the areas involved.
The applications are often recommended several times a day for about a week.Treat mom. To allow the mother to continue breast feeding and disrupt the cycle of passing the infection back and forth, the same medication, or a similar one, may be prescribed.
Topical antifungal creams or ointments are applied to the affected areas of the nipple on mom’s breast. Applications are usually recommended several times a day, for about a week, until both baby and mom are symptom free.You may also want to consider using disposable nursing pads to avoid passing the infection to your clothing.Talk to your doctor about cleaning or boiling items such as bottles and nipples, pacifiers and any detachable parts of a breast pump to reduce the chance of the infection coming back.

, People that are diabetic, are prescribed inhaled corticosteroids, take certain types of antibiotics, and people that wear dentures, develop oral thrush infections more often than otherwise healthy adults.Some people with serious illnesses that involve weakened immune systems more commonly experience oral candidiasis.These groups include people with HIV or AIDS, people receiving cancer treatments, and people that have had organ transplants., Make an appointment as soon as possible to have the thrush infection evaluated and treated.The doctor will choose the appropriate prescription medications based on the overall health and existing medications of the person with thrush.People that are elderly, have asthma or COPD, and people with weakened immune systems require quick intervention to prevent the thrush from spreading into their bloodstream.

, The at-risk groups are more challenging to treat since most are already taking a combination of medications that can sometimes interact with antifungal drugs.


The doctors know how to properly combine the antifungal medications needed, with their current prescribed drugs, to quickly and effectively treat the thrush infection.In some cases, intravenous therapy and hospitalization may be the safest course of action., One scientific research study looked for evidence of efficacy for natural and herbal products claiming efficacy in treating oral candidiasis. Unfortunately, the researchers were not able to find any evidence to support the claims.This does not mean the natural and herbal products do not work. The study results suggest that further studies, following proper scientific research methods, are warranted in order to show efficacy for these treatment approaches., When you have a thrush infection, warm saltwater rinses may provide some relief.Ask your dentist or doctor about using saltwater rinses to be sure it is the best option for you.To make a saltwater rinse, dissolve ½ teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of warm water.
Swish the rinse around in your mouth. Be sure to spit out the rinse and avoid swallowing it. Repeat this several times a day., Scientific research has shown that probiotics containing the lactobacilli species can help to control the overgrowth of candida albicans in some situations.The study authors recommend additional research in this area, but the initial work done in a controlled research setting was promising., The scientific literature suggests this to be possibly helpful in treating thrush. However, products available are not adequately regulated and exact dosing recommendations are not available.Talk to your doctor about specific products or sources, recommended by him or her, to treat thrush in this manner.Yogurt containing live or active cultures of the lactobacilli species are difficult to find. Yogurt products are now required to undergo processes like pasteurization that kills the live cultures.

, If you choose to try gentian violet, talk with your doctor first, then proceed carefully. Since safer and easier products are available, using gentian violet is often considered to be unfavorable option.


Gentian violet is effective in the topical treatment of fungal infections, including oral candidiasis, but the product is difficult to use. The product should not be swallowed, and will stain the skin and clothing.Side effects of gentian violet include redness, and irritation at the site where it is applied. Gentian violet should not be swallowed. Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting can result. If gentian violet is swallowed, call a poison control center.One study found that gentian violet applied topically using a 0.00165% product was somewhat effective at treating oral thrush and did not stain the affected areas., See your dentist regularly, and follow recommendations provided by your dentist or your regular doctor.General recommendations to prevent thrush infections include brushing your teeth at least twice each day, floss once a day, and never share your toothbrush., Some people have trouble reaching all areas of their mouth with a regular toothbrush.Talk with your dentist about switching to an electric toothbrush if this will help you to more effectively clean your teeth., If you have recently had a thrush infection, you may want to replace your toothbrush several times.Use new toothbrushes, and discard any contaminated ones, until you are comfortable that the infection has been effectively treated, and your new toothbrush has not been contaminated., Some mouthwashes and rinses can alter the normal flora in your mouth, and allow for the candida infection to get started more easily.Talk to your dentist to be sure. Many dentists recommend the use of mouthwashes and mouth rinses., Sugary foods, and foods and beverages that contain yeast, can encourage the growth of candida.


Limit the amounts of these foods that you eat or drink, and be sure to brush your teeth after eating., People that wear dentures at a higher risk of developing oral thrush infections.Your dentist can suggest different products and equipment to use in cleaning your dentures if this is happening to you., By maintaining tight control of your blood sugar levels, you can reduce the amounts of excess sugars that are found in your saliva.This helps to limit the sugary food source in your mouth area that helps the candida yeast to grow., Research has provided good evidence that this can help reduce the risk of oral candidiasis infections in people receiving cancer treatments.The most commonly prescribed prescription strength mouth rinse contains a solution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate., Some people with lung conditions, like asthma and COPD, regularly use inhaled corticosteroids.If you can, use a spacer (or aerochamber) attached to your inhaler. This greatly reduces oral thrush from using inhaled corticosteroids. Both children and adults should use spacers. In addition, they help the medication go deeper into the lungs instead of to the back of the mouth.


People that use these products can reduce their risk for getting thrush by rinsing their mouth with water, or a doctor recommended mouth rinse, after each use of their inhaler."

Purchase a home menopause test.,
Avoid drinking a lot of liquids before taking the test.,
Unwrap the testing strip.,
Place the strip in your urine stream.,
Wait 10 to 20 minutes to review the results.,
Read the results.,
Talk to your doctor about a positive result.,
Go over a negative result with your physician.,
Keep track of your symptoms.",How to Take a Home Menopause Test," Over-the-counter menopause tests measure the levels of follicle stimulating hormone, or FSH, in your urine. This hormone increases temporarily each month during ovulation, but it also spikes when your ovaries stop working and menopause begins. It is important to remember that an increase in FSH in the urine does not necessarily mean that menopause has begun.An at-home menopause kit typically comes with two individually-packaged testing strips that detect your levels of FSH.Ask a pharmacist for recommendations or talk to your doctor about purchasing an at-home testing kit.
The process of testing will vary with each kit, so it is important you read and closely follow the instructions included with the kit. If instructions are different from what is described in this article then follow the instructions from the kit.
These tests are sold at most pharmacies for about $20 dollars.If you are on birth control, you will not get an accurate reading from this test. Birth control keeps your FSH levels low, so the levels in your urine will already be altered by the medication.;
, If you drink a lot of liquid a couple of hours before taking the test, the results could be invalid. An increase in liquid may dilute the concentration of FSH in your urine. Limit fluid intake one to two hours before taking the test., Wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap to remove any bacteria or dirt from your hands. Carefully remove the testing strip from its foil packet.

, While sitting on the toilet, hold the test in one hand. Place your testing strip into your urine midstream. Be sure to place the absorbent end of the strip into your urine.


Alternatively, you can dip the strip in a cup of urine.After washing your hands, collect a sample of your urine in a sterilized cup.
Some testing strips will have a line marking where the urine sample should end. Look for a max line on your testing strip.
Some testing strips will resemble an at-home pregnancy test and will be encased in a plastic cover with a removable cap. Remove the cap and insert the exposed strip into your urine stream., While you are waiting for the test results, place the testing strip on a clean, flat surface where it will not be contaminated or disturbed.Chemicals within the testing strip will react with the hormones in your urine. This process can take between 10 and 20 minutes. The test should be discarded after 30 minutes as it may not yield reliable results.

, The chemicals will react to the presence of FSH to produce a colored line or symbol to appear on the strip. Each type of test will provide different symbols and colors to indicate the level of FSH in your urine, so be sure to consult the instructions for your particular test. If a line, set of lines, or symbol does not appear, the test is invalid., If you receive a positive result after taking your FSH test, schedule an appointment with your doctor to go over the results. A positive FSH test indicates that the levels may have increased, but it does not necessarily mean you are peri- or menopausal.Your doctor will consider the results and discuss the next steps for you, which may include treating menopause symptoms like vaginal dryness and hot flashes, or they may suggest that you take a test at the clinic so that your levels can be accurately checked in a lab.


Do not stop using contraceptives if you have a positive result., Do not assume that you are not in perimenopause or menopause because the FSH test provided negative results. Other variables could have caused the test to produce a negative result, so it is important to visit your doctor to discuss the test. Your doctor may wish to schedule other hormone tests, and they will talk to you about your menstruation cycle and if you are experiencing any other symptoms of menopause., You may experience signs and symptoms of menopause like hot flashes, night sweats, irregular periods, or mood changes for several years leading up to menopause. This is known as perimenopause. Tests typically aren't needed or required to diagnose the onset of menopause, so a home menopause test or saliva test at your doctor’s office will not be able to determine an accurate start date. Keep a record of any changes you experience so that you and your doctor can determine when menopause has begun.

Use lubricant for sexual activity.,
Get a vaginal moisturizer at your local drug store.,
Increase your sexual arousal.",How to Stop Vaginal Dryness1," Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and other water-based lubricants can help supply the moisture you need during sex. Buy these at any local pharmacy or drug store. Use liberal amounts before and during intercourse or other sexual activity to reduce uncomfortable friction caused by dryness.Silicone-based lubricants like Pure Pleasure, Pink, and others are also good options, but may stain your clothes if you spill some. They may not be compatible with some sex toys.
Avoid oil-based products like mineral oil, petroleum jelly, and Elegance Women’s Lubricant.
Try using jojoba oil, coconut oil, or aloe if you prefer natural products.;
, If you want to skip the hormones, use a simple vaginal moisturizer.Brands like Fresh Start, Replens, and Lubrin should be readily available at your grocery store or pharmacy. Moisturizers are different from lubricants – lubricants are used only right before and during sex, whereas vaginal moisturizers can be used all the time for help with continuous discomfort caused by vaginal dryness.Make sure the product you buy is estrogen-free, fragrance-free, tasteless, and can be used with barrier methods of birth control (generally, condoms), if needed.
Use it once every 2-3 days., For some, vaginal dryness is a result of trying to have sex without being properly aroused. As you become sexually aroused, blood rushes to your genitals and your body starts to make its own vaginal lubricant. Try some ways to amp up your arousal, and if you continue to have problems consider discussing it with your doctor, a counselor, or a sex therapist.Take your time before having sex – spend more time on foreplay. Caressing, kissing, massage, manual stimulation, and oral sex can help your body feel ready for intercourse.
Use toys like a vibrator to increase sexual pleasure. Many women need clitoral stimulation to become aroused and climax.Try masturbation so you know what feels good to you, then share that information with your partner.

De-stress! Many women struggle with arousal because of psychological reasons. Consider doing something soothing before sex like taking a warm bath or a walk."

Be cautious of hot tubs and swimming pools.,
Stay hydrated.,
Exercise regularly.,
Eat good fats and soy.,
Quit smoking.,
Stop taking medications that worsen the condition.",How to Stop Vaginal Dryness2," Douches and feminine sprays are marketed towards women as products that promote cleanliness. The vagina, however, is a self-cleaning part of your body. Stay away from these types of products if you have vaginal dryness, as they can worsen the problem.Plain warm water is enough to clean your vagina. Don’t use soap or other cleansers on the outside or inside of your vagina.

, Bubble bath, scented soaps and lotions, and laundry detergent can all worsen dryness because they contain harsh chemicals. Use plain, unscented products whenever possible. Try natural laundry detergent, and skip using dryer sheets., Public swimming areas contain high amounts of chlorine, which is very drying to your skin. Avoid spending a lot of time in pools and hot tubs, or at least rinse your vagina well with cool, plain water afterwards., Dehydration can contribute to vaginal dryness, so ensure you stay well hydrated throughout the day.Aim to drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids daily.Drink more if you sweat a lot, work out, or live in a hot climate.
Water, juice, and tea count towards your fluids.

, Get regular exercise to help keep your hormones in balance. Aerobic workouts are those that increase your heart rate and breathing rate. Walking, slow jogging, biking, and swimming are good options. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity at least 5 days per week., Omega-3 fatty acids and products like flaxseed oil and soy have estrogen-like qualities, which may help improve vaginal dryness.Eat fatty fish like salmon or mackerel several times per week, and incorporate soy products into your diet.

You can also try taking oral probiotics to improve vaginal health. Find these as capsules at your pharmacy, or eat yogurt with live cultures., Nicotine dependence can cause or worsen vaginal dryness. Stop smoking now to help improve your symptoms., Some antidepressants, cold medicine, and allergy pills can dry out mucous membranes – including the sensitive skin in your vagina.Make a list of your medications to take to your doctor. Discuss whether any of your medicines might be worsening your problem, and whether you can switch to a different medication.

Never stop taking your medicine without your doctor’s supervision.

Discuss risk factors with your doctor.,
Use an estrogen cream.,
Try the estrogen ring.,
Try Prasterone.,
Ask about a prescription for ospemifene.,
Consider hormone replacement therapy (HRT).",How to Stop Vaginal Dryness3," Your body’s level of estrogen drops significantly during and after menopause, stopping your periods and causing vaginal atrophy – drying and thinning of the walls of your vagina. Thus, the most common way to improve vaginal dryness is by replacing lost estrogen. Using estrogen may not be safe for some women, however. Discuss your issue with your doctor or OB/GYN so they can ask you your health history and do an exam.You can also have low estrogen if you’ve had your ovaries removed or had chemotherapy cancer treatment.
You shouldn’t use estrogen if you have or ever had breast cancer or endometrial cancer.
Don’t use estrogen if you have undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

, Replace estrogen locally by using an estrogen cream like Estrace or Premarin. Insert the cream into your vagina with an applicator. Use it every day for 1-2 weeks, then 1-3 times per week – or however your doctor suggests you use it.Estrogen also comes in tablet form, like Vagifem. Insert the tablet into your vagina with an applicator daily for two weeks, then twice a week thereafter for as long as you need it.
Vaginal estrogen is considered safe for long-term use., If you don’t want to use the cream, there are other options. Try an estrogen ring like Estring – a flexible ring that you insert into your vagina that releases estrogen to the local tissues. If inserting it is challenging, ask your doctor to do it for you. The ring only needs to be changed every three months.You can leave the ring in place during sex.

, Prasterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), is a non-estrogen vaginal suppository. Insert the capsule into your vagina daily. This can be a good option if you want to use local vaginal therapy but want to avoid estrogen., The medication ospemifene (Osphena) isn’t estrogen, but it’s similar to it and it acts similarly in your vagina. This pill can help improve vaginal dryness.You may have hot flashes as a side effect.
This medication can increase your risk for blood clots or cancer of the uterus, and you shouldn’t use it if you have or have ever had breast cancer. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this medication., HRT involves taking estrogen supplements by mouth so that the level of estrogen in your whole body increases, not just in and around your vagina. This can be helpful if you have severe symptoms of menopause like hot flashes. However, it’s more likely to cause side effects and can increase your risk for some cancers.HRT is available as a prescription in pill form, as well as a patch, an under-the-skin implant, or a gel you put on your skin.
Weigh the risks and benefits of HRT with your doctor.

Your nipple and areola will be removed, but the breast will remain intact.You may also need to get surrounding tissue removed near the nipple area.;
, If you have Paget’s disease of the breast and a tumor, you will need to have a mastectomy. If the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, you may need to have those removed as well.The stage of the cancer and size of the breast tumor will determine what related treatment, such as chemotherapy or additional surgery, will be needed.

, Depending on the severity of your condition and what operation you have had done, you may need follow up adjuvant therapy. If you have breast-conserving surgery, you more than likely will be given whole breast radiation.For a mastectomy, your doctor may suggest radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy. This depends on the stage of the cancer, the size and type of tumor, and if the lymph nodes are also affected.

Avoid known triggers of hot flashes.,
Try adding soy to your diet.,
Incorporate moderate exercise.,
Adjust your thermostat.",How to Survive Menopause1," HRT is the only FDA approved method for treating night sweats and hot flashes. It is effective, but some women choose to avoid hormonal methods of treating menopause because of safety concerns about taking hormones. Whether to use hormones is a personal decision., Known triggers of hot flashes are spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and smoking. Additionally, avoiding hot weather whenever possible will help with hot flashes. Skip the nightcap before bed and instead try ice water., Although the research shows mixed results, some studies have found that the plant estrogens in soy can help ease hot flashes and night sweats, which are thought to be the result of decreased estrogen at menopause. Incorporate soy milk or tofu into your diet., Upping your exercise routine can help stave off hot flashes. Though the reason for this is still being explored, it may have to do with the brain producing neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which can affect mood, sleep, and alertness.Shoot for moderate exercise like 30 minutes of walking four days a week, and exercise indoors or avoid exercising outside during the hottest part of the day.


In addition, exercising can help prevent weight gain and bone and muscle loss, which occur during menopause., If you feel hot, turn on the air conditioning or a fan until you find some relief. If you live in a space with no fan or air conditioning, taking a cool shower can also help with hot flashes.


Investing in bedding made of a cool, breathable fabric can help with night sweats. A satin blend or high thread count cotton sheets are great choices.

Undergo surgery to remove the affected area.,
Get a skin graft if too much tissue was removed.,
Follow up with your doctor regularly.",How to Treat Breast and Extramammary Paget's Disease2," The most common treatment for Paget’s disease of the vulva is surgery. During surgery, the doctor will perform a wide excision of the affected area. This wide area will ensure that any cells in healthy-looking skin are removed., In some instances, you may have to get a skin graft after surgical removal of the cancerous tissue. This is used when so much skin was removed that the wound cannot be closed on its own.The graft will replace the skin removed to help close the wound.

, Because of the nature of extramammary Paget’s disease, the condition may recur at any time or you may get a related Paget’s disease. You may also be at risk for additional underlying cancerous cells.Your doctor may suggest getting colonoscopies and mammograms since gut and breast tissue can be affected due to Paget’s disease.
To make sure you carefully monitor your health, work with your doctor to set up frequent appointments and follow up gynecological exams.

Be sure that your pain isn’t due to another condition.,
Talk with your doctor about estrogen replacements.,
Try an over-the-counter lubricant.,
Be sure you’re fully aroused before sex.,
Don't feel obligated to engage in sex.",How to Survive Menopause2," Painful sex can also be the result of other conditions like Endometriosis or Atrophic Vaginitis. Consult your doctor to rule out other causes for your dryness and discomfort.

, If you’re experiencing pain during sex, you can ask your doctor about estrogen-infused gels or oral prescription medicines designed to help you lubricate naturally.While these medicines are effective, they are not free from side effects. Weigh the pros and cons with your doctor to determine if these treatments are right for you.

, These lubricants will help replace your own natural moisture and lessen pain with intercourse. Options include one-time use lubricants and lubricant capsules that you insert into the vagina once or twice a week to proactively increase vaginal moisture. Be sure to choose a water-based lubricant and avoid oil-based lubricants like petroleum jelly., It’s important to take your time and be fully in the mood for sex before you attempt intercourse. Foreplay is key. This will give your body time to create its own lubrication (as much as possible), which will minimize pain and dryness., If your body isn't cooperating, don't engage in painful sex. This conditions your body to expect intercourse to hurt, and this will do more damage, both physically and mentally, in the long run. Try again another time when you are in the mood and it doesn't hurt as much.


Don't be embarrassed about this. Just as men sometimes need medication to obtain an erection, so too do women sometimes need medicines or extra lubrication to be able to have sex.

Minimize stressors.,
Practice self-care techniques.,
Be sure to get enough sleep.",How to Survive Menopause3," Finding support from other women who are going through the physical and mental changes can be comforting. Joining a group for menopausal women can also be therapeutic. In these groups women discuss coping strategies and approaches to dealing with menopausal symptoms that have worked for them.

, If your mood changes seem to go beyond the expected mood swings associated with menopause, talk to your doctor about whether you might benefit from an antidepressant. You might have depression, which is a serious condition, along with your menopausal symptoms., Reduce stress in your life as much as possible. Incorporate yoga or meditation into your daily routine. Avoid overextending yourself socially or at work. If you're having an ""off"" day, take a personal day from work, if you have the leave time available to use.

, Even if you feel depressed or not like your normal self, it's important to do little things to make yourself feel better. Relaxation massages, facials, and manicures or pedicures are great ways to pamper yourself and give yourself a mental boost.

, Quality sleep is important for mental and physical health. Menopause can be exhausting, so it's especially important to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night.

Take a pregnancy test.,
Carry feminine hygiene products with you.,
Download a period tracker app.,
Pack painkillers in your purse or briefcase.,
Bring a list of all your symptoms and be honest with your doctor.",How to Survive Menopause4," In early stages of menopause transition, many women can still become pregnant. Double check that your erratic periods aren’t the result of an unexpected pregnancy. For extra peace of mind, check with your doctor as well, especially if you’ve been on a reliable form of birth control for a long time.

, When you can’t predict when or if your period will arrive, it’s important to be prepared. Be sure to carry tampons, pads, or a menstrual cup in your handbag so you aren’t caught in an uncomfortable situation.

, The Apple Appstore and Google Play Store for Android have a wide variety of apps that help you track your periods and associated symptoms. If your periods become erratic because you’re entering menopause, these apps will help you know when your last period was and what symptoms you typically have at particular points in your cycle.These apps are especially helpful to document your symptoms so you can report specifics to your doctor. For example, if before each erratic period you tend to get migraines, a tracking app will help you pinpoint the specific dates you’re suffering each month so you can easily show these trends to your doctor.

, If menopause-related headaches or migraines are common for you, it’s important to be proactive with your pain management, as these symptoms can be debilitating for many women. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen are good choices for over-the-counter pain management.For stronger pain relief options, talk to your doctor about the extent to which your pain is affecting your everyday activities. Prescription treatments for migraines might be appropriate for you if over the counter treatments aren’t working, and you’re missing work or social events because of your pain.

, Your doctor can’t help you and give you the most accurate diagnosis if you withhold information from them. Some symptoms like vaginal pain or dryness can be uncomfortable to talk about, but remember your gynecologist is a healthcare professional who specializes in women’s health, so don’t feel embarrassed.

Be mindful of calories.,
Eat lean protein at each meal.,
Fill up on fruits and vegetables.,
Include one to two servings of dairy daily.,
Choose nutritious grain choices.,
Limit alcohol consumption.,
Consider taking supplements.,
Increase the amount of time you spend exercising.,
Include resistance training in your workout.,
Add in stretching and balance activities.,
Take care of stress.,
Take care of any sleep disturbances.,
Stop smoking.",How to Stop Menopause Weight Gain," One reason for weight gain during menopause may be the consumption of too many calories. For women especially, as you age you'll lose lean muscle mass and the amount of calories your body needs to support itself decreases.Be very mindful of your total calorie intake. If you're having troubles with your weight, it might be wise to start tracking your calories in a food journal or food journal app. You can use this information to decide whether or not you should cut out some calories.
Try cutting out calories to help you maintain your weight or lose some weight. Decreasing your total calorie intake by about 500 calories daily can help you lose about 1 pound per week.Don't forget to count calories from beverages such as soda, juice, and alcohol.
Do not go below 1,200 calories daily. It's difficult to maintain proper nutrition with very low calorie diets.;
, Protein is an essential nutrient in your diet. It's especially important to get enough protein when you're going through menopause to help preserve your lean muscle mass.


As you age, especially as women age, you're more susceptible to losing lean muscle mass. Eating enough protein can help combat this effect.Proteins take longer to digest so you feel full longer and thus tend to eat less.
Include a serving or two of protein at each meal. Studies have shown eating 20-30 g at each meal is beneficial for maintaining lean muscle.Aim for a 3-4 oz piece of meat or about 1/2 cup of protein-rich legumes.Choosing leaner proteins over high fat proteins (like fatty beef or poultry with skin) can help you stay within your calorie goal.Lean protein options include: poultry without skin, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, legumes and tofu.

, Both fruits and vegetables are an integral part of a well-balanced and nutritious diet. In addition, including many servings of these can help you stay within your calorie goal.Fruits and vegetables can help bulk up your meals and make you feel more full with fewer calories. These foods work well for weight loss since they are low in calories, yet high in fiber, vitamins and minerals.
Aim for about five to nine servings of these nutrient-rich foods each day.
Strive to measure your portion sizes to stay on track. For for about 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of leafy greens each day.

, Women who are going through menopause need a little extra calcium in their diets. Calcium is found in many foods, but is particularly high in the dairy food group.


The RDA or recommended daily amount increases from 1,000 mg daily to 1,200 mg daily as you age. Ensuring you're including a variety of calcium-rich foods is important.One serving of dairy is 1 cup of milk or yogurt and 1.5 ounces of cheese.Some studies have shown that you may become lactose intolerant as you age. This is caused by changes in your gut bacteria overtime. If you notice gas, bloating, cramping or loose stools after consuming dairy, try dairy alternatives. Soy, almond or rice milks and yogurts are good substitutes.
You can find calcium in other foods like broccoli, almonds, dark greens, beans and fortified orange juice. Use these foods as calcium alternatives in your diet.

, In addition to protein, fruits and vegetables and dairy, it's important to include nutrient-dense sources of grains. This will help balance and round out your diet.


If you're choosing to eat a grain-based food (like bread, rice or pasta) try to choose 100% whole grains. These foods are less processed and higher in fiber, protein and other nutrients.This makes them more nutrient dense compared to refined grains.
White bread, items made with white flour and white rice are more processed and lower in many nutrients.
Also make sure to measure your portion sizes so that you can stay within your target calorie limit. Go for 1 oz of 1/2 cup of whole grains.Choose whole grains like: quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread, millet or oatmeal.

, High levels of alcohol are not recommended for any person, and excessive alcohol consumption has been linked with increased risk of bone loss and osteoporosis.If you do decide to drink, only have one serving daily at a maximum; however, since alcohol is 100% empty calories, you should consider drinking less often.Also, when choosing to have a drink, minimize the amount of calories and sugar you consume. Instead of a fruity mixed drink, go for a low-carb beer or a glass of red wine.

, As you age and go through menopause, many of your nutrient needs change. If you cannot meet your nutrient needs through diet, consider taking supplements to prevent deficiencies.


As mentioned, your calcium needs increase to about 1,200 mg daily. If you are lactose intolerant, do not care for dairy or other calcium rich foods, consider taking a calcium supplement.
Although there have been studies linking calcium supplements with heart disease, it's only been found with calcium supplementation that is in excess of your needs. Consider taking a 500 mg calcium supplement once or twice a day.Again, this is only needed if you're not getting calcium from your diet.
Vitamin D is another important nutrient that many people are deficient in. It's difficult to get enough through food and sunlight. Vitamin D is integral to your health — especially your bone health. Without adequate vitamin D, it's hard for you body to use calcium effectively to maintain your bone health.Talk to your doctor about Vitamin D. If you're deficient (which is detected through a blood test), they may put you on a supplement. Ranges vary and should be determined by your doctor only.

, During menopause, women who are having trouble maintaining their weight should strive for 30 to 40 minutes of exercise five days a week.Aerobic exercise comes with many benefits. For women going through menopause, it can specifically help you: maintain or lose weight, decrease your risk of breast cancer, reduce your risk of diabetes and high blood pressure, and boost your mood.At a minimum, include 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week. You may find you need to a little more to help burn more calories to maintain your weight.
Aerobic activity hasn't been proven to help deal with any of the common side effects associated with menopause at this time (like mood swings or hot flashes);however, it doesn't hurt to keep up a good activity routine.

, In addition to aerobic exercise, it's vital to include regular strength training to help prevent the loss of bone and muscle mass that's associated with menopause.


Include two to three days of strength training in addition to doing your aerobic exercises.
Activities such as yoga, pilates or weight training may help to slow down the natural loss of muscle mass that occurs as a normal part of the aging process, and accelerates for women during menopause.

, Both stretching and stability exercises can help improve flexibility and balance which are important as you age.Stretch only after your muscles are warmed up. It is not advisable to stretch before your workout.Also include balance exercises. This may help prevent falls as you get older.Yoga, sideways walking, balancing on one leg or tai chi are good exercises to try.

, Stress can make weight maintenance or weight loss difficult for anyone, and when stress is combined with menopause it may make weight loss nearly impossible.When you're dealing with stress, your body secretes a hormone called cortisol (frequently known as the ""stress hormone). This can cause an increase in appetite and desire to eat making it more difficult to say no to foods.Stress may also cause you to ""stress eat"" or emotionally eat. In addition, you're more likely to go for ""comfort foods"" or those foods that are higher calorie and higher in fat.Manage stress the best you can. Try: taking a walk, talking to a supportive friend, meditating, doing yoga or listening to good music.
If those things don't work, consider seeing a behavioral specialist for additional help. These mental health professionals can give you additional tips and techniques for stress management.

, There are a variety of side effects and symptoms of menopause, a common one being nighttime hot flashes. These, in addition to other hormonal imbalances, may disrupt sleeping patterns for menopausal women.Sleep disturbances can directly work against weight maintenance or weight loss. Many people will experience changes in appetite and changes in cravings.In addition, if you're feeling tired and fatigued you're less likely to get up and exercise and make healthy food choices.You may want to talk to your OB/GYN about taking hormone replacements as relief. You may also want to consider taking melatonin daily to help regulate your sleep., Smoking is never recommended as it's been connected with a large variety of negative health side effects. It's also been linked to bone loss in menopausal women.Quitting smoking is associated with weight gain, and many women are reluctant to do quit and risk gaining more weight. Keep in mind that the long-term benefits will outweigh short-term weight gain.
If you currently smoke, consider quitting. It's best to quit cold turkey as you immediately discontinue the influx of toxins and nicotine in your body.
If you're having trouble quitting or cannot quit cold turkey, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able to prescribe you a medication to help you quit or refer you to a smoking cessation program.

Know what conditions cause vaginal burning.,
Diagnose vaginal burning.,
Treat a yeast infection with over-the-counter meds.,
Visit your doctor.",How to Relieve Vaginal Burning1," Various conditions can develop in the vagina. One symptom of many conditions is vaginal burning. Some of these conditions are serious and others are minor. The following conditions can affect the vagina and cause burning:Vaginitis or inflammation of the vagina. Vaginitis is often accompanied by symptoms of burning, itching, and discharge, often with a changed odor. Vaginitis is commonly caused by yeast or bacterial infections.
Infections caused by bacteria, like gonorrhea
Fungus, like yeast infections such as Candida

Viruses, like genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and genital herpes caused by herpes simplex virus
Parasites causing trichomoniasis and chlamydia
Cancer of the vagina
Vaginal prolapse;
, Vaginal burning is commonly caused by infections, irritation from a tampon or douching, using vaginal hygiene products, diabetes, urinary tract infections, and by normal changes in hormonal levels. Determine if your vaginal burning may be from tampon usage, a recent douching, or use of other vaginal hygiene products.If you think the cause may be medical, the specific cause can be determined by a pelvic exam, microscopic examination of any vaginal discharge and vaginal swabs, taking a culture of vaginal organisms to determine the cause of an infection, or taking a Pap smear.
In rarer cases, you may need a colposcopy to closely examine the vaginal walls or cervix, or a vaginal biopsy.

, If you have previously had a vaginal yeast infection and are certain that what you are experiencing is another yeast infection, you can use over-the-counter treatments that are available in most drug stores to treat the yeast infection.


If there is no relief within three to five days, make an appointment with your doctor or OB/GYN. Some untreated infections can cause serious consequences, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and sterility., Any vaginal burning that you don’t think is just a yeast infection should be evaluated by a physician. Your doctor can give you an exam to determine what is causing the burning and catch issues that may develop into more serious conditions if left untreated.Vaginal bacterial infections can be treated medically with either topical or oral antimicrobials. These are usually used once or twice a day for five to seven days.
Yeast infections can be treated with prescription oral antifungal medication if over-the-counter treatments don’t work.
Trichomoniasis is always treated with oral medication.

Abnormal vaginal bleeding can be the result of many different conditions ranging from not serious to life threatening. Some possible reasons why you may be having abnormal uterine bleeding may include:Celiac disease
Certain types of cancer
Endometriosis
Gonorrhea
Hypothyroidism
Hyperthyroidism
Polycystic ovary syndrome
Pregnancy
Stopping birth control pills
Vaginitis
Uterine polyps or fibroids;
, A common early treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding is a low-dose contraceptive that contains synthetic estrogens and progestins. This medication should help to normalize your menstrual cycle and decrease your menstrual flow.Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for a low-dose contraceptive if this option appeals to you.


Keep in mind that low-dose contraceptives should be taken for a short time unless you want to use the drug to prevent pregnancy as well.

, If you have abnormal uterine bleeding that is heavy, then higher doses of estrogen may be necessary to normalize your cycle. Keep in mind that there are significant risks associated with these drugs. Do not use these medications if you:Have recently given birth
Smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day and you are over 35 years old
Have a personal or family history of breast cancer, liver disease, blood clots, migraines, high blood pressure, gallbladder disease, heart disease, diabetes, or high triglyceride blood levels.

, Progesterone (or a synthetic progestin) may be used on its own in women who cannot or do not want to take estrogens. Progesterone may also be used if a previous treatment using oral contraceptives did not help to control the bleeding or if lab tests show that progesterone levels are low. Progesterone may be given in the form of a pill, an IUD intrauterine device) or as an injection.Keep in mind that progesterone alone will not prevent pregnancy. If you want to prevent pregnancy, then you will need to take another contraceptive as well.

, This treatment, prescribed by your doctor, is neither a contraceptive nor a hormone. Tranexamic acid tablets are taken when heavy bleeding begins and will help the blood in your womb to clot, potentially reducing blood loss by 29 – 58%.You may wish to use tranexamic acid in combination with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)., In some rare cases where bleeding does not respond to any other treatment, your doctor may recommend a male androgen called Danazol to control abnormal uterine bleeding. Danazol should not be used if you are pregnant or breast feeding and this drug will not prevent pregnancy either. There are also some serious risks associated with this drug, including:Stroke
Liver disease
Increased pressure in the brain

, Dilation and curettage has been successful at temporarily halting abnormal bleeding for some women. During this procedure, your cervix is dilated so that the doctor can scrape out excess tissue from your uterus. The tissue may also need to be analyzed to determine if it is abnormal in any way.This procedure is not a permanent fix. It can help provide the diagnosis and temporarily stop the bleeding, but it will not address the underlying cause of the abnormal bleeding.
This procedure is performed under anesthesia so you will not feel it or be aware of what is happening.

, In some rare cases, the only way to stop abnormal uterine bleeding is by surgical means. There are two options that are common for this condition.Endometrial ablation. Endometrial ablation is a procedure that destroys the lining of the uterus, but does not remove the uterus itself. This procedure should stop abnormal bleeding, but you may continue to have light periods after the procedure. Most women are not able to get pregnant after the procedure, but birth control is still recommended if you want to be certain that you will not become pregnant.

Hysterectomy. In a hysterectomy, the entire uterus is removed. This procedure will make it impossible to have periods or to become pregnant. It will stop abnormal uterine bleeding, but it is a major surgical procedure.

, It is important to see your physician about abnormal uterine bleeding no matter what. However, if you wish to try some natural treatments to stop the abnormal bleeding, then make sure that your physician is aware of what you are doing.


Keep in mind that even though a medicine is natural, it can still cause side effects and interact with prescription medications. ""Natural"" does not always mean ""safe.""

, There are some combination herbal products that may help to stop abnormal uterine bleeding. These products attempt to balance out your hormones, but they have not been proven to be effective. Also, keep in mind that because these products are not as potent as hormones, they may take longer to work. Talk to your physician before you try taking any herbal supplements for abnormal uterine bleeding. Some popular products include:


ProSoothe which contains vitamin B6, chaste tree, wild yam, dandelion, bupleurum, and ginger.
Slow Flow which contains vitamins A, C, and K1, bioflavonoids, ginger, cranesbill, periwinkle, yarrow, life root and shepherd’s purse.
Progensa 20 which is a bio-identical progesterone cream that also contains evening primrose oil, burdock root, chamomile, ginseng, lavender, and grape seed extract.

, Taking a liver support product may also help to stop abnormal vaginal bleeding because the liver metabolizes hormones. By supporting your liver, you may be able to achieve hormonal balance naturally and stop the abnormal bleeding. Milk thistle and dandelion root may help to support the liver.



Milk thistle. You can take milk thistle as a capsule, but you should ask your doctor first. Make sure that you follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use as well.Dandelion root. You can also drink roasted dandelion root tea to support the liver. Make sure that you check with your doctor first., Ginger tea may help to increase anti-inflammatory prostaglandins, which may lead to a reduction in abnormal uterine bleeding. Try drinking a commercial ginger tea or mince one teaspoon of fresh ginger and steep it in boiled water for about 10 minutes. Drink three to four cups of ginger tea per day. You can also add honey and/or lemon as needed.


Do not exceed more than four grams of ginger per day, including food sources., Getting enough iron in your diet will not treat abnormal uterine bleeding, but it may help to prevent anemia from blood loss.Eat two servings of iron-rich foods per day such as:


Red meats
Beans
Dark leafy green vegetables (spinach, chard, mustard greens, and broccoli)
Raisins

, Getting enough Vitamin C will not stop abnormal uterine bleeding, but it may help to support your health by keeping your blood vessels strong.Take 250 to 500 mg of vitamin C every day or just eat more vitamin C-rich foods such as:


Oranges
Grapefruit
Strawberries
Peppers
Cantaloupe

, Bio-identical hormones are man-made hormones that are supposed to match natural human hormones on a chemical and molecular level.They may be made from either animal hormones that have been altered using chemicals or they may be 100% synthetic hormones. Bio-identical hormones are not as potent as commonly prescribed hormones, but may have fewer side effects.You still need a prescription for bio-identical hormones, so talk to your doctor if you are interested in this option.
Bio-identical hormones are not regulated by the FDA.While they may contain FDA-approved ingredients, the final product has not been approved by the FDA. They have not been proven to be safe or effective.Be particularly wary of compounded hormones. Depending on where there are compounded, you may not even be sure how much hormone or what hormone you are receiving."

Switch your menstrual product.,
Wear cotton underwear.,
Try a cold compress.,
Make a milk compress.",How to Relieve Vaginal Burning2," Keeping your vaginal area clean can help reduce any burning or itching sensations. Take a daily shower and clean yourself well.Never use douche. Your vagina contains both beneficial and harmful bacteria, carefully balanced to create an ideal, acidic environment. When you use douche, this balance is disrupted and can lead to an overgrowth of the bad bacteria. This can lead to a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis and can push an infection deeper into your body where it can cause more harm.You do not need any special products, like douche, to clean your vagina. The mucus made by your vagina naturally cleans blood, semen, and vaginal discharge.Simple soap and water should be enough to clean your vagina.
After using the toilet, always wipe yourself from front to back. This prevents bacteria from fecal matter from getting in your vagina.

If you are menopausal, know when your last period was. A major symptom of cervical cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding. It is good to know what is normal for you and other women like you.You will usually have regular menstrual cycles if you are premenopausal. Each woman is different, but a normal cycle will be 28 days, plus or minus 7 days.You will have irregular menstrual periods if you are peri-menopausal. This phase normally starts between the ages of 40 and 50. This transition occurs when your ovaries gradually begin to produce less estrogen. It can last anywhere from several months to 10 years before menopause is fully reached.You will no longer have menstrual periods if you are menopausal. Your hormone levels have reached a point where you no longer ovulate or release eggs. You can no longer become pregnant.You will not have menstrual periods if you have had a hysterectomy. You no longer have a uterus and you will no longer shed the lining of your uterus. You should not be bleeding. If you still have ovaries that work, you are not menopausal.;
,


It is normal for a premenopausal woman to have an irregular cycle, occasionally. Spotting could be seen. Many factors like illness, stress or strenuous exercise can interfere with your cycle. Seek medical attention if your menstrual period remains irregular for several months.Spotting could be a normal part of your peri-menopausal phase. Be vigilant and look for other symptoms of cervical cancer., Call your doctor if this pattern changes significantly., Just remember that no amount of vaginal bleeding is normal if you are menopausal or if you have had a hysterectomy.Do not assume your cervix has been removed because you have had a hysterectomy. Your entire uterus, including your cervix, is removed during a total hysterectomy. A supracervical hysterectomy is often performed for non-cancerous conditions. Your cervix is left in place and you can develop cervical cancer. Ask your gynecologist which type you have undergone.Consider yourself menopausal if you completely stopped having menstrual periods for 12 straight months., These activities include vaginal sexual intercourse, douching, and even a pelvic exam by a doctor. Talk to your doctor about the nature of the bleeding, spotting versus a heavy flow.When a doctor performs a pelvic exam, she inserts two gloved fingers into your vagina while her other hand presses on your lower abdomen. She can examine your uterus, including your cervix, and ovaries looking for signs of problems or disease. It should not cause heavy bleeding., The discharge may be bloody and it occurs in between menstrual periods. It could be foul-smelling, as well.The cervix produces mucus that changes in consistency during the menstrual cycle to either prevent or promote pregnancy.It should not be bloody in between periods.
Menstrual blood may accumulate in the vagina and smell foul if it is left there for a long time, especially more than 6 to 8 hours. This is different from a discharge smelling bad.Seek medical treatment. Discharge that is foul smelling could be caused by other conditions like infection which can cause pain and bleeding, or by precancerous lesions or cancer., However, if it occurs frequently or is very severe, talk to a qualified medical professional about painful sex.Differentiate between your standard menstrual cramps and pain in your pelvis or lower abdomen.


Menopausal and peri-menopausal women can develop changes in their vaginal walls because of dropping estrogen levels. Vaginal walls become thinner, dryer, less elastic, and may become irritated (atrophic vaginitis). Sometimes sex becomes painful due to these vaginal changes. Sex may also be painful if you have certain skin conditions or are having sexual response difficulties., A delay could lead to more advanced disease and lower your chances of obtaining a cure.Your doctor will talk to you about your personal and family history as well as your symptoms. She will talk about risk factors such as having many sexual partners, early sexual activity, being diagnosed with other sexually transmitted diseases, signs of a weak immune system, and a history of smoking.Your doctor will perform a perform a physical examination to determine your general state of health. She will perform a Pap smear and HPV test if they have not previously been performed. These are screening tests (looking for signs of cervical cancer) and not diagnostic (confirming the presence of cervical cancer).Diagnostic studies are performed when you have an abnormal Pap smear and/or symptoms consistent with cervical cancer. A colposcopy is performed; this instrument, which opens the vagina like a speculum, also magnifies the cervix so that your doctor can visualize any abnormal areas on the cervix. Scrapings of the endocervix (the part closest to the uterus)and/or cone-shaped biopsies will be taken. A pathologist looks under the microscope to make the diagnosis of pre-cancerous or cancerous changes in the cells., There are two tests you can have at your doctor's office to help detect pre-cancerous lesions: the Pap smear and the HPV test., The Pap smear, or Pap test, identifies pre-cancerous cells that could become cervical cancer if they are not treated early and appropriately.The Pap smear is recommended for all women between the ages of 21 and 65 years old. It can be performed in the doctor’s office or in a medical clinic.


A speculum, an instrument used to widen the vagina, will be inserted by the gynecologist. As the doctor examines the vagina and cervix, cells and mucus are collected from the cervix and the surrounding tissue. These samples are placed on a slide or in a bottle of liquid and sent to a laboratory. They will be checked under a microscope, looking for abnormalities.You should get a regular Pap smear even if you are not currently sexually active and even if you have gone through menopause.In the US, Pap smears are covered under the Affordable Care Act, so most insurance plans must cover them at no cost. If you don't have insurance, you may be able to find a free or low-cost test from a local community health clinic., This test looks for the virus, human papillomavirus, that can cause pre-cancerous cell changes in the cervix.Most cervical cancers are caused by HPV infection. The HPV virus is passed from person to person during sexual intercourse.The cells collected during the Pap smear can be tested for HPV as well.The cervix is the cylinder neck-like passage at the lower end of the uterus.The ectocervix is the part of the cervix the doctor sees during the speculum exam.The endocervix is the tunnel through the cervix into the uterus. The transformation zone is the overlapping border between the endocervix and the ectocervix. This is where most cervical cancers develop. Samples of the cervical cells and mucus are taken from here.If you are 30 or older, you can usually have a Pap smear and HPV test together every 5 years., The frequency at which you are screened or need follow-up is based upon factors like your age, your sexual history, your previous history of an abnormal Pap smear, and your previous history of HPV infection.Most women between 21-29 should get a Pap smear every 3 years. Women between 30-64 should get a Pap smear every 3 years, or a Pap smear + HPV test every 5 years.If you have a weakened immune system, you are HIV-positive, or have ever had abnormal Pap results, you should ask your doctor whether you need a Pap smear more frequently.Cervical cancer is one of the most common in women worldwide, but is much less common in countries like the United States where cervical cancer screening, Pap smear and HPV testing, is routine.Get your diagnosis and treatment early. Pre-cancerous cervical cells with more severe changes are at a greater the risk of changing into cancerous cells. This transformation from normal to abnormal to invasive cancer can happen over a period as long as 10 years, but it could happen sooner."

Try eating yogurt.,
Eat fermented foods.,
Try garlic.,
Take goldenseal supplements.,
Limit your sugar intake.Increased sugar levels can cause extra yeast growth.,
Consider avoiding foods fermented with yeast.,
Wear cotton underwear.,
Avoid wearing tight clothing.,
Use condoms during sex.,
Avoid douching.,
Avoid using perfumes or feminine sprays.,
Use unscented pads instead of tampons.,
Wipe yourself thoroughly after using the restroom.,
Use only unscented, white toilet paper.",How to Prevent Yeast Infections from Antibiotics," Eating yogurt is known to be so helpful in the prevention of yeast infections that many doctors advise their patients to stop by the grocery store after picking up their antibiotics prescription. That's because yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, a bacteria that lives in the vagina and keeps the chemistry there balanced. Lactobacillus acidophilus gets depleted by antibiotics, and eating yogurt restores it and helps to prevent the growth of Candida albicans - yeast.When you buy your yogurt, check the label to make sure it contains Lactobacillus acidophilus in the ingredients list. Not all commercially-manufactured yogurt has it, but most brands do. Either flavored or plain yogurt should be fine.
For best results, eat one or two servings of yogurt every day when you're on antibiotics. It doesn't hurt to continue eating plenty of yogurt when you're finished taking them, either, since antibiotics are just one culprit leading to yeast infections.;
, Yogurt may be the most popular choice when it comes to replenishing healthy bacteria, but it's far from the only one. Fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and fermented tea, and more also contain probiotics, the living organisms our bodies need to stay healthy and balanced so that yeast doesn't grow out of control.Because probiotics also help to regulate your digestive system, there are many manufacturers have added them to products in which they wouldn't naturally occur. Cheese, juices, cereal and granola bars enhanced with probiotics can be found in grocery stores.
Take probiotics supplements as an alternative. If you're not a big fan of yogurt or sauerkraut, you can pick up a bottle of probiotics supplements instead. These contain the same healthy bacteria as yogurt, this time in the form of pills. Take the recommended dosage throughout the course of your antibiotics treatment.

, Garlic has antifungal properties that help destroy the yeast that leads to infections. Eating plenty of garlic while you're on antibiotics could help keep an infection at bay. Taking garlic supplements is another way to go, and keeps you from having garlic breath for days on end.Some women apply the garlic directly to the vagina when they feel the beginnings of an infection coming on. To try this, wrap a peeled clove of garlic in a small piece of cheesecloth. Tie it off, leaving a tail on the end. Insert it in the vagina with the tail hanging outside the vagina for easy removal. Leave it in for a few hours or overnight, then discard.

, Goldenseal is another natural remedy that many have found helps prevent yeast infections. Before taking this or any other herbal supplement, check with your doctor to make sure it's ok to take it with your other medications., Avoid foods or soft drinks that are high in sugar. Stick with fruit and raw honey if you need something sweet.

, There is limited evidence to support the notion that alcoholic beverages, breads and other foods made with yeast can lead to yeast infections. It won't hurt to limit your intake of these, but it may not necessarily help., Cotton is a breathable material that will prevent extra moisture from collecting. If you love satin and lace underwear, consider changing it out for cotton while you're on antibiotics. If you must wear pretty lingerie, make sure it has a cotton liner.

, Tight pants, pantyhose or elastic undergarments, or materials that don't allow air to circulate around the vaginal area, can cause the area to stay moist - perfect conditions for the growth of yeast.


Wear looser styles as opposed to skinny jeans.
Choose a dress or a skirt when possible.
Wear loose workout clothing instead of tight workout pants.

, Semen has a different pH than the inside of the vagina, so having sex without a condom can throw things out of balance. If you're willing to change things up while you're on antibiotics, consider using condoms for awhile.

, Even when you're not on antibiotics, douching can lead to conditions in the vagina that promote yeast growth. Douches usually contain chemicals that kill off that good bacteria and leave room for the bad stuff to take over. Douching can also change the pH level in the vagina.


Instead of douching, wash with warm water only.
Avoid using harsh soaps or body washes.

, Products with added scents can cause irritation. Don't put perfumes and sprays on your vagina. If you absolutely must add a scent, use a spray made from water and a gentle essential oil, such as a few drops of lavender.

, Tampons can encourage the growth of extra yeast. If you have your period while you're on antibiotics, switch to pads. Just make sure they're unscented, since a chemical-based perfume might irritate your vagina.

, Wipe from front to back to avoid any transfer of bacteria from the anal area to the vagina, which can encourage infection. Make sure your vaginal area stays clean and dry.

, Dyes and fragrances applied to your vagina can lead to the growth of yeast.

Look for noticeable menstrual irregularities, including long intervals between menstrual periods, the prolonged absence of menstrual periods, very heavy or very light menstrual periods, and bleeding between menstrual periods. Check for the following:Length of time between periods is longer than 35 days
Fewer than 8 periods per year
No period for 4 months or longer
Lengths of time when you have either very light or very heavy periods
Studies show that about 50% of women with PCOS have prolonged intervals between their menstrual periods (this is known as oligomenorrhea). About 20% of women with PCOS have no menstrual periods (this is known as amenorrhoea). Infrequent or irregular ovulation is called oligoovulation. Anovulation is the complete absence of ovulation. If you suspect that you are not ovulating – whether the root of the problem turns out to be PCOS or something else – you should see a doctor.;
, Healthy women have small amounts of androgens (“male” hormones) present in their bodies. Polycystic ovaries tend to produce larger amounts of androgens due to higher levels of the luteinizing hormone (normal levels of this hormone regulate the menstrual cycle and the production of eggs) and insulin. This problem may produce upsetting symptoms, including increased facial and body hair. This is called hirsutism.Extra hair might grow on your face, stomach, toes, thumbs, chest or back.

, Increased androgens in the body may also cause hair loss, thinning hair, or male pattern baldness. You may lose hair gradually. Check for more than normal amounts of hair in the shower drain, for example.

, Hyperandrogenism (increased androgens) may also cause oily skin with increased acne. You may also experience dandruff, which is a scalp condition in which skin flakes off. Dandruff , A polycystic ovary is an ovary with more than 12 cysts, each measuring 2 to 9 millimeters in diameter. The cysts are located around the periphery of the ovary, leading to an increase in ovarian volume. In some cases, you may need surgery to remove these cysts. To determine if you have polycystic ovaries, your doctor will need to order an ultrasound.You should have a reproductive endocrinologist review the results of your ultrasound. A reproductive endocrinologist specializes in reproductive and fertility issues, such as PCOS, endometriosis, in-vitro fertilization and uterine abnormalities.If the ultrasound is reviewed by a non-specialist, a polycystic ovary is often called 'normal,' meaning no tumor is seen. This is because this doctor is not trained to see specific abnormalities. Sometimes, doctors might misdiagnose the problem, or suggest that the patient exercise more to lose the weight caused by PCOS., Hyperinsulinemia is an excessive level of insulin. It is sometimes confused with diabetes or hypoglycemia, but it is a different condition. For women with PCOS, it results from your body having a tendency to resist the effects of insulin.Visit your doctor if you experience some of the following symptoms:Weight gain
Sugar cravings
Feeling hungry frequently or intensely
Difficulty concentrating or staying motivated
Anxiety or panic
Fatigue
As a symptom of PCOS, hyperinsulinemia is connected to the increased production of androgens. This can cause oily skin, acne, facial and body hair. In addition, you may gain weight around your abdomen.
If your doctor suspects you have hyperinsulinemia, she will likely order a glucose tolerance test (GTT).
Treatment for hyperinsulinemia includes a diet and exercise plan and may also include a drug called Metformin, which can reduce your insulin levels. Whether your doctor prescribes Metformin or not, ask for a referral to a dietician. A good nutrition plan is a crucial part of treatment.Check fasting insulin, glucose, hemoglobin A1c and c-peptide levels. Although there is no definitive test to diagnose insulin resistance, these levels are often higher than normal in PCOS patients with insulin resistance.

, If you are struggling to get pregnant and you have irregular periods, you may have polycystic ovary syndrome. In fact, PCOS is the most common cause of infertility. Irregular or absent ovulation makes it difficult or impossible to conceive.


Higher hormone levels sometimes increase the risk of miscarriage in women with PCOS who do manage to get pregnant. See your doctor if you cannot get pregnant.

, Obesity is always a health concern, but it may also be a sign of PCOS. Because of increased levels of insulin, women with PCOS often accumulate fat around the waist and wind up with a pear-shaped appearance, and they typically have a difficult time losing weight.About 38% of women with PCOS are obese. An obese adult typically has a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher., If you have PCOS, you may develop velvety, light brown or black patches of skin on your neck, armpits, thighs, and breasts (these are called acanthosis nigricans). You may also develop skin tags. These are small flaps of skin, which often occur in the armpits or on the neck.

, Some women with PCOS experience pain or discomfort in the pelvis, abdomen or lower back. Pain may be dull or stabbing, and it may range in intensity from mild to severe. The pain or discomfort may be similar to the pain you feel at the beginning of a menstrual period. , Some women with PCOS have sleep apnea, a condition in which you snore and stop breathing periodically while asleep. This can result either from increased estrogen and testosterone levels or from obesity, both of which are associated with PCOS.

, Women with PCOS seem to be quite susceptible to anxiety and depression. These symptoms may have physical causes, such as hormonal imbalances. They may be a reaction to the other symptoms, especially infertility.

, PCOS can be a hereditary condition. If your mother or sister has PCOS, you may also develop it. Consider your family’s medical history to determine if you are predisposed to having PCOS.It is common for women with PCOS to have family members who have diabetes.
It is common for women with PCOS to have been unusually small or unusually large babies at birth.

, If you suspect that you may have PCOS, visit your doctor or gynecologist to have a checkup. Your doctor will assess your condition, asking you about your symptoms and medical history., Medical history: Your doctor will talk to you about your family history and your lifestyle habits such as exercise, smoking, diet and stress. She will also ask you about your attempts to get pregnant.
Physical and pelvic exam: Your doctor will weigh you, check your body mass index. She will take your blood pressure, examine your glands, and give you a pelvic exam.
Blood tests: You will get some blood tests. These will check your glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and androgen levels, along with some other levels.
Vaginal ultrasound: You may get an ultrasound that will determine if you have cysts on your ovaries.

, If you are overweight or obese, you may suffer from more symptoms of PCOS. A healthy lifestyle may help you avoid some of the most severe consequences of PCOS.


Eat nutritious foods, avoid junk foods, get plenty of exercise, and do not smoke.
Become familiar with the glycemic index. This is a number that corresponds to the degree to which a food causes a high level of insulin release when it is consumed. You want to eat more foods with a low glycemic index and avoid foods with a high glycemic index. You can find the glycemic index of most common foods at www.glycemicindex.com.

, High blood pressure is very common in women with PCOS. Get your blood pressure checked regularly.


A healthy blood pressure for women is 120 over 80 less. , Women with PCOS may be at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Make sure you get regular medical care, including cardiovascular check-ups.


A healthy diet, exercise and weight loss can also help reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

, Women with PCOS develop are at increased risk of developing diabetes. Some common symptoms of diabetes include:Urinating frequently
Feeling very thirsty or hungry
Extreme fatigue
Healing slowly from bruises or cuts
Blurred vision
Tingling, numbness or pain in your hands or feet

, Having PCOS can put you at risk for endometrial (uterine) cancer, particularly if periods are infrequent or absent and this is not addressed by a physician. When hormone levels are abnormal, a woman’s chance of developing cancer may potentially increase. These hormones can be increased levels of estrogen and androgens, with lowered levels of progesterone., This risk can be reduced by inducing regular periods either with birth control pills or with periodic administration of synthetic forms of progesterone to provoke a period. It can also be done using an IUD that contains progestin such as Mirena or Skyla.

Drink green tea or use green tea extract.,
Consider changing your diet.,
Recognize sham remedies.,
Understand that pregnancy and childbirth may have protective effects against developing uterine fibroids.",How to Prevent Uterine Fibroids1," Uterine fibroids are hormonally mediated, much like tumors caused by breast cancer (although fibroids are not cancerous). Studies have shown that women who exercise regularly are less likely to develop fibroids.Studies also suggest that the more physically active you are, the more that exercise will help you prevent fibroids. Women who exercised 7 or more hours per week were significantly less likely to develop fibroids over a period of several years than women who exercised two hours or less per week.Research suggests that vigorous exercise is much more helpful in reducing your risk than light or moderate exercise. Vigorous exercise for 3 or more hours per week may reduce your risk of developing fibroids by 30-40%. (However, even light exercise is better than no exercise at all!);
, Research indicates that fibroids are more likely to occur in overweight or obese women (i.e., those with a BMI above the “normal” range). This may be because of the higher levels of estrogen in obese women.Being overweight increases your risk of developing fibroids by about 10-20%.Very obese women are two to three times more likely to develop fibroids than women within a normal BMI range.You can calculate your BMI using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website here. Or, you can use the following formulas: weight (kg) / 2 or weight (lb) / 2 x 703.

, Some research has shown that green tea may help prevent the development of fibroids in rats. While it has not been confirmed in humans, green tea has numerous other health benefits, so it can’t hurt.Green tea has been shown to reduce the severity of fibroid symptoms for women who already have fibroids.If you are sensitive to caffeine, avoid over-consuming green tea. It is higher in caffeine than some other teas and can cause nausea, jitteriness, or irritability in some people., Several studies suggest that consuming red meat is linked to an increased risk of developing fibroids. Eating green vegetables is associated with a decreased risk.


No evidence currently exists that suggests changing your diet will “prevent” fibroids. However, the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption and eating green vegetables are significant. Red meat consumption has been linked to many health issues, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and early mortality.Green vegetables are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.Eat foods high in Vitamin D, such as fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel). Vitamin D may reduce your risk of developing fibroids by over 30%.Vitamin D can also shrink the size of existing fibroids.Some research suggests that increasing dairy consumption — milk, cheese, ice cream, etc. — may reduce the risk of developing fibroids in African American women., Some websites and “alternative” health sources suggest that remedies exist that can prevent or “cure” fibroids. Common remedies include enzymes, dietary changes, hormone creams, and homeopathy. There is no scientific evidence to support any of these treatments., Although researchers are not entirely certain why this is the case, women who have been pregnant have a lower risk of developing fibroids.Pregnancy may also reduce the size of existing fibroids in some cases.However, some fibroids may get bigger during pregnancy. Because fibroids are poorly understood, there is no way of knowing whether your fibroids will grow or not during pregnancy.Some research suggests that the protective effect of pregnancy is strongest during and immediately after pregnancy than for women whose pregnancies were farther in the past."

Know what is normal.,
Know common causes of infections.,
Look for abnormal discharge.,
Notice any itching or burning.,
Pay attention to any pain or swelling.,
Call your doctor.",How to Recognize and Avoid Vaginal Infections1," It is completely normal to have some discharge. Your discharge should be clear, a little cloudy, or sometimes white. Your vagina is self-cleaning, and discharge is part of the cleaning process. Your discharge should not have a strong smell or be itchy, although some smell is common, especially during your period.The amount and consistency of discharge changes throughout your menstrual cycle. It can go from thin and watery to thick. Sometimes you may have a little and other times a lot.
Every woman's body is different. A normal amount of discharge for you may not be normal for someone else. You should pay attention to your discharge so that you can gauge what is normal for you.;
, The two most common vaginal infections are bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections.Both of these infections are caused by organisms that naturally occur in your vagina. Yeast infections are caused by having too much yeast in your vagina, and bacterial vaginosis happens when the proper balance of bacteria in your vagina is thrown off.


Other common vaginal infections are non-infectious vaginitis (caused by an allergic reaction or irritation from certain products) and sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes simplex virus, or trichomoniasis., Abnormal vaginal discharge is one of the most common signs of a vaginal infection. If the color, consistency, or amount of discharge changes, you may have an infection.If you notice a fishy smell in your vagina, it is probably bacterial vaginosis. If you have discharge that looks like cottage cheese, you may have a yeast infection.
Abnormal discharge is also may be a sign that you have chlamydia or gonorrhea.Greenish, frothy discharge is common with trichomoniasis.

, Itching and burning are never normal and indicate that you may have a vaginal infection.Having an increased urge to pee or having a burning sensation when you pee is another sign that you may have an infection.

, Experiencing pain in your lower abdomen and pelvic area, swelling, soreness, and redness around your genital area is a sign that you may have some type of vaginal infection.Pain during sex is also an indicator of a possible vaginal infection., You should never try to diagnose and treat your vaginal infection on your own. If you notice anything unusual, you need to call your doctor. Many infections have the similar symptoms but require different treatments. Getting the proper diagnosis is very important.You should be prepared to tell your doctor the color, smell, and consistency of your discharge, the amount of time you have been experiencing symptoms, and any products (i.e. detergent, perfume, vaginal sprays, spermicides, or douches) that you have been using.Detailed information will help your doctor diagnose you.
Your doctor may do a gynecological exam after you talk about your symptoms. They also may take a sample of your discharge or urine to test for an infection.About 90% of vaginal infections can be cured within two weeks or less. Untreated vaginal infections can last for years and can lead to infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease.There are over the counter treatments for yeast infections. You should visit your doctor before you try a treatment. For example, if you take Monistat to treat a yeast infection when you really have bacterial vaginosis, your symptoms will not get any better.

Try walking.,
Try a team sport.,
Do aerobics.,
Dance.,
Consider a stress-relieving exercise.,
Weight train.",How to Reduce Hot Flashes with Exercise1," Walking is one of the easiest exercises you can do. You don’t need any special equipment aside from walking shoes and time. Walking can be good for menopause since it can help prevent osteoporosis.Try walking three to four days a week for at least 15 minutes. Eventually, you want to get up to 45 to 60 minutes four to five days a week.
You can also try jogging and running if your fitness level permits.;
, Sports such as tennis, basketball, or softball can be a great way to get activity into your daily life. Studies have found team sports beneficial to women in menopause because it helps increase cardiovascular health, which can be at risk with the lower levels of estrogen due to menopause.Find a friend to play partner tennis, or gather the whole family together for a game of basketball or softball.


If you don’t want to exercise with others, try playing basketball alone or swimming.

, There are many different aerobic activities you can do. If you are part of a gym, you can take part in any of their aerobic classes. These include things like high-intensity cardio, mixed martial arts (MMA), and spin. You can also try aerobic machines, such as a treadmill, elliptical, or stationary bike.If you aren’t part of a gym or uncomfortable doing gym classes, you can find many different aerobic activities on DVD or YouTube.

, Dancing is one of the best physical activities. You can just turn on your favorite songs and dance around your house. It not only gets you moving, but also relieves symptoms.


You can try gym classes like Zumba if you are interested in dance.
You can also try taking dance classes at a dance studio, like ballroom dance, Latin dance, or swing dance.

, Since menopause can be a stressful time, an exercise that relieves stress could make a big difference.Tai chi, qigong, or yoga are great stress-relieving activities.Not only do these activities reduce stress, but they also help reduce insomnia, which can be a problem during menopause.

, Weight training is an extremely effective exercise for menopause. Not only will it potentially reduce hot flashes, but it also helps strengthen bones. This can help prevent osteoporosis. You can join a gym and use their weighted machines and free weights, or take a group strength training class.Good weight training exercises to start with include wall squats or regular squats, lat pull downs, leg presses, seated rows, and back extensions.
If you have never done any strength training before, ask a member of the gym to go through the machines and weights with you to teach you proper technique.
When you strength train during menopause, you want to make sure to exercise the major muscle groups: back, chest, buttocks, legs, arms, and core.
For each exercise, do 10 to 15 repetitions. Your muscles should feel tired after those reps. Each week, increase your weight by 10%. Make sure not to start off too heavy because that can lead to injury.
